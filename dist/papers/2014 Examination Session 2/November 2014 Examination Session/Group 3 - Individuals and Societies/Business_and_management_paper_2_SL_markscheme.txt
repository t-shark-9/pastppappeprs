                                              SECTION A

1.   (a)   (i)    Define the term secondary sector.                                          [2 marks]

                  Secondary sector refers to the manufacturing and processes whereby raw
                  materials (derived from the primary sector) or already manufactured
                  components are transformed into finished goods for sale.


                  Candidates are not expected to word their definition exactly as above.

                  Award [1 mark] for a basic definition that conveys partial knowledge and
                  understanding. In general, the [1 mark] will key on use of the word
                  manufacturing or production but with little elaboration.

                  Award [2 marks] for a definition that conveys knowledge and
                  understanding similar to the answer above, through elaboration,
                  comparison (to primary or tertiary sectors) or exemplification.

                  For only a relevant: example or application to the stimulus award
                  [1 mark].

           (ii)   Identify two advantages to SF of being a private limited company.          [2 marks]

                  For SF the advantages could include:
                  • limited liability of shareholders
                  • capital raised through the sale of shares
                  • increased credibility of the business, which can facilitate borrowing
                    and other activities
                  • no risk of loss of control of company
                  • continued legal existence of the business when a shareholder dies
                  • though the degree of privacy information varies from country to
                    country, in general private limited companies have more privacy than
                    public limited companies, and more privacy could be listed as an
                    advantage
                  • accept any other relevant advantage.

                  It is easier to obtain financing, often in the form of additional share
                  capital, but not necessarily from a bank loan or as an unsecured
                  bank loan. In the context of this stimulus, becoming a private limited
                  company would not increase the likelihood of getting unsecured
                  financing.


                  Award [1 mark] for each correct and relevant advantage of SF being a
                  private limited company identified. Award up to a maximum of
                  [2 marks].
                                             –6–               N14/3/BUSMT/SP2/ENG/TZ0/XX/M



(b)   Explain why electricity is a semi-variable cost for SF.                             [2 marks]

      Semi-variable costs have characteristics of both fixed and variable costs.
      SF has to pay a fixed monthly rate of $100, which is a fixed-cost characteristic:
      this $100 must be paid every month regardless of output. SF must also pay
      $0.10 for each kilowatt hour, which is a variable-cost component: the amount
      of electricity usage (and, thus, the cost) will vary according to output.


      Candidates are not expected to word their explanation exactly as above.
      Be attentive for candidates explaining variable costs rather than semi-variable.
      If they define variable cost (rather than using it as a contradistinction) award
      [0 marks].

      Award [1 mark] for an explanation that conveys knowledge and understanding
      of semi-variable costs (explanation but no application to the stimulus).

      Award [2 marks] for an explanation of how electricity is a semi-variable cost
      for SF (explanation with application to the stimulus). For [2 marks] candidates
      must convey the idea (though they do not have to use the exact wording) of
      varying according to output.

(c)   Prepare a monthly cash-flow forecast for SF for the first four months of
      operation.                                                                            [6 marks]

      Apply Own Figure Rule (OFR): if a candidate makes an error in one row and
      carries it through the remainder of the forecast, that is only one error.

      N.B. if a candidate rounds, for example, 691.2 to 691, that is acceptable
      provided the candidate rounds correctly.


      [1 mark]
      The candidate conveys some understanding of what a cash-flow forecast is, but
      otherwise the forecast is largely inaccurate, incomplete, or illegible.

      [2–3 marks]
      A cash-flow forecast is drawn, but either it is not in a generally accepted
      format or it is untidy, and the forecast contains two or more errors.

      [4–5 marks]
      The cash-flow forecast is drawn essentially correctly and neatly in a generally
      accepted format (and includes clear rows indicating opening and closing
      balance), but there is one or two errors.

      [6 marks]
      The cash-flow forecast is drawn accurately and neatly in a generally accepted
      format (and includes rows opening balance, closing balance and net cash flow),
      and is error free. Substituting the term “net profit” in the cash-flow forecast for
      “net cash flow” is inaccurate.

      If the candidate has only one row for all cash outflows, subtract [1 mark]
      from the total mark awarded.

(d)   Calculate SF’s forecast net profit for the first four months of operation
      (show all your working).                                                           [2 marks]

      All figures in $. Candidates may calculate this in several ways.

      One method is determining first four months’ sales revenue by adding monthly
      sales revenue:

      1000 + 1200 + 1440 + 1728 = 5368

      Then adding total monthly payments (all expenses):

      1160 + 1416 + 1688.1+ 1979.51 = 6243.61

      Then calculate net profit by subtracting all expenses from total sales revenue:

      Net profit for first four months:

      5368 − 6243.61=(875.61), or − 875.61

      Another method would be to subtract the opening balance from the closing
      balance:

      14124.39 −15000 = (875.61), or − 875.61

      There might be other means whereby the candidate calculates the net profit
      (for example, adding up the monthly net cash-flow figures).


      N.B. some candidates may read the question such that they calculate the
      net profit for each of the four months. In that case, award [1 mark] for correct
      procedure and [1 mark] for the correct answers (four different profit figures:
      –160, –216, –248.1, –251.51, in total –875.61).

      [1 mark]
      If a candidate who has shown working provides a correct procedure (thus,
      demonstrates an understanding of the underlying concepts) but has made an
      error in calculation.

      [2 marks]
      Candidate provides the correct answer with working.

(e)   Calculate SF’s forecast net profit margin for the first four months of
      operation.                                                                            [1 mark]

      −875.61
              ×100 = (16.31%), or −16.31%
       5368

      Accept −16.3% but not −16% .

      If the candidate calculates net profit margin by month, the correct answers are:
      Month 1: –16%
      Month 2: –18%
      Month 3: –17.22%
      Month 4: –14.55%

      Award [1 mark] if the candidate provides the correct answer(s). Working not
      required.

(f)   Examine two potential stakeholder conflicts when Gepa opens his factory.            [5 marks]

      Potential stakeholder conflicts include:
      • Gepa versus the residents of the village over the issues of pollution and
        smells and/or versus pressure groups;
      • Gepa versus the local government employment office over working
        conditions at the factory;
      • Gepa versus the potential workers over working conditions;
      • potential workers versus employment agency and/or residents of the village
        over whether the factory should open
      • accept other relevant potential stakeholder conflict.

      Accept any other relevant examination.


      If a candidate lists two stakeholder conflicts and names the stakeholders, and
      the response is based on the stimulus, the candidate should be awarded
      [3 marks], provided what they have written is largely accurate (though is
      perhaps not well developed).

      N.B. according to the stimulus, Gepa will own 100% of the shares of SF.
      Therefore, disagreement between shareholders, or between Gepa and other
      shareholders, is not an acceptable stakeholder conflict.

      If a candidate examines only one stakeholder conflict, award a maximum of
      [3 marks]. In the case of only one stakeholder conflict addressed award
      [1 mark] for identification of the stakeholder and [1 mark] for identification of
      the stakeholder and their conflict, award an additional [1 mark] for application
      to the stimulus, and an additional [1 mark] for depth and nuance.

      Marks should be allocated according to the markbands on page 3.

2.   (a)   (i)    Describe how one demographic change in Finland affects RG.                      [2 marks]

                  The one demographic change mentioned in the stimulus is the higher
                  level of education that Finnish youth have in contemporary society
                  compared to some earlier periods. Thus, “recently, RG has struggled to
                  recruit talented teenagers for the apprentice program.”

                  Though it is unlikely that many candidates would know of any other
                  demographic changes in Finland (that is, a change not mentioned in the
                  stimulus), accept it if it is correct and appropriate to the situation in the
                  stimulus.


                  Award [1 mark] for a response that conveys partial knowledge and
                  understanding of demographic change.

                  Award [2 marks] for a full, clear description of a demographic change in
                  Finland affecting RG.

           (ii)   Identify two features of a flow production process.                             [2 marks]

                  Features of flow production include:
                  • Standardized/similar product
                  • comparatively easy to expand production
                  • finished product is completed continuously
                  • high degree of automation
                  • workforce can be unskilled or semi-skilled
                  • workforce can be specialized (even if unskilled)
                  • large scale of production (accept economies of scale)
                  • low cost per unit (do not accept just “low cost” or “cheaper”)
                  • high/higher fixed costs
                  • all stages of production are interdependent (accept: “if a problem
                    occurs in one place in the assembly line, the whole production stops”).

                  Accept any other relevant feature of a flow production process.


                  Many candidates may struggle with the difference between a feature and
                  an advantage/disadvantage. If the examiner can reasonably infer a
                  feature from a stated advantage or disadvantage (such as large scale of
                  operation versus economies of scale) award [1 mark].

                  Award [1 mark] for each correct feature of a flow production process
                  identified. Award up to a maximum of [2 marks].

(b)   Calculate for RG for one year:

      (i)    manager’s and craftsmens’ salaries (figure X).                             [1 mark]

             (42 craftsmen × €50000) + €70000 = €2170000


             Award [1 mark] for the correct answer (working not required).

      (ii)   the break-even level of output (show all your working).                    [2 marks]

                                             fixed cost
             Break-even level of output =
                                            contribution


             Fixed costs = 120k + 480k + 2170k + 700k + 600k = 4070000

             Contribution = 1200 − 275 = 925

                                            4070000
             Break-even level of output =           = 4400
                                              925

             Which means the break-even level of output is 4400 units.

             Apply candidate own figure rule (OFR).

             [1 mark]
             If a candidate who has shown working provides a correct procedure
             (thus, demonstrates an understanding of the underlying concepts) but has
             made an error in calculation.

             Candidate provides the correct answer with working.

(iii) the profit or loss last year (show all your working).                         [3 marks]

     Profit is calculated by total revenue – total costs, where total costs equal
     total fixed costs + total variable costs.

      Total revenue: 4920 units × €1200 = €5904000

      Total fixed costs: 120000 + 480000 + 2170000 + 700000 + 600000 = €4070000

      Total variable costs: 4920 units × (225 + 35 + 15) = €1353000

      Total costs = €4070000 + €1353000 = €5423000

      Total revenue – total cost = €5904000 − €5423000

      Profit = €481000


     Candidates may also use the contribution method, calculated as follows:

     Sales in units – break-even quantity = margin of safety

     4920 – 4400 = 520 units

     Margin of safety × contribution = profit

     520 × (1200 – 275)

     520 × 925 = €481 000


     Apply candidate own figure rule (OFR).

     Award [1 mark] if the candidate clearly demonstrates an understanding
     of how to calculate the profit (candidate shows revenue – expenses =
     profit, or an understanding of the contribution method).

     Award [2 marks] if the candidate demonstrates that the method properly
     but makes an error in the calculation.

     Award [3 marks] if the candidate demonstrates the method (show
     working) and correctly calculates the answer.

     If the candidate produces the correct answer, but does not show working,
     award a maximum of [2 marks].

(c)   Construct a fully labelled break-even chart for RG.                                  [5 marks]




      Award marks as follows:

      [1 mark] for each appropriately labelled axis – maximum of [2 marks].

      [1 mark] for an accurately drawn and labelled total revenue curve.

      [1 mark] for an accurately drawn and labelled total costs curve.

      [1 mark] for the identification of the break-even level of output.

      Award [0 marks] if a candidate produces a table, and award no more than
      [3 marks] if the chart is not neat, not drawn with a straight-edge, or is not to
      scale.

      Ideally, the candidate will draw an arrow pointing to the break-even point and
      label the arrow. However, accept as an “appropriately labelled” break-even
      point a vertical line from the x-axis to the break-even point provided that the
      line is labelled “break-even point”.

      If the candidate does not specify the scale by placing numbers periodically on
      the axes (1000, 2000, 3000, etc) they have not demonstrated the scale, and,
      therefore, award a maximum of [3 marks].

      If the candidate labels the x axis as “sales” and the numbering on the axis
      corresponds to the unit of output of RG (that is, the number scale is in the range
      of 0 to 5000 +/ –) accept sales as a correct label.

(d)   Analyse the possible impacts of Anni’s proposed changes on the
      motivation of the workers at RG.                                                     [5 marks]

      The impact of the changes on the motivation of workers will be significant and
      mostly negative. Currently the workers enjoy the prestige and intrinsic rewards
      of being professional craftsmen. Those intrinsic rewards include the
      knowledge that they are making a high-quality product that requires specialized
      training and skill, and the camaraderie that comes from being in an “elite”
      group of skilled workers who know how to make their product. Because their
      skill is specialized, they also receive the extrinsic motivation of high pay
      (€50 000 per year).

      When the factory is converted, the workers will go from doing jobs that require
      highly specialized skills to ones that require far less skill. The work routine
      will become more routine and less interesting. They will probably take less
      pride in their work as a professional craftsman will not be personally
      responsible for individual guitars that he and two apprentices made. While in
      the short run most workers retain some degree of their camaraderie, as people
      who had been trained in the craft, over time this sense of group consciousness
      will probably diminish.

      One positive of Anni’s changes is that all current employees will retain their
      high salaries. Another positive is that the changes Anni is making may keep
      the business in operation. RG has high operating leverage (that is, high fixed
      costs) and must sell many guitars to break even. If RG lost the ability to attract
      teenagers into the craft, a reduced number of workers might mean an inability
      to produce enough guitars to break-even. Workers will at least be motivated by
      having a job and, for current workers, a well paying one.

      In the long run, these changes will significantly adversely affect motivation.
      New employees will receive only half the pay of the skilled workers, even
      though they will be doing the same jobs. This will cause dissension.
      Eventually, when all the skilled workers have retired, RG will employ mostly
      low-skilled workers receiving low pay, which creates a difficult motivational
      situation.

      Accept any other relevant analysis.


      If the answer has some balance, has application to the stimulus, and effectively
      applies theory, an answer would typically be in the [4–5 mark] range. Be
      attentive when candidates use theory, for often they use it poorly or
      ineffectively. Just the use of a name (Maslow, Taylor, etc) is not sufficient to
      earn marks for theory.

      If the response is a one-sided relevant approach with no analysis, award a
      maximum of [3 marks].

      Marks should be allocated according to the markbands on page 3.

                                            SECTION B

3.   (a)   Identify two methods of primary market research that SGS may
           have used.                                                                  [2 marks]

           Types of primary research that SGS may have used include:
           • surveys/questionnaires
           • focus groups
           • personal or telephone interviews.

           Accept any other relevant type of primary market research.


           Award [1 mark] for each type of primary market research identified. Award
           up to a maximum of [2 marks].

(b)   Using information from the table, construct a fully                   labelled
      position/perception map of SGS and its three main competitors.                    [4 marks]




      Award [1 mark] if the candidate has some general sense of what a
      position/perception map is: two axes on which companies are placed according
      to a position in the market. Award [2 marks] if the candidate labels the axes,
      one for price, the other for perception of reliability.

      Award [3 marks] if (i) the candidate labels the axes according to price and
      perception of reliability and the candidate places three or more of the
      companies in approximately the correct place.

      Award [4 marks] if the candidate labels the axes according to price and
      perception of reliability and the candidate places all four of the companies in
      approximately the correct place.

(c)   Explain one disadvantage of Jean-Paul changing to a situational leadership
      style.                                                                                   [2 marks]

      The central idea of situational leadership is that leaders should adapt their style of
      leadership according to the situation. There is no best leadership but rather that
      different contexts (or situations), require different styles of leadership. Possible
      disadvantages of Jean-Paul changing to a situation leadership style is that:
      • He has a bias toward an autocratic leadership style and changing leadership
         style according to contexts is not always easy. In the stimulus, Jean-Paul
         decides he will become more democratic, yet ample evidence in the stimulus
         indicates that a democratic style is not innate to him.
      • People in the organization have probably grown accustomed to Jean-Paul’s
         autocratic style and might often feel disoriented were he to change style.
         In the stimulus, workers and managers accustomed to “fearlessly autocratic”
         leaders may not find having the authority to make decisions on their own that
         easy.
      • A third disadvantage is that people at SGS may not know when the style
         changed and the degree to which Jean-Paul wants change according to different
         situations. Thus, some workers may perceive more freedom when Jean-Paul
         did not intend that.

      Accept any other relevant disadvantage with explanation.

      N.B. when the answer is theoretical, with no real application to the stimulus,
      award a maximum of [1 mark]. Also, it is possible for some candidates to be
      awarded [1 mark] for correctly explaining a disadvantage without making fully
      clear that they understand what situational leadership is. For example, a
      candidate could explain that a change in leadership styles can disorient
      employees used to a different style of leadership for [1 mark] without
      otherwise clarifying what situational leadership is.


      Award [1 mark] for a response that indicates some understanding of what
      situational leadership is (though they must go beyond the tautology that situational
      leadership is when leaders adopt a style according to the situation). Award
      [2 marks] for an explanation of a disadvantage of Jean-Paul changing to a
      situational leadership style. Award up to a maximum of [2 marks].

(d)   Examine the relationship between investment, profit and cash flow
      for SGS.                                                                             [5 marks]

      There is a clear relationship between investment, profit, and cash flow at SGS.
      Jean-Paul’s decision to transform SGS into a green company, a decision that
      will require investment in computers and new airplanes, should lead to several
      (or many) years of increased market share, which, Jean-Paul believes, will
      presumably lead, in the long run, to higher profits. In the short run, profits may
      actually decrease as the company has to absorb the costs of the new computer
      system and higher fixed costs of the more expensive airplanes. Short-term
      profits may also decrease as, initially, customers may be unaware of SGS’s
      decision to go green (a situation made worse by Jean-Paul’s unwillingness to
      listen to his Marketing Director). Customers may believe that SGS is merely
      raising prices and, in response, go to a lower cost carrier. Nevertheless, in the
      long-run Jean-Paul believes that “going green” is a better strategy for SGS and
      he is willing to invest in the business for its longer term profitability. Cash
      flow will also be affected. With higher expenditures, SGS will see pressure on
      cash flow. This situation will be mitigated against by new sources of finance
      for airplanes. If the new strategy is successful, eventually SGS will see cash
      flow improve. Initially, however, that will not be the case.

      N.B. balance, in this response, refers to some understanding between short
      term and long term (though the candidate does not have to use those exact
      expressions). However, to achieve [4 or 5 marks], the candidate must convey
      the idea that investment in the short run reduces available funds but the
      intention is, in the long run, to have those investments paid off with higher
      profits and improved cash flow.

(e)   Discuss the interrelationships between SGS’s aims, strategies and tactics.         [7 marks]

      Aims refer to the approach that is often formulated in a broad way and often
      corresponds to ideas in the vision statement of an organization. The initial aim
      of SGS is “to deliver all packages on time, at low prices, anywhere in the
      world”. Strategies are medium-to-long-term means to reach the aims, are more
      specific, and often have quantifiable objectives supporting them. For example,
      SGS’s strategy includes specific and measurable elements: prices charged to
      customers, costs, on-time delivery rates, and customer satisfaction. These
      strategic objectives fit into a long-term framework (“deliver all packages on
      time, at low prices, anywhere in the world”), but they can be more easily
      measured. Tactics refers to how the strategy will be achieved. When
      Jean-Paul decides to change the aims (and strategy of SGS to delivering
      packages on time and, presumably, in as “green” a fashion as the business can
      achieve profitably), he knows that tactics must change. In this case, that is to
      transition the fleet to more fuel efficient planes as well as adopt new software
      for determining routes. Tactics are more precise and concrete approaches to
      meeting objectives. They have a bearing on day-to-day activities.

      There is a hierarchy of objectives (from aims to strategies to tactics) that
      successful organizations do not always follow; some organizations also have
      corporate objectives, departmental objectives, team objectives etc.

4.   (a)   Describe one source of finance, other than a bank loan, that Gavin could
           use to fund the start-up of the new salon.                                          [2 marks]

           Sources of finance can include the following:
           • Trade credit. Gavin could ask suppliers to delay his payments to lead the
             business to a better cash starting position.
           • Leasing allows the firm to use an asset without actually buying it. Gavin
             could lease some of the equipment that he needs for the new salon.
           • Overdraft. Gavin could arrange an overdraft with the bank to spend more
             money from his account than is currently in it. He could use this finance in
             the short term to pay wages or suppliers.
           • Gavin could ask a friend or relative for a loan.
           • Small business grant. Often local authorities or the national government
             will encourage small businesses to start with grants. These are often free
             money or a low interest loan.

           Accept any other relevant source of finance.


           Award [1 mark] for a response that conveys partial knowledge and
           understanding of a source of finance other than a bank loan.

           Award [2 marks] for a full, clear description of a source of finance other than a
           bank loan for Gavin.

     (b)   (i)   Explain one disadvantage to H&B of introducing a flexitime
                 workscheme.                                                                   [2 marks]

                 Disadvantages to H&B of introducing a flexitime workscheme could
                 include:
                 • The workscheme itself could be time consuming to arrange. Bettina
                    will have to ensure an optimal work flow and full coverage of all the
                    services she offers.
                 • Supervision costs could be increased as Bettina will have to supervise
                    and monitor that the required hours are worked by all the employees.
                 • A flexitime workscheme could also lead to communication problems
                    between workers and Bettina.

                 Accept any other relevant disadvantage.

                 N.B. if a candidate says something to the effect that demotivated
                 employees may not come to work or employees will take advantage of
                 the situation, do not award any marks.


                 Award [1 mark] for a relevant and correct disadvantage identified and
                 award an additional [1 mark] for an explanation that refers to H&B
                 (application). Award up to a maximum of [2 marks].

(ii)   Explain one advantage and one disadvantage to H&B of using a
       commission-based financial reward package.                                    [4 marks]

       Advantages to H&B of using a commission-based financial reward
       package could include:
       • It is an incentive to motivate employees to produce more. Workers at
          H&B will put in more effort to increase their income by servicing
          more clients. Clients will spend less time waiting and as a result,
          customer satisfaction may be improved; customer base could grow.
       • It could help to identify those workers who do not have enough talent
          or skills for the job; it could also help to identify the ones that need
          further training.
       • Through the use of commission the more clients the higher the pay for
          workers. The contrary is also true; in times of low demand
          commission can be a way of adjusting costs for H&B.

       Disadvantages to H&B of using a commission-based financial reward
       package could include the following:
       • Customer service may be resented as workers may focus on quantity

(c)   Analyse the importance of Gavin’s business plan when seeking finance
      from his bank manager.                                                              [5 marks]

      If Gavin asks for a bank loan, he will have to provide a business plan to the
      bank manager containing detailed information about the franchise he wants to
      start up. For instance, Gavin will have to explain his business idea, how he
      plans to develop and market his business, the resources he requires and who his
      competitors are. He will also have to back up arguments with documented
      research and include financial forecasts. A business plan will give the
      bank manager a summary of the key points of the business and evidence of
      Gavin’s payback possibilities. It is therefore an important tool for the bank
      manager to assess and minimize the risks of credit allocation.

      Although important, business plans have some limitations. Gavin may find it
      difficult to gather reliable and precise data to cover some of the main points of
      his business plan. In addition, external factors such as the macro-economic
      environment could be very difficult for him to predict.

      All in all, the bank manager should then supplement Gavin’s business plan
      with other sources of information, such as Gavin’s credit history records to
      fully evaluate the risks of giving him a loan.

(d)   Evaluate the use of franchising as a growth strategy for Bettina and her
      salon, H&B.                                                                          [7 marks]
      Through the use of franchising, Bettina can expand her business without the
      need to raise finance and investing her own funds to make her business grow.
      In addition, if the franchise is successful, Bettina will receive an annual fee of
      10 % from Gavin’s profits. The expansion will increase H&B’s brand value
      and contribute to local and regional brand recognition. Economies of scale
      such as purchasing economies of scale could be gained when buying
      hairdressing products.

      Although, in general, franchising may be a quicker way of expanding the
      business rather than taking an organic-growth route. Franchising serves as a
      source of expansion for H&B, Bettina will still have to cover some costs such
      as the advertising and training expenses. In addition, if her brother Gavin does
      not respect quality standards or goes out of business, H&B’s brand reputation
      may be affected. Since Gavin and Bettina are siblings, their commercial
      relationship could be intermingled with personal or family issues. Their
      business relationship and the franchise strategy may be compromised. There
      are some risks to be faced, such as the fact that most of H&B’s success is based
      on Bettina’s personal talent, networks and expertise.

5.   (a)   Define the term mission statement.                                                  [2 marks]

           The term mission statement is an explanation of an organization’s reason for
           existence. It also embodies the organization’s philosophies, goals and
           ambitions.


           Candidates are not expected to word their definition exactly as above.

           N.B. award [0 marks] if candidates, as part of their response, write down RP’s
           mission statement. Please bear in mind that RP’s mission statement is in the
           stimulus and, thus, just re-writing, with nothing else, does not really
           demonstrate any understanding.

           Award [1 mark] for a basic definition that conveys partial knowledge and
           understanding.

           Award [2 marks] for a full, clear definition that conveys knowledge and
           understanding similar to the answer above.

     (b)   Explain one formal method of communication that might be used at RP.                [2 marks]

           Formal methods of communication that might be used at RP could include the
           following:
           • Oral communication: one-to-one talks, telephone, meetings etc. Oral
              communication can be planned or spontaneous. If someone is an effective
              speaker, he or she can sharpen the message by control of tone and use of
              facial expressions and body gestures. With oral communication, the speaker
              runs the risk of going “off script”, which can weaken or compromise the
              intended message.
           • Written communication: memos, reports, notices pinned on boards etc.
              Written communication allows the writer to say exactly what they intend
              and a permanent record of the communication exists, which can thus be
              referred back to. With written communication – emails are notorious for
              this because they are often written in haste – the author has to worry about
              spirit in which the message will be read and thus the writer has the difficult
              challenge of conveying tone in writing. Email, letters, or other types of
              written communication can be considered a substitute for written
              communication.
           • Visual communication: videos, posters, charts etc. Visual communication
              can get people’s attention and, if done well, send a message that is easy to
              remember. With visual communication, the producer can use pictures,
              format, and other visual cues which shape the viewers understanding.
              With visual communication, some risk exists that the message will be
              oversimplified. At other times, visual communication gets to the heart of
              the matter (YES! to the question of collective action, for example).

           Accept any other relevant explanation.

      Award [1 mark] for a correct and relevant identification of a formal method of
      communication and [1 mark] if the candidate provides a reasoned explanation.
      Candidates do not have to say exactly what is written above, but some relevant
      explanation of the method they have identified. Award a maximum of
      [2 marks].

(c)   Explain one advantage and one disadvantage for McMikey of having a
      corporate social responsibility policy.                                           [4 marks]

      Possible advantages: brand image and reputation could be improved as
      customers will associate McMikey’s brand name with RP; good relationships
      with local authorities or government enables doing business easier.

      Possible disadvantages: costly to maintain; in addition it may cause a
      disadvantage against competitors who do not have social responsibility
      programs and thus reduced costs.

      Accept any other relevant advantage and disadvantage.

(d)   Analyse the impact on RP of McMikey’s offer to pay for the books.                 [5 marks]

      As a non-governmental and non-profit organization, RP is financially
      supported by national businesses. Internal sources of finance are not available
      and public funding seems to be quite difficult to obtain at the moment.

      If Alice wants to launch a new literacy program she does not have many
      options. She could accept McMikey’s donation as a starting point to finance
      the program and then contact other national businesses for following up the
      program.

      However, if Alice accepts the offer, the program runs the risk of lacking
      continuity. If McMikey’s Finance Manager’s views prevail, the new literacy
      program will only have financial support for two years. If the program is
      stopped RP’s image could be damaged; and staff morale could be negatively
      affected.

      Alice should perhaps revise her expectations and postpone the program until
      she finds suitable support for a minimum of five years.

(e)   Evaluate RP’s use of a very large number of part-time volunteers.                     [7 marks]

      The use of a large number of part-time volunteers has a direct impact on RP’s
      finance. Using unpaid workers is a low cost and effective way for RP to
      complete the teaching tasks that may not otherwise be done due to a lack of
      time and resources. RP’s savings in recruitment costs would be very
      important. With a large number of volunteers, RP will be able to cover most
      parts of the city; it will also allow the permanent staff to dedicate their time to
      plan new projects instead of doing direct teaching. In addition, volunteers are
      usually vocationally involved and supportive to the cause. It could be very
      valuable for RP’s working environment to have a large number of motivated
      volunteers.

      However, a large number of volunteers can be time-consuming in terms of
      training; RP will have to provide them with adequate training if they want their
      programs to be successful. In addition, a large number of volunteers will be
      difficult to coordinate; communication problems may arise. As volunteers
      don’t usually work under a contract they could leave unexpectedly and put at
      risk the continuity of the teaching programs.

      All in all, a large number of volunteers can be difficult to manage, however, so
      far it seems to be the only realistic possibility for RP to actually reach its
      strategic objective.
