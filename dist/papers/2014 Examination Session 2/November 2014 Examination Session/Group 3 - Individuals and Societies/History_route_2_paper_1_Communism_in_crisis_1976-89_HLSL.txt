These sources and questions relate to China under Deng Xiaoping (Teng Hsiao-p’ing) and to his
economic policies.

SOURCE A                Deng Xiaoping (Teng Hsiao-p’ing), leader of the People’s Republic of China, in a
                        speech to a Japanese delegation (1984).

The present world is open. One important reason for China’s backwardness after the industrial revolution
in Western countries was its closed-door policy. After the founding of the People’s Republic, we were
blockaded by others, so the country remained virtually closed, which created difficulties for us. The
experience of the past thirty or so years had demonstrated that a closed-door policy would hinder
construction and inhibit [limit] development. There could be two kinds of exclusion: one would be directed
against other countries; the other would be directed against China itself, with one region or department
closing its doors to others. Both kinds of exclusion would be harmful. We are suggesting that we should
develop rapidly, but not too rapidly because that would be unrealistic. To do this, we have to invigorate
[strengthen] the domestic economy and open to the outside world.


SOURCE B                Maurice Meisner, an historian, writing in an academic book, Mao’s China and
                        After: A History of the People’s Republic (1999).

The first four “special economic zones” were established on the South China coast in 1979 near Hong
Kong and opposite Taiwan. Others followed, and within a decade virtually the whole of the Chinese
coast, as well as selected inland regions were “opened”, which is to say they were offering foreign
capitalists favourable conditions for the exploitation of Chinese labour and the making of quick
profits … The special economic zones were embarrassments from the outset [beginning], on both socialist
and nationalist grounds. Moreover, the zones were places where Chinese workers were exploited by foreign
capital and where Chinese servants catered to [provided for] privileged foreign residents. And the zones
were breeding grounds for official corruption.


SOURCE C                John Gittings, an academic and journalist who worked in East Asia, writing in the
                        book, The Changing Face of China: From Mao to Market (2006).

Across the border from Hong Kong, lorries with dual Chinese and Hong Kong number plates headed north
and south between Shenzhen and Guangzhou carrying in cloth, leather, plastics and electrical parts, and
taking out garments, shoes, toys, and assembled electrical goods and electronics. Deep in the countryside
factories sprang up employing local peasant labour at a quarter of the rate paid in Hong Kong and half of
that in the Shenzhen Special Economic Zone. Migrants from the interior sat in village squares, hoping to
pick up casual work for even lower wages … Hong Kong’s own economy was increasingly dominated by
mainland investment – at least 30 per cent according to most estimates – and the territory also provided a
free management school with several thousand mainland visitors at any one time learning new skills.

SOURCE D               Julian Baum, a journalist writing in an article for the US newspaper The Christian
                       Science Monitor, reports on a speech made by Chen Yun (1985).

Chen Yun [a prominent Chinese Communist Party (CCP) member, in a speech to the Party conference]
warned about problems the party faces, directly criticizing specific issues raised by Deng’s reform
program. Beginning with agriculture, he said bluntly, “We must continue to pay attention to grain
production.” Under Deng’s policies and after several years of surplus production, large numbers of
peasants have been abandoning grain production for crops that could be sold readily on the free market.
They have also been getting involved in rural industries for higher profits than farming can offer.
Chen warned that the line of “no prosperity without engaging in industry” is heard much louder than
that of “no economic stability without agricultural development.” “Feeding and clothing a billion
people constitutes one of China’s major political as well as economic challenges, for grain shortages
will lead to social disorder,” he said. Chen is widely respected for his views on economic policy and he
cautioned party leaders not to become infatuated [obsessed] with market economics or to confuse a
planned economy under socialism with a market-oriented economy.


SOURCE E               Liu Heung Shing, a photojournalist, depicts a young man drinking Coca-Cola in
                       the grounds of the Imperial Palace, Beijing, in his book, China After Mao: Seek
                       Truth From Facts (1981).




                         “It tastes so-so [just acceptable],” said the young man.
