Answer one question.

Wherever possible, answers should include case studies and examples, and, where relevant, large, well drawn
maps, sketches and diagrams.

1.    (a)   Analyse the increasing influence of one multi-governmental organization you
            have studied.                                                                             [10]

      (b)   “Global interactions bring negative effects, rather than positive effects, to every
            part of the world.” Discuss this statement.                                               [15]


2.    (a)   Analyse recent growth trends in the use of ICT for one or more countries or
            regions you have studied.                                                                 [10]

      (b)   Examine the changing global pattern of sociocultural interactions, referring to
            core regions and peripheral areas.                                                        [15]


3.    (a)   Explain how rising global demand for one raw material has led to environmental
            degradation.                                                                              [10]

      (b)   “The barriers to global interactions are increasing, not decreasing.” Discuss
            this statement.                                                                           [15]
