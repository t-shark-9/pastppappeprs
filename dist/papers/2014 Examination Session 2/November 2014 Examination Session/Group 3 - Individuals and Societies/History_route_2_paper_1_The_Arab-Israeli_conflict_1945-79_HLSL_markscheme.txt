1.   (a)   What, according to Source A, is the opinion expressed by Winston Churchill
           about Britain’s presence in Palestine?                                     [3 marks]

            That Britain was facing a lamentable situation in Palestine.
            That the British presence was incurring a massive financial cost.
            That 100,000 British troops were confronting a handful of terrorists. Churchill thinks this
              is a waste of resources and that 100,000 troops is a significant part of the British Army.
            That the money wasted in Palestine could be better spent in Britain, for example in helping
              to find employment for British people.

     Award [1 mark] for each relevant point up to a maximum of [3 marks].

     (b)   What is the message conveyed by Source B?                                               [2 marks]

            That Britain is relinquishing her responsibility for Palestine and/or the expression on the
              “nurse’s” face suggests that Britain is fed up with trying to treat the “patient”.
            That Britain is exasperated with the intractable problem of Palestine and/or Britain is
              exasperated with the interference of other powers, and this has led to Britain's withdrawal.
            That neither the “medicine” of trusteeship nor the “medicine” of partition has improved the
             situation in Palestine, thus the situation in Palestine is very grave as indicated by the
             patient’s temperature chart.
            That the other Great Powers are now obliged to deal with the Palestinian situation.

     Award [1 mark] for each relevant point up to a maximum of [2 marks].
                                                 –4–                N14/3/HISTX/BP1/ENG/TZ0/S2/M


2.   Compare and contrast the views expressed in Sources C and E about the UN
     General Assembly’s approval, in November 1947, of the partition of Palestine into
     two states.                                                                       [6 marks]

     For “compare”
      Both sources recognize the role of the UN and/or indicate strong reactions to the UN’s
       agreement to the partitioning of Palestine.
      Both sources relate the partition decision to the Jews’ past suffering in the Western world.
      Both sources’ views are shaped by their attitudes to the legitimacy of Jewish claims to a national
       home in Palestine.

     For “contrast”
      Source C only deals with the Jewish claim to Palestine whereas Source E refers to both Arab and
       Jewish claims and/or Source C shows the Israeli perspective whereas Source E shows the Arab
       perspective.
      Source C shows an enthusiastic response by Jewish settlers to the UN decision; this is in strong
       contrast to the hostile feelings of the Arab world expressed in Source E.
      Source C and Source E express conflicting historical claims, with Source C justifying the Jewish
       claim to Palestine (after “two thousand years of exile”), while Source E rejects the Zionist claim
       to any part of Palestine, instead arguing for the historic rights of the Arab people (“… from the
       beginning its indigenous inhabitants …”).
      Source C claims that the establishment of a Jewish state is justified by recent events such as the
       persecution suffered by the Jews in Europe, whereas Source E emphasizes the injustice of the
       West in making the Arab people pay the price of such suffering with Arab land.

     Do not demand all of the above. If only one source is discussed award a maximum of [2 marks].
     If two sources are discussed separately award [3 marks] or with excellent linkage [4–5 marks].
     For maximum [6 marks] expect a detailed running comparison/contrast. Award up to [5 marks] if
     two sources are linked/integrated in either a running comparison or contrast.

3.   With reference to their origin and purpose, assess the value and limitations of
     Source A and Source D for historians studying the factors which led to the
     establishment of the state of Israel.                                           [6 marks]

     Source A
     Origin:        An extract from a speech to the House of Commons on 31 January 1947 by Winston
                    Churchill, leader of the British Conservative Party and the country’s former prime
                    minister.

     Purpose:       To state to the House of Commons his opposition to the continued presence of
                    British forces in Palestine. To persuade the British government to relinquish its
                    mandate.

     Value:         Churchill’s extensive experience of domestic and international affairs (including his
                    period as prime minister between 1940 and 1945) meant that he was likely to have a
                    good knowledge of Britain’s economic situation and of its global interests.
                    The speech may provide a good insight into the views of an important political figure
                    at that time.

     Limitations:   Since he was not prime minister at the time, he may not have been fully informed
                    about Britain’s position in Palestine. Also, in making a public speech, Churchill may
                    be seeking both to consolidate his leadership of the Conservative Party and to shape
                    British public opinion and thus win public support for his party. The source lacks
                    hindsight because Churchill was speaking more than one year before the
                    establishment of the state of Israel. Churchill, as Leader of the Opposition, would
                    want to attack Government policy. This Source only presents Churchill's own
                    opinions.

     Source D
     Origin:        An extract from an academic book “The Modern History of Israel” by Noah Lucas
                    published in 1975. The author was a professor of History as well as a Jewish
                    supporter of Zionism.

     Purpose:       To inform the reader of the history of Israel in modern times, and to present the
                    Zionist case.

     Value:         The book’s exclusive focus on Israel could be useful in gaining an insight into the
                    Israeli perspective. Lucas’s academic position meant that his work is likely to be the
                    outcome of careful scholarly research. Also, since this book was published many
                    years after the event, it is likely to benefit from hindsight and from a more objective
                    perspective.

     Limitations:   The title of this book suggests that the author was taking a broader view of Israeli
                    history and this could mean that it does not go into sufficient depth in explaining the
                    establishment of the state of Israel. Furthermore, the writer’s Zionist sympathies
                    could mean that his analysis is not totally objective. Finally, the book is now nearly
                    40 years old and therefore could be considered to be outdated in its views.

     Do not expect all the above. Ideally there will be a balance between the two sources, and each one
     can be marked out of [3 marks], but allow a [4/2 marks] split. If only one source is assessed, mark
     out of [4 marks]. For a maximum of [6 marks] candidates must refer to both origin and purpose,
     and value and limitations.

4.   Using the sources and your own knowledge, to what extent do you agree that
     Britain’s financial and economic weakness after the end of the Second World War
     was the main reason for the establishment of the state of Israel in 1948?       [8 marks]

     Source material
     Source A This source explains the heavy and intolerable cost to Britain of its continued presence
               in Palestine.

     Source B   This source suggests that the other Great Powers were having to take over responsibility
                for Palestine from the British. It also suggests that Britain’s efforts in Palestine had
                been ineffectual – hence Britain’s decision to give up the Mandate. Also the partition
                plan is not improving the situation.

     Source C   This source seems to suggest that the main reason for the establishment of the state
                of Israel was to redress historic wrongs. The support of much of the international
                community is reflected in the passing of the UN Partition Resolution.

     Source D This source explains a range of contributory factors. The two Great Powers, the US and
              the USSR, both favoured the establishment of the state of Israel; the US because of its
              support of the Zionist cause and the USSR because of the detrimental impact it had on
              the British Empire, which was already on the wane. Skilful Zionist diplomacy enabled
              the Zionist lobby to achieve the 2/3 General Assembly majority in favour of the
              Partition Plan. In this regard they were helped by the support of many smaller
              countries, especially those in Latin America.

     Source E   The source suggests that the state of Israel was established as a response to the suffering
                that the Western world had inflicted on the Jewish people. It was the United Nations
                that decided to create an independent Jewish state in Palestine and the UN was an
                organization controlled by Europe and the US.


     Own knowledge

     Factors suggesting the importance of Britain to the establishment of the State of Israel:
     Candidates could expand on the terrorist acts and refer, for example, to the increasing Zionist
     violence by the Irgun and Stern (later LEHI) gangs and by the Haganah such as the blowing up of
     the King David Hotel in Jerusalem, the spiral of brutality throughout Palestine, eg the Irgun
     hanging of two British soldiers in retaliation for the British execution of three members of the Irgun
     gang. There was British war weariness after the Second World War. The Second World War had
     seriously weakened the British economy, and its resources were thinly stretched. This meant that
     Britain was heavily reliant on US financing and therefore particularly receptive to US pressure.
     Britain’s withdrawal from Palestine formed part of its imperial retrenchment eg from India. One of
     the Labour government’s priorities was the creation of a welfare state.

     Other contributory factors:
     President Truman, who succeeded President Roosevelt after Roosevelt’s death in 1945, was very
     sympathetic to the Zionist cause and, partly because he was aware of the need for Jewish electoral
     support, he supported the UN’s partition plan.

In April 1946 Bevin, the British Foreign Secretary who opposed the creation of a Jewish state,
rejected the proposal to issue 100,000 immigration certificates to Jewish refugees, and this
increased pressure upon Britain from the international community. There was widespread horror at
the Royal Navy’s interception of the ship “Exodus” attempting to bring more than 4,000 Jewish
refugees to Palestine.

Do not expect all the above and accept other relevant material. If only source material or own
knowledge is used, the maximum mark that can be obtained is [5 marks]. For maximum [8 marks]
expect argument, synthesis of source material and own knowledge, as well as references to the
sources used.
