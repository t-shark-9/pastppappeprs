Marks      Level descriptor

0          The answer does not reach a standard described by the descriptors below.

1 to 3     There is an attempt to answer the question, but knowledge and
           understanding is limited, often inaccurate, or of marginal relevance to the
           question. The response makes no direct reference to the stimulus
           material or relies too heavily on quotations from the text.

4 to 7     The question is partially answered. Knowledge and understanding is
           accurate but limited. Either the command term is not effectively
           addressed or the response is not sufficiently explicit in answering the
           question. The response makes limited use of the stimulus material.

8 to 10    The question is answered in a focused and effective manner and meets
           the demands of the command term. The answer is supported by
           appropriate and accurate knowledge and understanding of qualitative
           research methodology.       The response demonstrates a critical
           understanding of qualitative research methodology applied to the
           stimulus material.

1.   Evaluate the use of covert participant observation in this qualitative research study.            10 marks

     Refer to the paper 3 markbands when awarding marks.

     The command term “evaluate” requires candidates to make an appraisal by weighing up the
     strengths and limitations of the use of covert participant observation in this study.
     Although a discussion of both strengths and limitations is required, it does not have to be
     evenly balanced to gain high marks.

     The major focus of the response should be on an evaluation of the use of covert participant
     observation in this study. Responses may briefly refer to other research methods as part of
     the evaluation of why covert participant observation was used in this study. Candidates are
     not required to explicitly define covert participant observation in order to gain full marks.

     Relevant strengths of covert participant observation could include, but are not limited to:
      With reference to the study, candidates could say that covert participant observation was
       chosen because it gave the researcher the possibility to blend in with the poor and thus
       have a genuine feeling of “walking in their shoes” when they come to a health clinic.
      Covert observation is useful in exploring a socially sensitive issue (in this case, how
       poverty is experienced, especially in relation to seeking help in a health clinic) because it
       gives the researcher detailed information that may not be obtained using other methods.
      A covert approach is more likely to avoid demand characteristics, for example, the
       Hawthorne effect or social desirability effect. If the healthcare workers in the clinics
       believed they were being observed, they could have behaved differently than they
       usually would.

     Relevant limitations of covert participant observation could include, but are not limited to:
      Covert participant observation is an invasive research method. It has serious ethical
       implications because the researcher does not obtain informed consent and deceives the
       other participants, in this study both the healthcare workers and the poor people seeking
       health care. Candidates may assert that in this study the covert approach was justified
       because more research is needed on this important topic.
      The researcher could lose objectivity as it may be difficult to keep a balance between
       involvement and detachment, especially with regard to a socially sensitive issue such as
       the one described in this research. This concern related to researcher bias is heightened
       by the fact that the researcher herself worked in a similar environment and she was
       emotionally affected by her experiences during her research (lines 18–19). Researcher
       reflexivity could be used to increase credibility.

     If a candidate evaluates only the covert or only the participant aspect of the observation, the
     response should be awarded up to a maximum of [5 marks].

     If a candidate refers only to strengths or only to limitations of covert participant
     observation, the response should be awarded up to a maximum of [5 marks].

     If a candidate refers only to strengths or only to limitations of only covert observation, the
     response should be awarded up to a maximum of [3 marks].

     If a candidate refers only to strengths or only to limitations of only participant observation,
     the response should be awarded up to a maximum of [3 marks].

2.   Explain how triangulation could contribute to the credibility/trustworthiness of
     this qualitative research study.                                                 10 marks

     Refer to the paper 3 markbands when awarding marks.

     The command term “explain” requires candidates to give a detailed account of how
     triangulation could contribute to credibility/trustworthiness and give reasons for why
     they are relevant, by referring to details of the study.

     Candidates are not required to explicitly define triangulation in order to gain full marks.
     Triangulation is a method of cross-checking the data and conclusions in a study by
     introducing various procedures, sources or researchers so there can be increased
     confidence in the researchers’ interpretations.

     This study was based on a single research method (covert participant observation) and
     could therefore be affected by limitations associated with that method or from the
     application of that method in this particular study. Triangulation is believed to be a way
     to control for such limitations.

     Candidates may refer to one or more forms of triangulation explaining their relevance,
     for example:
      Researcher triangulation: the researcher could ask one or more other researchers to
        check data collection, analysis and interpretation. This would help to prevent
        researcher bias. In this study there was only one researcher collecting data. This
        could result in bias so asking another researcher to check her field notes and
        interpretations (line 16) could be a way to limit bias and increase credibility.
      Method triangulation: the researcher could have combined the observations with
        follow-up interviews with the “participants” of the study (for example, the poor
        people and healthcare staff in the healthcare clinics) or similar participants. If the
        conclusions from alternative methods are the same, credibility/trustworthiness
        is increased.
      Data triangulation: the researcher collected data at different times and different social
        situations (various clinics) as well as on a variety of people. This is believed to
        increase credibility.

     Candidates may address how triangulation was applied to the study as well as
     suggesting other approaches to triangulation that could have been applied. Both
     approaches are acceptable.

3.   To what extent can findings from this qualitative research study be generalized?             10 marks

     Refer to the paper 3 markbands when awarding marks.

     The command term “to what extent” requires candidates to consider the degree to which
     findings from this qualitative study can be generalized.

     Candidates may say that generalization could be important in qualitative research
     because it means that the results are relevant outside the context of the study itself.
     They could also argue that generalization may be difficult with a study such as this one
     because there is little previous research in the same area to compare it with.

     Candidates could refer to ways of generalizing findings in qualitative research, for
     example, as outlined by Lewis and Richie (2003):
      Representational generalization: findings from qualitative research studies can be
        applied to populations outside the population of the study. With reference to the
        study in the stimulus material, candidates may say that even though the results may
        primarily apply to the seven clinics in the study, there is a similar pattern that could
        indicate a more general trend. If the sample is small the results cannot be statistically
        representative but if similar studies confirm the findings of this study, it could be
        argued that generalization is possible. The problem is that not many studies have
        been performed so far.
      Theoretical generalization: this refers to how far results could contribute to
        formulation of theory, for example, with reference to the study in the stimulus
        material that a shabby appearance negatively affects the treatment clients receive in
        most clinics for the poor. Such a theory could be put to test in other similar settings
        to test its generalizability and this could be used to develop further theory.
        For example, the findings from this study could lead to inferences about how to
        select and provide effective training of staff in healthcare clinics for the poor.
      Inferential generalization: the findings of the study can be applied to settings outside
        the study, ie transferability. Since the study is on poor, marginalized and homeless
        individuals, candidates may argue that the findings could be transferred to other
        similar settings (for example, shelters) but this will depend on the richness of the
        data.

     Candidates may, in their discussion of generalization of findings from this qualitative
     research, briefly refer to statistical generalization (quantitative research) as part of their
     argument. This should be given credit as long as the main focus is on generalization
     from qualitative research.

     Candidates may refer to the possibility of comparing findings from one qualitative study
     to other qualitative studies without using specific terminology relating to generalization,
     such as “representational”, “inferential” and “theoretical”.
