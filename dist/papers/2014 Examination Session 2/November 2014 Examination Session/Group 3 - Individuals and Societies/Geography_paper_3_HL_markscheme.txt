1.   (a)   Analyse the increasing influence of one multi-governmental organization you
           have studied.                                                                             [10]

           Likely examples include the EU, NAFTA or the BRICS group (which has had annual
           meetings since 2009). Also credit other examples of global governance with a
           multi-governmental character, such as the IMF, World Bank, G8, OPEC, NATO,
           OECD. Also credit the UN, or UN-sponsored agencies. An analysis of the influence
           of a specific global conference or agreement/protocol (climate change meetings in
           Kyoto, Doha, etc) could reach band D/E provided that it is explicitly shown to be the
           product of multi-governmental collaboration, organization or debate (if not, limit
           such responses to band C).

           Multi-governmental organizations (MGOs) influence the way citizens, civil society
           and businesses operate by relaxing barriers to certain types of global flow/movement
           (migrants, tourists, goods, capital, etc). A key issue is the diminishing effectiveness
           of political borders.

           Alternative approaches might analyse the political influence that MGOs have over
           the governance of sovereign states:
           • EU states must agree to adopt legislation from European Parliament (some may
              even know of the growing influence of Germany as a driver of EU policy
              affecting Greece during Eurozone crisis)
           • IMF insistence on economic reform/adjustments in countries seeking loans,
              sometimes critiqued as a neo-colonial form of influence
           • UN human rights rulings / war tribunals / peace-keeping operations
           • NATO or other military alliances and their actions
           • the macro-economic influence of OPEC during the 1970s (another approach
              might be to analyse why OPEC’s influence has ceased to increase since)
           • the growing influence of the BRICS group (especially Chinese and Indian
              investment in African countries).

           At band D, expect either description of some range of ways in which an MGO is
           influential, or some chronology / explanation of why its influence is increasing.

           For band E, expect both.
                                            –5–              N14/3/GEOGR/HP3/ENG/TZ0/XX/M


(b)   “Global interactions bring negative effects, rather than positive effects, to every
      part of the world.” Discuss this statement.                                             [15]

      Credit all content in line with the markbands.       Credit unexpected approaches
      wherever relevant.

      Three likely ways to discuss the statement (there may be others) are as follows:
      • one way is to assess the net effect for a range of generic global concerns (“every
        part of the world” is thus interpreted as “the world”)
      • another way is to agree that there are few positives associated with global
        interactions, notably environmental effects, and to then address the extent to
        which particular places, especially isolated/wilderness regions [Guide 7], have
        suffered
      • alternatively, candidates may offer a place-by-place or regional audit eg
        compares/discusses South America, Africa, USA, etc.

      Likely themes for discussion include:
      • financial flows [Guide 3] and workplace exploitation, balanced against the
         alleviation of poverty
      • cultural interactions can bring homogeneity but also bring new forms of culture,
         and hybridity [Guide 5] but this must be balanced against the loss of authentic
         differences and the ways in which adopted cultural traits enable “exploitative” or
         consumerist TNCs to gain leverage to penetrate new markets, etc
      • migration brings a range of effects for host and source regions [Guide 5]; these
         should be carefully weighed and, ideally, a genuine evaluation given (rather than
         listed costs and benefits)
      • environmental harm is likely to be a major theme [Guide 4]; some may argue that
         accelerated climate change stems from accelerated global interactions (accept this
         view), opening the way for a thoughtful discussion of predicted changes
         (including some beneficial ones, eg thermal growing season).

      Good answers may provide some discussion of the extent of these effects (the
      interrogation of whether “every place” is affected) and may focus on “un-globalized”
      societies eg Amazonian tribes [Guide 7], ocean pathways for pollution and plastic-
      strewn coral atolls, Antarctic beaches, etc.

      At band D, there should be either a detailed explanation of a variety of effects or a
      more critical discussion of the net balance/spread of effects.

      For band E, expect both.

2.   (a)   Analyse recent growth trends in the use of ICT for one or more countries or
           regions you have studied.                                                                [10]

           There are many possible approaches to answering this question.

           The focus could be on:
           • actual ICT network growth/adoption trends (in terms of numbers of
              subscribers/device owners/intensity of use/places where there is uptake)
           • growth of a single/narrower aspect of ICT adoption (eg mobile phone use, social
              networking, broadband provision)
           • the growing uses of ICT in civil society (more people exchanging ideas,
              information, finance) and/or changing rates of social adoption.

           Weaker answers are likely to provide isolated fragments of information about
           different places, or may offer a technology timeline with little geographical content.

           Good answers may provide a clear geographical focus (perhaps named countries eg
           M-Pesa in Kenya or ICT outsourcing in India) and give some depth of analysis of
           how and why ICT uptake has changed, and who the users are.

           At band D, there should be either detailed description of ICT growth/adoption trends
           or explanation of ways in which ICT is being used by people/groups/TNCs.

           For band E, expect both.
                                            –7–              N14/3/GEOGR/HP3/ENG/TZ0/XX/M


(b)   Examine the changing global pattern of sociocultural interactions, referring to
      core regions and peripheral areas.                                                       [15]

      Credit all content in line with the markbands.       Credit unexpected approaches
      wherever relevant.

      Global sociocultural interactions can encompass migration and diaspora,
      social networking, cultural shifts (in spoken language, music, fashion, cuisine, etc),
      the spread of global media and the diffusion of branded commodities (all [Guide 7]).
      The response should examine a range of such interactions and may address reasons
      for their growth over time (technology, TNCs) [Guide 2, Guide 5].

      A sound examination of global sociocultural interactions may illustrate the ongoing
      role that “core” regions/countries have in bringing cultural change to other places.
      • concepts such as “cultural imperialism” or “soft power” may be employed and
          should be credited if used [Guide 5]
      • it may be argued that these interactions have intensified due to technology and
          TNCs [Guide 5]
      • done well, and with sufficient synthesis of themes, this approach, though simple,
          could reach the higher bands
      • perhaps a global core/hub and periphery/semi-periphery framework will be used
          [Guide 3].

      Good answers may explicitly address the changing pattern / new locations of global
      cultural influence, notably emerging economies such as the BRIC nations (India’s
      Bollywood film, Brazil’s Bossa Nova music, etc). Some may even consider the
      extent to which a long-established US–EU (core) hegemony is under threat.

      Credit other valid interpretations, but material on financial interactions
      (eg remittance flows) should be marked as irrelevant or not answering the question.
      Some answers may lack conceptual grounding, but usefully employ a good range of
      anecdotal/documentary evidence that draws on a candidate’s own lifestyle, eg
      familiarity with South Korea’s K-pop phenomenon and Psy (a major music trend of
      2012 that will be very familiar to the age group who will have sat the paper).

      At band D, expect either explanation of a wide, detailed range of sociocultural
      interactions, or a more critical examination of a changing pattern over time.

      For band E, expect both.

3.   (a)   Explain how rising global demand for one raw material has led to
           environmental degradation.                                                              [10]

           Raw materials may include fossil fuels, ores, timber or food stuffs such as soya. Any
           unexpected interpretations, the validity of which is not clear, must be referred to a
           team leader.

           • Located impacts for degradation could include the Niger delta or Gulf of Mexico
             (oil), Brazil (timber/soya), shale gas (USA), oil sands (Canada).
           • Specific impacts might include loss of biodiversity or acid rain. A good account of
             impacts that lacks locational detail can still reach the higher band if the process
             details are good.
           • The idea of degradation might also be linked to the lifecycle of the raw
             material/product including waste disposal issues.
           • Good answers may be structured to show different scales of environmental
             degradation (local and global) or may look at transmission of effects (questioning
             whether degradation occurs at the source or destination/market eg coal burning).

           Details of rising demand are required for band E, or can help candidates to access
           band D if they are lacking details about environmental degradation. Rising demand
           could be linked specifically with the growth of emerging economies/rising
           affluence/growth of new consumer classes. Some credit can be given for suggesting
           population increases, although rising demand is in fact related far more to changing
           lifestyles in China, Brazil, Indonesia, etc.

           At band D, expect either a detailed description of some range of environmental
           degradation, or a clear explanation of how/why rising demand plays a role.

           For band E, expect both.

(b)   “The barriers to global interactions are increasing, not decreasing.” Discuss
      this statement.                                                                           [15]

      Credit all content in line with the markbands.        Credit unexpected approaches
      wherever relevant.

      Global interactions may be defined as a diverse set of flows (economic, social,
      cultural, etc), potentially “setting the scene” for an essay which provides a nuanced
      conclusion that discusses the extent to which the statement is true for different types
      of global interaction.

      Likely themes and barriers include:
      • free trade versus protectionism (and the role trade blocs play); the focus will be
         loss of sovereignty and multi-governmental organizations (MGOs) [Guide 6]
      • information exchange versus censorship, linked to growing importance of
         technology/“shrinking world” theory [Guide 2]
      • “open-door” migration versus points systems and restrictions either in the context
         of economic migration or diaspora studies [Guide 3, Guide 5]
      • some possible considerations of the now well-documented and growing risks
         associated with outsourcing/offshoring [Guide 3] – perhaps an “end of
         globalization” argument
      • physical/environmental barriers may not be growing but are certainly falling due
         to overcoming of friction of distance [Guide 2]
      • developed further, the migration and offshoring debates can be linked with the
         resurgence of nationalism and anti-globalization movements [Guide 6, Guide 7].

      The double-edged effect of MGOs may be remarked on – namely, that they reduce
      barriers to internal exchanges while erecting barriers to external trade
      (eg through the adoption of a common external tariff in the case of the EU, thereby
      excluding some producers from access to European markets).

      Good answers may conclude that the response to the question depends on the type of
      interaction that is being discussed (thus China is more open to flows of FDI than in
      the past, pre-1978; yet efforts to censor the internet have increased in line with its
      growing popularity). Some countries encourage economic interactions but attempt to
      curtail cultural ones.

      At band D, expect either a detailed explanation of a variety of ways in which barriers
      are changing, or a more critical discussion of different kinds of barriers and
      interactions.

      At band E, expect both.
