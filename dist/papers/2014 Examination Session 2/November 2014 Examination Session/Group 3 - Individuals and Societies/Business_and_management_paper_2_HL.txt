                                               SECTION A

Answer one question from this section.

1.    Deep Sea Catch (DSC)

      Deep Sea Catch (DSC) operates as a sole trader on an island popular with tourists. DSC specializes
      in supplying fresh fish to local hotels on a daily basis.

      The local government has given DSC a permit to catch a maximum of 70 kilograms of fish per day.
      However, there has been an increase in illegal fishing (without permits), in addition to overfishing
      by DSC’s other competitors (with permits), which has reduced fish stocks in the area. Given the
      increasing competition among fish suppliers on the island, hotels will only pay a fixed price of $10
      per kilogram of fish.

      DSC’s cost of operation and the quantity of fish caught varies depending on factors such as weather
      conditions, the availability of fish, and the number of competitors.

      Local hotels demand that:
      • the fish they buy meet strict national health and safety standards, to ensure the quality of the fish
        for tourists
      • fish are caught ethically without endangering other sea creatures, such as sea turtles or dolphins.

      An environmental pressure group is also pressuring the government for:
      • more strict regulations on the fishing industries, targeting suppliers without permits
      • a reduction in the quantity of fish that each supplier can sell
      • new legislation for a compulsory installation of new and sophisticated technological equipment
        for ethical fishing.

      DSC is well known for fishing responsibly and within government legislation. However, the owner
      is worried about the possible high costs of some of the new legislation.

      Unsold fish is stored and kept in a refrigerator for up to two days. After two days, the stored fish is
      sold to a processing factory for $4 per kilogram. For example, fish caught on Monday, but still not
      supplied to the hotels by Tuesday evening, will be sold on Wednesday to the processing factory.



                                                            (This question continues on the following page)

(Question 1 continued)

      DSC uses the system of last-in-first-out (LIFO) for the stock valuation. The table below shows a
      typical week’s supply of fish at DSC:

       Day of the week     Kilograms of fish caught by Kilograms of fish supplied
                           DSC and the cost of fishing by DSC
       Monday                       20 @ $5                       10
       Tuesday                      30 @ $8                       20
       Wednesday                    20 @ $6                       20
       Thursday                     40 @ $5                       30
       Friday                       20 @ $8                       20
       Saturday                     40 @ $8                       30
       Sunday                       40 @ $5                       30

2.    Stay Float (SF)

      Stay Float (SF) is a family-owned private limited company that produces rowing boats. Dan is
      the Marketing Director and Ori, his brother, is the Finance Director. Together they own 75% of
      SF’s shares. The main target market is university boat clubs that require custom-made rowing boats.
      SF produces two models of boat, “The Single” and “The Quad”, using a job production method.
      Each model of boat is treated as separate profit centres.

      SF is market-orientated and highly responsive to customer needs. Customers are willing to wait a
      long time for the completion of a boat because of its high quality and flexible design. Employees are
      highly skilled and motivated. SF uses a price skimming strategy.

      Increasing overseas competition of cheaper mass-produced rowing boats and a cut in university
      activity budgets has caused a fall in demand for SF’s boats. As a result, SF is experiencing cash flow
      difficulties. Dan and Ori are considering two different strategic options to reduce costs and find new
      market segments for both boats:
      • (Option 1) change the production method to flow production to improve the working capital cycle.
         However, Ori is concerned about how this will be financed.
      • (Option 2) subcontract the production of the “The Quad” overseas and continue producing
         “The Single” at the current location.

      Sales price for “The Single”: $15 000.
      Sales price for “The Quad”: $25 000.

      Current financial data for 2014:

       Total fixed costs for SF        $50 000
       Variable cost per boat          “The Single”: $12 000
                                       “The Quad”: $18 000
       Actual number of boats produced “The Single”: 6 boats
       and sold                        “The Quad”: 4 boats
       Production capacity             20 boats in total

      Financial data if SF subcontracts “The Quad” overseas (Option 2):
      • production capacity for the subcontractor: 40 boats.
      • the total fixed cost will be reduced by $14 000.
      • SF will pay a variable cost of $14 000 per boat to the subcontractor.
      • SF will reduce the price of the mass-produced “The Quad” by 20% and double the quantity sold in
         the first year.
      • the quantity of “The Single” (6 boats) sold will remain unchanged.



                                                           (This question continues on the following page)

(Question 2 continued)

      (a)   Describe two features of SF operating as a private limited company.            [4 marks]

      (b)   Explain two advantages and one disadvantage for SF of operating “The Single”
            and “The Quad” as separate profit centres.                                     [6 marks]

      (c)   Calculate for SF (show all your working):

            (i)    the current capacity utilization in 2014.                               [2 marks]

            (ii)   the break-even quantity for “The Single” if the subcontracting option
                   (Option 2) is chosen.                                                   [2 marks]

            (iii) whether the production of “The Quad” should be subcontracted overseas
                  (Option 2), assuming that the sales of “The Single” stay the same as
                  in 2014.                                                                 [5 marks]

      (d)   Analyse the suggestion that SF should change from job production to
            flow production (Option 1).                                                    [6 marks]

                                                SECTION B

Answer two questions from this section.

3.    Cheap4U (C4U)

      Cheap4U (C4U), a public limited company (plc), operates a successful low-price airline service.
      C4U offers a basic service targeting low-income families and students. It is positioned as offering the
      lowest price for a flight. Staff training for flights is on-the-job and C4U uses non-financial motivation
      such as job enlargement. C4U has recently experienced difficulty in recruiting enough flight staff.
      As a result, flight staff are overworked and there have been complaints by some passengers about
      poor service.

      In 2013, C4U suffered its first loss in 11 years. C4U carried out a review and the following three
      issues were identified:
      • given the staff shortages, C4U flights are often delayed or cancelled.
      • some advertising for popular flights is considered to be unethical. For example, cheap one-way
         flights are promoted without stating that the return flight is twice as expensive.
      • new low-price competitors are emerging, using newer and more fuel-efficient aircrafts.

      C4U is considering offering a new international flight service, Quality4U (Q4U). This service will
      only be offered at certain times. Q4U will target higher-income consumers by offering excellent
      aircraft facilities, free internet access and more comfortable seats. Four new fully equipped aircrafts
      will need to be purchased. C4U’s gearing ratio is rising at over 80%. New sources of finance will
      be required.

      C4U is also considering new methods of staff training for the new Q4U service:
      • One new method of off-the-job training could be conducted by a hotel which is famous for its high
        quality of customer service. This new training method will increase C4U’s costs at a time when its
        working capital is limited.
      • Secondly, all flight staff will have to study for and pass an examination to meet international
        quality standards of customer service. C4U’s senior management is insisting that staff study in
        their own free time. Flight staff have complained and have consulted their representatives about
        possible industrial action, as they feel that they are already overworked.



                                                             (This question continues on the following page)

(Question 3 continued)

      (a)   Describe one feature of:

            (i)    job enlargement.                                                         [2 marks]

      (b)   Explain how each of the three issues identified, could have impacted on C4U’s
            revenue, leading to its first loss in 11 years.                                 [6 marks]

      (c)   Analyse two appropriate sources of finance that C4U could use to purchase the
            new aircrafts for the new Q4U service.                                          [6 marks]

      (d)   Evaluate the two new methods of training and examination that C4U are
            considering to prepare flight staff for the new Q4U service.                    [9 marks]

4.    Creative Bleu (CB)

      Creative Bleu (CB) is an Australian media private limited company which has produced many
      innovative television (TV) commercials. Jennifer Joyce, the Chief Executive Officer (CEO), set up
      the company with three college friends. CB now employs 24 people.

      The organizational culture is technological, collaborative, innovative and task-orientated.
      Flexible project teams of four are created and rotated to generate new and creative ideas. On occasions,
      decisions are made intuitively. All employees have equal input into the decision-making process.
      CB has an employee share-ownership scheme, and profits are shared among all of the shareholders.
      Jennifer has a democratic leadership style. Staff turnover at CB has been very low.

      CB has received a substantial contract to produce a TV commercial. The commercial will be for
      a new product. The commercial will also help CB gain entry into a new international market:
      South Korea. The long-term financial benefits for CB could be significant, but Jennifer is worried that
      CB will use all its working capital on this operation. Moreover, CB does not have a Korean speaker
      amongst its staff.

      Jennifer and the staff see the production of the TV commercial as an opportunity for CB to enter a new
      market and grow. Jennifer has two strategic options for CB:
      • grow internally by producing the TV commercial in Australia. CB would finance the whole
         operation and employ additional staff: translators, local Korean actors, and technical support staff.
      • form a joint venture with a Korean media company. CB would share the costs of the operation
         with them. The TV commercial would be produced in Seoul, South Korea. Given the size of the
         operation, CB would relocate one of their teams to Seoul.

      (b)   Identify two key features of intuitive decision-making.                                [2 marks]

      (c)   Explain two benefits and one cost to CB of using an employee share-ownership
            scheme.                                                                                [6 marks]

      (d)   Analyse the effectiveness of using flexible project teams for CB.                      [6 marks]

      (e)   Recommend which of the two strategic options CB should pursue.                         [9 marks]

5.    Moving back to the US

      Reducing costs has been a significant driving force in pushing multinational companies to offshore
      manufacturing. However, as emerging economies develop, labour costs are rising.

      Between 2005 and 2010, wages of factory workers in China rose by 69%. An analyst for
      Boston Consulting Group said that “the cost advantages from offshoring are falling to such an extent
      that some American multinationals with manufacturing offshore are returning home to supply their
      American customers”. By 2015, the cost advantage of offshoring manufacturing for the United States
      (US) market will disappear. The analyst has forecasted, based on the same time series technique as
      sales forecasting, that wages will continue to grow at around 17% a year in China, but remain stable in
      the US.

      Gary Pisano, of Harvard Business School, said that some American companies that had considered
      offshoring parts of their business are choosing to expand within the US. General Motors, for example,
      will invest US$2 billion to create 4000 jobs at 17 manufacturing plants in the US.

      A growing number of multinational companies, especially from high-income countries, are starting
      to see the benefits of keeping their manufacturing “at home”. For many producers, labour costs are
      a small proportion of the total cost. Also, long and complex supply chains have become unreliable
      due to changes in external factors such as the increase of oil prices, political instability and natural
      disasters such as earthquakes.

      However, Gary Pisano also argues that:
      • in some industries, such as consumer electronics, the US no longer has the necessary supply chain
      • some multinational companies will continue to build most of their new factories in emerging
        economies, where the demand is growing fastest
      • some of the new factories in the US have been financed by government subsidies, which will
        soon stop
      • in India, despite rising wages, its innovative software development and call-centre offshoring
        industries are likely to retain its cost advantages because of increasing productivity.

(Question 5 continued)

      (a)   (i)    Identify one possible variable cost of production, other than wages, that
                   a manufacturing company may face.                                           [1 mark]

            (ii)   Identify one possible fixed cost of production that a manufacturing
                   company may face.                                                           [1 mark]

            (iii) Define the term offshoring.                                                  [2 marks]
