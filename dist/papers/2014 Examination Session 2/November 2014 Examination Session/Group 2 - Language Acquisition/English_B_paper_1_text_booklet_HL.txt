       Sea Turtles

       Sea turtles are one of the Earth’s most ancient creatures. The seven species that can be
       found today have been around for 110 million years, since the time of the dinosaurs. The sea
       turtle’s shell is streamlined for swimming through the water. Unlike land turtles, sea turtles
       cannot retract their head into their shell. Their color varies between yellow, green and black
 5     depending on the species.




       [–X–]
       Sea turtles are found in all warm and temperate waters throughout the world. Most sea turtles
       go on long migrations, some as far as 1400 miles, between their feeding grounds and the
       beaches where they nest.

10     [–3–]
       Green sea turtles can stay underwater for as long as five hours even though the length of a
       feeding dive is usually five minutes or less. Their heart rate slows to conserve oxygen, and nine
       minutes may elapse between heartbeats.

       [–4–]
15     Sea turtles spend most of their lives in the water, where not much information can be gathered
       on their behavior. Most of what is known about them is obtained by observing females that
       leave the water to lay eggs. Sea turtles, like salmon, will return to the same nesting grounds
       in which they were born. When females come to the shore, they dig out a nest with their back
       flippers, bury their clutch of eggs and return to the ocean. After hatching, the young may take
20     as long as a week to dig themselves out of the nest. They emerge at night, move toward the
       ocean and remain there, solitary, until it is time to mate.

       [–5–]
       A new study has shown that endangered green turtles are swallowing more man-made debris,
       including plastic products, than ever before. This debris can ultimately kill them.

25     “We found that for green sea turtles, the likelihood that they have eaten debris has nearly
       doubled in the last 25 years,” said Qamar Schuyler from the University of Queensland, who led
       the study.

       [–6–]
       Plastic products swallowed by turtles can be lethal. Schuyler said the data showed that dead
30     turtles discovered on beaches with lots of plastic inside them were not necessarily found in
       the most polluted places.

       “So it means that they are usually eating that debris somewhere far away from where they
       end up,” she said, adding that this meant that a global response was needed to counter the
       problem. “What we really need to look at is a large scale movement to stop debris entering
35     the oceans.”

            Who
            Look at who created or uploaded the piece, whether the author can be trusted,
35          and whether it is an authoritative source or if there is a potential conflict of interest.

            When
            Check when it was published and if it is up-to-date and relevant now.

            What
            Check if the piece has a hidden agenda and if it offers more than one perspective.
40          Does it claim to be objective reporting or is it clearly a point of view? Cross-check
            the information with other sources if possible.

            Why
            Ask yourself why you are reading that medium, and consider that people tend to go
            to information sources that are in line with their own beliefs and perceptions. Try to
45          be objective and seek out other sources of information.

       Changing English
       This is an extract from an interview with
       David Crystal, who is an authority on a wide range
       of aspects dealing with language in general
       and English in particular. He is not only a
 5     highly respected academic, but through his
       books and radio programmes he has made
       clear the mysteries of English to a much
       wider audience.

       Jack Scholes: How is the internet changing the English language
10     and how do you see the future of standard English, taking into consideration
       the whole spectrum of the so-called new language created by the digital generation?

       David Crystal: It isn’t a new language. That’s one of the myths created by the media who
       have noticed an occasional new linguistic feature and have exaggerated its presence. What
       has happened is that languages have evolved new styles as a result of the internet. English has
15     styles such as blogging, texting, tweeting, instant messaging, social networking, and
       so on, which were not there before. These styles have emerged in response to particular
       technologies. They have no impact on the rest of the language. Nothing I am writing now
       shows any influence of the way I write when I blog, text, or tweet. Nor does it influence my
       speech. This has always happened. When broadcasting came along, it introduced us to
20     many new styles, such as sports commentary and news-reading. The arrival of these styles
       hasn’t made our daily speech sound like a sports commentary or a news broadcast. And it is
       the same with the internet.

       Jack Scholes: On the BBC Channel Four programme, It’s only a theory, you debunked
       several myths about text messages and successfully proved that texting is good for the English
25     language. Could you summarize your arguments?

       David Crystal: There are five main myths:


            Myth 1: texting is full of abbreviations.
            Reality: it isn’t. Only around 10 per cent of the words used in the texts are
            actually abbreviated.

30          Myth 2: the abbreviations are new, thought up by a young generation.
            Reality: they aren’t. Most of them can be traced back to origins over a
            century ago.

            Myth 3: the fact that people leave letters out shows they don’t know how
            to spell.
35          Reality: people leave letters out because it’s economical and “cool” to do
            so; but if it’s cool to leave a letter out, you have to know that it’s there in
            order to leave it out. The research shows that the best texters are actually the
            best spellers.

            Myth 4: young people are putting these abbreviations into their homework
40          and exams.
            Reality: they aren’t. Such things are hardly ever seen. And if a student did try
            to get away with such a thing, there is a fine cadre of people whose job it is
            to deal with the inappropriateness. They are called teachers.

            Myth 5: texting shows the decline of the English language.
45          Reality: on the contrary, it shows that English is alive and well, capable of
            adapting to the new demands placed upon it.

       Finally, when asked how he finds the time to write so many books, Crystal replied, “Language
       cries out for prolific treatment. It has so many aspects, all calling ‘study me’, and of course it
       is changing every day. Language never stands still. Whatever it was like yesterday, it will be
50     different tomorrow.”

                                        Mother and Daughter
         Like many ambitious women of her generation, Annie had been determined to prove
         the compatibility of motherhood and career. However, she had never broadcast it,
         and refused so many requests for photo spreads of her with her daughter Grace
         that women’s magazines stopped asking. Grace had found such a piece about a TV
 5       anchor-woman with her new baby.

         “Why didn’t we ever do this?” she asked. Annie answered that she thought it was
         immoral. Grace had continued, “I guess people think you’re younger if you make out
         you haven’t got kids.”

         This comment and the fact that it was uttered without a trace of malice had given
10       Annie such a shock that for several weeks she thought of little else than her
         relationship with Grace, or, as she now saw it, her lack of one.

         Until four years ago when she had taken her first editorship, Annie had prided herself
         that she and Grace were closer than almost any mother and daughter she could
         think of. As a celebrated journalist, more famous than many of those she wrote
15       about, her time until then had been her own. If she so chose, she could work from
         home or take days off whenever she wanted. When she travelled, she would often
         take Grace with her.

         Executive life was very different. In the strain and euphoria of transforming a stuffy,
         little-read magazine into the hottest read in town, Annie had at first refused to
20       acknowledge the toll it was taking at home. She and Grace had what she proudly
         referred to as “quality time”, but now its main quality seemed to Annie to be oppression.

         They had one hour together in the mornings when she forced the child to do her piano
         practice and two hours in the evening when she forced her to do her homework.
         Words intended as motherly guidance seemed increasingly doomed to be taken as
25       criticism.

         At weekends things were better, and the horse riding helped keep intact what fragile
         bridge there remained between them. Annie herself no longer rode but, unlike her
         husband Robert, had from her own childhood an understanding of the peculiar tribal
         world of riding and show-jumping. She enjoyed driving Grace and her horse to events.
30       But even at its best, their time together never matched the easy trust that Grace shared
         with Robert.

         It was to her father that the girl first turned, and Annie was resigned to the notion
         that history was repeating itself. She herself had been her father’s child, her mother
         unwilling or unable to see beyond the pool of golden light encircling Annie’s brother.
35       Now Annie, with no such excuse, felt herself propelled by pitiless genes to replicate
         the pattern with Grace.

            Time and Childhood
            So this is a book about not very much: about being small and getting larger slowly. One of the
            great myths of life is that childhood passes quickly. In fact, because time moves more slowly in
            Kid World – five times more slowly in a classroom on a hot afternoon, eight times more slowly
            on any car journey of over five miles, and so slowly during the last week before birthdays,
  5         Christmases and summer vacations as to be functionally immeasurable – it goes on for decades
            when measured in adult terms. It is adult life that is over in a twinkling.

            The slowest place of all in my corner of the youthful firmament was the large, cracked leather
            dental chair of Dr D K Brewster, our spooky, cadaverous dentist, while waiting for him to
            assemble his instruments and get down to business. There, time didn’t move forward at all.
10          It just hung.

            Dr Brewster was the most unnerving dentist in America. He was, for one thing, about a
            hundred and eight years old and had more than a hint of Parkinsonism in his wobbly hands.
            Nothing about him inspired confidence. He was perennially surprised by the power of his
            own equipment. “Whoa!” he’d say as he briefly enlivened some screaming device or other.
15          “You could do some damage with that, I bet!”

            Saturdays and Sundays were the longest days in Kid World. Sunday mornings alone could
            last for up to three months depending on season. In central Iowa for much of the 1950s
            there was no television at all on Sunday mornings, so generally you just sat with a bowl of
            soggy Cheerios* watching a test pattern until WOI-TV sputtered to life some time between
20          about 11.25 and noon with an episode of Sky King, starring Kirby Grant, “America’s favourite
            flying cowboy” (also its only flying cowboy). Sky was a rancher by trade, but spent most of
            the time cruising the Arizona skies in his beloved Cessna, The Songbird, spotting cattle rustlers
            and other earth-bound criminals.

            Even at six-years-old, and even in an age as intellectually undemanding as the 1950s, you
25          didn’t have to be hugely astute to see that a flying cowboy was a fairly flimsy premise for an
            action series. Sky could only capture villains who lingered at the edge of grassy landing strips
            and to whom it didn’t occur to run for it until Sky had landed, taxied to a safe halt, climbed
            down from the cockpit, assumed an authoritative stance and shouted, “OK, boys, freeze!” –
            a process that took a minute or two, for Kirby Grant was not, it must be said, in the first flush
30          of youth. In consequence, the series was cancelled after just a year.
