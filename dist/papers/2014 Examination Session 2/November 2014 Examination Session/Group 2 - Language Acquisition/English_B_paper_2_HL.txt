                                                SECTION A

Complete one of the following tasks. Write 250 to 400 words.

1.    Cultural diversity

      Your school recently organized a social event where international students cooked and presented
      samples of food from their countries. You found the range of the dishes impressive and the
      information about them interesting. Using both of these aspects, write a review of the event to be
      published in your school magazine.


2.    Customs and traditions

      Visitors to other countries are often advised to find out about the local customs in order to fit in well
      and not to give offence unintentionally. To help foreign students in your school to achieve both aims,
      write a set of guidelines about customs in your country.


3.    Health

      You feel that many students have an unbalanced diet. Write an article to be published in your school
      magazine on how this may affect their performance at school and make suggestions for improvements.


4.    Leisure

      You recently interviewed a disabled athlete who won a medal at an international sporting event,
      and you asked about his/her achievements and opinions on sport for the disabled. Write an article
      based on this interview to be published in the newsletter of your local sports club. Do not simply
      write the exact words (transcript) of the interview.


5.    Science and technology

      In order to use more renewable energy in your country, there is a plan to build a dam to provide
      electricity. However, the resulting lake would cover a village, and all the people living there would
      have to be moved. You decide to give a speech at a public meeting called to discuss the project.
      Write your speech either for or against the plan.

studied in class. Write 150 to 250 words.

6.    Many people claim that watching television is educational, but others feel it can never be more than
