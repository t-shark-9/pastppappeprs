 Online Learning
 Study at the best universities without leaving home – or paying for classes

 1.
 The internet offers more and more possibilities for online education. In open learning
 institutions like Canada’s Athabasca University and the Open University in the UK,
 you can pay to take a single course, complete a diploma or earn a university degree.
 These institutions are excellent: you can have a formal education and at the same time
 stay in the comfort of your own home. However, you can now connect directly via the
 internet with many of the best institutions and resources in the world – and they are free.

 2.

           Open Culture (openculture.com)
   This site brings together free online resources such as language lessons, e-books, university
   courses and movies. You will quickly find an introductory course to Spanish (or 39 other
   languages). You can look through hundreds of quality movies and documentaries.
   An excellent site.

           Coursera (coursera.org)
   This online site was created by two professors from Stanford and it works with top world
   universities. It offers more than 200 free courses in the arts, sciences, humanities, medicine,
   biology, social sciences, math, business and computers. Courses have specific start dates
   and include quizzes, tests and assignments, and offer certificates.

           The Khan Academy (khanacademy.org)
   This is an online school funded by philanthropists. It has more than 3500 short videos.
   The videos make you think you’re back in elementary or high school, but that is the aim.
   The classes help students to understand a key concept, from telling time to advanced
   algebra problems. It’s very strong in sciences, math and other technical subjects, but at the
   moment limited in the humanities. Interactive exercises help develop skills. It is probably
   the best resource, for any age, to get help on specific concepts and skills.

             Friendships that depend on technology
           According to a recent survey,
            two thirds of the interaction
            between friends now takes place
            electronically.     Research into
 5          modern   friendship   shows   that
            time spent in direct contact,        Image removed for copyright reasons
            talking on the phone or meeting
            a person, is much less than the
            contact through texts, emails and
10          social media. The average adult
            does 65 % of communication with
            friends and family electronically and sends 140 texts, 72 Facebook
            interactions and 40 emails a month. Half of the people who answered
            the survey had not spoken to their closest friend on the phone for
15          more than a month. They stay in contact with electronic messaging.

           A representative of the company who carried out the survey said:
            “The results show that many of us feel we depend on technology too
            much and that it’s changing our relationships. Although we are in
            more constant contact and can share and bring visual elements to our
20          conversations, the time we spend speaking on the phone or the time
            we see each other face to face is much less than in the past.”

           63 % of the 2000 adults who answered the survey say they have friends
            who only contact them via text or on Facebook. However, 66 % feel
            that online interaction does not help their friendships to develop.
25          75 % feel they do not see people face to face enough. The survey
            shows that people use the phone less and less. 33 % say that they
            do not like talking on the phone, even with friends.         However,
            80 % of people still believe that talking face to face is the best
            way to communicate if they want to thank someone or want to express
30          something sincerely.

       Volunteers needed to count whales




                                    Humpback whale


1
Lihu’e (Hawaii) – Christine Brammer, Coordinator of the Humpback Whale National Marine
Sanctuary said yesterday that volunteers are encouraged to sign up to participate in the
Ocean Count project. “We count the whales around the Hawaiian Islands and make
notes about their behavior. In this way we help to protect the humpback whales.”

Scientists say that the humpback whale population around the Hawaiian Islands has
been increasing at a 7 % annual rate because of federal protection. They now number
about 20 000.

The annual event will take place on the last Saturday in January, February and March.
Volunteers count the number of whales which can be seen during a four-hour period.
There will be 15 counting sites this year around Kauai and 60 sites around Oahu
and other Hawaiian Islands.

In order to take part in the event, Ocean Count volunteers must first be registered.
They must then attend one of two compulsory training programmes. These will take
place in the Chiefess Kamakahelei School cafeteria. Volunteers will be told what
to expect, what the duties are and what they need to bring. They will also watch a
multimedia presentation on whales.

Those who cannot take part in any volunteer activities but would like to support the
programme, can buy T-shirts made of soft organic cotton online. The design is printed in
the colors of the Pacific: blue, sky blue and black. The money from the T-shirts will go to
the National Marine Sanctuary for the Ocean Count project.

What the volunteers on the Ocean Count said last year:

– Vickie L.
The experience added to my knowledge by helping me to better understand the whales’
movements and playful swimming … it was great to see!

– Pat and Susan M.
We were in Hawaii on vacation and thought the count would be fun to do, worthwhile,
and not something we could do at home.

– Barbara F.
The final count figures help to show that the population of our humpback whales in the
Hawaiian Islands is growing.

– Andrew C.
There were moments when no whales were in sight, but those moments were rare.
