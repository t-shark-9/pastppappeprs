These marking notes give additional information for marking paper 2. When marking the paper,
keep in mind that neither subject specific knowledge nor candidates’ personal opinions, as such,
should be assessed, although Criterion B marks may be influenced by how successfully knowledge
or opinions are handled in the message.

These notes are intended to define the top mark of the scale in this examination. The phrase,
“a good answer”, is intended to refer to scripts which are likely to be placed in the 9 to 10 band
(5 for criterion C) of descriptors. Scripts should be marked proportionately lower to the degree to
which they fail to meet these requirements.

In each case, good answers will meet most, though not necessarily all, of the following requirements.

Word count

At SL, students are required to write a minimum of 250 words. Failure to write the minimum
number of words will result in a [1 mark] penalty under criterion A. There is no penalty for
exceeding 400 words: the whole text should be taken into consideration in the award of marks.

Criterion A – Language

A good answer will have few language gaps, and slips or flaws rarely affect meaning.


 Language
 Not all errors have the same importance, and examiners should bear this in mind. Some errors
 affect the communication of meaning significantly, and others do not. Also, some errors indicate a
 fundamental lack of command of the language, while others may simply indicate a moment of
 forgetfulness.
 SLIPS – mistakes at all levels of difficulty, but erratic and occasional – eg the candidate normally
 forms past tenses well, but occasionally forgets “-ed”
 FLAWS – errors occur more regularly, particularly in certain structures – eg past tenses are
 formed correctly quite often, but are not really reliable, and there may be basic confusions
 (eg past simple versus present perfect)
 GAPS – some structures are rarely correct, or simply don’t appear – eg the past tenses are needed,
 but do not appear.

1.   Cultural diversity

     You and your friends recently discussed how what the younger generation believes is
     important in life is different from what the older generation believes is important. You
     feel your ideas are of general interest. As the junior reporter for the local newspaper,
     write an article describing some of these differences and why they might exist.

     A good answer:

     Criterion B – Message
      will describe differences lucidly
      will describe reasons for why these differences might exist
      will cover both aspects: differences and reasons. If only one of the requirements is covered,
       the message should be judged as “partially communicated” (ie no more than [6 marks]
       should be awarded)
      will use paragraphing and cohesive devices which structure the development of ideas
       effectively
      may also support their ideas with examples drawn from personal experiences.

     Criterion C – Format
      will adopt a semi-formal to formal register
      will have tone appropriate for a wide audience
      will adopt a style that engages and interests readers
      will have a relevant title
      will have a distinct introduction, development and conclusion
      may also use other format features, eg name of the author, sub-headings, quotes.

2.   Customs and traditions

     Some people regard fashion as an expression of the individual, while others see it as
     conforming to a group. Your teacher has set as your next essay topic: “Is teen fashion
     just another type of uniform?” Write your essay.

     A good answer:

     Criterion B – Message
      will concentrate on teen fashion as an expression of individuality vs. conformity rather
       than fashion in general; responses that are too general should be marked down under
       “relevance”
      will develop one or both aspects: individuality and conformity
      will take a definite stance or be balanced
      will use paragraphing and cohesive devices which structure the development of ideas
       effectively
      may also cite examples, personal or derived from media.

     Criterion C – Format
      will adopt a semi-formal to formal register
      will have a distinct introduction, development and conclusion
      will use stylistic devices to enable the reader to follow the arguments easily
      will have a title
      may use the first person, provided that the focus is on the substantive issue.

3.   Health

     Your local council recently decided to start actively supporting young people who would
     like to stop smoking. You have been set the task of writing a pamphlet which will
     include information on the dangers of smoking and tips on how to give up this habit.
     Write the pamphlet.

     A good answer:

     Criterion B – Message
      will clearly introduce the purpose of the pamphlet
      will clearly explain the dangers of smoking
      will provide clear tips to encourage young people to give up this habit
      will include both information on the dangers of smoking and tips on how to give up the
       habit. If only one of the requirements is covered, the message should be judged as
       “partially communicated” (ie no more than [6 marks])
      may also list other sources from which to get additional help.

     Criterion C – Format
      will adopt an informal to semi-formal register
      will adopt a serious and encouraging tone
      will adopt an engaging style
      will incorporate elements of a pamphlet: title, bullets, sub-headings, etc
      will include a short introduction and conclusion
      may also include examples, such as personal anecdotes.

4.   Leisure

     Your local government has proposed to cut financial support to the only theatre in your
     town. The public is asked for feedback in a public hearing. You decide to go to this
     hearing to speak in support of ongoing government funding. Write the text for your
     speech.

     A good answer:

     Criterion B – Message
      will be clearly in support of ongoing government funding. If the script fails to take this
       clear position, it may achieve the 5–6 band only if the ideas that are developed are
       “coherent” with supporting details that are “mostly appropriate”
      will have a coherent and convincing argument supported
      will give clear reasons to support opinion
      will use paragraphing and cohesive devices which structure the development of ideas
       effectively
      may acknowledge the government's standpoint
      may also use personal experience effectively.

     Criterion C – Format
      will adopt a semi-formal to formal register
      will adopt a suitably serious tone
      will address the audience and keep contact with them throughout the speech (eg use of
       “we” and “you” etc)
      will consistently use effective speech rhetoric (eg rhetorical questions, repetition, flashes of
       humour)
      will set out to catch the audience’s attention at the beginning, and leave a clear impression
       at the end.
                                               –8–           N14/2/ABENG/SP2/ENG/TZ0/XX/M


5.   Science and technology

     You recently heard a news report that all scientific experiments in school laboratories
     might be replaced by virtual experiments. You decide to write a blog entry reflecting on
     how this might change your science classes and whether or not you think this would be a
     good development. Write the blog entry.

     A good answer:

     Criterion B – Message
      will clearly focus on the impact of introducing virtual experiments in school
      will discuss both possible changes to science classes and whether or not making all science
       experiments virtual is a good development. If only one of the requirements is covered, the
       message should be judged as “partially communicated” (ie no more than
       [6 marks])
      will take a definite stance or be balanced
      will support ideas with examples
      will use paragraphing and cohesive devices which structure the development of ideas
       effectively
      may also offer an opinion on whether they would support such a change or not.

     Criterion C – Format
      will adopt a semi-formal to informal register
      will have an engaging title
      will show awareness of the reader, eg through direct address, a lively and interesting style,
       an invitation for comments
      will have a closing statement to round off the entry, eg “that’s my take on it”.

     N.B. Some limited use of textese (eg 4 for four/for and u for you) and/or emoticons is
     permissible.
