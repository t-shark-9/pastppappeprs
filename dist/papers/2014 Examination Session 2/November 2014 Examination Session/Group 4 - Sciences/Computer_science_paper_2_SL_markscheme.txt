Mark Allocation

Candidates are required to answer all questions in one Option. Total 45 marks.


General

A markscheme often has more specific points worthy of a mark than the total allows. This is intentional.
Do not award more than the maximum marks allowed for that part of a question.

When deciding upon alternative answers by candidates to those given in the markscheme, consider the
following points:

          Each statement worth one point has a separate line and the end is signified by means of
           a semi-colon (;).

          An alternative answer or wording is indicated in the markscheme by a “/”; either wording can
           be accepted.

          Words in ( … ) in the markscheme are not necessary to gain the mark.

          If the candidate’s answer has the same meaning or can be clearly interpreted as being the
           same as that in the markscheme then award the mark.

          Mark positively. Give candidates credit for what they have achieved and for what they have
           got correct, rather than penalizing them for what they have not achieved or what they have
           got wrong.

          Remember that many candidates are writing in a second language; be forgiving of
           minor linguistic slips. In this subject effective communication is more important than
           grammatical accuracy.

          Occasionally, a part of a question may require a calculation whose answer is required for
           subsequent parts. If an error is made in the first part then it should be penalized. However, if
           the incorrect answer is used correctly in subsequent parts then follow through marks should
           be awarded. Indicate this with “FT”.

General guidance

 Issue          Guidance
 Answering      • In the case of an “identify” question read all answers and mark positively up to the
 more than        maximum marks. Disregard incorrect answers.
 the quantity   • In the case of a “describe” question, which asks for a certain number of facts
 of responses     eg “describe two kinds”, mark the first two correct answers. This could include two
 prescribed       descriptions, one description and one identification, or two identifications.
 in the         • In the case of an “explain” question, which asks for a specified number of
 questions        explanations eg “explain two reasons …”, mark the first two correct answers.
                  This could include two full explanations, one explanation, one partial explanation etc.

Option A — Databases

1.   (a)   (i)    An operation is one of the minimal functions that a database can perform;
                  While a transaction may consist of multiple operations;
                  For example a withdrawal might consist of a query to determine the account
                  balance followed by a second query to reduce the account balance;          [3 marks]

           (ii)   If the transaction could not be completed successfully;                     [1 mark]

           (iii) Returns the database to the state before the transaction was started;        [1 mark]

     (b)   Award [1 mark] each for identifying two reasons, up to [2 marks max].
           Award [1 mark] each for an elaboration that goes beyond simply identifying
           reasons, up to [2 marks max].

           Example:
           A database engine provides standardized support for operations such as queries;
           It has built-in capabilities for ensuring that transactions succeed;
           Easy to sort/retrieve/analyse data;
           No redundant data / no data entered twice;
           This greatly reduces development time by providing a common platform that
           developers can reuse in multiple projects;                                      [4 marks]

     (c)   Award up to [2 marks max] each for validation and verification, for a total of
           [4 marks max]. Award [1 mark] for correctly defining the term and [1 mark] for
           an example.

           Example:
           Validation is making sure that the value entered is of the correct type;
           For example, the user entered a currency value to deposit and not a date;
           Verification is getting confirmation that the value entered is the one intended;
           For example, making the user enter the deposit amount twice and ensuring that the
           entries match;                                                                    [4 marks]

     (d)   Isolation refers to the property of having transactions that are performed at the
           same time, produce the same results as if they were performed sequentially;
           In either order;
           For example, a deposit of $10 and a withdrawal of $50 should result in the
           account balance being decreased by $40, regardless of the order or simultaneity of
           the two transactions;                                                              [3 marks]
                                                  –5–               N14/4/COMSC/SP2/ENG/TZ0/XX/M


2.   (a)   Size: integer;
           Price: float;
           Maker: String;
           Accept reasonable alternatives, eg size could be float or price could be integer.    [3 marks]

     (b)   Creation of a database;
           Manipulation of the database;
           Interrogation of the database;                                                       [3 marks]

     (c)   Award up to [2 marks] for each security feature, up to [4 marks max]. For each
           feature, award [1 mark] for identifying the feature and [1 mark] for further
           elaboration.

           Example:
           Data Validation;
           Ensuring that only data of the correct type is stored in the database: No dates in
           the balance column, for example;

           Access Rights;
           Ensuring that users can only access data to which they are authorized: Customer A
           cannot access Customer B’s data, for example;

           Data Locking;
           Preventing data values from being accessed by a transaction while another
           transaction involving the same data is in progress;                       [4 marks]

     (d)   Award up to [2 marks max].
           A data dictionary describes the data in a database;
           Its meaning;
           Its format;
           Its relationship to other data;                                                      [2 marks]

     (e)   Award up to [3 marks max].
           The data model is the “blueprint” for the physical database;
           Ensure that all data objects required are identified;
           Ensure that all data objects are accurately specified;
           Provide a description of the database that can be understood/reviewed by
           customers/end-users;                                                     [3 marks]

3.   (a)   Award up to [2 marks max].
           A normalized database is one which minimizes/reduces/eliminates redundancies;
           And/or dependencies;
           So that manipulation of a field only needs to be performed in one table;          [2 marks]

     (b)   Award up to [2 marks max].
           Redundant data in a database wastes space;
           Creates the potential for inconsistency;
           Requires extra work to keep updated;                                              [2 marks]

                 The Book column in the Shelf table will be duplicative and/or not atomic;
                 The Shelf column in the Bookcase table will be duplicative and/or
                 not atomic;                                                                 [1 mark]

      (ii)   Award up to [3 marks max].
             Group the related data into a table;
             For example, make a Shelving table with Booktitle, ShelfNumber, and
             BookcaseNumber rows;
             Remove subsets of data that apply to multiple rows in a table;
             For example, CustomerName will duplicate the name of a repeat customer
             for each transaction;                                                  [3 marks]

(e)   Award [1 mark] for identifying an issue. Award an additional [2 marks] for
      discussion.
      Customer information might be made available;
      Police could identify suspicious reading/purchasing habits;
      This may represent a breach of the customer’s privacy;
      The information may prove unreliable;                                      [3 marks]

Option B — Modelling and simulation

4.   (a)   50 ×1.5 = 75 mg ;                                                                 [1 mark]

     (b)   Award [1 mark] for the variables and [1 mark] for the calculation.
           Variables: age, weight, amount;
           Calculation: (total amount) = (weight) × (amount per kg for their age group);     [2 marks]

     (c)   Award marks as follows, up to [4 marks max].
           Award [1 mark] for correct inputs.
           Award [1 mark] for calculating amount.
           Award [1 mark] for correct day loop.
           Award [1 mark] for correct time loop.

           Example:
           input weight, age
           calculate amount
           output amount, “to be taken at these times”
           loop day from 1 to 10
                output day
                loop time from 0 to 2
                     output 8 + time*8
                end loop
           end loop                                                                          [4 marks]

     (d)   (i)   Award [2 marks] for describing how the software is used and [2 marks] for
                 correct calculations. Spreadsheet is most likely to be used (the only one
                 compulsory in the guide) but accept any suitable software reference.

                 Example: (using a spreadsheet, description or illustration)
                 Construct column headings to show dose number (day and time) and
                 amount of dose given (calculated from age and weight);
                 Amount in blood at the moment in one (last) column;
                 First dose entered is the first amount;
                 From second dose onwards;
                 (amount) = (first dose) + (0.2 × (previous amount));
                 Copy down to last dose;

                  Dose #                   Dose Given                Amount in Blood
                  1                        D                         = B2
                  2                        D                         =B2+0.2*C2
                  3                        D                         (copy down)
                  4                        D                         etc.

                 Example: (using Insightmaker.com – a free simulation download)
                 Set [initial] to dose calculated from weight and age;
                 Set variable [amount] to initial dose;
                 Set equation to [initial] + 0.2*[amount];
                 Number of simulations = 29 (accept 30);
                 Run simulation to see graph or table of amounts;                            [4 marks]

           (ii)   Award [1 mark max].
                  Input errors that could occur are age category and weight.

                  Example:
                  If input age was not within the categories due to mistyping then no dose
                  would be given;
                  If weight was wrongly measured or rounded then the wrong dose could
                  be given;                                                                     [1 mark]

           (iii) By measuring medicine levels in the blood at each dosage;
                 And calculating/checking with the results expected from software;
                 Errors in the input or in the model can be identified;                         [3 marks]


5.   (a)   Input the current population. For each successive year, multiply the previous year
           by 1.07 / increase by 7 % ;                                                          [1 mark]

     (b)   Award up to [3 marks max].
           Change in birth rate;
           Change in death rate;
           Immigration;
           Emigration;                                                                          [3 marks]

     (c)   Award up to [3 marks max]. Award [1 mark] for each of the factors included in a
           logical way.

           Example:
           Build up percentage change from rise in birth rate;
           (Use previous trend figures to change the birth rate over the 10 years;)
           Minus the death rate;
           (Use previous trend figures to change the death rate over the 10 years;)
           Seen from registry;
           Immigration – most difficult to predict but could work on figures in similar new
           towns to give an average number/percentage rise;
           Any planned new factories/companies or known redundancies could be factored
           into immigration/emigration;                                                     [3 marks]

     (d)   Award [2 marks] for each source of inaccuracy which is discussed, up to
           [4 marks max]. A list of four or more which are not elaborated should get no
           more than [3 marks max].

           Example:
           This method assumes that the change in population can be expressed as a
           combination of factors listed above;
           But there are many other factors that have not been included such as economic
           climate of the country;
           It also assumes a ten year span can be calculated on past figures;
           Whereas a new town has different population patterns from an established one;
           For example the early years could see an influx which stops after a short while/or
           the opposite – takes time to get established;                                      [4 marks]

     (e)   Award [1 mark] for each consequence identified and [1 mark] for a description,
           up to [4 marks max].

           Example:
           Predicted population is used to build schools/hospitals;
           If the population is far greater there will not be enough services – if it is smaller
           then too much money will have been invested and the community could have
           economic problems;                                                                    [4 marks]

8.   (a)   In the HITS algorithm the page is ranked on a combination of its importance as a
           hub and an authority;
           Its value as an authority will depend upon the ranking of the in-links (pages
           pointing to it);
           Its value as a hub will depend upon the ranking of the out-links;
           So if high profile scientific magazines (eg Nature, Science) have more links to one
           of these magazines than the other, the page rankings will be different (or similar);
           Only award the fourth mark if an example in context (last point above) is given.     [4 marks]

     (c)   This can happen as a result of browsing history being recorded;
           For example, the search term “Paris Hilton” for a businessman who travels
           frequently might produce hotel links;
           Whilst someone who regularly accesses society magazines might be linked with
           the website of this celebrity;

           (ii)   As access to resources is through the browser;
                  The user will need to have internet access (Wi-Fi) in order to use (most)
                  resources;
                  The user will not be able to use their favourite software;

           measure.

           Examples:
           Theses of university students;
           Sites exist such as Turnitin which crosscheck a submitted essay with a database of
           previously written essays;
           This will return a statistical evaluation of the authenticity of the submitted piece;
           This will generally find examples of plagiarism although it is generally only
           successful for essays written in the English language;
           Music;
           Some countries now track the movements on peer-2-peer networks to identify
           individual offenders;
           The number of prosecutions is low, but the publicity may be an important
           deterrent;
           Illegal downloading still exists extensively, but at the same time record number of
           legal downloads are taking place, suggesting that an “acceptable” balance may
           exist;                                                                                [4 marks]

            Polymorphism allows an external program to use the same method action on all
            subclasses;
            By allowing overridden functions in child classes to add only the code that is
            needed for the unique processing of that sub-class;
            In this example, the getWeight() method returns the weight of each piece of
            RollingStock. In the case of a wagon, the additional computation needed to add
            the weight of the cargo is added;                                              [3 marks]

            User Interfaces, etc;
            Information hiding can be used to reduce module dependencies;
            Different programmers can work on different classes independently because the
            internals of those classes are hidden;
