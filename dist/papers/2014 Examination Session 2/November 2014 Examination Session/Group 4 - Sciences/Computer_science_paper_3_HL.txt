Answer all questions.

1.    Define the following two attacks.

      (a)   zero-day                                                                              [2 marks]

2.    (a)   Describe the role of Botnets in the successful execution of a DDoS
            (Distributed Denial of Service) attack.                                               [4 marks]

      (b)   Explain two advantages of using a proxy server as part of a school network that
            accesses the internet.                                                                [4 marks]


3.    Susan Woo considers social networking to be an area that will see an increase in attacks
      by cyber-criminals.

      With reference to different forms of social networking, explain why Susan Woo
      considers this area to be a threat to the security of major companies.                      [6 marks]


4.    With the change in the threat landscape over the last few years, Western Heights
      has reviewed its approach to network security.   They have changed from using
      signature-based firewalls on the network perimeter to a much more comprehensive
      system of prevention and monitoring, with the aim of minimizing threats to
      the organization.

      By focussing on innovations in software and hardware, discuss how the security
      systems of Western Heights have changed in order to minimize the threats coming
      from outside of the organization.                                                          [12 marks]
