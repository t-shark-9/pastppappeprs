General Marking Instructions

 Assistant Examiners (AEs) will be contacted by their team leader (TL) through Scoris™, by e-mail
 or telephone – if through Scoris™ or by e-mail, please reply to confirm that you have downloaded
 the markscheme from IBIS. The purpose of this initial contact is to allow AEs to raise any queries
 they have regarding the markscheme and its interpretation. AEs should contact their team leader
 through Scoris™ or by e-mail at any time if they have any problems/queries regarding marking.
 For any queries regarding the use of Scoris™, please contact emarking@ibo.org.
                                                  –4–             N14/4/ENVSO/SP2/ENG/TZ0/XX/M


1.   Follow the markscheme provided, award only whole marks and mark only in RED.

2.   Make sure that the question you are about to mark is highlighted in the mark panel on the
     right-hand side of the screen.

3.   Where a mark is awarded, a tick/check () must be placed in the text at the precise point where it
     becomes clear that the candidate deserves the mark. One tick to be shown for each mark awarded.

4.   Sometimes, careful consideration is required to decide whether or not to award a mark. In these
     cases use RM Assessor™ annotations to support your decision. You are encouraged to write
     comments where it helps clarity, especially for re-marking purposes. Use a text box for these
     additional comments. It should be remembered that the script may be returned to the candidate.

5.   Personal codes/notations are unacceptable.

6.   Where an answer to a part question is worth no marks but the candidate has attempted the
     part question, enter a zero in the mark panel on the right-hand side of the screen. Where an answer
     to a part question is worth no marks because the candidate has not attempted the part question,
     enter an “NR” in the mark panel on the right-hand side of the screen.

7.   If a candidate has attempted more than the required number of questions within a paper or section
     of a paper, mark all the answers. RM Assessor™ will only award the highest mark or marks in line
     with the rubric.

8.   Ensure that you have viewed every page including any additional sheets. Please ensure that you
     stamp ‘seen’ on any page that contains no other annotation.

9.   Mark positively. Give candidates credit for what they have achieved and for what they have
     got correct, rather than penalizing them for what they have got wrong. However, a mark should not
     be awarded where there is contradiction within an answer. Make a comment to this effect using a
     text box or the “CON” stamp.

Subject Details: Environmental Systems and Societies SLP2 Markscheme
Mark Allocation

Candidates are required to answer ALL questions in Section A [25 marks] and TWO questions in
Section B [40 marks]. Maximum total = [65 marks].


1.    A markscheme often has more marking points than the total allows. This is intentional.

2.    Each marking point has a separate line and the end is shown by means of a semicolon (;).

3.    An alternative answer or wording is indicated in the markscheme by a slash (/). Either wording can
      be accepted.

4.    Words in brackets ( ) in the markscheme are not necessary to gain the mark.

5.    Words that are underlined are essential for the mark.

6.    The order of marking points does not have to be as in the markscheme, unless stated otherwise.

7.    If the candidate’s answer has the same “meaning” or can be clearly interpreted as being of
      equivalent significance, detail and validity as that in the markscheme then award the mark.
      Where this point is considered to be particularly relevant in a question it is emphasized by
      OWTTE (or words to that effect).

8.    Remember that many candidates are writing in a second language. Effective communication is
      more important than grammatical accuracy.

9.    Occasionally, a part of a question may require an answer that is required for subsequent
      marking points. If an error is made in the first marking point then it should be penalized. However,
      if the incorrect answer is used correctly in subsequent marking points then follow through marks
      should be awarded. When marking, indicate this by adding ECF (error carried forward) on the
      script.

10.   Do not penalize candidates for errors in units or significant figures, unless it is specifically referred
      to in the markscheme.

      (ii)   They are positively correlated (as oil production increases so does the GDP).
             (OWTTE);                                                                             [1]

(e)   (A biodiversity hotspot is a biogeographic region that is both a significant
      reservoir of biodiversity and is threatened with destruction), the Niger Delta
      swamp is threatened by oil production;
      populations isolated in swamps allow for speciation/many endemic species to
      occur;
      many different habitats/niches / habitat diversity (eg Pools/forests
      /islands/mangroves/river);
      mangroves have high diversity as they are at the interface of land and sea;
      high temperatures and high precipitation all year round so constant growth;             [2 max]

(f)   nitrous/nitrogen oxides/sulphur dioxide are released (when gas is burned);
      combine with rainfall and become nitric acid/sulphuric acid;
      or deposited directly as dry deposition;                                                [2 max]

(g)   delta is low lying so more likely to be flooded as sea levels rise;
      removal of mangroves removes coastal protection and increase sea level causes
      more damage/increased/larger storms impact coast more;
      high level of poverty/low development so people are vulnerable/not very resilient
      to increased climate disasters eg floods/large storms;
      already tensions/conflict in the area so tensions could easily increase as flooding
      occurs/land is lost to flooding;
      resources are already being used unsustainably/shortages of resources for example
      salt intrusion of drinking water;
      agricultural land too close to the sea coast, so more vulnerable to (potential) salt
      water inundation / loss of food crops;
      global warming will compound other environmental problems eg oil
      pollution/deforestation/acid deposition;
      high population density so large numbers of people to be affected by any changes
      in the delta’s sea level;
      this region will be prone to fatal tropical diseases such as Malaria that will spread
      more rapidly with GW;
      social unrest/stress as the traditional worship species may be lost as they cannot
      adapt to changes due to global warming (eg too hot/too much salt water);
      any severe degradation to the land or drying of river due to GW may be
      considered as divine punishment and lead to panic/psychological
      stress/tensions/upheavals due to religious reasons;
      the river may dry up and so will the supply of freshwater/loss of freshwater supply
      (due to river drying up) will be devastating as people directly depend on the river
      water for drinking / have no established water network infrastructure;
      lack of preventive infrastructure would exacerbate any issue caused by GW eg
      flooding / drying of rivers / coastal erosion;
       Valid responses should address issues that would be "particularly bad" for
      people in this area ...not just generally bad effects of GW e.g. no mark for "GW
      may increase spread of disease" but 1 mark for "this region will be prone to fatal
      tropical diseases that will spread more rapidly with GW"
      The candidates are not expected to have a detailed knowledge of the Niger Delta,
      so answers should indicate how GW effects are exacerbated by local features eg

      geographical    (delta/coastal/tropical),   or   cultural   (LEDC/poverty/religious
      values);                                                                                 [3 max]

(h)   they feel strongly about the land because of their spiritual connections to it/this is
      the only homeland they have / Ogoni people don’t wish to live lavishly so they
      don’t care to exploit the oil / their tradition is ecocentric so fight for their land;
      they are organized into a pressure group/NGO which has more power than an
      individual;
      their campaign was non-violent and therefore did not alienate people;
      Ken Saro-Wiwa execution raised their profile/caught media attention;
      their land has been particularly badly affected so most of the Ogoni were
      affected/so consensus was reached in campaigning;
      UNEP report raised awareness about the issues they faced leading to recognition
      of the campaign / leading to awarding of $1 billion (US) for clean-up;
      they have been campaigning for over 20 years/since 1990/a long-running
      campaign of over 20 years/since 1990 means continual pressure on the companies
      and local continued involvement;                                                         [3 max]

(i)   it is a very expensive process, Nigeria/Ogoniland is poor/marginalized;
      TNCs are very powerful/may refuse to pay/already refuse to pay fines for
      polluting;
      high levels of conflict/tension in the area so a distrust of government clean-up/oil
      industry clean-up;
      not clear that the Government in Nigeria will take action on pollution as oil
      companies already do not follow guidelines / political resistance to conservation
      efforts / possible corruption involved;
      evidence that TNCs are not abiding by minimum standards as areas cleaned by the
      firms are still contaminated;
      little history of protection/conservation in the Delta/there is no large scale formal
      protection there / data on biodiversity to save is little;
      scale/extent of the pollution problem is huge / the area affected is vast
      (70000km2);
      it is one of the five most polluted spots on Earth/ 1.5 million tonnes of oil spilt in
      50 years;
      soil contamination is 5m deep so difficult to clean up / oil is microscopic/widely
      dispersed making clean up complex;
      It will be difficult to regrow mangrove areas;
      low level of development/education and poverty of local people leads to increased
      pressure on resources / people will still fish/harvest timber to satisfy short term
      needs;
      Accept other reasonable responses of equivalent validity, relevance and
      significance.                                                                            [4 max]

(j)   that more attention was paid to the smaller spill in the Gulf of Mexico/America
      than to the bigger pollution issue/spill in West Africa / that Africa is wondering
      why Americans are so concerned over a much smaller issue / that the spills in
      West Africa are a much bigger problem than the BP oil spill in the US;
      America’s eyebrows/expression suggest Western society/America is
      shocked/concerned/screaming at pollution nearby, when there are much greater
      concerns further away/in LEDCs;
      Africa’s eyes/expression suggest they may be more resigned/undisturbed by their
      pollution (perhaps because of more pressing issues of survival);
      Africa is wondering why such attention is not paid to their pollution issue too;
      The question mark may suggest Africa/everyone is relatively unaware of the
      pollution in Africa / there is no easy solution to the issue;                        [2 max]

     General Essay Markscheme
     Each essay is marked out of [20] of which [2] are for clarity of expression, structure and development
     of ideas.
             [0] Quality of expression, structure and development is poor.
             [1] Quality of expression, structure and development is limited.
             [2] Quality of expression is clear, structure is good and ideas are well developed.

     Candidates can use bullet-pointed lists in responses where these are appropriate eg for questions
     using command terms such as state and identify. However, for command terms such as discuss,
     compare and contrast, explain and evaluate, bullet points alone, without any evidence of a
     developed, logical line of reasoning, could gain no credit for EoI.



2.     (a)     Award [1 max] for definition and [1 max] for example of each. NB: Credit may
               be given for definition where the key concept is explicitly identified within the
               example. Please add a comment on the work if you give credit in this manner.

               Negative feedback:
               Definition:
               Feedback that tends to damp down/neutralize/counteract/self-regulate any
               deviation from an equilibrium/promote stability; [1 max]
               examples:
               eg increased global temperatures cause more evaporation/cloud cover that reduces
               input of solar radiation thus decreasing temperatures;
               eg increase in predator population increases consumption of prey reducing food
               available for predators thus decreasing predator population; [1 max]

               Positive feedback:
               Definition:
               Feedback that amplifies/increases change / leads to exponential deviation away
               from an equilibrium; [1 max]
               examples:
               eg increased global temperatures cause melting/shrinking of ice sheets reducing
               albedo/reflected energy thus further increasing global temperatures;
               eg    melting     permafrost    releases    methane      that  increases   global
               warming/temperatures thus further increasing the melting of permafrost; [1 max]

               NB: Valid examples must link a change in a named factor to the subsequent
               reversal/acceleration of change in that same factor.
               Do not accept non-environmental system examples such as blood temperature or
               thermostat regulation.                                                                [4 max]

(b)   Award [1 max] for each of three valid policies; and [1 max] for a valid
      explanation of each policy named

      development policy:
      Increased education/empowerment for women; [1 max]
      explanation:
      evidence shows that the longer females stay in school, the lower their fertility rate;
      women have more choice and are able to make informed decisions about having
      children; [1 max]

      development policy:
      Increased education about contraception/birth control/family planning; [1 max]
      explanation:
      as people learn more about the ranges of contraception then more likely to choose
      to use them and reduce fertility rate;
      as people learn about child spacing and the benefits to mother/child health of
      smaller families the fertility rate will reduce; [1 max]

      development policy:
      Increased access to free/cheap contraception; [1 max]
      explanation:
      greater availability/access to contraception (particularly in rural areas) gives
      greater choice to reduce fertility; [1 max]

      development policy:
      Improved sanitation / access to clean water; [1 max]
      explanation:
      improving sanitation / access to clean water decreases avoidable childhood deaths
      (due to gastrointestinal problems) from contaminated water, which then leads to
      decreased CBR; [1 max]

      development policy:
      Increased healthcare; [1 max]
      explanation:
      vaccination programmes reducing child deaths/more doctors/nurses/clinics so
      illness and disease can be treated early to reduce infant mortality leads to reducing
      CDR which then leads to decreased CBR;
      eg Access to smoke-free cooking in homes so reducing deaths which then leads to
      decreased CBR;
      eg Improved nutrition for children by educated mothers so reducing deaths which
      then leads to decreased CBR;
      eg Mothers can read instructions on medication so reducing child deaths which
      then leads to decreased CBR; [1 max]

      development policy:
      Government fertility/anti-natal policies eg one child policy in China / tax on more
      children; [1 max]
      explanation:

development policy:
Empowerment of landless and marginal people; [1 max]
explanation:
evidence has shown that giving landless and marginal people more power and
choice in their lives successfully reduces fertility in these populations; [1 max]

development policy:
Improved cooperation / transfer of technology / transfer of funds,
between MEDCs and LEDCs / Sustainable development; [1 max]
explanation:
improved economy provides funds for education and workforce opportunities
away from agriculture, moving away from agrarian society and less need for
children to support family; [1 max]

(c)   Arguments supporting claim:
      Ecological/ecosystems: vegetarian means eating at the first trophic
      level/producers/plants;
      second law of thermodynamics explains that energy is lost at each transfer as heat;
      so reducing the length of food chains, reduces energy loss/maximizes efficiency
      (of energy transfer);
      less land area/water is needed when only first trophic level is consumed / lower
      ecological footprint / when animals are consumed more land/water is needed
      (for same quantity of food) / higher ecological footprint;
      less land being used for agriculture means less loss of biodiversity/environmental
      degradation;
      meat production results in large amounts of greenhouse gases being
      released/global warming;
      ecocentrics may support vegetarianism as it may reduce exploitation of
      resources/may attribute greater intrinsic value to animals;
      ecocentrics support self-sufficiency which is more easily supported in an
      urbanized environment through growing vegetables rather than managing
      livestock;

      Counterarguments:
      Ecological/ecosystems: some livestock eat on pastures where human food crops
      cannot grow, so can be environmentally sound eg goats and sheep;
      vegetarianism may be worse in some locations if supply requires long-distance
      transport/high food miles;
      some animals eat the leftovers/peelings of human food production eg pigs and
      chickens reducing waste;
      open water fish farming and wild fish harvesting can be practised sustainably
      providing better quality protein/without increasing land use;
      technocentrics believe that humans are ingenious and could resolve impacts of
      meat production through technology;
      eg genetically modified cattle/cattle feed to produce fewer greenhouse gases /
      laboratory-grown meat / harvesting of insect protein;
      cornucopians would believe that whatever resources (meat or vegetable) are
      available are valid for human exploitation;

3.   (a)   Award [2 max] for each pyramid type
           pyramid of numbers:
           displays the numbers of individuals/population size at each trophic level of a food
           chain/ecosystem;
           may differ greatly in shape / may be inverted (depending on eg size of
           organisms/time of year/reproductive strategies);
           represents storages;
           represents quantities present at a given moment/snapshot in time; [2 max]

           pyramid of productivity:
           represents the gain in biomass/flow of energy at each level;

     (b)   Award [1 max] for each of three strategies and [1 max] for accompanying
           explanation:

           Strategy:
           use organic fertilizers/manure/animal waste on agricultural fields;
           Explanation:
           this should reduce runoff/amounts of nitrates/phosphates;

           Strategy:
           legislate in favor of organic farming, / setting water quality standards;
           Explanation:
           would prevent unsustainable/polluting practices / overuse of agrochemicals;

           Strategy:
           legislate for/encourage restraint in use of artificial fertilizers/phosphate-rich
           detergents;
           Explanation:
           this will reduce quantity of nitrates/phosphates released into environment;

           Strategy:
           practice mixed cropping/crop rotation;
           Explanation:
           this will reduce the need for artificial fertilizers;

           Strategy:
           planting buffer zones around agricultural fields;
           Explanation:
           This helps absorb the excess nitrates/phosphates before they reach water bodies;

           Strategy:
           effective sewage treatment of urban waste;

Explanation:
this removes the excess phosphates and nitrates from the sewage before it reaches
the water bodies;

Strategy:
safe collection of slurry from livestock farms;
Explanation:
prevent nitrates/phosphates from reaching water bodies/this will reduce
concentrations of nitrates/phosphates in water bodies;

Strategy:
control application of fertilizers to times/seasons where run-off will be minimum;
Explanation:
this will reduce quantity of nitrates/phosphates entering water bodies;

Strategy:
mud-pumping/removal of nutrient-rich sediment/bottom sediment from affected
water bodies;
Explanation:
this will prevent ongoing release of nutrients/eutrophication;

Strategy:
introduce surface plants to take up excess nutrients;
Explanation:
this will reduce quantity of nitrates/phosphates in the water bodies;

(c)   Outline of impacts:
      Award [3 max] if examples are not specifically named
      Example 1: eg intensive wheat/corn production in USA:
      using large quantities of herbicide/pesticides/agrochemicals reduces the
      biodiversity in surrounding areas/locally / eg may kill off many useful insects;
      agrochemicals         may         affect       top     predators/birds        through
      biomagnification/bioaccumulation / will intoxicate soils / kill soil invertebrates;
      using a GMO (genetically modified organism) crop (eg Bt corn) reduces
      biodiversity;
      heavy use of artificial/inorganic fertilisers may cause eutrophication of local water
      bodies;
      use of agrochemicals/over-cultivation/heavy machinery may lead to loss of soil
      quality/compaction/salinization/toxification;
      heavy irrigation/use of agrochemicals may lead to depletion/pollution of
      aquifers/water reservoirs;
      irrigation/leaving fields bare after harvesting may lead to soil erosion; [2 max]

      Example 2: eg cattle farming in Brazil:
      land clearance/deforestation of tropical rainforest/cerrado vegetation results in
      loss of habitat/biodiversity / reduces a major global carbon sink/storage increasing
      global warming;
      use of agrochemicals/pesticides/antibiotics leads to pollution of local habitats/loss
      of biodiversity;
      displacement of indigenous people and their way of life reduces stewardship of
      local environment;
      deforestation and overgrazing of the cattle increases soil erosion/desertification;
      methane production by cattle contributes to global warming; [2 max]

      Counterarguments and balancing factors relating to either or both systems:
      impacts of inorganic fertilisers can be reduced/prevented by use of buffer zones;
      use of agrochemicals/GM/intensive technology can increase yields per area
      reducing land required for food production;
      drip irrigation technology can be used on a commercial scale to reduce water
      consumption;
      GMO crops may be pest-resistant reducing need for pesticides;
      crop-farming is ecologically more efficient than meat production (cattle farming);
      cattle farming on Brazil has greater global impact than wheat farming in USA
      through its significant contribution to global warming;
      tropical rainforest has particularly high biodiversity and so deforestation there
      causes a greater biodiversity loss; [4 max]

      Award [1 max] for an explicit and valid conclusion.

      Alternative points of equivalent validity, significance and relevance to those given,
      should be credited.

4.   (a)   natural selection leads to survival of the fittest;
           leading to adaptation of species/populations to new environmental conditions;
           isolation occurs when members of a population are prevented from interbreeding
           due to geographical barriers / eg, mountain formations/continental drift/island
           formation;
           isolation occurs when members of a population are prevented from interbreeding
           due to reproductive barriers / eg behavioural/seasonal/ecological/mechanical
           differences/incompatibilities;
           the isolated groups within the population may then be subject to different selective
           pressures/natural selection;
           so that the separate groups evolve increasingly different characteristics and
           become unable to reproduce fertile offspring between them;
           in this way natural selection can lead to formation of new species/speciation;
           award [1 max] for a good example of natural selection due to isolation                 [4 max]

(b)   energy enters (most) ecosystems from the sun / energy enters (some) ecosystems
      from geothermal vents;
      plants/(archae)bacteria/autotrophs      convert      this        energy    into
      biomass/glucose/chemical energy / plants use photosynthesis to convert light
      energy into chemical energy;
      energy is transferred from the autotrophs to consumers by
      feeding/consumption/food chain;
      energy is lost as heat (entropy) in respiration (as it is transferred along a
      food chain);
      this heat is transferred to atmosphere where it is absorbed/reflected back to
      earth/lost to space;
      this illustrates the second law of thermodynamics(–increasing entropy in a
      system);
      only 10% of the available energy in one trophic level is passed onto the
      next/higher trophic level;
      chemical energy is transferred to decomposers via waste / death;                  [4 max]

      award up to [2 max] for a diagram which shows at least producers, consumers
      and decomposers with flows going the right direction (accept
      plant/herbivore/carnivore/detritivore or named examples of each);
      an energy source (sun/geothermal) and losses (heat / decomposers);

(c)   Why it is endangered [5 max]. Award [3 max] if only one of the following
      categories is addressed:
      eg Tiger

      Biological/ecological factors:
      as a top carnivore it requires a large ecosystem/food production base / typically
      having relatively low population size;
      as a mammal with relatively long gestation/low reproduction rate population
      growth is slow;

      Human activities:
      direct killing/hunting/poaching by humans / invasive predator leads to reduction
      in population;
      fragmentation of habitat through human land use leads to lack of gene
      flow/inbreeding/low genetic diversity;
      loss of habitat/prey species through pollution/hunting/habitat disturbance leads to
      increased competition for resources eg prey/shelter/mates;

      Conservation difficulties:
      tiger habitat may cross national boundaries making cooperative
      management/international protection agreements difficult;
      protection undermined by corruption/black market demand for tiger parts;
      low employment may promote poaching / local poverty limits effectiveness of
      enforcement/protection;

      Why it should be preserved [5 max]. Award [3 max] if only two or fewer of the
      following categories are addressed:

      Ethical reasons:
      because it has intrinsic value/biorights / humans have no rights to destroy species;
      many religions/local cultures attach particular spiritual/cultural significance to the
      tiger;
      …although not all cultures/value systems will acknowledge spiritual/intrinsic
      values;
      we owe it to future generations to pass on the same environmental heritage we
      received;

      Economic reasons:
      each species in ecosystem contributes to the overall natural capital/sustainable
      resources/goods and services the system provides;
      tigers provide a significant source of income from ecotourism;

      Aesthetic reasons:
      tigers are beautiful/unique/interesting and make the world more pleasurable;
      all species add to the diversity/quality of human experience;

      Ecological reasons:
      as top carnivores, tigers have an important role in maintain balances within their
      ecosystem / may be a keystone/umbrella species;
      all species add to the diversity of a system, making it more stable/resistant to
      change;

Reasons for other species may also include:
genetic variation in plant and animal species provides the means for sustaining
and improving production in farms, forestry, animal husbandry and fisheries;
many organisms contain chemicals which may be of medical or commercial
value;

5.   (a)   fossil record extinctions occurred over relatively long timescales / over thousands
           to hundreds of thousands of years;
           present day extinctions occurring over relatively short timescales /
           decades/hundreds of years;
           extinctions within historic period largely attributable to anthropogenic / human
           causes eg over hunting / habitat loss / pollution / climate change;
           past mass extinctions are linked to natural causes / eg meteorite impact / ice ages /
           extreme volcanic activity / changes in atmospheric composition;
           current extinction is being more accurately recorded whereas in the past
           extinctions it is hard to see/identify species from fossils;

           Award [1 max] for a named example or time of a mass extinction, eg K-T
           boundary (dinosaurs) / Triassic / Permian / Devonian / Ordovician;

           Award [1 max] for a named example of a present day organism that has gone
           extinct due to human causes
           eg Passenger pigeon;

           Award [2 max] if only the fossil extinctions or only the recent extinctions are

     (b)   Explanation of models:
           models are simplified representations of natural systems that enable predictions
           for change based on pre-existing data;
           climate models are mathematical formulae/computer programmes that
           scientists/IPCC use to predict future changes in climate based on historic climatic
           data; [1 max]

           Strengths:
           provides information/range of scenarios to policy/decision makers;
           allows predictions/extrapolations to be made based on wide input of historic data;
           large quantities of data (from a variety of sources) can provide statistical certainty
           to predictions;
           can provide relatively objective information to political/emotional/contentious
           issues;
           can lead to greater understanding of complex relationships between environmental
           factors;
           visualizes projected effects / eg images of projected changes in global average
           temperatures;
           shows that some regions are more vulnerable than others / eg poles might undergo
           higher temperature increase than the Tropics;

           Limitations:
           conflicting results from different models can lead to uncertainty/confusion for
           policy/decision makers;
           …and enable politicians to pick those that are most supportive to their cause;
           approximations/simplifications are necessary and lead to uncertainties;
           only a few experts/not all policy/decision-makers will fully understand the
           statistical limitations/reliability/application of models;
           data used may be inaccurate as in-depth recordings have only been made recently;
                                     – 23 –            N14/4/ENVSO/SP2/ENG/TZ0/XX/M


data comes from many sources and instrumentation/methodologies may not be
consistent/compatible;
models generally rely on assumptions that factors will operate in the way they
have historically which may not always be valid;

Appraisal: Award [1 max] for a clear appraisal that is consistent with argument
of response.
eg while models have significant limitations they are the best available means of
planning appropriately for the future;
eg there is so much political manipulation in the current use of models that they
are of very limited value;
[5 max] if no clear appraisal regarding relative strengths or weaknesses:
[3 max] if only strengths or only limitations are discussed.

(c)   Award [2 max] for clear definitions of the two chosen EVS.

      Definition:
      eg Ecocentric viewpoint is a nature-centred viewpoint with a minimum
      disturbance to the natural world;
      anthropocentric viewpoint is a people-centred viewpoint with strong regulations
      about the environment;
      technocentric viewpoint is a technology centred viewpoint with a strong emphasis
      on scientific analysis/market structures;
      (accept equivalent definitions for their chosen value systems eg. deep ecologists /
      soft ecologists / environmental managers / cornucopians)

      Responses should identify effects of GW on the Tundra and the responses to this
      effect of two different value systems (eg deep ecologists / soft ecologists /
      environmental managers / cornucopians). Broader categories can be accepted eg
      ecocentrics / anthropocentrics / technocentrics), but they should not be chosen in
      conjunction with narrower categories that they include eg ecocentrics & deep
      ecologists. Other than that, any two systems can be contrasted.

      Any number of relevant and appropriate responses other than those given below
      should be credited, but do not credit responses from more than two environmental
      value systems.

      Effect:
      Melting of permafrost would cause the biome to disappear/reduce; [1 max]
      Responses:
      deep ecologists would consider this unethical per se;
      cornucopians would consider it a chance to implement new modes of farming;
      and they may search/exploit new resources now more easily accessed;
      environmental managers would enforce legislations protecting the remaining
      habitat;
      soft ecologists would call for the local and national community to take action;
      [3 max]

      Effect:
      Loss of biodiversity through competition by invasive species better adapted to the
      “improved” conditions; [1 max]
      Responses:
      deep ecologists would object to the infringement of biorights for the displaced
      species;
      cornucopians would be optimistic that these new conditions will offer new
      resources to humans;
      environmental managers would call for assigning endangered status to species and
      implement protection plan ;
      soft ecologists (might collaborate with EMs) to protect species through active
      involvement of locals; [3 max]

Effect:
Conditions becoming warmer / growing season longer / precipitation patterns
changing (less snowfall, more rainfall); [1 max]
Responses:
deep ecologists believe in intrinsic importance of any process, thus would
consider such change unacceptable;
they would advocate changes/simplification of lifestyles to reduce energy
consumption/global warming;
cornucopians would call for investments in technology to help people survive in
such conditions;
would see opportunities for exploiting a new frontier/new resources;
environmental managers would call for compensation to those who experience
adverse effects due to these changes;
soft ecologists would advocate for small-scale adjustments in human settlements
and/or work conditions to alleviate any issues arising from the changed
conditions; [3 max]

Effect:
rising sea level reduces available land mass/habitat leading to loss of
species/biodiversity; [1 max]
Responses:
deep ecologists would deplore the loss of intrinsic value in the ecosystem/species;
environmental managers would legislate to reduce production of greenhouse
gases;
they may set up reserves to protect remaining populations;
technocentrics would invest in technology to mitigate for GW;
cornucopians would oppose any restrictions of human activities leading to
GW; [3 max]
