Subject Details: Physics SL Paper 3 Markscheme
Mark Allocation

Candidates are required to answer questions from TWO of the Options [2 x 20 marks].
Maximum total = [40 marks]

1.    A markscheme often has more marking points than the total allows. This is intentional.

2.    Each marking point has a separate line and the end is shown by means of a semicolon (;).

3.    An alternative answer or wording is indicated in the markscheme by a slash (/). Either wording can
      be accepted.

4.    Words in brackets ( ) in the markscheme are not necessary to gain the mark.

5.    Words that are underlined are essential for the mark.

6.    The order of marking points does not have to be as in the markscheme, unless stated otherwise.

7.    If the candidate’s answer has the same “meaning” or can be clearly interpreted as being of
      equivalent significance, detail and validity as that in the markscheme then award the mark.
      Where this point is considered to be particularly relevant in a question it is emphasized by
      OWTTE (or words to that effect).

8.    Remember that many candidates are writing in a second language. Effective communication is
      more important than grammatical accuracy.

9.    Occasionally, a part of a question may require an answer that is required for subsequent
      marking points. If an error is made in the first marking point then it should be penalized. However, if
      the incorrect answer is used correctly in subsequent marking points then follow through marks
      should be awarded. When marking indicate this by adding ECF (error carried forward) on the script.

10.   Do not penalize candidates for errors in units or significant figures, unless it is specifically referred
      to in the markscheme.

Option A — Sight and wave phenomena

1.   (a)   cones are sensitive to colour while rods provide black and white vision;
           cones provide photopic vision while rods provide scotopic vision;
           cones work under bright/normal light conditions while rods function under low light
           conditions;                                                                         [2 max]

     (b)   accommodation is the process by which the eye can focus on objects at different
           distances;
           this is accomplished by changes in the lens shape (as a result of changes in tension in
           the suspensory ligaments and the ciliary muscle);                                          [2]


2.   (a)   (longitudinal)
           the standing wave is formed of (travelling) sound waves (which are longitudinal);          [1]
           Do not allow responses that focus only on travelling waves.

                                     1
     (b)   the frequency is f =            (= 800 Hz) ;
                                1.25 ×10−3
                                       v 340
           and the wavelength is λ = =         (= 0.425m) ;
                                       f 800
           the fourth harmonic corresponds to 2 wavelengths in the tube, thus L = 2λ = 0.85m ;        [3]

                                                                     λ
     (c)   the length of the tube closed at one end corresponds to       , while the length for the
                                                                     4
                                                   λ
           tube open at both ends corresponds to       ;                                              [1]

3.   (a)   as the mosquito approaches the wavelength perceived by Georgia is shorter and
           therefore the perceived frequency is higher;
           as the mosquito is moving away, the wavelength perceived is longer than the emitted
           and therefore the perceived frequency is lower;
           due to the Doppler effect;                                                          [2 max]

           to produce u = 0.45ms −1 ;                                                                 [3]
           or
                                  751+ 749
           emitted frequency is            = 750 Hz ;

                                                                                          340
           applying the Doppler effect for approach (or recession), 751 = 750                    or
                                                                                         340 − u

           to produce u = 0.45ms −1 ;


4.   (a)   light is said to be (plane) polarized if the electric field (vector) lies on one plane;
           when light is unpolarized, the electric field (vector) lies on many planes/does not
           lie on a specific plane;                                                                   [2]

                      = ;
                   I0 2

                   or
                   measure activity as a function of time;

            longer to the mirror and less to Daniela;

                                                  convex lens

            (iii) real/inverted/magnified;                                                                [1]
                  Allow ECF from (a)(ii).

      (b)   (i)    central cross shown straight;
                   sides curved (inwards or outwards);                                                    [2]

            (ii)   rays passing through the edge of the lens are brought to a different focal point
                   than those passing through the centre;
                   by covering the outer edge of the lens/reducing the aperture (only the centre of
                   the lens is used) bringing the light to one focus;                                     [2]

21.   (a)   (i)    (the waves) all have the same/narrow interval of frequency/wavelength;                 [1]
                   Do not accept “one colour”.

            (ii)   more electrons are in the higher state than in the ground/lower state;                 [1]

      (b)   any sensible suggestion; (eg eye surgery, cancer treatment)
            brief description given;                                                                      [2]

            eg eye surgery;
            laser burns tissue to control leakage of blood vessels in the eye / laser used to destroy
            cells (to reshape the cornea) to improve eyesight;
                                                  – 16 –              N14/4/PHYSI/SP3/ENG/TZ0/XX/M


22.   (a)   the waves are coherent so interference occurs;
            high intensity sound corresponds to a position where sound constructively
            interferes/superposes / low/zero intensity sound corresponds to a position where sound
            destructively interferes/cancels;
            high intensity is where the path difference is an integral number of wavelengths;
            low/zero intensity of sound is where the path difference is n + 12 wavelengths;        [3 max]

                330
      (b)   λ=      = 0.132 m ;
               2500
              ⎛ nλ D 1.0 × 0.132 × 8.0 ⎞
            x=⎜     =                 =⎟ 0.70(4) m ;                                                   [2]
              ⎝ d            1.5       ⎠

      (c)   distance doubles so fringe width is halved;
            so fringes are encountered at the same rate, no change;                                    [2]
