Subject Details: Physics HL Paper 2 Markscheme
Mark Allocation

Candidates are required to answer ALL questions in Section A [45 marks] and TWO questions in
Section B [2 × 25 marks]. Maximum total = [95 marks].

1.    A markscheme often has more marking points than the total allows. This is intentional.

2.    Each marking point has a separate line and the end is shown by means of a semicolon (;).

3.    An alternative answer or wording is indicated in the markscheme by a slash (/). Either wording can
      be accepted.

4.    Words in brackets ( ) in the markscheme are not necessary to gain the mark.

5.    Words that are underlined are essential for the mark.

6.    The order of marking points does not have to be as in the markscheme, unless stated otherwise.

7.    If the candidate’s answer has the same “meaning” or can be clearly interpreted as being of
      equivalent significance, detail and validity as that in the markscheme then award the mark.
      Where this point is considered to be particularly relevant in a question it is emphasized by
      OWTTE (or words to that effect).

8.    Remember that many candidates are writing in a second language. Effective communication is
      more important than grammatical accuracy.

9.    Occasionally, a part of a question may require an answer that is required for subsequent
      marking points. If an error is made in the first marking point then it should be penalized. However, if
      the incorrect answer is used correctly in subsequent marking points then follow through marks
      should be awarded. When marking indicate this by adding ECF (error carried forward) on the script.

10.   Do not penalize candidates for errors in units or significant figures, unless it is specifically referred
      to in the markscheme.

Part 2        Photoelectric effect

(d)   light consists of photons with energy E = hf ;
      there is a minimum energy/work function required for electron to leave a particular
      metal;
      hf must be larger than this value;                                                  [2 max]

              Allow answers in the range of 9.0 to 9.5, but with correct power of ten.

              6.4 ×10−34 J s ; (allow ECF, eg answers in the range of 6.2 to 6.7 ×10−34 )       [3]
              Do not allow a bald answer of 6.6 ×10−34 as value is known.

              or

              an answer in the range of 3.4 to 4.0 eV; (allow ECF from (e)(i) and (e)(ii))      [2]
