                                                  SECTION B

Answer all questions.

10.   A customer buys an item in a small local shop and pays with a credit card.  The sales transaction
      data is input to a computer at the point of sale.  Prices are downloaded every morning from
      a central computer at the company headquarters.   The credit card is verified with the card
      authorization centre and then the receipt is printed.

      (a)   Draw and label a system flow chart to represent this process in the shop.                     [5]

      At the end of the day the sales transaction data is sent to the central computer at the
      company headquarters.

      (b)   Describe the processing that should be carried out at the company headquarters.               [2]

      All programs and data should be protected from theft, destruction, manipulation and alteration
      in this process.

      (c)   Identify three causes of data loss.                                                           [3]

      (d)   Describe why data loss is a more serious problem than the loss of software or hardware
            for a sales company.                                                                          [3]

11.   A magic square is a two-dimensional array with n rows and n columns in which each of the
      integers 1, 2, 3, …, n2 appears exactly once and all column sums, row sums and diagonal sums
      are equal.

      The array A is a 7 × 7 magic square in which all rows, columns and the two main diagonals add
      up to 175.

      (a)   Construct an algorithm to calculate the sum of all elements on the main diagonal,
            from A[0, 0] to A[6, 6].                                                                  [2]

      (b)   An array with n rows and n columns holds every number from 1 to n2. Construct an
            algorithm that checks whether the n × n array is a magic square.                          [8]

      The following is the algorithm for constructing a magic square with n rows and n columns for
      any odd integer n.

      • Z=1
      • Place Z in the middle of top row
      • Loop until all integers 1, 2, 3, …, n2 are placed in the array
           • Z=Z+1
           • Move one row up and one column to the right to place the integer Z, unless one of the
              following occurs
                 • If a move takes you above the top row in the jth column, move to the bottom of
                    the jth column and place the integer Z there
                 • If a move takes you outside to the right of the square in the ith row, place the
                    integer Z in the ith row at the left side
                 • If a move takes you to an already filled square or if you move out of the square
                    at the upper-right corner, place Z immediately below Z – 1.

      (c)   By applying this algorithm, copy and complete the 5 × 5 magic square, which has been
            started below. Do not write solutions on this page.                                       [5]

12.   Three IB students are working on a programming project.  They have 10 days to complete
      the work.  To plan the project activities and timeline they produce the following Gantt chart.

      (a)   State two tasks students should perform to define a problem.                                [2]

      (b)   Identify two tools or techniques that students could use to represent algorithms.           [1]

      (c)   Discuss whether beta testing would be appropriate in this scenario.                         [3]

      (d)   Outline three criteria that could be used when deciding which programming language is
            to be used for coding.                                                                      [3]

13.   An automated security system monitors a prison.

      (a)   Suggest the sensors that could be used to detect any person crossing the perimeter.          [2]

      A team of security guards patrols the perimeter of the prison at night.  The guards each carry a
      device incorporating a GPS that links to the prison’s security system.

      (b)   Outline a suitable output that would notify a guard that a prisoner has escaped.             [2]

      The guards’ GPS devices transmit information to the security system.

      (c)   Suggest the most suitable method for the transmission

            (i)    between the perimeter’s sensors and the security system;                              [1]

            (ii)   between the security system and the guards’ devices.                                  [1]

      (d)   State one method of network security that could be used when transmitting the
            GPS information.                                                                             [1]

      (e)   Outline how this GPS information may be used once transmitted to the security system.        [2]

      There are other situations where people may be required to carry GPS devices.

      (f)   Discuss the ethical implications of insisting people carry GPS devices.                      [6]

14.   (a)   (i)    Describe, with the aid of a suitable diagram, a dynamic singly linked list.              [3]

            (ii)   Explain how an item could be found in this list.                                         [3]

            (i)    State the order in which data will be listed using postorder tree traversal.             [1]

            (ii)   Identify the traversal which will return a list of names sorted in alphabetical order.   [1]

      (c)   Describe how a name which is stored in a node with two children could be deleted from
            the binary tree without changing the order of the remaining names.                              [4]

      (d)   Compare the efficiency of finding a name in the binary tree with finding the same name
            in a linked list.                                                                               [3]
