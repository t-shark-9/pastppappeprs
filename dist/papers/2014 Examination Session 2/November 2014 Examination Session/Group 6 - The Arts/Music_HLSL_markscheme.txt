General Comment to Examiners
Please note that the markscheme is provided as a guideline for marking. There are many potential and
valid ways in which to approach these questions and examiners need, therefore, to use their judgment
carefully.

Each question is worth [20 marks].

                                             SECTION A

This criterion concerns the student’s ability to:
 question 1 or question 2—analyse and examine essential musical elements (including form and
  structure) within one of the two prescribed works
 question 3—compare and contrast the two prescribed works, emphasizing the presence of any
  significant musical links.

 0:         The work does not reach a standard described by the descriptors below.
 1–4:       The arguments, which generally do not address the question, show a minimal level of
            musical understanding. There is limited use of musical evidence, though this is poorly
            located, or none at all. There is limited use of musical terminology or none at all.
 5–8:       The arguments, which may not always address the question, show some level of musical
            understanding. There is some use of musical evidence, though this is not located precisely
            enough. There is some use of musical terminology.
 9–12:      The arguments, which generally address the question, show an adequate level of musical
            understanding. There is use of musical evidence, though this is not always precisely located.
            There is partially effective use of musical terminology.
 13–16:     The arguments, which generally address the question, may not always be convincing but
            show a good level of musical understanding. There is appropriate use of musical evidence,
            mostly precisely located. There is mostly effective use of musical terminology.
 17–20:     The arguments, which consistently address the question, are convincing and show a very
            good level of musical understanding, supported by a most appropriate use of musical
            evidence, precisely located. There is highly effective use of musical terminology.
                                                 –4–              N14/6/MUSIC/BP1/ENG/TZ0/XX/M


1.   Symphony No. 1 in D Major, Op. 25 “Classical” by S Prokofiev
2.   The Yellow River Piano Concerto by X Xian
3.   Symphony No. 1 in D Major, Op. 25 “Classical” by S Prokofiev and The Yellow River Piano
     Concerto by X Xian

     Question 1 or Question 2
     The arguments should refer to the appropriate prescribed work.

     Arguments should address the question and be consistent and convincing in their display of musical
     understanding, and should be backed up by clearly located evidence. Musical terminology should
     be effective in its use.

     Question 3
     The arguments should refer to both prescribed works. The comparing and contrasting, as an
     attempt to find significant musical links, must focus on treatment of modulation/key change.

     Arguments should be consistent and convincing in their display of musical understanding, and
     should be backed up by clearly located evidence. Musical terminology should be effective in its use.

                                                SECTION B

Musical elements
This criterion concerns the student’s ability in each extract to perceive the musical elements (duration,
pitch, timbre/tone colour, texture and dynamics) and their significance. Articulation and other expressive
and production techniques might also be discussed.

Note: Structure is assessed in a separate criterion.

 0:    The work does not reach a standard described by the descriptors below.
 1:    The work displays insufficient and weak aural perception. The student has identified musical
       elements poorly, including very few, if any of the significant ones.
 2:    The work sometimes displays adequate aural perception. The student has identified some musical
       elements, including a few of the significant ones.
 3:    The work displays partially effective aural perception. The student has generally accurately
       identified musical elements, including some of the significant ones.
 4:    The work displays mostly effective aural perception. The student has accurately identified musical
       elements, including many of the significant ones.
 5:    The work consistently displays highly effective aural perception. The student has accurately
       identified musical elements, including nearly all of the significant ones.


Musical structure
This criterion concerns the student’s ability to perceive the principal structural features of each extract.

 0:    The work does not reach a standard described by the descriptors below.
 1:    The work demonstrates little perception of the principal structural features of each extract.
 2:    The work demonstrates limited and ineffective perception of the principal structural features of
       each extract.
 3:    The work demonstrates partially effective perception of the principal structural features of each
       extract.
 4:    The work demonstrates mostly effective perception of the principal structural features of each
       extract.
 5:    The work consistently demonstrates highly effective perception of the principal structural features
       of each extract.


Musical terminology
This criterion concerns the student’s knowledge of musical terminology and its appropriate use.

 0:    The work does not reach a standard described by the descriptors below
 1:    The work displays little knowledge and use, if any, of musical terminology.
 2:    The work displays some knowledge of musical terminology but its use is inaccurate at times.
 3:    The work displays satisfactory knowledge and use of musical terminology.
 4:    The work displays good knowledge and use of musical terminology.
 5:    The work consistently displays very good knowledge and use of musical terminology.

Musical context
This criterion concerns the student’s ability to place each extract in its musical context—cultural,
historical and stylistic—and relate it to music that he or she knows.

 0:   The work does not reach a standard described by the descriptors below
 1:   The work demonstrates little and inaccurate knowledge of the musical context. The student has
      used little reasoned argument.
 2:   The work demonstrates some knowledge of the musical context. The student has sometimes used
      reasoned argument.
 3:   The work demonstrates adequate knowledge of the musical context. The student has used partially
      effective reasoned argument.
 4:   The work demonstrates good knowledge of the musical context. The student has used mostly
      effective reasoned argument.
 5:   The work consistently demonstrates very good knowledge of the musical context. The student has
      consistently used highly effective reasoned argument.

     There are many possible interpretations of the structure of this excerpt. Here is one of them.

     Opening: Syncopated figures in strings. The tonic chord appears in the score, but due to the
     weakness of the bass of the harp, a dominant “feel” is implied.

     Rondo Form

     Bar 38           D minor           Variations of opening chorus – imitative entries between tenor
                                        and bass, with other parts declamatory.

     Bar 42           Bb Major          New imitative section, using suspensions and sequence, leading
                                        to:

     Bar 47           Bb Major          Cadential section using part of the opening ritornello and also a
                                        repeat of material from the previous section.

     0:22    1st phrase “a”, 4mm by solo male, repetitive sung pattern, mostly conjunct, narrow pitch
             range with slight pitch turns at end of phrase; alternates with 4mm white noise, scratching
             rhythmic pattern “b” and wah-wah effect (electronic) suspended bass at 0:32, phrase “a”
             returns.

     0:43    Texture lightens: keyboard & drum set play 2 phrases “c” of simple 8th and ¼ note rhythms,
             until percussion flourish; bass re-joins for repeat, followed by electric guitar solo at 1:02
             based on material “a” from 0:22.

     1:12    Solo voice with new melodic phrase “d ”, more lyrical and ornate, alternates with pattern
             “b” from 1st verse.

     1:28    Similar to “a” from 0:22.

7.   Balada lui Pintea Viteazul (The Ballad of Pintea the Brave) by Ana Hossu and Group
     (Unidentified Piece)
     (no score provided)

     Musical elements
      female voice, tárogató (single-reed instrument that sounds like a cross between a clarinet and a
       saxophone), accordion, string bass, braci (slightly larger than a normal violin), and fluier
       (6-holed pipe or fipple flute) flute
      tempo changes
      predictable and unpredictable beat
      fluctuation between D Major and minor
      drones
      homophonic.

     Musical structure
     There are many possible interpretations of the structure of this excerpt. Here is one of them.

     0:00     Introduction by taragot with improvisatory character and unpredictable beat.

     0:25     Drone by braci, bass and accordion.

     0:29     Entrance of the voice, in declamatory style, over the drone. The bass moves from “I to V”
              (at 0:34), and returns to “I” on 0:41. The vocal phrases are complemented by the taragot.
              The beat is not clearly established. D Major.

     0:48     A second phrase with similar characteristics than previous.

     1:10    Modulation to D minor. The voice establishes a 2/4 meter (some students might argue 4/4).
             Accompaniment is rhythmically very stable and predictable: bass plays “on” the beat while
             braci plays on the “off” beat.

     1:26     Return to declamatory style similar to that of 0:29. However, in here the mode is minor.

     1:55     The fluier plays a role similar to the voice at 1:26. Towards the end it returns to D Major.

     Musical terminology
     Some of the words that could be relevant to criterion C include (but are not limited to):
     recitative (declamatory), drone, homophonic, major, minor, ornaments, meter.

     Musical context
      This is a traditional ballad from Transylvania, more specifically the valley of the Maramures..
      It narrates the story of a popular hero Pintea The Brave (a ‘Robin Hood’ character who lived in
       north-western Transylvania).
      The narrative nature of the song/text, justifies the declamatory style.

                                               SECTION C

This criterion concerns the student’s ability to:
 question 8—compare and contrast two extracts chosen from section B, emphasizing the presence of
  any significant musical links.

 0:           The work does not reach a standard described by the descriptors below.
 1–4:         The arguments, which generally do not address the question, show some level of musical
              understanding. There is some use of musical evidence, though this is not located precisely
              enough. There is some use of musical terminology.
 5–8:         The arguments, which generally address the question, show an adequate level of musical
              understanding. There is use of musical evidence, though this is not always precisely located.
              There is partially effective use of musical terminology.
 9–12:        The arguments, which generally address the question, may not always be convincing but
              show a fairly good level of musical understanding. There is appropriate use of musical
              evidence, mostly precisely located. There is mostly effective use of musical terminology.
 13–16:       The arguments, which consistently address the question, are convincing and show a good
              level of musical understanding, supported by a most appropriate use of musical evidence,
              precisely located. There is highly effective use of musical terminology.
 17–20:       The arguments, which consistently address the question, are highly convincing and show a
              very good level of musical understanding, supported by a most appropriate and substantial
              use of musical evidence, precisely located. There is highly effective use of musical
              terminology.


8.      A choice of any two of the extracts from Section B

        The arguments should refer in a balanced way to both of the candidate’s chosen extracts
        (taken from Section B). Arguments establishing significant musical links should be consistent and
        convincing in their display of musical understanding, and should be backed up by clearly located
        evidence. Musical terminology should be effective in its use.
