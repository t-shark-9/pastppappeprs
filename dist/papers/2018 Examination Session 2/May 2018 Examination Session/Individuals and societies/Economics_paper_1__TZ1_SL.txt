Answer one question from this section.

Microeconomics

1.   (a)   Explain how the value of the cross price elasticity of demand (XED) for a particular
           good is determined by its relationship to other goods.                                    [10]

     (b)   Examine the significance of both cross price elasticity of demand and income elasticity
           of demand for a firm.                                                                     [15]


2.   (a)   Explain two factors that would lead to an increase in the demand for a product.           [10]

     (b)   Discuss the view that competitive markets will always achieve allocative efficiency.      [15]

Answer one question from this section.

Macroeconomics

3.   (a)   Explain how income inequality might be measured in a country.                            [10]

     (b)   Evaluate the view that the best way to reduce income inequality in a country is by using
           progressive taxation.                                                                    [15]


4.   (a)   Explain how expansionary fiscal policy could be used to close a deflationary
           (recessionary) gap.                                                                      [10]

     (b)   Evaluate the view that fiscal policy is the most effective way of achieving long-term
           economic growth.                                                                         [15]
