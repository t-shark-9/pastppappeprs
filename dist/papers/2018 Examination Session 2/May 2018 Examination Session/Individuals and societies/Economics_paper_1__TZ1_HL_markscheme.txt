    (b)   A government decides to impose an indirect tax on unhealthy drinks. Discuss the
          consequences for the stakeholders in these markets.                                 [15]

          Discussion may include: the importance of price and cross elasticities of demand,
          equity issues, micro and macro-economic consequences.
.
     Some responses may approach unhealthy food as a demerit good leading to mar-
     ket failure / negative externalities of consumption. This can be credited equally if it
     leads to a valid discussion.

          Examiners should be aware that candidates may take a different approach which,
          if appropriate, should be rewarded.

          Opinions or conclusions should be presented clearly and should be supported by
          appropriate examples.

     (b) Examine why, in contrast to the monetarist/new classical model, the economy will not auto-
matically return to the full employment level of output in the Keynesian model.    [15]

           Answers may include:
             definitions of full employment level of output, Keynesian model, monetarist/new
             classical model
             diagram(s) to show equilibrium in the two models
             explanation of the mechanisms through which an economy may remain stuck in a
             deflationary gap in the Keynesian system but will always return to full employ-
             ment equilibrium in the monetarist/new classical model in the long run
             examples of the two models applying in practice
             synthesis or evaluation (examine).

           Evaluation may include: the importance of the type of unemployment, the degree to
           which both models represent extreme theoretical ends of a spectrum, the degree to
           which reality deviates from the models, the difficulty of establishing what is full em-
           ployment, policy implications.

           Examiners should be aware that candidates may take a different approach which,
           if appropriate, should be rewarded.

           Opinions or conclusions should be presented clearly and should be supported by
           appropriate examples.

         creating an economic environment that is favourable to private investment, and
         directly through government spending on physical capital goods and human capi-
         tal formation, as well as provision of incentives for firms to invest, all of which are

      already been given in part (a) and then referred to in part (b) should be

      Evaluation may include: the type of fiscal policy and how it is financed, advantages
      and disadvantages of fiscal policy, consideration of alternative policies, such as
      monetary and supply-side policies.
