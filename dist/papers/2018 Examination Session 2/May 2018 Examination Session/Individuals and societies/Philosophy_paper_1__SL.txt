Answer one question from this section. Each question in this section is worth [25 marks].

Core theme: Being human

1.   Read the following article and develop your response as indicated below.

     Grayson Perry is a famous British artist who is also a transvestite. This is an extract from an
     interview he had with two journalists.

     Yet as a transvestite, challenging gender stereotypes is “front and centre” of everything he
     (Grayson Perry) does. “You are thinking: ‘I’m being compelled to dress up in the wrong clothes,
     so there must be something going on here’. I don’t think it gives me any insight into being a
     woman but it makes me question masculinity”. He is convinced that traditional maleness as
     it is popularly understood is now redundant – “the physical prowess, aggression, territorial
     aggrandisement, competitiveness”, he says. “A lot of people are nostalgic for old-school
     masculinity. They think that you only have to peel off this veneer of civilisation and men can be
     men and women can be women and it can all go back to normal. I want to say it won’t be like that.
     You have to redefine masculinity to fit in with democracy.”

Optional theme 1: Aesthetics

3.    To what extent can aesthetic judgments be more than declarations of personal taste?


4.    To what extent must art, for it to be counted as art, be appreciated for its own sake, as opposed to
      some other end?



Optional theme 2: Epistemology

5.    Evaluate the role played by technology in shaping a human’s knowledge.


6.    Evaluate the claim that “colour, taste, etc must be contemplated not as properties of things,

Optional theme 3: Ethics

7.    To what extent is it possible that fundamental moral principles can be applied to every situation?


8.    Justify which ethical approach offers the most effective way to articulate and address moral issues.

      support of the aim cannot be.


10.   Evaluate the claim that multicultural societies are faced with a dilemma: On the one hand they are,
      by definition, inclusive of all minority groups; but on the other hand, they must listen to the majority.

Optional theme 5: Philosophy of religion

11.   Evaluate the claim that God’s existence is not a matter of deductive or ontological proofs, but is 		
      established by experience.

      usual rules for establishing its truth do not apply.



Optional theme 6: Philosophy of science

13.   Evaluate the claim that “wherever external authority reigns, thinking is considered suspected
      and dangerous”.


14.   Evaluate the claim that “accuracy of observation is the equivalent of accuracy of thinking”.

      they govern.
