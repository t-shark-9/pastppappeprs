Answer one question from this section.

1.   Fishers

     Fishers manufactures baseball caps. In 2017, it sold 75 000 caps. The variable cost per cap was
     $6. 70 % of Fishers’s annual sales occur from April to September. Starting in March, Fishers
     experiences a significant increase in current assets and current liabilities, which start to decrease
     in October.

     Table 1: Selected data for Fishers for 2017 (figures in $000s)

      Sales revenue          $900
      Fixed costs             $55

     Table 2: Selected forecasted financial information for Fishers for 2018

      Increase in number of baseball caps sold                      10 %
      Increase in variable costs per cap                            $1.00
      Fixed costs                                                 $55 000
      Interest                                                    $30 000
      Income tax expense                                20 % of net profit before tax

     Sales price per cap will remain the same as in 2017.

Answer one question from this section.

3.   JVS

     JVS is a successful manufacturer of designer clothing. A marketing expert described JVS’s
     brand name, Izzys, as one of the business’s major strengths. Because of its market orientation
     approach, JVS spends significantly more on market research than its competitors.

     JVS’s products are:
     • Izzys, a range of high-quality fashion jeans, which contributes 70 % towards JVS’s revenue and
           profit. The market for this range is not growing.
     • IzzDen, a range of denim jackets, which is near the end of the product life cycle. Manufacturing
           of this product will cease later this year.

     Izzys and IzzDen are sold through high-end independent retailers throughout countries in Europe.
     JVS uses a price leadership strategy for these two products. Consumers perceive JVS as
     fashionable. They also believe that JVS’s products are worth the premium price.

     JVS is considering launching a new product, a range of fashionable shorts – Izzless – aimed at the
     15–19 age group. With this product, JVS would reach a different, but highly competitive, market.
     Focus groups revealed that many low-income young consumers want to purchase fashion shorts.
     JVS would sell the new shorts to mass market discount retail stores. Consumers would also be
     able to order online for next-day delivery.

                                   [Source: © International Baccalaureate Organization 2018]


     (a)      State two stages of the product life cycle.                                                [2]

     (b)      Apply the Boston Consulting Group (BCG) matrix to JVS’s current product portfolio.         [4]

     (c)      Explain one advantage and one disadvantage for JVS of using focus groups for its
              market research.                                                                           [4]

     (d)      Recommend whether JVS should launch the new product, Izzless.                             [10]

4.   Healthy Start (HS)

     Tom Donat started Healthy Start (HS), a national chain of stores preparing and selling healthy
     snacks, which are produced in batches. HS’s target market is teenagers and young adults. Tom
     was concerned about high levels of fast food consumption and youth unemployment. His vision
     statement for HS is: “To encourage life-long healthy eating habits and to train school leavers (drop
     outs) in acquiring work skills”.

     HS hires many school leavers without qualifications. Because of the valuable social service that
     HS provides, an independent online media provider will feature HS in a new online reality TV show.

     All employees, including managers, start at the lowest level of the organizational hierarchy and
     train on the job. Job enlargement, job enrichment and intrapreneurship opportunities are available.
     20 % of all profits earned are put back into HS to finance these opportunities. Staff turnover is
     lower than the industry average.

     Competition from global fast food restaurants has intensified. Their economies of scale mean that
     HS struggles to increase its market share. Online reviews indicate that some customers perceive
     HS’s snacks as healthy but overpriced and with small-sized portions.

     Tom is considering two options:
     • Option 1: Implement flow production. HS will buy new technology and assign each employee to
       a specific job on the production line. HS will increase portion sizes and keep prices the same.
     • Option 2: Implement a new social media marketing campaign linked to the new online TV show.
       The campaign will focus on the health benefits of HS’s snacks.

     (a)   Describe one role of a vision statement for HS.                                             [2]

     (b)   Explain how the following can benefit HS:

           (i)    job enlargement;                                                                     [2]

           (ii)   intrapreneurship.                                                                    [2]

     (c)   Explain two possible economies of scale available to global fast food restaurants but
           not HS.                                                                                     [4]

     (d)   Discuss the two options that Tom is considering for HS in response to the intense
           competition.                                                                               [10]

5.   Creative Software Systems (CSS)

     Creative Software Systems (CSS), a private limited company, designs custom software packages
     for public sector organizations. Ebru Aga is the sole shareholder, though she is considering an
     employee share ownership scheme.

     For years, CSS managed its employees closely, setting individual targets for performance and
     requiring regular progress reports. Following Adams’s equity theory, CSS tied financial rewards
     to frequently measured performance outcomes. Though managers clearly explained to individual
     employees how additional financial rewards were linked to specific contributions they made, many
     employees still felt the system was unfair.

     After reading Daniel Pink’s theory of motivation, Ebru reconsidered her management style and
     CSS’s system of financial rewards. She liked when Pink reported that a major American company
     allowed employees to work 20 % of their time on projects of their choice. Ebru implemented the
     following three changes:
     • Change 1: Adopting a project-based organizational structure for CSS projects.
     • Change 2: Eliminating performance-related pay (PRP).
     • Change 3: Allowing employees to spend 20 % of their time on any project they wish, either one
         of CSS’s or their own “dream project”.

     Employees’ reactions were mixed. Some employees were thrilled. They had many ideas of their
     own that they wanted to explore. Other employees, however, did not like the change. In the 20 %
     of their time given to any project they wished, they chose to work on projects given to them by
     CSS. They felt it was unfair. Although they were advancing important projects of the company,
     they would no longer get performance-related pay (PRP), while others spent their time on projects
     that might not contribute to CSS’s profitability.

     (a)   Define the term public sector.                                                            [2]

     (b)   Explain one advantage and one disadvantage for CSS of introducing an employee
           share ownership scheme.                                                                   [4]

     (c)   Explain one advantage and one disadvantage for CSS of implementing a project-
           based organizational structure (Change 1).                                                [4]

     (d)   With reference to Adams’s equity theory and Daniel Pink’s motivation theory, discuss
           Ebru’s decision to eliminate performance-related pay (PRP) (Change 2) and to allow
           employees to spend 20 % of their time on any project they wish (Change 3).               [10]
