IT system: Collecting, transmitting and storing information from a mobile device

     Mobile devices have become a central part of our daily lives. However there is a risk that some
     people can find themselves in the grip of an “addiction” to social media that may have social,
     psychological and physical consequences (Figure 1).

                               Figure 1: Are we addicted to our mobile devices?

 5   Many of us are not aware of how much time we spend using our devices. Reports have shown
     that some teenagers spend anywhere from six to nine hours each day with social media
     technology. That’s more time than teens typically spend sleeping, and more time than they spend
     with their parents and teachers.

     Is this endless stream of social media information packing our minds too full? Does our “fear
10   of missing out” (FOMO) mean that we end up missing out on something else – the creative
     opportunities of being bored?

     A recent study by Dr Sandi Mann, a lecturer in psychology at the University of Central Lancashire
     in the UK, discovered that being bored can increase creativity because it gives us time to
     daydream – to simply let our minds wander and make new mental connections.

15   A group of parents attended a talk by Dr Sandi Mann and decided to install an app* called Moment
     Family on all family devices. Created by the company Moment, Moment Family is designed to
     make people aware of how long they spend interacting with their mobile devices and encourage
     them to limit their “screen time”.

     The app collects information from the device’s system and sensors in order to determine when and
20   how it is being used. It also collects information about what other apps a person uses.

     This information is stored on the device and shared with all members of the family. It is also sent
     to Moment and stored by the company, along with other information about both the device and the
     user. This includes information the user entered when they first installed the Moment Family app.

     Moment Family also allows anyone in the family to enforce a 1-hour period of “screen-free” time
25   (Figure 2). People can still make and receive telephone calls, listen to music, etc with their
     screens turned off but the device will make a loud alarm sound if they try to use it for anything else.

     In an interconnected world, Moment Family offers one way of addressing the overuse of mobile
     devices, but it potentially raises a number of other issues.
