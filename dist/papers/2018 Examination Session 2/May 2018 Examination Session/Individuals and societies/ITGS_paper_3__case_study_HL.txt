     Overview

     Margaret Zepher is the founder and chief executive officer (CEO) of MAGS, a large IT software
     company. As a computer professional, Margaret’s ultimate goal is to develop ethical software
     solutions that can be used to enhance people’s lives, but as the CEO of MAGS she is also
 5   required to develop products that are going to be profitable.

     MAGS offers a suite of cloud-based software services for communication, collaboration and
     office productivity, which can be used on a range of devices from cellphones to
     desktop computers. However, Margaret sees that incorporating recent advances in
     artificial intelligence (AI) into its software would allow MAGS to gain greater penetration into its
10   existing markets and diversify into new ones.

     AI developments

     Margaret has studied various uses of AI, such as natural language processing in smartphone
     tools like Siri and Cortana, voice recognition in chatbots and helpdesk systems, subtitles for
     films, and language translators such as Google Translate. She has also looked at AI-based
15   pattern recognition that is being used in various applications, such as handwriting recognition,
     image recognition and face recognition. Margaret can see great potential in this evolving
     technology.

     Margaret recognizes that these products, which are based on machine learning, have had
     varying levels of success and believes future developments will focus on the use of deep
20   learning and emotional artificial intelligence (see Figure 1).

     Current situation

     Margaret has been following the news, and in recent years has seen that other companies are
     developing robotic toys with consumer-grade artificial intelligence. Remembering her favourite
     childhood doll, Margaret can see the potential of a doll that would use cloud-based AI software
25   to provide features that can be personalized to the child that uses it. As a first step Margaret
     intends, in partnership with a toy manufacturer Vellieplay, to develop a doll called Alicia with
     embedded AI software that is linked to the cloud. The doll would learn to respond to the child
     and could eventually become the child’s companion. In the future, the AI software will not just
     be limited to the doll, but will be further developed for use in MAGS’s other products, as well as
30   in products developed by other companies.

     Margaret has a trusted team of experts within MAGS and will work with them to develop Alicia.
     The team members and their responsibilities are outlined below:
     • Nia Clifford, the chief legal officer (CLO), who advises on any legal implications that may
       arise from the use of MAGS’s products.
35   • Sonia Oliver, the business development officer (BDO), who oversees the business strategy
       and ensures that the products developed are well designed and are marketable.
     • Mark Danbung, the chief technical officer (CTO), who oversees the technological side of
       product development. He will need to set up a specialized AI department in addition to the
       other teams he manages.

40   The first meeting

     At the team’s first meeting, Mark introduced the key AI concepts. There was a long discussion,
     as everybody seemed to have a slightly different understanding of these key concepts, but
     eventually the team agreed on the working definitions below. These working definitions will be
     used in this case study.
45   • Machine learning uses a supervised environment to teach the computer and requires
        human intervention. For example, for image recognition the computer would receive
        feedback from humans to confirm that the image was identified correctly.
     • Deep learning is an advanced form of artificial intelligence, where computers are able
        to automatically collect feedback from the results of their processing and improve their
50      performance by using this to refine the algorithms they use. Deep learning occurs in an
        unsupervised environment with no human intervention.
     • Neural networks are used by deep learning. They aim to mimic the way that the human
        brain processes raw data into meaningful information so that it can learn more effectively.
        This is particularly useful when incomplete data is available and the software needs to use
55      deep learning techniques to provide pattern recognition.

     Margaret’s plan to work in partnership with Vellieplay to develop Alicia by embedding AI into a
     version of Vellieplay‘s top-selling doll was approved at the meeting. It was anticipated that Alicia
     would be launched in December 2019.

     Alicia will be able to remember previous conversations, such as whether the child has brothers
60   and sisters or when they last played together. These interactions will be sent to the cloud and
     will be used by deep learning to “train” the AI algorithms. For example, Margaret hopes that
     eventually the AI software in Alicia will be able to recognize when the child is upset, rather than
     playful, and adopt a more nurturing or soothing response that would be appropriate to the child’s
     needs at that time.

65   Training and operation

     At the meeting, Mark presented a sketch of his initial ideas on how deep learning would
     work in Alicia (see Figure 2). He will need to carry out further research in order to devise an
     implementation plan that will meet his deadline of December 2019.

                                                      child interacts with the doll


             Supervised                                           Unsupervised

                               [Source: © International Baccalaureate Organization 2018]


     Alicia will start with a generic profile, based on data collected in the supervised environment,
70   which can be customized according to the child’s age, gender, nationality and mother
     tongue. This data will consist of the records of the behaviour of a wide variety of children that
     researchers have already collected, and will be expanded over time with the records of the
     children who interact with the doll.

     During the “training” of Alicia, the deep learning AI software, containing natural language
75   processing, pattern recognition for vision and emotional AI, will learn by being presented with a
     variety of situations. It will detect environmental factors, such as location and the time of day, as
     well as the nature of the child’s verbal and non-verbal communication, so that it can make the
     most appropriate response.

     All of the child’s interactions with Alicia will be recorded and uploaded onto the cloud-based
80   AI servers, where they will be used in the further training of the deep learning AI software in
     the unsupervised environment. These interactions with Alicia will have two purposes: the first
     purpose is to create and update the child’s digital profile, and the second is to aggregate the
     data from all of the Alicia dolls sold in order to update the generic profile that will be provided
     with new Alicia dolls. This could lead to a greater range of profiles for future dolls, which could
85   shorten the time it would take to train Alicia.




                                                                                                      Turn over
                                                  –6–             M&N18/3/ITGSX/HP3/ENG/TZ0/XX/CS

      Each Alicia doll will therefore become personalized to the child, with a configuration based on
      the child’s interactions with the doll. This will mean that different dolls will react differently to
      similar patterns of behaviour displayed by different children.

      If the AI software within the doll itself cannot determine an appropriate response to the child’s
90    behaviour, the doll will link to the AI software in the cloud, transfer the data associated with the
      behaviour to the cloud and wait for it to be processed by the cloud-based AI software. The
      cloud-based software will then send an appropriate response back to the doll, which will be
      used to interact with the child. The response will then be added to the digital profile within the
      child’s Alicia doll.

95    When Alicia is not connected to the cloud, she will behave according to her most recent
      profile. The child’s profile will remain the same until a connection to the cloud can be
      re-established. Once this connection is re-established, the interactions that were recorded while
      offline will be uploaded and will train the deep learning AI, and this will then be used to update
      the child’s profile.

100   Other considerations

      Margaret is aware that the increasing personalization of these services will require the collection
      of a significant amount of personal data from children. Sonia can see the potential commercial
      opportunities that sharing the data collected by her company could provide. In contrast, Nia is
      acutely aware that adequate security measures will be needed to protect the individual profiles
105   of the children – on both the servers and in the dolls themselves – because much of this data
      would be highly sensitive.

      Margaret is keen for any of the data collected by MAGS to be used ethically, and she is also
      concerned that many companies lack openness about how they share their customer’s data.
      Margaret feels that she is entering into a relationship with a customer when they buy an Alicia
110   doll, and that she should therefore act in that customer’s best interests.

      When Margaret raised these concerns at the first meeting, Mark explained the need for
      standard data formats and protocols to ensure the correct storage and transmission of the data
      between the cloud and Alicia. He also reminded her that some countries have privacy laws
      that give users the right to access and inspect any data stored about them. When he started
115   to talk about converting data into standard format and secure transmission protocols, Margaret
      realised that this would need to be looked at in more detail once the ideas for Alicia were more
      concrete.

      Margaret is confident that Alicia will prove to be a success, and Sonia can see that there are
      other potential uses for AI that would benefit a variety of users. For example, AI could be used
120   in an assistive or adaptive capacity to help an elderly user, or someone with a particular learning
      need, where it would supply the appropriate response to the situations they encounter.

      Challenges faced

      After the first meeting, each member of the team conducted further research. A second meeting
      between Margaret, Nia, Sonia and Mark was held to plan a way forward. Yasmin Bruce, a child
125   psychologist, was also invited to the meeting. In this meeting a number of challenges were
      identified:
                                                 –7–            M&N18/3/ITGSX/HP3/ENG/TZ0/XX/CS

      Technical challenges
      • Mark wants to ensure that the AI software is compatible with future developments and
        standards, and can also be easily adapted for use with other products from MAGS and other
130     companies.
      • Mark is concerned about the December 2019 deadline and whether there is adequate
        time to develop and test effective deep learning algorithms. To expedite the process, he
        is considering whether to hire experts from other companies, to buy AI software from other
        companies, or even whether to buy the companies themselves.
135   • Yasmin wants to ensure that Alicia learns to develop an appropriate relationship with the
        child. Mark wants to monitor the different ways in which the product could adapt itself.
        He believes it will be necessary to put limits on its learned behaviour. He questions how far
        Alicia should be able to evolve from the generic behavioural profile. He needs to think about
        how to handle behaviour from Alicia that may be considered to be beyond the “norm”, or is
140     aggressive or inappropriate.
      • Mark is aware of the need to develop a more sophisticated Human–Computer Interaction
        (HCI) for Alicia that goes beyond the initial market. With greater global customization, this
        would mean accommodating different cultural norms, as well as a range of languages,
        dialects and colloquial words or phrases.
145   • Mark is concerned about the security of the data being transferred between Alicia and the
        cloud, and has asked his team to investigate encryption techniques. He has also asked his
        team to investigate appropriate levels of access for the children and their parents.
      • Yasmin knows that adapting the doll’s shape and face to make it more human-like to
        enhance its role as a companion would need to be considered. Robotic research has shown
150     that there is an issue with the degree of humanization that humans can cope with. This is
        referred to as the “uncanny valley”.

      Ethical challenges
      • Data collected from the child’s interactions with Alicia is stored in a profile so that Alicia can
        be personalized to the individual needs of the child. Margaret wants to ensure the privacy of
155     the child, and has asked Nia to investigate the degree to which data privacy and protection
        principles would apply to data that is collected as a result of the child’s interactions with
        Alicia.
      • Sonia wants to share the data with third parties for educational purposes and advertising
        campaigns, whereas Margaret wants to ethically manage the data associated with the
160     children’s profiles and assure parents that their child’s data profile will not be misused.
      • In the medium term there will be the potential to add messages and games from third parties
        into Alicia’s responses. However these third parties may request additional personal data
        from MAGS so that they can personalize the information they provide.
      • Nia suggests that the parents of some children are likely to be concerned that collecting data
165     from the interactions between their child and Alicia is not appropriate at all, and should not be
        shared under any circumstances.

      Social challenges
      • Sonia is concerned that Alicia will not be as intuitive to the child’s needs in the first few weeks
        after purchase, and may not respond in the way that the child would want. Until the AI has
170     learned about the child’s preferences there is a chance that the child will not interact well with
        Alicia and the doll will be discarded.




                                                                                                Turn over
                                               –8–            M&N18/3/ITGSX/HP3/ENG/TZ0/XX/CS

      • Yasmin is concerned that the child’s behaviour may change as a result of its interactions
        with Alicia. Over time, the child could become over-reliant on Alicia, and in more extreme
        cases Alicia could take the place of the child’s existing [human] friends. She is concerned
175     that some children may become so involved with Alicia that they lose their ability to think
        independently and critically. In effect, they may lose their autonomy.
      • Yasmin is also concerned that languages or dialects with relatively small numbers of
        speakers will not be included.

      Other challenges
180   • People are often fearful of AI and there are many myths and preconceptions. Extreme views
        predict a technological singularity. Sonia wants to find a way to convince potential customers
        that these myths and preconceptions are unfounded.
      • Margaret wants to ensure that products such as Alicia are used in conjunction with a human,
        rather than in place of a human. For example, the doll should not to be used to babysit a
185     child, or supervise an elderly or disabled person, without an appropriate person nearby.
      • Nia is concerned that there may be issues linked to accountability if an accident occurs
        while a child is playing with Alicia, especially if the child is following instructions or
        recommendations given by Alicia. Nia believes that being able to determine accountability is
        critical. Future AI applications may be developed for use in situations where the AI software
190     could become the decision-maker for the user, for example an elderly person with dementia.

      At the close of the meeting, Margaret reflects that many of the challenges can be reduced
      to the fundamental question about the relationship between humans and machines. She is
      mindful of this problem, and is thinking about how limitations can be built into the products
      that MAGS develops. Mark reminds the team that Ray Kurzweil has hypothesized that a
195   technological singularity will be reached in the mid-21st century. Margaret is concerned that the
      continued development of AI software could be a contributing factor to this, and that intelligent
      machines could unwittingly be involved in the next stage of human sociocultural evolution.
      These concepts have also been considered by Alan Turing and Isaac Asimov, and also appear
      in science fiction writings and films. Companies such as MAGS need to be aware of these
200   concerns when developing and designing AI-based products.
