Answer one question from this section.
1.   Visionary Toys (VT)

     Visionary Toys (VT) produces highly innovative toys for children. VT began operation in January
     2017 and its unique selling point/proposition (USP) is producing toy parts with a 3D printer. VT
     uses the reducing balance method of depreciation. 3D technology changes rapidly and the
     financial directors are also considering ways of reducing VT’s tax liabilities in 2018. The financial
     director presented financial information for VT at the end of 2017.

2.   Jill Anderson

     Jill Anderson operates a restaurant. Although Jill’s meals are viewed as being excellent quality,
     sales are slowing. Jill is considering replacing existing meals with gluten-free meals. The following
     financial and forecast information is for the month of May 2018. Jill’s restaurant can only produce
     either existing or gluten-free meals.

     Table 1: Existing meals

     Average price of existing meals = $8
     Rent = $2000 per month
     Variable cost per unit of existing meals = $5
     Sales of existing meals served = 800 per month
     Jill’s salary = $400 per month, which is paid irrespective of the level of sales

     Table 2: Estimated costs and price if Jill produces the gluten-free meals

     Average estimated price of gluten-free meal = $14
     Variable cost per unit of gluten-free meals = $10
     Sales forecast of gluten-free meals = 1200 per month
     Fixed cost increase for new machinery per month = $400

     A local gluten-free manufacturer, which is not part of Jill’s existing supply chain, has offered to
     supply already prepared gluten-free meals at $8 per meal. Jill is unsure whether to make or buy
     the gluten-free meals.

                              [Source: © International Baccalaureate Organization 2018]

     (b)   Calculate:

            (i)    the total contribution of existing meals sold per month (show all your working);        [2]

           (ii)    the total profit or loss on existing meals for May 2018 (show all your working);        [1]

           (iii)   the forecast profit or loss if Jill decides to make and sell gluten-free meals (show
                   all your working);                                                                      [2]

           (iv)    the contribution per unit of a gluten-free meal if Jill decides to buy-in the gluten-
                   free meals (show all your working).                                                     [1]

     (c)   Using your answer from (b) (iii) and (iv), explain whether Jill should buy-in or make the
           gluten-free meals herself.                                                                      [2]

                                                  Section B

Answer two questions from this section.

3.   Speedy Delivery (SD)

     Speedy Delivery (SD) is a private limited company that delivers freshly cooked meals by bicycle.
     SD only delivers. Restaurants subcontract SD to deliver meals to customers who place orders
     online and expect quick and efficient delivery. SD has been operating profitably for two years.
     Currently, it has the highest market share in the city.

     SD is now facing two issues:
     •  It operates at 98 % capacity utilization. Recently, some restaurant owners complained to SD
        that meals arrived late and cold to customers.
     • The market for home delivered, freshly cooked meals is growing quickly and some new delivery
        companies have just entered the market.

     The CEO wants to address the delivery quality issues and the threat of competitors, two of whom
     recently merged. He is considering an internal growth strategy involving investing in new electric
     scooters and employing more staff to deliver a greater number of meals more efficiently. SD must
     raise a large sum of finance. Major shareholders are in disagreement regarding the internal growth
     strategy.

     The financial manager has provided some financial information.

         Net profit margin (NPM)                          9%

(Question 3 continued)

     (a)   Define the term market share.                                                           [2]

     (b)   Explain one advantage and one disadvantage for SD of working at almost full capacity
           utilization.                                                                            [4]

     (c)   Explain one advantage and one disadvantage for SD of using an internal growth
           strategy.                                                                               [4]

4.   Healthy Start (HS)

     Tom Donat started Healthy Start (HS), a national chain of stores preparing and selling healthy
     snacks, which are produced in batches. HS’s target market is teenagers and young adults. Tom
     was concerned about high levels of fast food consumption and youth unemployment. His vision
     statement for HS is: “To encourage life-long healthy eating habits and to train school leavers (drop
     outs) in acquiring work skills”.

     HS hires many school leavers without qualifications. Because of the valuable social service that
     HS provides, an independent online media provider will feature HS in a new online reality TV show.

     All employees, including managers, start at the lowest level of the organizational hierarchy and
     train on the job. Job enlargement, job enrichment and intrapreneurship opportunities are available.
     20 % of all profits earned are put back into HS to finance these opportunities. Staff turnover is
     lower than the industry average.

     Competition from global fast food restaurants has intensified. Their economies of scale mean that
     HS struggles to increase its market share. Online reviews indicate that some customers perceive
     HS’s snacks as healthy but overpriced and with small-sized portions.

     Tom is considering two options:
     • Option 1: Implement flow production. HS will buy new technology and assign each
        employee to a specific job on the production line. HS will increase portion sizes and keep
        prices the same.
     • Option 2: Implement a new social media marketing campaign linked to the new online TV
        show. The campaign will focus on the health benefits of HS’s snacks.

     (a)   Describe one role of a vision statement for HS.                                             [2]

     (b)   Explain how the following can benefit HS:

            (i)   job enlargement;                                                                     [2]

           (ii)   intrapreneurship.                                                                    [2]

     (c)   Explain two possible economies of scale available to global fast food restaurants but
           not HS.                                                                                     [4]

     (d)   Discuss the two options that Tom is considering for HS in response to the intense
           competition.                                                                               [10]

5.   Taxi-M (TM)

     Taxi-M (TM) operates 2500 taxis in a developing country. All drivers are full-time employees
     and have a professional taxi license. Although not compulsory, TM regularly conducts safety
     inspections of the taxis. Though safe, most of TM’s taxis are old and TM charges high prices.
     Many customers complain.

     However, a multinational company, RE, with offices around the world, has started to offer a
     mobile application (app) called Best-Taxi (BT). Using their mobile phones, passengers can use
     BT to book and pay for a car journey. Any car owner can offer journeys through BT. For security
     reasons, the BT app registers passengers’ and drivers’ personal details.

     TM’s sales are falling and profits are down. A number of TM’s drivers are becoming demotivated.
     Facing lower incomes, poor management and rumours of redundancies, many loyal drivers have
     left to offer taxi services using their own cars and the BT app. Some of these drivers are earning
     considerably higher wages than before.

     The situation for TM appeared critical. However, local media have reported a higher rate of road
     accidents by BT drivers than licensed taxi drivers. Several of its drivers have assaulted and
     robbed customers. In response, TM’s management decided to downsize and differentiate itself
     from BT by positioning its service as a high-price, high-quality traditional taxi service. TM will:
     • sell older cars and lease new luxury cars
     • develop a unique selling point/proposition (USP) emphasizing comfort and safety.
     Customers can book taxis by telephone and by stopping them in the street. TM’s target market will
     be business people, higher income families and passengers concerned about safety.

     (a)   Define the term redundancy.                                                                     [2]

     (b)   Explain one positive and one negative impact of the multinational company, RE, on the
           developing country.                                                                             [4]

     (c)   With reference to Maslow’s motivation theory, explain two reasons that some TM
           drivers left to drive for BT.                                                                   [4]
