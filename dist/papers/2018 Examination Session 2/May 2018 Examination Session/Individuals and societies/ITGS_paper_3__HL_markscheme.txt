Examiners should be aware that in some cases, candidates may take a different approach, which if
appropriate should be rewarded. If in doubt, check with your Team Leader.

If candidates answer more than the prescribed number of questions:

• In the case of an “identify” question read all answers and mark positively up to the maximum marks.
  Disregard incorrect answers.

• In the case of a “describe” question, which asks for a certain number of facts eg “describe two kinds”,
  mark the first two correct answers. This could include two descriptions, one description and
  one identification, or two identifications.

• In the case of an “explain” question, which asks for a specified number of explanations eg “explain
  two reasons”, mark the first two correct answers. This could include two full explanations,
  one explanation, one partial explanation etc.

1.   (a)   Alicia will have sensors that use voice recognition.

           Identify two additional sensors that may be added to provide for a more
           sophisticated product.                                                                 [2]

           Answers may include a range of internal and external sensors that could be
           incorporated into the doll, such as:
           • pressure sensors to respond to touch from the child
           • proximity sensors to detect child coming into room
           • nearness sensors to respond to approach of a child
           • heat sensors to detect heat of touch or body
           • orientation sensor / gyroscope to detect position of doll in space
           • speed detectors to detect movement of the doll
           • light sensor - in conjunction with other sensors to power off the doll
           • biometric sensor - to determine the identify of who is holding her.

           Note to examiners: When a student provides two similar sensors eg Motion or
           movement - only accept as one.

           Award [1] mark for identifying each additional sensor that may be added to
           provide for a more sophisticated product up to a maximum of [2] marks.

     (b)   When Alicia is initially activated after purchase, it will ask a number of questions
           to configure the most appropriate profile for the child.

           Identify two questions that could be asked.                                            [2]

           Answers may include questions about:
           • personal items (gender, age, skin colour, nationality, school grade, language,
             name, etc)
           • family relationships (mother, father, how many brothers, sisters, pets etc)
           • surroundings (home environment, address etc)
           • likes and hobbies (swimming, walking, games, TV shows, films, books, etc)
           • dislikes (behaviors, opposite to likes).

           Award [1] mark for identifying each question that could be used to configure the
           most appropriate profile for that child up to a maximum of [2] marks.

2.   (a)   Alicia records data about the child’s behaviour.

           Explain one way that this data could be made compatible for use with
           other systems.                                                                            [2]

           Answers may include:
                 [1 mark] A standard data storage format is required. The student may
                 give an example eg xml, csv, some sort of fixed data field, or any other
                 suitable format
              • [1 mark] Any form of data storage format. An explanation of how the
                 data storage format of the behaviour and interactions will be compatible
                 or can be used between Alicia and the other system. Eg researching
                 industry standard or exporting into another system.

           The explanation should be generic as the details of the IT behind the file formats
           is beyond the current course.

     (b)   Explain the sequence of steps that take place when Alicia responds to what the child is
           saying.                                                                                   [4]

           Input:
           Answers will need to include a set of steps from data entry, to processing, to
           output/feedback:
           • the child’s voice is recorded by Alicia
           • analogue sound waves are converted to digital and sent to be processed by
              Alicia
           • the recording is sent to a natural language processing unit in the doll or in the
              cloud.

           Processing:
           • voice recognition software converts the digital sound by dividing it into
              segments which is then matched to a particular language
           • the meaning of the words in the deep learning based AI in the doll is used to
              determine a response after being combined with other data about the child’s
              behavior
           • the doll is trained to understand the words spoken by the child
           • tone of speech is analysed and compared to the database to identify the
              emotional behaviour of the child
           • the doll is trained to recognise who is speaking
           • the response is determined by consulting the most recent profile stored on the
              doll.

           Output
           • an appropriate response to the child may be with supporting example (verbal
             reply, physical action)
           • if the AI software within Alicia cannot determine an appropriate response the
             doll will send the data for processing to the AI software in the cloud.

           Accept appropriate and valid steps that are in sequence but not in the markscheme.
           If in doubt consult your team leader.

3.   A number of organizations are interested in obtaining the data that is collected and
     stored by MAGS from the interactions between Alicia and each child. MAGS is
     responsible for this data, and the problems that could arise if this data was sold to third
     parties (lines 153–166).

     To what extent could data privacy and protection principles be applied to how this data
     is stored, accessed and used?                                                                      [8]

     Answers may include:
     • candidates would need to justify how the various data privacy and protection
       principles can be applied with reference to the case study
     • a balanced application would include a discussion of how the principles can and
       cannot be applied, and the reasons why. A judgment would need to be made where
       not all three areas in the question are addressed in a balanced way
     • only one principle needs to be used for each of the three areas (store, access and
       use). A balance would be easier if more than one was used
     • no overall conclusion is needed but candidates would be expected to justify the
       application to each of the three areas (store, access and use) in the question in the
       context of the case study
     • a generic set of principles can be found at this link, but most countries have
       legislated a set of laws that could also be used by the candidate

       Principles
     • students may approach this question by responding on the steps to protect the
       privacy of data eg:
     • storage - security methods e.g. encryption, access control, no excessive data
       stored, length of time stored
     • sharing - gaining permission, policies on how the data is reshared
     • use - data used for its original purpose, no illegal use of data.

4.   There have already been concerns raised by parents about the deep-learning AI
     version of the doll. As a result Margaret is considering whether to develop a version of
     Alicia that is based on the original generic profile and does not share any data with the
     cloud-based services.

     Discuss whether MAGS should continue to develop the cloud-based deep learning AI
     version of Alicia or introduce a simpler version that only uses the original generic
     profile.                                                                                      [12]

     For a balanced response, the student needs to address both advantages and
     disadvantages for the main stakeholders – MAGS, the child and the parent.

     The reasons for/against the child and the parents overlap and can be addressed from
     either perspective, eg the lower cost of the simpler doll could be an advantage from the
     child’s view as the parents could be convinced to buy it; and from the parent’s perspective
     they would be more willing to purchase the doll as a present. Similarly, for MAGS and the
     other stakeholders. Students do not have to discuss the reasons for/against for both
     options in order to gain access to the higher mark bands.

     A balanced analysis should include connections between the various stakeholders and
     between the advantages and disadvantages. Basic analysis could be displayed through
     the structure of the response: sections for the various stakeholders and the positive and
     negative reasons.

     Reasons for/against simple toy:

     Child/parent
     • privacy of the child’s interactions is kept
     • functionality of the toy would be diminished if it could not learn properly
     • the cost of the simpler toy would be less
     • parents will know the full capabilities of the doll and not need to worry about any
       inappropriate behaviour developing.

     MAGS
     • the popularity of the doll could be lessened if functionality is reduced
     • MAGS would lose the opportunity to develop AI software that could be used in other
       products of their own and other companies
     • toy would be cheaper to produce
     • toy could have enhanced functionality included later increasing sales
     • simple toy introduced so that later ono there is scope for product extension or
       product development (existing market will go and buy next version / brand loyalty)
     • MAGS may not stay competitive if other toy companies develop more AI enhanced
       toys
     • the child may soon get bored of the doll and not play with it anymore.

     • the toy would have increased functionality so the child would enjoy the toy more
     • parents would be worried about privacy issues and the issue of dependency on the
        doll impacting the child’s life
     • It is possible that the doll can be hacked and programmed to develop undesirable
        behaviour
     • child may learn undesirable behaviour or pick up bad habits
     • parents may rely on this developed doll which will replace some of the interactions
        with their child e.g. reading a story at bed time.

     MAGS
     • MAGS would be able to develop much better AI software
     • MAGS could enter the market with a “successful” product to see if it would be worth
       the money and effort to develop and sell a fully functional doll
     • MAGS would need to be prepared for dealing with the privacy and other issues
       associated with the collection and use of children’s interaction data
     • MAGS can use this data to improve on Alicia’s performance and send updates to
       Alicia based on the analysis of the data collected
     • MAGS will need to develop ways to maintain limitations of how Alicia behaves.

    4–6 marks
                      strategies that are no more than unsubstantiated statements.
                      The analysis underpinning them may also be partial or unbalanced.
                    • Implicit references are made to the information in the case study or
                      independent research in the response.

    7–9 marks
                      limited support and are underpinned by a balanced analysis.
                    • Explicit references to the information in the case study or
                      independent research are made at places in the response.
                    • A response with a detailed knowledge and understanding of the
                      relevant ITGS issues and/or concepts.
                    • A response that uses ITGS terminology appropriately throughout.
     Proficient
                    • A response that includes conclusions, judgments or future
   10–12 marks        strategies that are well supported and underpinned by a balanced
                      analysis.
                    • Explicit references are made appropriately to the information in the
                      case study and independent research throughout the response.
