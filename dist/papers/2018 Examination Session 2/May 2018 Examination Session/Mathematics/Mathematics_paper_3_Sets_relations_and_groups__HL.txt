Please start each question on a new page. Full marks are not necessarily awarded for a correct answer
with no working. Answers must be supported by working and/or explanations. In particular, solutions
found from a graphic display calculator should be supported by suitable working. For example, if
graphs are used to find a solution, you should sketch these as part of your answer. Where an answer
is incorrect, some marks may be given for a correct method, provided this is shown by written working.
You are therefore advised to show all working.
