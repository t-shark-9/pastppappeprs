Maximum marks will be given for correct answers. Where an answer is incorrect, some marks may
be given for a correct method, provided this is shown by written working. Answers must be written within
the answer boxes provided. Solutions found from a graphic display calculator should be supported by
suitable working, for example, if graphs are used to find a solution, you should sketch these as part of
your answer.

     The mean point, M, for these data is (40 , 16).


     (a)   Plot and label the point M (m , p ) on the scatter diagram.                                                                                  [2]

     (c)   Using your line of best fit, estimate the physics test score for a student with a score
           of 20 in their mathematics test.                                                                                                             [2]

3.   Last year a South American candy factory sold 4.8 × 108 spherical sweets. Each sweet has
     a diameter of 2.5 cm.

     The factory is producing an advertisement showing all of these sweets placed in a straight line.



                           2.5 cm         2.5 cm            2.5 cm               2.5 cm

13.   A factory produces shirts. The cost, C , in Fijian dollars (FJD), of producing x  shirts can be
      modelled by

                                       C (x) = (x - 75)2 + 100 .

      (a)   Find the cost of producing 70 shirts.                                                                                    [2]

      The cost of production should not exceed 500 FJD. To do this the factory needs to produce
      at least 55 shirts and at most s   shirts.

      (b)   Find the value of s .                                                                                                    [2]

      (c)   Find the number of shirts produced when the cost of production is lowest.                                                [2]

15.   Julio is making a wooden pencil case in the shape of a large pencil. The pencil case consists
      of a cylinder attached to a cone, as shown.

      The cylinder has a radius of r  cm and a height of 12 cm.

      The cone has a base radius of r  cm and a height of 10 cm.

                                                                                  diagram not to scale

      (a)   Find an expression for the slant height of the cone in terms of r .                          [2]

      The total external surface area of the pencil case rounded to 3 significant figures is 570 cm2.

      (b)   Using your graphic display calculator, calculate the value of r .                            [4]
