Answer all questions in the answer booklet provided. Please start each question on a new page.
You are advised to show all working, where possible. Where an answer is incorrect, some marks may
be given for a correct method, provided this is shown by written working. Solutions found from a graphic
display calculator should be supported by suitable working, for example, if graphs are used to find a
solution, you should sketch these as part of your answer.

     In a company it is found that 25 % of the employees encountered traffic on their way to work.
     From those who encountered traffic the probability of being late for work is 80 %.

     From those who did not encounter traffic, the probability of being late for work is 15 %.

     The tree diagram illustrates the information.

                                                                     late for

(Question 1 continued)

     The company investigates the different means of transport used by their employees in the
     past year to travel to work. It was found that the three most common means of transport
     used to travel to work were public transportation (P ), car (C ) and bicycle (B ).

     The company finds that 20 employees travelled by car, 28 travelled by bicycle and
     19 travelled by public transportation in the last year.

     Some of the information is shown in the Venn diagram.

     The Tower of Pisa is well known worldwide for how it leans.

     Giovanni visits the Tower and wants to investigate how much it is leaning. He draws a diagram
     showing a non-right triangle, ABC.

     On Giovanni’s diagram the length of AB is 56 m, the length of BC is 37 m, and angle ACB is 60.
     AX is the perpendicular height from A to BC.
