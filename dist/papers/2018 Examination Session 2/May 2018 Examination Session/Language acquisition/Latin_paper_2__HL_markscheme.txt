Option A: Vergil

1.   (a)    Eurydice is likened to smoke/mist dispersing into the air (ceu fumus in auras commixtus);
            Orpheus is likened to a nightingale grieving/weeping (qualis maerens philomela). Reponses
            must include all these Latin words. Each simile must be attributed to the correct person at
            least implicitly.

     (b)    Award [3] if the meaning has been fully communicated, and vocabulary and grammar are
            rendered correctly. Award [2] if the meaning has been communicated, and vocabulary and

            (locomotion must be implicit). Accept details from line 510 only.

     (d)    Orpheus’s grief is emphasized through the extent of time (septem menses; totos menses; not ex
            ordine without menses) [1]; he wept (flesse) [1]; the wildness of the context (rupe sub aeria or
            deserti ad Strymonis undam or gelidis sub antris) [1]; and the power of his song (mulcentem
            tigres et agentem carmine quercus) [1]. Accept tigres if explained eg as ‘he did not mind the
            company of wild animals’, but tigres can only earn 1 mark, ie it cannot be rewarded for both
            wilderness of context and power of song. Accept answers based on style if well argued.

                                                                                                 Total: [10]

            wound is aeternum.

     (b)    Mark only for length of syllables. Award [1] per line if all correct, [0] otherwise.

            • direct speech/monologue/soliloquy to give listeners access to Juno’s inner
               thoughts/feelings: haec secum (37) or other relevant reference

               enforced restraint: exurere (39), disiecit (43), evertit (43).
            • hendiadys points out the diminished responsibility of Ajax, whom Minerva is allowed to punish
               whereas Juno may not punish the Trojan’s deliberate offences: ob noxiam et furias (41)
            • the otiose ipsa (42) reinforces Pallasne to show Juno’s enduring resentment
            • vivid description of Ajax’s death to reflect Juno’s resentment with relevant Latin (44–45)
            • Sibilance/hissing sounds suggest Juno’s bitterness with relevant Latin (line 44 and passim)

            • contrast (polyptoton) of the objects of anger to point out perceived unfairness (Minerva
               was offended by one man, Juno by an entire people): unius Aiacis … una cum gente (41–
               47).
            • the chiasmus in 41 (unius noxam furias Aiacis) draws attention to the smallness of
               Minerva’s insult
            • attention drawn to length of unsatisfied outrage: tot annos / present tense of gero (47-48)
            • irony/rhetorical questions to suggest indignation: quisquam … honorem (48-49)

Instructions
Section B is assessed by the assessment criteria found below and published in the subject guide.

Criterion A (Range of evidence) assesses to what extent the evidence represents both prescribed
passages and supplementary reading. A candidate is expected to:
• use relevant examples from the prescribed passages to support the response (candidates are not
   expected to provide exact quotes)
• demonstrate knowledge of historical, political and cultural contexts beyond those embedded in the
   prescribed passages.

Criterion B (Understanding and argument) assesses how well the response demonstrates understanding
of the chosen option. Ideally, a candidate will:
• build a critical analysis that responds directly to the prompt in a clear, logical and imaginative way
• fully address the contexts and background knowledge pertinent to the examples related to the chosen
    option.
