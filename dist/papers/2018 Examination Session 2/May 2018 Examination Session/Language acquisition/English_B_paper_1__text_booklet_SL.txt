                  Remembrance Day for Lost Species
        Every hour, three species of lifeform vanish from our planet forever. Almost all of this species
         loss is a direct result of human activity. As a response to this fact, Remembrance Day for
         Lost Species was created and marked worldwide on 30th November.

        The initiative began in 2010. From the start, the aim was to create an event which is accessible
         to anyone who wishes to honor extinct species. Memorial activities in past years have ranged
         from lighting a single candle to holding funeral ceremonies for lost species.




        Both artists and scientists were involved in establishing Remembrance Day for Lost Species.
         The interdisciplinary nature of the day reflects our strong desire that the event should be as
         inclusive as possible. The initiative hopes to encourage people to commit anew to doing what
         they can to ensure that at-risk species have a future.

        Those of us behind Remembrance Day for Lost Species have found that creative activities are
         an invaluable way to develop a sense of the value of biodiversity. Of course, Remembrance
         Day for Lost Species does not have to be about art, science, or anything more than taking a
         moment to reflect upon what humans have done to many species.

        We are delighted with the enthusiasm which so many people have already shown for the idea
         and sincerely hope that this reflects an appetite to engage more deeply with the rest of nature.

           Amazing discovery about a woman from The
                         Great Hunger
        This newspaper illustration is one of the most iconic images from The Great
         Hunger in Ireland, a famine which led to the loss of approximately one million lives
         between 1845 and 1852. The mother and her children have become symbols
         for the thousands of mothers and children who suffered and died, struggled and
         survived during these years.

        But she is not a mere symbol. She was a real person with a real story, and the
         subject of what was possibly the first human interest interview in the history
         of journalism.

        Bridget O’Donnel was a poor famine victim whose story appeared in The Illustrated London
         News on December 22, 1849. Forced to leave her home while pregnant, O’Donnel endured
         losing her child at birth and her thirteen-year old son due to starvation. Her fate after the
         interview remains unknown.

        Michael Foley’s essay, Death in Every Paragraph: Journalism and the Great Irish Famine,
         explores how the press reported on The Famine and how it shaped the future of journalism.
         As Foley explains, the interview with O’Donnel was highly unusual for the time. “Newspapers
         and periodicals did not deal in human interest stories, and did not tell their readers about
         the poor. The only way people like Bridget O’Donnel would normally have been named in a
         newspaper was if she had appeared in court, had been before a public hearing or tribunal,
         had been a witness, or the subject of an inquest.”

        O’Donnel was none of these, and the interview – conducted by James Mahoney, who also
         drew the sketch of O’Donnel with her surviving children – represents a historic milestone for
         that reason. “What was unprecedented about O’Donnel was not only that she was named,
         but that this poor Irish Famine victim was projected onto the international news stage, and her
         own words were used to convince the world of the massive social and political injustice endured
         by the people of Ireland,” Foley writes.

        The Great Hunger forced journalists in Ireland to rethink the way they approached telling
         the news.

        “The great calamity  [ – X – ]  Europe in the nineteenth century leaving one million dead and
         forcing another three million to emigrate and had a  [ – 27 – ]  impact on the future of journalism.
         The changes that were  [ – 28 – ]  upon Ireland by The Famine were eventually  [ – 29 – ]  to the

         the post-Famine period,” Foley writes.

                                       The Eden Project
         The Eden Project, an educational charity, explores how we
         can work towards a better future. This visitor destination is
         nestled in a huge crater. Stunning plants, exhibitions, and
         massive biomes1 housing the largest rainforest in captivity all
    5    serve as a backdrop to our striking contemporary gardens.

         The core building is a place where you can learn about
         everything from ecosystems and evolution to climate
         change and plant resources. Its design is based on nature’s
         architecture. It incorporates a central trunk and canopy roof that shades the ground and
10       harvests the sun. The most striking feature – the roof created from an intricate web of curved
         timber beams – is based on Fibonacci spirals2, a pattern found in many natural forms.

         [–X–]
         We worked with mechanical and electrical consultants to reduce the environmental impact of the
         building as much as possible. Innovative features include:

15                  [ – 36 – ]
                     o Underground tubes warm the air before it enters the building.
                     o The walls are super-insulated, made from recycled newspapers.
                     o A lobby reduces heat loss through the front door.

                    [ – 37 – ]
20                   Panels on the roof provide electricity although the building is mainly powered
                     through a renewable energy tariff.

                    [ – 38 – ]
                     The green tiles in the floor were originally beer bottles. The entrance mats are
                     made from recycled tyres, and the cafe floor is made up of reclaimed wood.

25                  Concrete Choices
                     We tried to reduce the amount of cement needed because we know that producing
                     cement is a carbon-intensive process which harms the environment. For this
                     reason, the project team’s design removed the need for concrete support pillars
                     wherever possible. For the cement we did need, we opted for Portland cement
30                   because the producers were committed to the reduction of carbon dioxide in the
                     manufacturing process. We sourced a recycled aggregate to make up the remaining
                     90 % of the concrete.
