You must make sure you have looked at all pages. Please put the          annotation on any blank page,
to indicate that you have seen it.

When using the On page Comment annotation, please keep the following in mind:
  • Avoid covering the candidate’s own writing. This can be done by writing your comments in the
    margins then running the arrow attached to the “On page comment” annotation to the appropriate
    place.
  • Provide all comments in the target language.
  • You may provide summative comments at the end of the script, but please do NOT record
    numerical marks on the scripts.

The translation is assessed in its basic units of clause and sentence. To this end, the original text is
chunked in a fixed number of sections (or “sense units”), 15 at SL and 30 at HL. Every section is
awarded two separate marks according to the two descriptors outlined below.

Each section is awarded 0 to 3 marks for descriptor A (Meaning) and 0 to 3 marks for descriptor B
(Vocabulary & Grammar).

The range of marks for each section is therefore 0 to 6, while the maximum number of marks for the
whole text is 180 at HL (30 sections × 6 marks).

Criterion A (Meaning) assesses how well the meaning of each sense unit has been communicated.

Criterion B (Vocabulary & Grammar) assesses how correctly vocabulary and grammar have been
rendered in relation to each sense unit. The term “grammar” here includes syntax and accidence.

As a guideline, criterion A tends to look at the translation as a whole (eg stylistic, literal and idiomatic
meanings conveyed), while criterion B tends to assess the conformity of the single section with the
original text (eg grammatical accuracy of translation, apparent understanding of source language syntax
and vocabulary).

While it may not always be possible to give the full range of marks for a single sense unit, the range of
marks necessary for differentiation is present over the whole exam.

By way of example, the marking of different translations of the sense unit ἐπεὶ δὲ σπονδαί τε ἐγένοντο
found in a Xenophon passage (HL specimen papers), would be as follows:
• “When both the libations occurred”: A=3, B=3.
• “After religious activities happened”: A=2 (the meaning has been partially communicated; errors
   impair the translation), B=3 (most grammar is rendered accurately).
• “When they were libation makers”: A=3, B=2 (some vocabulary and grammar are rendered
   appropriately).
• “There were religious rites”: A=2 (the meaning has been partially communicated; errors impair the
   translation), B=1 (the meaning has been partially communicated; limited grammar is rendered
   accurately).
• “When pouring out was being”: A=1 (the translation conveys some meaning), B=2 (some vocabulary
   and some grammar are rendered appropriately).

Square brackets [ ] indicate that the words in the sense unit have been inserted out of the order of the
text.
