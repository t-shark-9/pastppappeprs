Extended response questions – quality of construction

     •   Extended response questions for SLP2 carry a mark total of [16]. Of these marks, [15] are awarded for content and [1] for the quality of
         the answer.

     •   [1] for quality is awarded when:
          • the candidate’s answers are clear enough to be understood without re-reading.
          • the candidate has answered the question succinctly with little or no repetition or irrelevant material.

                Evidence that colour does not play a role:

                  For any non-pathogenic disease being addressed, look for the following components            is explained.
                  ● name of disease/condition.
                  ● factor/category e.g.: genetic, lifestyle, environmental, psychological, multi-factoral.    For accuracy of individual answers,
                  ● description/symptoms of disease.                                                           check resources.
                  ● cause of disease.

                  At least 2 of these qualities must be present to earn any marks for a disease or
                  category/factor
                  For this question use the unlettered tick. Award 4 MAX if only one condition is
