23.   The Jerrycan, see Figure 10, was developed in Germany in the 1930s for military use.
      It became a much sought-after item because it was engineered to a much higher standard than
      the competition and contained many innovative features, including indentations in the walls that
      allowed for expansion and increased strength, and a handle design that allowed it to be carried by
      one or two people. Its iconic status is demonstrated by continued availability of and the use of the
      term “Jerrycan” in reference to all fuel containers.

Questions 36 – 40 relate to the following case study. Please read the case study carefully and answer
the questions.

When the Italian manufacturer Alessi commissioned the architect Michael Graves to design a new
kettle, the company stipulated two requirements. They wanted a hob kettle that would come to the boil
quickly, and that looked American. Graves realised that a fast boil could be achieved by making the
kettle the right shape, with a broad base that tapered towards the top, see Figure 14, but making it look
American was more of a challenge. In the end, he looked back to the childhood summers he spent on
a farm in Indiana for inspiration. He remembered waking to the sound of boiling water and the rooster
crowing, so he gave the kettle a whistle in the form of a coloured bird that screeched when steam from
the boiling water rushed up the spout, see Figure 15. This witty reference to the past was typical of the
Postmodern movement in design and architecture of the 1970s and 1980s.

Developed in 1985, Graves’ Alessi kettle with a bird whistle remains an iconic design with one of its
successes being that it meets all four aspects or criteria of the four-pleasure framework.
