1.   (a)   Award [2] for one method that is suitable for the given scenario.

           Answers may include:
           Interviews could be held (with the librarian/stakeholders);
           To establish the functions required by the system;

           Direct observation could be made of the users/students using the present
           system;
           To gain an insight on how the library is being used;                           [2 max]

     (b)   Allows stakeholders to gain an idea of how the system would be/work/look;
           so they can provide feedback / suggest improvements;                               [2]


2.   Holds (a copy of) the contents of the memory;
     Which are to be transferred from/to memory to/from other CPU components;
     Allowing the processor and memory to act independently/processor not affected by
     differences in the speed of operation;                                               [2 max]


3.   2 hex = 4 + 4 = 8 bits;
     hence 2^8/16^2/256 colours;
     Note: Allow [2] for 256 colours with no workings and also ONLY 256                       [2]


4.   Award [3] as follows:
     The function of the memory management [1].
     An example if its use [1].
     Reason for the importance [1].

     Example:
     Allocates and de-allocates memory/ assigns blocks of memory to programs;
     Ensures a program has sufficient memory to run/manages virtual memory if needed;
     To avoid overwriting /clashing of programs/optimise system performance/maximise
     memory usage                                                                             [3]


5.   Award [3] as follows:
     Clearly a logic diagram with 2 inputs, 1 output and 3 logic gates [1];

7.    Process/method/ procedure/ subroutine/ function/ algorithm that calls itself;              [1]


8.    Award [2].
      FIFO data structure;
      Items can be added only to one end (rear/tail) and removed from the other end
      (front/head);                                                                              [2]

9.    Award [3].
      Award [1] for size comparison.
      Award [1] for access comparison.
      Award [1] for relation to the given scenario.

      Example:
      Size/length of a static array is predetermined/fixed / size of a linked list
      can be changed / size of a linked list depends only on memory available;
      Linked list can be expanded to suit the daily sales;
      Each item in a static array can be directly accessed whilst access to the items
      in a linked list is sequential;
      And searching for the given item in the linked list is slower /an item in the linked
      list cannot be searched for using binary
      search;                                                                                    [3]

10.   Award [2 max].
      An interrupt is a signal to the CPU sent by hardware or software;
      The function of an interrupt is to alert the CPU to suspend execution of the current
      program;
      And to transfer the control to the interrupt handler (which saves the state of the
      current program to the interrupt stack, services the interrupt and resumes the normal
      CPU activity);                                                                             [2]

            Iterate through the patients file until record for that ID found;
            Retrieve phone number and send out SMS;

            Example:
            loop for every appointment in the appointments file
               if the appointment is for the correct day
                   Store patient ID

                         if patient ID (patients file) = patient ID (appointments file)
                             get phone number from patient’s file to send SMS
                         end if
                      end loop
               end if
            end loop

(c)   There are 2 possible issues here: who has what level of access to the data in the
      hospital and whether storing in the cloud is safer than storing locally.

      For each of these 2 issues award [3 max] as follows:
      Award [1] for identifying the issue.
      Award [1] for some valid development of the issue.
      Award [1] for a suitable discussion.

      Example answers could include reference to the following but this is not an
      exclusive list. Award marks for any two reasonable issues discussed – one of
      which is access and the other security.

      Official access to the data [3 max]:
      Access to this sensitive data must be restricted.
      Only those directly concerned can be able to access it.
      Even less people should be able to edit it.
      Therefore access levels should be set up, with strong levels of authentication.
      Physical access to servers should be controlled if using the local system;

      Data security [3 max]:
      Is the data safer stored locally or on the cloud?
      Cloud service providers are professionals – they should have stronger security
      than a hospital system.
      What track record / reputation does the cloud service provider has?
      If patient data could be sold/inspected, then both the patient and hospital could
      suffer serious consequences.
      Is the cloud governed by appropriate privacy laws?
      Is it located internationally or is it governed by the laws of the country in
      question?
      Could be intercepted in transmission;                                               [6 max]

12.   (a)   Processes/task are carried out simultaneously/at the same time;                         [1]

      (b)   Install connectors on wall of server room AND Install connector on wall of new
            office space;

            OR

            Test the cabling AND Connect the new computers with the cabling;                    [1 max]

      (c)   Any pair of tasks that are NOT a correct answer to part (b);                        [1 max]

      (d)   Award [1] for stating an advantage, [1] for expansion/example in context.
            Mark as [2] and [2]

            Answers may include:
            Use on the move;
            More versatile staff encouraged to collaborate etc.;

            Allows BYOD:
            Which could lead to greater productivity (as familiarity with device);

            No extra equipment is needed for expansion after initial set-up;
            Which will save the company time and money;

            Reduces wiring;
            Therefore improved safety for employees;                                            [4 max]

      (e)   Mark as [2] and [2].

            The data can be intercepted as it goes through “the air”;
            Can be resolved by strong encryption/protocols;
            WPA-2 / a description of WPA-2;
            Use of trusted MAC addresses;
            Regular changes of router password; [2 max]

            BYOD issues leading to insecure devices;
            Clear company policy regarding use;
            Use of sand-box;
            Only approved devices allowed;
            MAC addresses – only adding clean and tested devices brought in by staff;
            Installation of MDM services;
            Authentication (user ID + password on all devices including BYOD);
            Security features added by company; [2 max]                                         [4 max]

      (f)   A VPN/ tunneling allows the employee’s device to appear to be part of / a node of
            the internal company network;
            Thus affording him/her full access to the network resources;

            Data that passes through a VPN can be encrypted;
            So any unauthorized access will not be able to understand the data;

            Tunnelling allows the company’s own protocols to be used/IPsec/TSL ensure
            security;
            Even though the data is passing over an outside network;

            Multiple exit nodes / hidden IP addresses/encrypted connections;
            Make it hard to distinguish where the data was generated;                           [4 max]

                 if X == NAME
                   then NAMEDEPTH=DEPTH
                 DEPTH = DEPTH + 1
              end while
              if NAMEDEPTH == -1
                 then output(NAME + ’not found’)
                 else output(NAMEDEPTH)
              endif
            end searchName

            Award [1] for initialization.
            Award [1] for a correct while/until loop.
            Award [1] for correct comparison and assignment.
            Award [1] for updating and outputting correct position of NAME on the

            Award [1] for use of stack methods (pop() and isEmpty())                         [5]

            Example answer 2:

            NAME=input()
            CSTK = STACK.copy() // must make a real copy,
            //any attempt to make a copy of stack is acceptable

(b)   Award [3 max].

      Example answer 1 (time efficiency):
      The data in the binary search tree(BST) is ordered;
      Such that as each node is checked for the item, half of the remaining nodes
      are ignored;
      But each element in the stack has to be checked;
      Which, for large data sets, may be inefficient compared to the BST;

      Example answer 2 (memory efficiency):
      Each element on the stack has to be popped off/removed from the stack to
      be checked for the searched item;
      When the item is found the stack will be empty/stack contents will be changed;
      When an element in the BST is checked for the item it is not removed from the
      BST;
      So there is no need to create an additional copy of the BST (but a real copy of
      the stack must be created which for large data sets may be inefficient);                [3 max]

(c)   Award [4 max].

      Example answer:
      The (next) stack item is (placed into a new node and) compared (alphabetically)
      to the root;
      If the root is empty it would be placed here (and this recursive procedure
      terminates);
      Else, depending upon the comparison, it would look to the node to the left or right
      and the (recursive) procedure calls itself again (with the new root);
      If it is lower than the root, then the left child of the root becomes the new root;
      If it is higher than the root, then the right child of the root becomes the new root;

      Note: Marks should also be awarded for an algorithm constructed in pseudocode.              [4]
