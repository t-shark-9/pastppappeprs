General comment to examiners
Please note that the markscheme is provided as guidance for marking. There are many potential and
valid ways in which to approach the questions and examiners need, therefore, to use their judgment
when attributing marks to a candidate’s answers. Examiners are also reminded to accept
cultural/geographical differences in terminology (eg quavers/eighth notes).

Each question is worth [20 marks].

                                              Section A
This criterion concerns the candidate’s ability to:
 question 1 or question 2 – analyse and examine essential musical elements (including form and
   structure) within one of the two prescribed works
 question 3 (HL only) – compare and contrast the two prescribed works, emphasizing the presence of
   any significant musical links.

          The responses communicate without the use of musical terminology, or where musical
          terminology is applied, it is generally not relevant and/or inaccurate. However, a rudimentary
          understanding of terminology in relation to the material/topic in question may surface on
          occasion.

Note: The following indicative content is for guidance only, and by no means meant to suggest that
candidates should be marked according to the extent that their answer resembles these suggestions. It
is quite possible for candidates to come up with good responses other than these, which should be
credited accordingly.

Examiners may find the following resources helpful:

Brandenburg Concerto No 2 in F major by Johann Sebastian Bach
Various editions of the score are available online for free download, eg at:

http://imslp.org/wiki/Brandenburg_Concerto_No.2_in_F_major,_BWV_1047_(Bach,_Johann_Sebastian)

Dances of Galánta by Zoltán Kodály
The score of the work is still in copyright and no free download versions as such are available, but a
digital copy of the score used by André Kostelanetz when conducting the New Philharmonic is available
(for viewing, not printing) at:

http://archives.nyphil.org/index.php/artifact/db9cbad7-6e9c-4dc1-bc81-08439b597b11

Note: Examiners should be aware that there is an error in the bar/measure numbering of Dances of
Galánta. The indication for bar/measure 95 has actually been placed in bar 96, and all numbers following
this are one lower than they should be. Some candidates will have been alerted to this by their teachers,
but others will not, and will simply use the bar/measure numbers given in good faith. We have therefore
decided to accept both possibilities and examiners will need to remember that the bar numbers provided
by some candidates may be one more than those given in the score. As these differ only by one
bar/measure, however, it should be easy to distinguish such “adjustments” of the numbering from actual
errors in location.

1.   Brandenburg Concerto No 2 in F major by Johann Sebastian Bach
     Analyse how the second movement of Bach’s Brandenburg Concerto No 2 in F Major develops
     from the opening melody. The opening melody appears in bars 1 to 4.

     The answers should refer to the prescribed work.

     Answers should address the question and be consistent and convincing in their display of musical
     understanding. Evidence should be located by using bar(s)/measure(s), rehearsal number(s),
     and/or instrument(s) in the works/extracts. Musical terminology should be effective in its use.

     The question is very specific and invites candidates to demonstrate their analytical abilities by
     examining the initial four bars and subsequent development. References should be made to the
     theme, intervallic structure and its constituent motifs which appear in various contexts throughout
     the movement.

     Section 1: bars 1–22
      The violin presents the theme from which the movement develops in bars 1–4b1. The theme is
        treated in two ways: firstly, by imitative polyphony, and secondly through development of its
        constituent motifs and principally the two-note ‘tail’ first heard at bar 3b3 – bar4b1
      The solo parts are derived from the theme in bars 1 – 4b1 through motivic development,
        including imitation. The oboe enters at bar 3 with the first imitation at the unison. Similarly, the
        flute enters at the octave in bar 5.
      The motif at bar 3b4 – bar4b1 comprised of a falling or rising semitone is presented throughout
        the movement as suspensions, accented passing notes or appoggiaturas. It forms the
        consequent of the opening phrase. The rising minor third and consequent minor second are
        also structural elements which recur, representing the second type of derivation from the
        principal theme. They may be considered as motifs from the theme.
      Within the first section, the principal theme continues to be treated imitatively and with the
        addition of wider intervals such as the minor 6th [flute, bar 9b3], perfect 5th [oboe, bar 10b3]. All
        motivic elements constituting the theme continue to be integrated contrapuntally between
        bars 10 and 15.
      From bar 15b3 the oboe leads with a variant of the theme, complemented by the flute which
        plays a variant on the motif changed to a tone [C – B-flat] rather than the initial semitone
        Another variant of the theme appears as imitation at the unison in bar 17 by the violin and
        finally by the flute at the octave in bar 19.
      The motif is presented in 6ths and 3rds embellished with figures from minor 2nd and 3rd intervals
        thus demonstrating their formal and derivative relationships.

     Section 2: bars 23–32
      The violin leads with a third episode where the principal theme undergoes further modification
        including an initial change from a semitone to a tone. The harmonic rhythm increases in bar
        25 through to the perfect cadence on D minor in bar 29.
      Imitation continues in the flute at bar 25b3, with a further entry from the oboe at bar 27b3. It
        plays the original form of the theme except for a tonal change of E to E-flat in bar 30 as the
        modulation progresses via IV of VI in B-flat at bar 33. The arrival of B-flat marks the beginning
        of the third section of the design.

Section 3: bars 33–57
 The section begins with antiphonal exchanges of the ‘tail’ motif in close imitation. As before,
   the instruments are doubled in consonant 3rds or 6ths.
 Another imitative episode begins with the flute from bar 37b3, this time featuring a rising perfect
   5th (bar 38) in place of the initial minor 3rd. However, the answer retains the minor 3rd in the
   oboe’s entry.
 The scale figure from bar 11 reappears in oboe at bar 41 and then in flute from bar 42–43. The
   key is G minor, the subdominant minor.
 The passage from bar 45 to 57 is derived from the ‘tail’ motif (bars 3b1–4b1) as identified. The
   flute entry from bar 37b3 is tonally imitated in the oboe at bar 43b3 and the section unfolds as a
   development of the previous few bars (33–37), but retains both theme and motif in a
   contrapuntal relationship.

Section 4: bars 57b3
 Both theme and motif are drawn together in a dénouement beginning with the violin’s
   recapitulated entry in bar 57 including the rising fifth. The oboe’s imitation begins with a major
   3rd both oboe and violin joining in thirds momentarily at bars 60–61, the flute adding the
   appoggiatura. The diminished 5ths in bar 61 (flute/oboe) and at bar 62–63 in flute and the
   overall chromatic intensification leads to the final cadence with tierce de Picardie.

2.    Dances of Galánta by Zoltán Kodály
     Discuss how the themes/melodies are presented in Dances of Galánta.

     The answers should refer to the prescribed work.

     Answers should address the question and be consistent and convincing in their display of musical
     understanding. Evidence should be located by using bar(s)/measure(s), rehearsal number(s),
     and/or instrument(s) in the works/extracts. Musical terminology should be effective in its use.

     The question requires discussion of the presentation of themes/melodies in the work but not of the
     character of the themes/melodies themselves. Presentation is mainly a matter of orchestration,
     the accompaniments [texture and harmony] tempo and dynamics.

     Bars 1–49: Lento
      Theme at bars 1–4 presented in cellos, ending with a sustained A over which violins and violas
        superimpose a decorative passage in close canon with an accelerando.
      Horns repeat the theme (b. 10) perfect 5th lower at initial tempo, followed by the decorative
        canon beginning on D. Piccolo doubles vlns2 at bar 17 with rallentando.
      Theme presented mainly by woodwinds (b. 19) beginning with oboes but with predominant use
        of clarinet, which leads to a cadenza passage on the trill in bar 33. Bassoon and violas are
        doubled as they overlap the B flat from flute in bar 23 creating a new sonority and antiphonal
        response. The same technique applies to the response by violins from bar 27. The clarinet
        cadenza passage reaches A minor at bar 44 and B major before the time-signature changes to
        quadruple time at bar 50.

     Bars 50–65: Andante maestoso
      A second theme is presented by solo clarinet with homophonic accompaniment in strings,
        the E minor tonality being emphasized by the horns’ E pedal point reaching A major at bar 65.

     Bars 66–73:
      The theme is repeated differently orchestrated. It is doubled across the violins and violas, with
        definition provided by the flutes and clarinets. The accompanying harmonies [D9/11] are
        presented homophonically in the horns, and cellos and basses provide both textural and
        harmonic contrasts.

     Bars 73–93: Allegretto moderato
      A third melody is presented with contrasted orchestration, the clarinet doubling first violins to
        present the melody, with further doubling from the cellos an octave lower. The flexible tempo
        rubato effect of the verbunkos style is also presented with the rit. at bar 75/76 as the melody
        progresses to a pause on the D (bar 79) [marked “breve”].
      Vln1 plays an ascending anacrusis [Dorian] to the final presentation of the melody (b. 81),
        strengthened through doubling in violas and cellos as well as clarinets and bassoons. Tempo
        changes continue until chord of G7 [F in the bass], cadence to E-flat and a tempo change to
        Lento.

     Bars 94–150: Lento
      Thematic presentation is mainly rhythmical with tempo change. Strings follow a pizzicato off-
        beat ostinato-like quaver accompaniment.
      Theme repeated bar 103, this time beginning syncopated on the second quaver and doubled
        (2 8ves higher) by piccolo, with reduced accompaniment. Consequent phrase (bar 109) also
        contrasts dynamically (f instead of the previous phrase at pp).
      Melody returns (b. 123) with resumption of the off-beat quaver accompaniment, doubled in
        parallel fourths in woodwinds with the addition of light touches from triangle and timpani.
                                             – 10 –                N18/6/MUSIC/BP1/ENG/TZ0/XX/M


   Treatment of theme in parallel doubling and developed at b. 129 with decorative grace notes
    in both oboe and clarinet, a new decorative quintuplet at bar 131 and a sudden sf marking
    within the pp dynamic level. Grace notes in clarinets then doubled for last three bars.
   Consequent phrase repeats b. 134 with addition of prominent syncopated countermelody in the
    horn. Parallelism from here primarily in thirds rather than the starker presentation in
    fourths/fifths.
   Triadic figure heard b. 117 [flutes] treated in brief, rhythmically diminished form bb. 142–146,
    in successive imitations by various winds. The presentation therefore combines small
    rhythmical changes with contrasts of timbre.
   Climactic passage at Andante maestoso (b. 151) is another repeat of a principal melody as
    orchestral tutti, effectively in unison. Horns play as in the previous statement (b. 66), basses
    are modified playing octaves with grace notes, timpani add a pedal roll on A.
   Bars 167–172 form a bridge passage derived from the semiquaver figure of the previous
    melodies and the alternating figure of diminished fifths in violins.

Bars 173–228: Allegro con moto, grazioso
 New folk-like melody introduced by oboe, delicately orchestrated to match its character, with
   accompaniment of pizzicato basses, cellos and violas and a clarinet syncopated motif of a
   rising fourth [A–D], also presented harmonically in the violas, pizzicato.
 Repeated b. 181; dynamic reduced to pp, clarinet plays variant of rising 4th motif in
   semiquavers, oboe and piccolo decorate with grace notes. Variant creates a simple
   counterpoint to the theme in flutes. String sonority exploited with pizzicato in lower strings and
   natural harmonics in perfect 5ths, again on A and D. As the passage develops, the decorative
   grace notes, rising 4th motif and continuing semiquaver counterpoint are drawn together,
   closing four bars from the Animato [bar 209].
 First tempo returns b. 213; melody transposed up minor 3rd to C; all three figures once again
   appear together until Animato at bar 217 adopts the scale figure.

Bars 229–236: Andante maestoso
 Another variant of a principal theme, fortissimo and appassionata: rhythm changed slightly to
   include quaver grouping, with B-flat pedal point and rolls. Quaver figure slows further from bar
   234 to pause on D.

Bars 236–333: Allegro
 The whole section, based on a syncopated scale passage, reflects more of the spirit of the folk
   idiom.

Bars 334–565: Poco meno mosso
 Ostinato accompaniment figure; Kodaly again presents the material simply with occasional
   octave doubling (e.g. b. 350, flute, or the combination with the triadic figure in flute/piccolo from
   b. 333). Contrapuntal fragments also occur in such figures as the triplets in the clarinet (b. 365),
   the descending phrase in the cellos (b. 366), both being brief additions within a predominantly
   homophonic texture. The section from bar 370–376 shows imitative and short-lived polyphonic
   texture.
 From bar 377, the music becomes more typically homophonic with decorative acciaccaturas
   or grace notes, and the only form of counterpoint remaining is the straightforward imitation of
   the folk melody from bar 393 and from bar 405. The treatment of the melody first stated at bar
   405 in the horns, is over a two-note ostinato diminished 5th [C–G-flat]. Also, the initial statement
   is on A and its answer [bar 430] is on E-flat.
 The following orchestral fury is whipped up from the two-bar figure with its syncopation and
   scale movement [A tempo, bar 443] until the return of a brief reference to the syncopated
   homophony at bar 490.
                                                   – 11 –             N18/6/MUSIC/BP1/ENG/TZ0/XX/M


     Bars 566–578: Andante maestoso
      Time signature changes to 4/4, orchestral texture reduced along with dynamic level. Strings
        sustain a G-sharp minor triad [divisi], continuing through a progression via E minor and a final
        chord comprising A-sharp, G-sharp and E, which again highlights the tritone relationships in
        the outer voices. The melodic idea is the theme heard previously at bar 50 [also marked
        Andante maestoso], which is simply traced from flute to oboe to clarinet which then develops

3.   Brandenburg Concerto No 2 in F major by Johann Sebastian Bach and Dances of Galánta
     by Zoltán Kodály
     Compare and contrast the structure of the first movement of the Brandenburg Concerto No 2 in F
     Major with the structure of Dances of Galánta. In your answer, emphasize any significant musical
     links.

     (HL only)

     The answers should refer to both prescribed works. The comparing and contrasting of significant
     musical links must focus on concerto characteristics.

     Answers should be consistent and convincing in their display of musical understanding and should
     be backed up by clearly located evidence. Musical terminology should be effective in its use.

     [NB: bar/measure numbers below are as given in the score, without adjustment.]
                                             – 12 –                N18/6/MUSIC/BP1/ENG/TZ0/XX/M


In general terms, the structure of the first movement of the Bach is a ritornello form. The structure
of Dances of Galánta follows a traditional pattern of a slow and fairly free section (Lassú) and a
fast section in a stricter tempo called Frist [Friss]. The Lassú is episodic [like the entire structure]
while the Frist is formed from a set of five dance melodies divided by three repetitions of the
Andante maestoso theme heard in the Lassú. The second part has also associations to a Rondo.

Points of contrast, comparison and links:
 Both works have episodic structural elements.
 The use of ritornello form in Bach is like the use of rondo form in the Frist section of the
   Kodály and is a significant musical link, though the point may not be made as though they were
   synonymous.
 Both works show structural relationships derived from the thematic material, eg:

    Bach:
    o 8b4–28b3: contrasted concertino and ritornello episodes, each of which is given identity
       by means of distinct motivic ideas (solo concertino moments repeat the motif identified by
       its trill and alternating semiquavers).

    Kodály, Frist section:
    o 93–150: Dance 1 with AB AB design and elements of variation/development
    o 151–172: Andante maestoso theme from bars 50–92 repeats with strong orchestral tutti
    o 173–228: Dance 2 with AB B2 design
    o 229–235: Andante maestoso theme abbreviated with tempo change
    o 236–334: Dance 3 combines elements of rondo design ABACA and variations
    o 335–420: Dance 4 with a pre-echo of elements of the dance which follows
    o 421–565: Dance 5 to finale; Dance 3 is repeated from bar 490
    o 566–579: Another interruption marked Maestoso signals final entrance of principal theme
    o 580–close: Reflection of Dance 5.

   However, a difference between the two is that Kodály – as can be seen from the above – uses
    tempo change as a structural device, whereas Bach’s movement remains in the same tempo
    throughout.
   Both works exploit orchestral sonority and texture as defining elements for the structure, eg:

    Bach:
    o 8b4–28b3: Antiphonal exchanges between solo instruments and the ritornello
    o 59b4–67b4: Texture reduces to the concertino ensemble. Imitative exchanges between
       trumpet and oboe with suspensions [cf. bb8–28]
    o 83b4–102b4: Concertino group is prominent, long suspensions in the ripieno ensemble
       where antiphonal exchanges also occur.

    Kodály:
    o 1–9: Solo cello theme coupled with scale flourishes
    o 50–92: Andante maestoso – clarinet presents theme with parts A and B; repeated with
      element of variation
    o 173–228: Light dance marked Allegro con moto, grazioso matched by the lightness of
      orchestration.
                                             – 13 –               N18/6/MUSIC/BP1/ENG/TZ0/XX/M


   Episodes in both works are defined tonally; eg:

    Bach – the structure is most readily defined in terms of its tonal relationships, especially as the
    treatment of the concerto grosso is integrated, and Bach does not always make the distinction
    between concertino and ritornello as clearly separable entities:
    o 1–8b3: F major [tonic]
    o 8b4–28b3: Modulates to C major [dominant]
    o 28b4–59b4: Begins/ends in B-flat [sub-dominant]. Ritornello in D minor [relative] b. 36
    o 59b4–71: Modulates to C minor [via other keys]
    o 72–85: Modulates to G minor
    o 86–102b4: D minor – A minor
    o 102b4–118: F major [tonic]

    Kodály–Frist:
    o 93–150: A-flat minor
    o 151–172: A minor
    o 173–228: D major
    o 229–235: On B-flat [7]
    o 236–334: A minor
    o 335–420: B-flat major
    o 580–close: A minor/Aeolian on A

   However, a difference between the two works here is that Kodály’s tonal practice is more
    ambiguous than Bach’s, eg:
    o 421–565: F pedal but the close canonic writing creates tonal ambiguity
    o 566–579: Begins on G-sharp minor, passes through C-sharp minor to a final resting point
      on dominant 7th on C [through Lydian modality]. Finally, the clarinet plays over an F-sharp
       7th [assuming G# in viola is misprint – cf. bar 47].

 The use of solo or solo groups in contrast to tutti passages is reflected in the structure of both
  works. In the Bach, the solos are taken from the concertino ensemble while the ritornello is
  formed from the ripieno ensemble plus the concertino group, as marked in the score. Given
  these elements of instrumental contrast in both works, the structures are similarly concertante.

     Magnificat anima mea by Heinrich Schütz
     (Identified piece, score provided)

     Musical elements
      Large vocal ensemble (SATB soloists [Favoritchor], 2x SATB choirs) plus relatively small
       instrumental ensemble (2 violins, 3 trombones, basso continuo).
      No key signatures, but extract starts in G and individual sections pass through a number of
       keys, mostly closely related (see below).
      Begins in 2/2 at moderate speed; metre and tempo change through course of extract.
      No dynamics indicated in score but there are some dynamic changes in the recording.

     Musical structure and terminology [underlined]
     Extract falls into a number of sections determined by verses of text:

     1–19:       Magnificat anima mea, full ensemble, G major, 2/2
                Regular monophonic entries by solo tenor, echoed antiphonally by rest of ensemble
                with block chords producing homophony. Can be subdivided into:
                A b. 1 – Magnificat: tenor intones text syllabically to falling third motif, echoed by rest
                of ensemble with G major triad. Full ensemble, loud dynamics.
                B b. 5.2 – Anima mea: another syllabic solo introduces characteristic syncopated
                dotted rhythm; choral answers again
                C b. 9.4 – Dominum: melisma in tenor, echoed in choral response which contains
                polyphonic features. Suspensions (b. 11), cadences in d with tierce de Picardie.
                B1 b. 12.2 – Anima mea: rhythm of B reappears in solo. Second entry repeats first tone
                lower (sequence).
                C1 b. 17.2 – Dominum: melismatic entry in solo alto, cadence in G with fermata.

     20–71:     Et exultavit, solo soprano and tenor, 3 trombones, basso continuo, begins in G
                but passes through various keys, 3/2 – 2/2
                Subdivides into 3 main parts, which again can be further subdivided:

                20–39: Instrumental, 3/2
                D b. 20 – 3-part canon for trombones, entries fifth below/fourth above; basically
                polyphonic/contrapuntal but with homophonic elements (eg basso continuo).
                E b. 26.3 – Similar to above but more freely imitative.
                E1 b. 32.3 – Similar to above, ends with perfect cadence.

                40–61: Vocal (solo soprano and tenor), 3/2
                D1 b. 40 Et exultavit – duet for solo soprano + tenor with basso continuo. Canon at
                octave, based on D; syllabic setting, dotted rhythm of B returns.
                E2 b. 46.3 In Deo salutari – similar to E, again in free imitation at octave. Long
                melisma for tenor; cadences in C with hemiola.
                D2 b. 51. Et exultavit – canon similar to D1, but voices enter after 2 beats instead of 3,
                creating quasi-2/2 cross-rhythm effect. Dotted rhythm reappears again.
                E3 upbeat to b. 59 In Deo salutari – similar to E2, ends with perfect cadence in G.
                                              – 20 –             N18/6/MUSIC/BP1/ENG/TZ0/XX/M


           Vocal + Instrumental, 2/2 (metre change)
           F b. 63 In Deo salutari – ostinato vocal figure with parts exchanged at each repetition,
           accompanied by simple alternation of G and C triads. Ends with perfect cadence in G
           with 4/3 suspension and melisma in tenor part.
           F1 b. 67 In Deo salutari – similar passage fourth higher; trombones take over alternating
           repetitions; vocalists have alternating interjections mostly based on a monotone C.
           Perfect cadence in C with 4/3 suspension and fermata.

72–85: Quia respexit (bars 72–85), solo bass + 2 violins, C major, 2/2
         G b. 72 Quia respexit – bass solo, syllabic setting based on inversion of C; answered
         by solo violins with descending scalar figure in parallel thirds.
         G1 b. 74.3 – Variant of G in Violin II, fifth higher, imitated by bass. Repeated by each
         violin in turn, imitated by bass; starting pitches pass through cycle of fifths.
         D3 b. 79 humilitatem – soloist sings similar falling third to opening of D; ends with
         imperfect cadence in E.
         G2 b. 81 ancillae suae – Similar imitative passage to G. Violins alternate as before, but
         bass now imitates at 5th lower, again taking entries through a cycle of fifths.

Beginning of Ecce enim (full ensemble, 2/2) can be heard as extract fades.

Musical context
 By Heinrich Schütz (1585–1672), German composer of early Baroque period. He studied
  composition in Venice under Giovanni Gabrieli from 1609–1612 and works such as this
  Magnificat clearly reflect his teacher’s famous “polychoral” style.
 Liturgical work for church performance; text is Mary’s famous canticle in Luke I, 39–56 (“My
  soul doth magnify the Lord…”).

     Nocturnes, Movement II (Fêtes) by Claude Debussy
     (Identified piece, no score provided)

     Musical elements
      Large symphony orchestra
      Multiple changes of time signatures and combination of metres
      Wide-ranging use of timbre
      Wide-ranging dynamics
      Dissonance
      Use of modes

     Musical structure and terminology [underlined]

     Introduction:
     00:00: F minor. Violins play heavily accented rhythmic ostinato on open 5th chord, sustained by
              flutes.

     00:04:   first statement of Theme A using Dorian mode in cor anglais and clarinets; continues
              while first and second trumpets interject with a fanfare-like motif in 3rds at 00:09 and
              00:12.

     00:13:   violas, cellos and double bass take over rhythmic ostinato.

     00:17:   second statement of Theme A in flutes and oboes beginning third higher, using melodic
              minor scale.

     00:23:   third statement of Theme A in bassoons and cellos using whole-tone scale. Flutes and
              clarinets have rhythmic ostinato accompaniment/pedal, strings work out tail of Theme
              A in octaves.

     00:33:   fortissimo sustained notes in horns and bassoons; then at 00:37, horns, trumpets and
              trombones introduce an extended fanfare motif based on the earlier motif (motivic
              development) at 00:09 and 00:12.

     00:40:   timpani roll heralds big cadence and a pause in the ostinato, leading to D-flat Mixolydian
              harp glissando a tempo at 00:48.

     New section
     00:50: Time signature changes to 15/8 (with 5/4 in strings) (polymetre/multi-metre), key to A
            major, tempo to Un peu plus animé. Woodwinds play variation of triplet motif; strings
            play pizzicato, punctuating the “triplet-like” figure in the wind on the offbeat at 00:52.

     00:54:   fourth statement of Theme A is heard with variation. Time signature changes to 9/8 but
              triplet figuration is still felt. Strings accompany with staccato chords arco.

     00:59:   reprise of the “triplet” motif in cor anglais, clarinets and bassoons; offbeat pizzicato
              punctuation again at 01:01.

     01:03:   varied Theme A (as at 00:54) repeated in flutes and oboes.

     01:07:   bassoons and horns pick up accented rhythmic figure from the opening, cor anglais and
              clarinets take up triplet figure at 01:10. At 01:12 the cellos introduce a motivic fragment
              which leads into...
                                               – 22 –                N18/6/MUSIC/BP1/ENG/TZ0/XX/M


01:13:   oboes and cor anglais use question and answer on ascending (whole-tone) and
         descending scales; flutes interject with trills on G-flat; brass/low woodwind have long
         sustained chords; clarinets play triplet rhythmic figure while violins play duplet rhythm in
         thirds against this.

01:18:   flutes take over triplet figure; at 01:21 violins revisit the earlier ostinato figure, joined by
         cellos at 01:23.

01:26:   time signature changes to 3/4; Theme B stated in oboes; rest of the orchestra, for now,
         remains in 9/8 (polymetre / mixed metre).

01:36:   flutes join oboes, with trumpets playing a “dragged out” fanfare; at 01:39, clarinets join in
         with Theme B as oboes drop out. At 01:40 flutes continue theme, 01:42 oboes join in
         unison and clarinets drop out.

01:45:   2 new themes appear simultaneously: Theme C, in 3/4, played by cor anglais and violas,
         and Theme D, in 9/8 (polymetre/ mixed metre), played by rest of the woodwinds. Both
         built on F# Dorian mode.

01:46:   cellos and basses interject with fragments of the accented triplet-feel motif, creating 2s
         against 3s with the violin and violas’ tuplets; horns join the cor anglais at the end of the
         first statement of Theme D at 01:54, leading back into the triplet figure in unison at 01:55
         in the upper strings. Woodwinds continue to play Theme C, timpani play a rhythmic
         pedal, as whole orchestra crescendos to fortissimo.

02:00:   dynamic suddenly drops to pianissimo; track fades as triplet motif is played staccato by
         divisi strings in a cascading manner...

     Abstinence by John Hollenbeck
     (Unidentified piece, no score provided)

     Musical elements
      Pulse ranges from uncertain free tempo/senza misura to 4/4 and 5/8/mixed metre.
      Some free rhythm, some more regular.
      Melodies are conjunct, chromatic with disjunct descending leaps.
      Work written for Big Band ensemble, with some live electronic modification.
      Dynamics are within range of p to f and partly consequence of instrumental combinations.

     Musical structure and terminology [underlined]:
     The design is basically strophic with variations.

     INTRO:
     0:00 – double bass [acoustic bass] pizzicato solo plays free angular melody featuring glissandi
     and dissonance from the start – there is also some incidental snap pizzicato [“Bartók pizz”] –
     neither key nor pulse are clearly established (senza misura/free tempo) – the line plays
     improvisatory free rhythm – ca. 0:14 short descending sequence with glissando – a pulse begins
     to be established – new figure ca. 0:21 foreshadows next section.
                                            – 24 –               N18/6/MUSIC/BP1/ENG/TZ0/XX/M


A:
0:34 – double bass has settled into a more regular pulse as brushes on snare enter – bass plays
repeated ostinato figure which settles on B-flat ending with a short four-note figure – almost
settles into walking bass but not quite…

A1
0:49 – p – bass continues ostinato – unison chromatic melody of seven notes in wind [beginning
on E-flat]– phrase played twice ending on high A-flat for two bars in 4/4 time – as the note sustains
the bass pre-echoes the next melody, which is cued by the change in the snare pattern with
cymbal strikes a harder attack but still with brushes.

B:
B1
1:19 – time signature changes to repeated pattern of 2 bars 5/8 plus one bar 4/4 (poly-metric)
with a change of snare drum rhythm – more animated together with saxophones, trombones and
bass in unison – melody treated sequentially four times in octave unison with different
consequents to each repeat.

1:51 – the melody repeats on saxophones, with final pitches of each phrase sustained to produce
cluster sonorities/note clusters – trumpet plays countermelody with mute, with delay/reverb or
other electronic treatment – the cluster increases intensity up to 2:08.

2:15 – metre returns to 4/4 – the trumpet continues its prominent melody improvisation coloured
with electronic effects, with sustained chords in trombones… [fade].

Musical context
 John Hollenbeck is a composer and percussionist.
 The style is variously described as “free-form jazz”, “contemporary jazz” or “avant-garde jazz”.

     Skotchne #1 (traditional klezmer dance music)
     (Unidentified piece, no score provided)
     Musical elements
      Pitch: Klezmer scale / Romanian Minor; tonic/dominant pattern.
      Duration/rhythm: quaver and semiquaver rhythmic patterns; off-beat.
      Sonority/timbre: portamento playing; trumpet triple tonguing; double bass plays pizzicato
       throughout
      Tempo: Fast duple time [2/4]; tempo helps to define structure.
      Texture: homophonically supported melody.

     Musical structure and terminology [underlined]:
     Structure is strophic but with different instrumental alternations at certain sectional repeats which
     introduce variation to the content:

     A 0:00 Presto – 2/4 (duple time) – C minor - fast tempo – clarinet solo with guitar, double-bass
     and snare as rhythm section; 4 x 4-bar phrases; tonic C.

     B 0:12 Slow rubato tempo: mournful violin solo melody with guitar chords – phrase ends on G.
     1 x 4-bar phrase. C pedal in guitar.

     C 0:23 Quicker pace: melody in trumpet and clarinet; snare drum provides off-beats to the double
     bass which is on the beats – brief interjections from clarinet in high register. 2 x 4-bar phrases.

     D 0:34 Tempo quickens as trumpet enters with consequent phrase in major mode (Mixolydian)
     featuring accented strike on second beat; 2 x 4-bar phrases.

     E 0:43 New tempo: trumpet features longer notes (minims on Cs) 4 bars repeating before the
     semiquaver figures which recur – trumpet and clarinet in unison; minor mode again; 3 x 4-bar
     phrases.
                                            – 26 –               N18/6/MUSIC/BP1/ENG/TZ0/XX/M


A1 0:53: Reprise of A with clarinet taking the melody and trumpet adding triple-tonguing at
faster pace. 4 x 4 bar phrases.

B1 1:04: Solo clarinet variant of B with guitar accompaniment, at same slow tempo as when the
melody was on violin at 0:12.

C1 1:15: repeats the same material as C.

D1 1:26: Same material as D, but there is a change from the trumpet to clarinet.

E1 1:34: Same material as E.

A2 1:44: Reprise of A with clarinet taking melody for the first 8 and the trumpet joining in unison
for the last 8. Accelerando!

Musical terminology may also include:
 Homophony/homophonic, accompaniment
 Terms related to tempo and tempo changes including rubato, rall., rit., allarg., etc
 Off-beats [but not syncopation]
 Portamento/glissando

Musical context:
 Klezmer is a form of Jewish folk music, associated with various celebrations such as weddings,
  anniversaries and Bar Mitzvahs. The name derives from Yiddish for “song” and “instrument” as
  reflected in the vocal quality of the extract.
 It is basically secular and is categorized as either as for dance or for instrumental display.
  As far as is known for certain, the music originated from Romania, spreading throughout
  Eastern Europe and Russia or wherever there were Jewish settlements.
 The music is often highly expressive, ranging and combining both happy and sad – even tragic
  – emotions. In some klezmer, the clarinet is used to imitate the sound of laughter while the
