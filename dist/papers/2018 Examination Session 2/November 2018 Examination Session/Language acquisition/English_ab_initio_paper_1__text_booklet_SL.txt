                A graduate from Manchester University
                 takes his skills back home to Tanzania
        Ray grew up beside Mount Kilimanjaro in north-east Tanzania and graduated from Dar es
         Salaam Institute of Technology in 2011. A friend told him about the scholarships offered by
         Manchester University, England, and he successfully applied to study for a Masters in
         Science in Construction Project Management at the university.

        The scholarship helped to pay for Ray’s university fees for
         the year as well as giving him enough money to pay for
         his living costs. After he finished the course, Ray returned
         to the Tanzanian capital of Dar es Salaam to help with the
         development of the growing city’s transport system.

        He is now managing the construction of Africa’s first rapid
         bus system, Dar Rapid Transit (DART). Inspired by similar
         systems in Latin America, DART is helping to make the city
         more accessible for its four million inhabitants, as well as
         improving journey times. “Dar es Salaam’s future is very
         promising,” said Ray. “Its rapid growth is forcing policy
         makers to improve planning, infrastructure and environmental management in the city.
         Mistakes made when the city was first planned are being corrected.”

        Ray added: “The scholarship made a huge change in my life. It has made a difference to my
         career, my experience, my family and my society. Studying at Manchester University gave
         me the advantage of learning project management skills.”

        Manchester University’s head of development said: “We are extremely proud of our
         scholarship programme and very grateful to our donors who help to fund it. Education is one
         of the most powerful gifts you can give, and Ray’s story shows the impact these scholarships
         can have not just on the students who receive them but on their entire country.”

                        Therapy dogs help patients
         When Mia, Peter Beliveau’s six-year-old dog, walks into the hospital, she is quickly
         surrounded by people. Mia loves it. She is incredibly friendly and approaches most people
         she passes in the hospital corridors. It is all fun until her owner takes out a white and red
         scarf and puts it on the dog. That is when Mia starts to work.

  5      Mia is one of forty therapy dogs with the St John Ambulance
         therapy program. As part of the program, trained therapy
         dogs and their owners visit patients in hospitals to talk about
         life outside the hospital.

         Twice a week for the past two-and-a-half-years, Mia and
 10      her owner, Peter Beliveau, have visited elderly patients for
         an hour for each visit. The program has grown in the past
         few years; it started with only two dogs in 2013 and there
         are forty dogs today.

         Peter Beliveau explained: “The dog acts as a bridge between
 15      you and the patient. It’s amazing how people respond to her
         and then allow you to get to know them. The presence of the
         dog makes the patients more comfortable and then they start
         talking to you.”

         Peter Beliveau used to be a doctor and is now retired. He missed the interactions with his
 20      patients and colleagues. He also noticed how well Mia responded to most people, including
         seniors and those in wheelchairs, and he decided to join the volunteer program.

         Many of the patients Mia and her owner see are seniors; however, the volunteer
         dog therapy program also includes visits to students at university campuses during
         exam time and children at elementary schools and libraries, where kids can read to
 25      the dogs and their owner.

         The program coordinator explained: “Dog therapy is calming because the attention is on the
         dog. This lowers the level of anxiety of the patient.”

         Any type of dog can become a therapy dog but not all dogs have the right skills. According
         to the coordinator, dogs have to be over two years old, have the right temperament, obey
 30      their owner and have a good relationship with him or her.



                                                                   adapted from: www.vicnews.com (2016)
