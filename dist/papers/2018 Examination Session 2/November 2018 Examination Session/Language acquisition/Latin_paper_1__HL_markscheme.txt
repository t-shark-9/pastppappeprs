The translation is assessed in its basic units of clause and sentence. To this end, the original text is
chunked in a fixed number of sections (or “sense units”), 15 at SL and 30 at HL. Every section is awarded
two separate marks according to the two descriptors outlined below.

Each section is awarded 0 to 3 marks for descriptor A (Meaning) and 0 to 3 marks for descriptor B
(Vocabulary & Grammar).

The range of marks for each section is therefore 0 to 6, while the maximum number of marks for the
whole text is 180 at HL (30 sections  6 marks).

Criterion A (Meaning) assesses how well the meaning of each sense unit has been communicated.

Criterion B (Vocabulary & Grammar) assesses how correctly vocabulary and grammar have been
rendered in relation to each sense unit. The term ‘grammar’ here includes syntax and accidence.

As a guideline, criterion A tends to look at the translation as a whole (eg stylistic, literal and idiomatic
meanings conveyed), while criterion B tends to assess the conformity of the single section with the
original text (eg grammatical accuracy of translation, apparent understanding of source language syntax
and vocabulary).

While it may not always be possible to give the full range of marks for a single sense unit, the range of
marks necessary for differentiation is present over the whole exam.

By way of example, the marking of different translations of the sense unit omnia tela totius accusationis in
Oppianicum coniciebantur, found in an Ovid passage (HL specimen papers), would be as follows:
 “The entire force of the whole accusation was hurled against Oppianicus”: A=3, B=3.
 “The strength of the accusation was fully directed against Oppianicus”: A=3, B=2 (grammar is
   rendered adequately despite inaccuracies).
 “The weapons of the accuser were hurled against Oppianicus”: A=2 (the meaning has been partially
   communicated; errors impair the translation), B=2 (grammar is rendered adequately
   despite inaccuracies).
 “Every bit of the accusation was aimed into Oppianicus”: A=2 (the meaning has been partially
   communicated), B=1 (limited grammar is rendered accurately).
 “The attack of the accusation was focused intently on Oppianicus”: A=1 (the translation conveys
   some meaning), B=1 (little grammar is rendered appropriately).

Square brackets [ ] indicate that the words in the sense unit have been inserted out of the order of the
text.
