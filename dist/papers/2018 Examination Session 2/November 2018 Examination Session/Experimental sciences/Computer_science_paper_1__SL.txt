10.   The following method, calcBMI() accepts person’s height (H) in metres (m) and weight (W)
      in kilograms (kg) and returns their Body Mass Index (BMI).

      Boris weighs 104 kg and is 2.00 m tall. His BMI can be calculated by calling method
      calcBMI() as follows

                                  BorisBMI = calcBMI(2.00, 104).

       less than 18.5                            underweight

(Question 10 continued)

     The data about a group of adults and their height measurement (in metres) and weight
     measurement (in kg) is held in three one-dimensional arrays.

                   NAME                WEIGHT                 HEIGHT
                                        (kg)                    (m)

     [2]          Hugh         [2]     105.00         [2]      2.03
     [3]          Paul         [3]      61.00         [3]      1.75
     [4]          Robby        [4]      88.00         [4]      1.80

      …             …           …         …           …         …

    [29]          Zara        [29]      68.00       [29]       1.71

     Where
     NAME is a one-dimensional array holding names (currently sorted in alphabetical order).
     WEIGHT is a one-dimensional array holding weight measurement in kilograms.
     HEIGHT is a one-dimensional array holding height measurement in metres.

     For example,
     NAME[0] is Annie.
     Her weight measurement is 52.40 kg and can be found in WEIGHT[0].
     HEIGHT[0] is 1.56 which represents Annie’s height measurement in metres.

     (c)   State the name of the person whose height is held in HEIGHT[3].[1]

     (d)   (i)	Identify one reason why a binary search algorithm cannot be used to find the
                 name of person whose height is given.                                         [1]

           (ii)      Describe how the name of person whose height is given could be output.    [2]

     (e)   Construct an algorithm which will output the names of all the people whose BMI is
           greater than this group’s average BMI.

           You should call method calcBMI() in your answer.                                    [6]
