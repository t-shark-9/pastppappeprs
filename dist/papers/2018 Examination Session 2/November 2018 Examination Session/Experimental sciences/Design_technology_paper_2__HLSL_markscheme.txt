                the trolley can be reused by other people for water delivery/the trolley can be used for      of how the IDEO trolley uses
                purposes other than delivering water                                                         waste mitigation strategies.

                once the trolley becomes obsolete the materials/components can be recycled for other
                products 

                repair 
                the ease of reconstruction or renewal of any part of an existing structure or device 
                the trolley uses simple technology/locally available materials (tyres, wheels, frame) which
                makes it easy to repair                                                                                                           9

                rebuilding a product so it is in an as new condition 
                the frame can be repainted/the wheels can have new bearings fitted so they run more
                efficiently 

                reengineer 
                redesign components or products to improve their characteristics or performance 
                the frame is easy/inexpensive to modify 

                dematerialisation 
                is the reduction of total material and energy throughput of any product 
                the frame is very basic/uses the bare minimum of materials needed 
