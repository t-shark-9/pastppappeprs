Answer one question from this section.

1.     Study the following extract and data and answer the questions that follow.


                             South Sudan joins the East African Community

     	The East African Community (EAC) is the most integrated trading bloc in Africa. In 2005,
        the members established a customs union, and then in 2010 it became a common market.
        There are ambitious plans to establish a monetary union by 2024.

     	According to a recent report, the region is wealthier and more peaceful as a result of the
        increased integration. Economic models suggest that bilateral trade between member
        countries was 213 % higher in 2011 than it would have been without the integration. This
        is despite the fact that progress on fully eliminating trade barriers has been rather slow
        and there are still a large number of non-tariff barriers.

     	Until recently the customs union was made up of Burundi, Kenya, Rwanda, Tanzania and
        Uganda. Very recently, South Sudan joined the bloc. This presents a tremendous opportunity
        for South Sudan, which was recently recognized as an independent country.

     	South Sudan is one of many developing countries that are dependent on oil exports for the
        majority of its export revenues and oil prices have been falling due to increased supply of oil
        in the market. The deteriorating terms of trade have resulted in a worsening of the current
        account and lower government revenues. Regional economic integration might help South
        Sudan to diversify its economy.

     	Agriculture is one potential area that South Sudan could focus on to diversify its economy.
        According to some estimates, 70 % of land is suitable for agriculture, but less than 4 % is
        currently being cultivated. The large flood plains in the country are suitable for rice production
        and the hope is that South Sudan can develop a comparative advantage in this essential
        food.

     	South Sudan is landlocked and most of its road network is unpaved. This is just one example
        of its poor infrastructure. Since infrastructure is an expensive investment, regional cooperation
        will be vital for improving its road systems. Furthermore, effective transport links to sea ports
        in Kenya and Tanzania will allow for greater trade and therefore economies of scale.

     	In the short term, there will be challenges for South Sudan associated with joining the
        common market. For example, before Rwanda joined the EAC in 2007, there were lower
        tariffs on many imported inputs. However, the cost of living for the poor population rose
        because of trade diversion that occurred after joining the EAC. South Sudan is likely to face
        the same problem.

     	Labour costs in South Sudan are higher than those of other member countries and years
        of conflict have left the population with low levels of education and skills. This may present
        a barrier for South Sudan in attracting foreign direct investment, despite being part of the
        common market.

Answer one question from this section.
3.     Study the following extract and answer the questions that follow.

                                               Solar power in Kenya

     	Kenyan shopkeepers are able to use mobile phones and a small deposit to buy solar panels.
        This gives them 24-hour access to electricity and also lowers their fuel bills. Before this,
        the shopkeepers struggled to get a connection to electricity. M-Kopa is the company that
        provides these solar panels.

     	M-Kopa estimates that 80 % of its customers live on less than US$2 a day, and without
        access to credit, are caught in a poverty trap (poverty cycle). Many of them rely on
        subsistence farming or run a small business as their source of income. Energy accounts for a
        significant amount of their spending.

     	Kopa means “to borrow” in Swahili, and each panel the company sells is in effect a loan of
        about US$165. M-Kopa’s solar panels cost US$200. Clients pay US$35 upfront and agree to
        make a daily payment of 45¢ for a year, after which the solar panel is theirs.

     	When M-Kopa’s customers are reaching the end of their loan terms, an M-Kopa
        representative calls to offer another product, in exchange for reopening the account and
        making payments for another few months. M-Kopa has sold around 325 000 solar panels
        so far and 50 000 of their buyers, who have already paid off their loans, have extended their
        credit to buy other products offered by M-Kopa. Ideally, these new products will also save
        customers money over time. They include fuel efficient stoves that save charcoal, a bicycle
        that cuts transportation costs and water tanks to store rainwater. M-Kopa also sells Samsung
        smartphones and offers loans to pay for school fees.

     	M-Kopa is replacing kerosene lamps with solar power technology. Kerosene lamps emit a
        dangerous smoke that burns the eyes, irritates the throat and slowly turns walls and ceilings
        black. They are also expensive. According to a 2014 survey, an average household in Kenya,
        without access to electricity, spends about US$164 a year on kerosene. M-Kopa estimates
        that a customer saves about US$750 over the first four years by switching to solar panels.
        Given Kenya’s climate, solar power is an obvious source of energy.

     	Since its commercial launch in October 2012, the company’s total revenue has risen rapidly,
        from US$15 million in 2014 to US$30 million in 2015, and the company says it will double this
        in 2016. Every day, about 600 new customers are purchasing solar panels, meaning that the
        company is extending loans of almost US$100 000 a day to people who might otherwise not
        have access to credit.

     	According to a company representative, “If you take the long-term view and if you treat
        low-income people as customers, not charity cases, you can change the world. In our view,
        it is one of the advantages that foreign direct investment can bring to a country. Our
        customers’ lives are improved as our lives are improved”.
