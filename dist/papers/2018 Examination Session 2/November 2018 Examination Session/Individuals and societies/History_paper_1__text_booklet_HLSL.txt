Prescribed subject 1: Military leaders

Read sources A to D and answer questions 1 to 4. The sources and questions relate to case study 2:
Richard I of England (1173–1199) — Leadership: Rise to power: revolt of Richard I and his brothers
against Henry II (1173–1174).

Source A                  Philip Potter, an author of popular history books, writing in the book Gothic Kings
                          of Britain: The lives of 31 Medieval Rulers, 1016–1399 (2009).

Henry II designated his eldest son, the younger Henry, as the successor to Anjou, Normandy and
England, while Richard was granted Aquitaine and the fourth son, Geoffrey, was bequeathed Brittany.
Nevertheless, the king refused to relinquish any sovereignty to his heirs and, as they grew older, the
lack of independent authority gave cause for rebellion. At Queen Eleanor’s urging, Richard joined the
insurrection of his older brother. The rebels met in Paris at the court of Louis VII where a formidable
alliance was formed … resulting in the agreement to wage war against Henry II. In July 1173, the allies
invaded Normandy, where Richard gained his first experience in battle. However, the attacks against
the Plantagenet crown were inconclusive and in September the monarch offered to reconcile with his
sons, proposing generous financial terms but no power. The offer was rejected and the conflict renewed,
with Henry II taking the offensive by mounting an assault against Anjou with a formidable army. As
his father succeeded in re-imposing his control over large sections of Poitou, Richard assumed his
first independent command to resist his father’s attack … The revolt continued through the summer
as Richard’s military might deteriorated under the relentless pressure of the Plantagenet [Henry II’s]
counter-campaign. Finally, on 23 September 1174, at Poitiers he agreed to peace terms, accepting a
reduced financial settlement and renewing his homage for Aquitaine.

                        others.

The younger Henry, by the advice of the French, devising evil from every source against his father, went
secretly into Aquitaine, where his two brothers, Richard and Geoffrey, resided with their mother; and with
her connivance [plotting], brought them with him into France. Their father had granted Aquitaine to one
and Brittany to the other. Hence the younger Henry believed, from the suggestions of the French, that
the people of Aquitaine and Brittany would, because of Richard, support him as would the Bretons under
Geoffrey. The younger Henry also allied himself to the count of Flanders—a man of great power and
immoderate presumption [arrogance]. The younger Henry gained the count’s support by making great
promises with the consent of the king of France [Louis VII]. Then many powerful and noble persons—
in England and in foreign parts—driven by hatred, which until then they had hidden, or persuaded by
promises of the vainest kind, began by degrees to desert the father for the son, and to make every
preparation for war.

                        A History of England (1972).

Henry, it was said, could rule every household but his own. His sons grew up discontented and hostile
towards him … Henry was partly to blame. As a parent, he was indulgent yet controlling, giving his
sons titles but little money or power, he sent them to represent him in various parts of his dominions
but expected them to be as obedient as paid officials … The three older brothers, encouraged by their
mother Eleanor, were eager to revolt against their father …

Louis VII of France also encouraged Henry’s sons to revolt. The great rebellion of 1173–1174, which
included risings in England, Normandy, Brittany and Aquitaine, was managed—or, rather, mismanaged—
by Louis. The widespread nature of the revolt made it dangerous. But Henry was supported by the
Church, by his great officials, by the smaller tenants in the country, and by the towns. [Also,] his sons
were too young to lead so extensive an enterprise, Louis was incompetent and there was little overall
planning. Hence, the revolt was put down, as it had arisen, gradually. Louis was driven back to Paris,
an invasion of England from Flanders was defeated and Eleanor was captured. Henry forgave his sons
and increased their revenues.

Read sources E to H and answer questions 5 to 8. The sources and questions relate to case study 2:
The conquest of Mexico and Peru (1519–1551) — Key events and actors: Francisco Pizarro and the
campaign against the Incas; alliances with indigenous populations.

Source E                  David Werlich, a professor of Latin American history, writing in the academic book
                          Peru: A Short History (1978).

Francisco Pizarro, a veteran conquistador of modest origins, landed in northern Peru with some 180
followers early in 1532. Pizarro led his men to the highland city of Cajamarca where Atahualpa was
enjoying nearby mineral baths. Atahualpa’s armies could have defeated the small force of Europeans
as they marched through the narrow mountain passes, but he could not comprehend that these few
strangers posed a threat to his grand person. On November 16, 1532, Atahualpa accepted an invitation
to dine with Pizarro in the city. Entering the central plaza with a retinue [escort] of 5,000 lightly armed
men, Atahualpa was boldly attacked and captured by Pizarro and a team of 20 soldiers. While the
all-powerful Inca ruler remained in the hands of the Europeans, his subordinates offered little
resistance …

In July 1533, after receiving dubious information that a large Inca force was preparing to attack
Cajamarca, the Spaniards accused Atahualpa of betraying them by ordering the assault and hastily
executed him … [Prior to his execution,] while a prisoner of the Europeans Atahualpa had ordered the
execution of his half-brother Huascar and other claimants to the Inca throne so that they could not profit
from the monarch’s [Inca’s] distress. At the same time, Atahualpa’s armies continued to destroy many
towns that had supported Huascar in the recent civil war. The Spaniards exploited this internal strife.

Prescribed subject 3: The move to global war

Read sources I to L and answer questions 9 to 12. The sources and questions relate to case study 1:
Japanese expansion in East Asia (1931–1941) — Responses: League of Nations and the Lytton Report.

Source I                  The Lytton Report (4 September 1932).

Without declaration of war, a large area of what was indisputably Chinese territory has been forcibly
seized and occupied by the armed forces of Japan and has, in consequence of this operation,
been separated from and declared independent of the rest of China. The steps by which this was
accomplished are claimed by Japan to have been consistent with the obligations of the Covenant of the
League of Nations, the Kellogg–Briand Pact and the Nine-Power Treaty of Washington, all of which were
designed to prevent action of this kind … The justification has been that all the military operations have
been legitimate acts of self-defence, the right of which is implicit in all the multilateral treaties mentioned
above, and was not taken away by any of the resolutions of the Council of the League. Further, the
administration which has been substituted for that of China in Manchuria is justified on the grounds that
its establishment was the act of the local population, who spontaneously asserted their independence,
severed all connection with China and established their own government. Such a genuine independence
movement, it is claimed, is not prohibited by any international treaty or by any of the resolutions of the
Council of the League of Nations.

                          “A Businessman’s View of the Lytton Report” in the Japanese magazine Gaiko
                          Jiho (November 1932).

As has been officially declared by the Imperial Government more than once, Japan has no territorial
ambitions in Manchuria. Japan has given formal recognition to Manchuria as an independent state
[Manchukuo], assuring it full opportunity for growth and organization ... At the same time, Japan hopes
thereby to rescue Manchukuo from the destruction caused by China’s internal disorders and give
it opportunity to attain free development, so that it may be able to play its part in easing the world’s
economic difficulty by offering a very safe and valuable market in the Far East. This aspect of Japan’s
policy should have been quite clear to the Lytton Commission. But unfortunately, the Lytton Report
makes an altogether inadequate estimate of Manchuria’s economic value, and entirely fails to do justice
to the previously mentioned motive of Japan in recognizing Manchukuo … Japan is fully prepared, in
view of the position she rightly occupies among the nations of the world, to do her best to support China
in her work of unification and reconstruction to the end that peace may thereby be assured in the Far
East. This aspect of Japan’s policy should have been quite clear to the Lytton Commission.

                        Joint History Research Report (2011).
The Guangdong [Kwantung] Army continued its advance into Chinese territory … To serve as head
of the new state, the Japanese took the deposed Chinese emperor Puyi out of Tianjin under cover of
riots that the Japanese staged in the city and brought him to Manchuria. Japan’s position that it acted
in self-defence to protect its own interests thus began to lose credibility, and the League of Nations
grew increasingly suspicious. On October 24 [1931], the League Council voted for the withdrawal of
Japanese troops by a specific deadline, but Japan’s opposition alone defeated the resolution. Finally,
with Japan’s agreement, the League Council decided on December 10 to send a commission to the
scene to investigate, and deferred any decision until the investigation was completed … the [resulting]
Lytton Report refused to recognize the Guangdong Army’s actions following the Manchurian Incident as
legitimate self-defence, nor did it accept the claim that Manchukuo had been born from a spontaneous
independence movement.

Prescribed subject 4: Rights and protest

Read sources M to P and answer questions 13 to 16. The sources and questions relate to case study 1:
Civil rights movement in the United States (1954–1965) — Protests and action: Non-violent protests;
Montgomery bus boycott (1955–1956).

Note: In sources M and P the word “negro” is used to reflect the place and time of the original material.
Today, in many countries, the word is no longer in common usage.

In 1954, white segregationists throughout the South had created White Citizens’ Councils (WCCs) …
Martin Luther King faced WCC attacks as soon as the Montgomery bus boycott began, and was a target
of these groups throughout his career.

In January 1956, a month after the start of the boycott, the mayor of Montgomery joined the WCC,
publicly declaring “I think every right-minded person in Montgomery, Alabama and the South should
do the same. We must make certain that negroes are not allowed to force their demands on us” ...
By the next month WCC membership had doubled. The WCC attempted multiple strategies to stop the
boycott, from prosecuting the boycott organizers to pressuring insurance agencies throughout the South
to cancel policies for church-owned vehicles. King appealed to President Eisenhower to investigate
violence carried out by WCC members against the boycott organizers whose homes were bombed …
The attorney general [the US government’s chief lawyer] responded to King’s appeal, writing that “the
activities of the White Citizens’ Council do not appear to indicate violations of federal criminal statutes.”

                         The Civil Rights Movement (2013).

The boycott was an overwhelming success … Ministers and activists formed the Montgomery
Improvement Association to direct the protest, coordinate transportation for boycotters, garner [gain]
support from individuals and organizations in and out of the state, and enter into negotiations with
the bus company and city officials. Reverend Martin Luther King Jr was elected president of the
organization … His acceptance of the position was the beginning of his career as a civil rights leader ...
The mayor and the city officials claimed that the separation of the races was ordained [ordered] by
God and social custom, and white Montgomerians retaliated against the boycotters with harassment
and violence … When they were not taunted by white residents on their way to and from work, black
boycotters were harassed by telephone ... Police officers stopped, fined, and arrested car pool drivers
on trumped-up [invented] charges.

The boycott ended after 381 days and was a key victory in the Civil Rights Movement. Local people,
the educated and uneducated, the wealthy and the poor, demonstrated to people around the country,
especially to those in other southern cities, that African Americans could organize themselves to abolish
a system that had oppressed them for decades.

Dear Sir:
I am writing this letter to you, because I have long been impressed with the fair and unbiased treatment
you give in your news stories.

There is a story in the making here in Montgomery. I am referring to the protest which negroes (and
many whites) of Montgomery are making against the local bus company ... The local newspapers have
consistently printed one-sided stories about developments in this protest. They have at times omitted
[left out] relevant facts that would have put a much more favorable light on what the negroes are asking
for …

I am a white Lutheran minister, serving a negro congregation. I cannot even give my own church
members a ride in my car without fear of being stopped by the police and accused of running a taxi …
If you want a good look at the way a one-way press and a one-race police force band together to
discredit fifty thousand people who are tired of being treated like animals on the city buses … then I urge
you to send a reporter to Montgomery as soon as possible. …

I respectfully request that the contents of this letter be kept confidential until such time as they have been
verified [checked] by you.

Sincerely yours,

Robert Graetz

                        Modern World History. The Rwandan Genocide (2010).

The assassination of Habyarimana was the spark that set the plans for genocide in motion. Within hours
of the crash, members of the presidential guard and other elite troops—carrying hit lists composed of
the names of persons perceived to be RPF sympathizers, including prominent Tutsi and Hutu opposition
politicians and civil society activists—were spreading throughout the capital. On April 7 [1994], the
presidential guard assassinated the Prime Minister Agathe Uwilingiyimana, a moderate Hutu, along with
ten Belgian UN troops who had been guarding her. On the first day of the genocide, death squads also
killed several cabinet ministers, justices of the constitutional court, journalists, human rights activists and
progressive priests. For several days, the murderous attacks took place primarily in Kigali and were
focused on prominent individuals, both Hutu and Tutsi, perceived to be opponents of the regime. The
international community at this initial stage of the genocide, construed the violence in Rwanda as an
