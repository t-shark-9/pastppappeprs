Extract adapted from Kleinman, A., Eisenberg, L. and Good, B. (2006), “Culture, Illness, and Care:
Clinical Lessons From Anthropologic and Cross-Cultural Research”, FOCUS. The Journal of Lifelong
Learning in Psychiatry, 4 (1): 140–149.

         Illness is culturally shaped in the sense that how we perceive, experience, and cope with
         disease is specific to the social positions we occupy and systems of meaning we use. These
         have been shown to influence our expectations and perceptions of symptoms, the way we
         attach particular labels to them, and the conclusions and responses that flow from those labels.

    5    Doctors diagnose and treat diseases (abnormalities in the structure and function of body organs
         and systems), whereas patients suffer illnesses (the personal experience of feeling unwell).
         Illness and disease, so defined, are not the same thing. Feelings of illness may occur in the
         absence of disease (50 % of visits to the doctor are for complaints without a proven biological
         base). Moreover, the remedies prescribed by doctors may fail to cure disease, despite effective
   10    treatment, when patients fail to follow the doctors’ orders because they do not understand or
         agree with the doctors’ diagnosis.

         Illness is culturally constructed and embedded in a complex family, social, and cultural context.
         Illness experience is an intimate part of social systems of meaning and rules for behaviour and
         strongly influenced by culture. It is not surprising, then, that there can be marked cross-cultural
   15    differences in how disorders are defined and coped with. The variation may be equally great
         across ethnic, class, and family boundaries. Thus, doctors’ explanations and activities, as well
         as those of their patients, are also culture-specific.

         For patients, the difficulties in living that result from illness are usually viewed as the disorder
         itself. Conversely, doctors often disregard illness problems because they look upon the disease
   20    as the disorder. Both views are insufficient. Doctors’ lack of attention to the patient’s experience
         of illness is in part responsible for patient noncompliance, patient and family dissatisfaction with
         health care, and inadequate clinical care.

         Take for example the case of a 33-year-old Chinese man (Cantonese-speaking) who came
         to the medical clinic at an American hospital with tiredness, dizziness, general weakness,
   25    pains in the upper back, a sensation of heaviness in the feet, weight loss, and insomnia. He
         denied having any emotional problems and had no relevant past medical history. Medical tests
         were negative for a physical disorder. The doctor considered the patient to be anxious and
         depressed but the patient rejected this. Although the patient initially refused psychotherapy for
         the diagnosis of mental disease, he finally accepted this treatment, but only after it was agreed
   30    that he would also be given medication. Nonetheless, during the course of his care, the patient
         never accepted the idea that he was suffering from a mental disease. He described his problem,
         as did his family, as due to “wind” (fung) and “not enough blood” (mkaù-huèt).

         He believed that he had acquired the “wind” disease, after having overindulged in sexual
         relations, which resulted in loss of “blood and vital breath” (huèt-hèi) causing him to suffer from
   35    “cold” (leãng) and “not enough blood”. After seeking advice from his Chinese family and friends,
         the patient first began treating himself for his symptoms with traditional Chinese herbs and diet
         therapy. This involved both the use of tonics to “increase blood” (po-huèt) and treatment with
         symbolically “hot” (ît) food to correct his underlying imbalance.
                                                            –3–                      N18/3/SOCAN/SP1/ENG/TZ0/XX

            This patient and his family believed his illness to be a physical disease, labelling it in traditional
     40     Chinese medical terms. In Chinese cultural settings, where mental illness is highly stigmatized,
            minor psychiatric problems are most commonly experienced and treated as physical symptoms.

            Anthropological studies of American health culture can help us to understand the complexities
            involved in the doctor-patient relationship within and across different cultural contexts. By
            freeing ourselves from ethnocentric and “medicocentric” views, we may begin to recognize
     45     important issues that are often ignored.

1.        Describe the difference between “disease” and “illness” in the text.                                   [6]


2.        Explain how a doctor’s concept of “disease” influences the success or failure of treatment.            [6]


3.        Compare and contrast this example of people having different understandings of a single
          phenomenon with another such example in one society that you have studied in detail.                   [8]
