Notes for examiners:

1. Whenever relevant, carry over marks must be awarded. If a candidate makes an error in
   calculation, but then uses the incorrect figure appropriately and accurately in later question
   parts, then the candidate may be fully rewarded. This is the “own-figure rule” and you should
   put OFR on the script where you are rewarding this.

2. Alternative approaches may be taken in responses to the [4] questions that use A02 command
   terms. If this is the case and the alternative approaches are valid, then full credit should be
   given.

1.   (a)   (i)    Calculate Firm A’s average fixed costs when it is producing 125 cartons
                  of coffee per month.                                                            [2]

(ii)    Using Figure 2, calculate the total costs when 55 cans per month
        are produced.                                                                          [2]

        30  55

        Identification of ATC at $30 or any valid working is sufficient for [1].

         $1650

        An answer of $1650 or 1650 (without working) is sufficient for [1].

        NB If the candidate identifies ATC as $29 or $31, (with a final answer of
        $1595 or $1705) this should be fully rewarded.

(iii)   Explain why in the short run, as output increases, marginal costs typically
        decrease and then increase.                                                      [4]

Level                                                                              Marks

          below.
   1      The written response is limited.                                         1–2
          For a limited explanation that marginal product initially tends to
          increase but then because of a fixed input (factor), diminishing
          returns cause MP to fall.

          OR

          MP falls because of a fixed input, which increases the additional
          costs of one more unit, and so MC increases.

          Allow [1] mark only if “productivity” used instead of MP or if fixed
          input not mentioned.

          An algebraic response (see below) without any reference to The
          Law of Diminishing Marginal Returns may be awarded a
          maximum of [2] marks.
   2      The written response is accurate.                                        3–4
          For explaining that marginal product initially tends to increase,
          due to specialization, but then because of a fixed input (factor)
          that has to be shared, diminishing returns cause MP to fall.

          AND EITHER

          as MP falls, the additional costs of one more unit of output will
          begin to increase and so MC increases.

          OR

                  VC (wL)            L 
          MC                   w            1 
                                            w  MP 
                   Q     Q          Q          
          so, if MP increases, then MC will decrease and, when MP
          decreases (as a result of the LoDMRs), then MC will increase.

(c)   (i)     Using this information, draw and label the average revenue curve on Figure 2.   [1]




              A correctly labelled AR (or P/MR/D) line is sufficient for [1].

      (ii)    Using Figure 2, identify the quantity of cans per month Firm B must produce
              in order to maximize profits.                                                   [1]

              Where marginal revenue equals marginal cost.

              An answer of 105 is sufficient for [1].

              If the candidate identifies the quantity as 104 or 106 this should be fully
              rewarded.

              OFR may apply.

      (iii)   Calculate the economic profit when Firm B is producing at the output level
              identified in part (c)(ii).                                                     [2]

              105 (21  23)

              Any valid working is sufficient for [1].

               $210 or a loss of $210

              An answer of $210 or a loss of $210 (without working) is sufficient for [1].

              OFR may apply — eg $208 if 104 cans identified in (c)(ii) OR $212 if 106
              cans identified in (c)(ii).

(d)   Sometimes a firm continues to produce in the short run, even when it is making
      an economic loss. Explain why the firm might choose to do this.                           [2]

       Level                                                                            Marks

                For a response that the price is above the shut-down price
                (minimum AVC) OR the firm is covering its variable costs.
          2     There is clear understanding.                                              2
                For a response that in the short run, the firm should continue to
                produce provided price covers (average) variable costs, since it
                is making a contribution to fixed costs OR the firm’s losses are
                less than its fixed costs, so its losses would be greater if it shut
                down.

(e)   Outline why a perfectly competitive firm is a “price taker”.                              [2]

                For a response that it does not have market power and so must
                accept the market price.

                If the firm raises the price both its quantity sold and revenue will
                drop to zero (there is also no benefit from lowering its price,
                since it can sell any amount at the market price).

(f)   Firm B and all the other firms in the tea market begin to sell their tea in distinctive
      packages and many differentiate their product with organic tea or fruit flavours.
      Explain how the demand curve faced by Firm B will change as a result.                     [2]

                For a response that the demand curve will slope down because
                the firm now has the market/monopoly power (or the ability to be
                a price maker) OR that the demand curve will slope down
                because it is now a monopolistic competitor OR the firm’s
                demand curve is no longer perfectly elastic because it now has
                the market power to change its price.

(g)   Firm B conducted a market survey and found out that the price elasticity of demand for
      its brand of tea is 0.8 among urban customers, whereas it is 1.2 among customers
      in rural areas. The sales director said “This information could help Firm B to raise its
      revenue, by trying to separate the two markets, provided that certain conditions are
      satisfied”. Explain this statement.                                                        [4]

      Firm B could:
       price discriminate in two separate markets (charge different prices in
        different/separate markets)
       charge a higher price to urban customers (or a lower price to rural)
       when demand is inelastic a higher price yields more revenue (or when elastic demand a
        lower price yields more revenue)
       Firm B needs to separate the two markets so no opportunity for resale (or Firm B needs to
        have some monopoly/price-setting power).

               [3].

               For providing two accurate reasons, award a maximum of [4].

               Accurate explanations may include:
                to assist buyers of cotton the cotton subsidy will decrease
                 production costs, increase supply and thus decrease price
                to assist producers (farmers) of cotton as the price per unit
                 earned following the subsidy as well as the amount produced
                 and sold will be greater leading to higher revenues
                to assist the textile industry as cotton is (as stated) an input
                 and thus costs of production will decrease making textiles
                 cheaper and increasing profitability
                to increase employment (lower unemployment) as more
                 output in the cotton and textile markets will require more
                 workers
                to increase exports and/or reduce imports by making the
                 cotton produced in San Marcus more competitive in the
                 international market.

               Any valid response.

              cheaper imported inputs for producers
              greater scope for exports
              more competition for exporting and importing sectors

             advantage or one disadvantage and a limited explanation of a
             disadvantage or advantage.
             Award a maximum of [4] for providing two accurate explanations.

             Accurate explanations of advantages may include:
              since tariffs and other trade restrictions will be removed, consumers
               will enjoy cheaper and a greater variety of imports
              since tariffs and other trade restrictions will be removed, production
               costs for domestic firms using imported inputs will be lower
              domestic firms will have easier access to foreign markets increasing
               their exports
              domestic firms that grow may face lower average costs.

             Accurate explanations of disadvantages may include:
              overspecialization may render the economy vulnerable to changes in
               the prices of exports and imports
              domestic industries unable to compete with foreign producers may
               suffer job losses
              harder to establish new industries due to the competitive advantage of
               foreign producers
              loss of tariff revenues which could be used for public investment.

              NB Responses should refer to the economy of San Marcus, not just one industry such
              as the consumers or producers of cotton.
