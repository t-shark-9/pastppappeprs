                                               Section B

Answer the following question.

4.   Sam and Finn are having difficulties resolving their disagreements. Finn was convinced
     that the problems at AFA should be resolved by a change in the organizational structure.
     Sam, however, was convinced that he should strengthen the organizational culture. Sam
     reluctantly accepted the need for greater delegation but insisted that there should be more
     training for all employees on the culture and ethics of AFA.

     As part of greater delegation, Kim was given responsibility for the relationship between AFA
     and its suppliers. Kim is concerned that she spends a lot of time chasing orders that do not
     arrive and dealing with the poor quality of orders. Some products have to be thrown away
     because they have passed their sell-by dates*. Others have to be returned to suppliers
     because the outlet managers do not accept the poor quality and therefore cannot be sold.

     AFA’s stock of fair trade woollen hats has now reached 500, with an annual sales average of
     around 1250 for the whole business. Kim wants to introduce lean production including total
     quality management (TQM) throughout AFA’s operations and has created a Gantt chart to
     show the stages in implementation.



* sell-by dates: dates printed on the packaging of products that state the date after
  which the product can no longer be sold.

                                                Section C

Answer the following question.

5.     Sam is still impatient and keen to grow the business. He is becoming increasingly frustrated
       by problems with suppliers, particularly AB Clothing (ABC). Frequently, orders are late and
       wrong, and quality is becoming a major problem. Sam has heard rumours of disagreements
       amongst ABC’s board members and discontent from major shareholders. ABC’s share price
       has fallen 25 % in the last month. Productivity has fallen and strikes have been threatened.
       Recently, several press reports linked ABC to using child labour and suggested that the
       company did not always use organic materials for its products. Sam is wondering whether
       to take over ABC. He is sure that many of the problems at ABC could be resolved and that
       ABC would become, once again, a reliable supplier.

       Sam has put together some information. Figure 2 relates to AFA and shows a summary of
       issues and additional information. Tables 1 and 2 provide data on ABC.
