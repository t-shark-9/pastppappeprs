Apply the markbands that provide the “best fit” to the responses given and award credit wherever it is
possible to do so. If an answer indicates that the demands of the question are understood and
addressed but that not all implications are considered (for example, compare or contrast; reasons
or significance; methods or success), then examiners should not be afraid of using the full range of
marks allowed for by the markscheme. Responses that offer good coverage of some of the criteria
should be rewarded accordingly. If you are uncertain about the content/accuracy of a candidate’s
work please contact your team leader.

Section 1: Trade and exchange: The Silk Road in the medieval world (750–1500)

1.   Discuss the ways in which Marco Polo and Ibn Battuta connected the West and the East.

     Candidates are required to offer a considered and balanced review of the ways in which Marco
     Polo and Ibn Battuta connected the West and the East. Candidates may discuss the ways in which
     they transmitted increased knowledge of the trading opportunities, such as in jade, silk and
     porcelain, social customs, such as marriage practices, and religion. Polo and Battuta commented
     on advanced aspects of the eastern economies, such as postal services, the use of paper money
     and sophisticated ship-building techniques. Polo’s accounts of the splendours of the Khanate court
     heightened Western interest in the East. It would be valid to discuss the extent to which Polo’s and
     Battuta’s travels were known in the Middle Ages, and the reliability of their evidence. Polo and
     Battuta may be discussed separately, or a comparative approach may be adopted. Equal coverage
     of the two is not required.


2.   “The rise in seaborne trade was the most important reason for the decline of the Silk Road in the
     15th century.” To what extent do you agree with this statement?

     Candidates are required to consider the merits or otherwise of the argument that the rise of
     seaborne trade was the most important reason for the decline of the Silk Road in the 15th century.
     In support of the argument candidates may discuss the impact of the voyages of Zheng He, which
     opened up seaborne trade with India, Africa and the Middle East. This was quicker and more
     secure than the land alternative. The voyages of Dias and da Gama came too late to influence
     trade before 1500. Candidates may consider the importance of other factors, for example, the
     steep decline in the silk trade, the Chinese policy of “turning in”, the threats from nomadic tribes
     and the fragmentation of the Mongol Empire which made the Silk Road more hazardous.
                                                 –6–                 N18/3/HISTX/HP3/ENG/TZ0/OC/M


Section 2: Japan in the age of the samurai (1180–1333)

3.   “Buddhism was the most significant influence on the samurai way of life.” Discuss.

     Candidates are required to offer a considered and balanced review of the influence Buddhism had
     on the samurai way of life. In support of the argument candidates may consider how Buddhism
     focused on developing the attributes of self-discipline, self-reliance, meditation and concentration
     amongst the samurai. These skills benefited them greatly in their military training and preparation
     for battle. Candidates may argue that other factors had a greater or equal influence on the samurai
     way of life. These could include a discussion of Confucianism, the Eight Virtues and the samurai
     code of honour. Although the term Bushido was not used at this time it is acceptable for candidates
     to refer to code of honour as Bushido. This code emphasized military skills and the qualities of
     kindness, honesty, care and respect by which the samurai lived.


4.   “The Mongol invasions highlighted Japan’s military weaknesses and it was only the kamikaze
     storms (1274 and 1281) that saved Japan.” To what extent do you agree with this statement?

     Candidates are required to consider the merits or otherwise of the argument that Japan’s military
     was weak and that Japan was only saved from the Mongol invasions by the kamikaze storms.
     Candidates may agree, partly agree or disagree with the statement. Arguments for Japan’s military
     weakness may include the traditional practices and methods of warfare of the Japanese such as
     their opening ceremony to the battle, only firing single arrows and their horses being unprepared
     for the noise of more modern warfare. Arguments supporting the argument that the kamikaze
     storms saved Japan from invasion, may include how the storms destroyed the Mongol ships,
     forcing them to retreat. Arguments against the statement may include the strengths of the Mongols
     and the ways in which Japan’s military was better prepared for the second Mongol invasion with
     improved defences and new tactics.
                                                  –7–                 N18/3/HISTX/HP3/ENG/TZ0/OC/M


Section 3: Exploration, trade and interaction in East Asia and South-East Asia (1405–1700)

5.   Evaluate the impact of European settlements on the indigenous peoples of the region.

     Candidates are required to make an appraisal of the impact of European settlements on the
     indigenous peoples in the region. There may be different approaches to this question and an
     appraisal could be achieved by considering the changing nature of the impact over time. There
     may be consideration of positive and negative effects of the settlements, or of whether social,
     economic or political effects were greater. European settlements could include those of the
     Spanish, Portuguese, French, Dutch and British and candidates may choose to focus on one in
     depth or have a broader discussion of several. The social impact may be considered to have
     encompassed the impact of missionaries on society and the impact on education, language and
     culture. Economic effects may include the issue of international trade and exploitation of resources.
     Political effects could refer to rebellions and the demise of local leaders.


6.   Discuss the motives for, and impact of, Japan “turning in”.

     Candidates are required to offer a considered and balanced review of the motives for, and impact
     of, Japan “turning in”. Motives for this may include a growing fear of the religious influence of
     Spanish and Portuguese missionaries and the growing number of Catholic converts in Japan. Fear
     of colonisation and exploitation of Japan’s natural resources by European settlers may also be
     considered. The decision to “turn in” may have been made to ensure peace for Japan and thereby
     secure the political status of the bakufu. Candidates are also required to discuss the effects of
     Japan’s “turning in” and these may include the implementation of the alternate attendance, the
     political and economic strengthening of the bakufu, peace and the weakening of the samurai.
     Candidates may also suggest that Japan was not fully isolated and did maintain some links with
     the outside world through Dutch Learning.
                                                 –8–                  N18/3/HISTX/HP3/ENG/TZ0/OC/M


Section 4: The rise and fall of the Mughal Empire (1526–1712)

7.   “Lack of centralized political control was the most important reason for the rise of Mughal power in
     India.” Discuss.

     Candidates are required to offer a considered and balanced review of the merits of the statement.
     Links must be made between the suggested factors and the way they contributed to the rise of
     Mughal power. In support of the statement candidates may consider the fact that Lodi power was
     declining, that there were many defectors, the Rajput confederacy was unable to unite and that
     Daulat Khan, the governor of Lahore, had invited Babur to save him from Ibrahim Lodi.
     Consideration of other factors may include Babur’s military might and careful planning, his heavy
     guns and cannons and his superior Turkish-style artillery. His leadership and oratorical skills as
     well as his final defeat of the Afghan and Bengali forces raised by Mahmud Lodi may also be
     referenced.


8.   Discuss the social, cultural and economic achievements of the Mughal Empire in India.

     Candidates are required to offer a considered and balanced review of the social, cultural and
     economic achievements of the Mughal Empire in India. For social achievements, they may discuss
     the social harmony of various ethnic and religious groups under Akbar. However, candidates may
     note that under his successors, riots and revolts occurred. The Hindu-Muslim symbiotic
     relationship may also be considered. Cultural developments were numerous in art, architecture,
     literature and painting although there was evidence of instances of destruction of art and
     architecture. The Sufi and Bhakti movements also developed during this time along with the
     development of the Urdu language. New types of cuisine arose and these became popular among
     diverse groups in society. For economic achievements, there may be a discussion of the trading
     system, commerce, agriculture and taxation that was introduced and developed by the Mughals.
                                                  –9–                  N18/3/HISTX/HP3/ENG/TZ0/OC/M


Section 5: Colonialism and the development of nationalism in South-East Asia (c1750–1914)

9.    “The Dutch colonial system had a damaging impact on the Indonesian economy.” To what extent
      do you agree with this statement?

      Candidates are required to consider the merits or otherwise of the argument that the Dutch colonial
      system had a damaging impact on the Indonesian economy. In support of the statement,
      candidates may consider the imposition of monopolies on the most valuable spices, which resulted
      in the flight of capital to the Netherlands. They may also consider the impact of burdensome
      taxes—such as the land tax, on top of continuing tribute to indigenous rulers—and the Coolie
      Ordinance. Beneficial effects, such as increased demand for Indonesian products, and, in the 19th
      century, the abolition of the Cultivation System and the introduction of the Agrarian Law, which
      promoted landholding by Indonesians, will also be addressed. There were significant
      improvements to infrastructure and the labour market.


10.   Evaluate the significance of Aguinaldo on the development of nationalism in the Philippines.

      Candidates are required to make an appraisal of the significance of Aguinaldo on the development
      of nationalism in the Philippines. Candidates may evaluate Aguinaldo’s military record, from his
      early successes in Cavite province to his later, mixed record against both the Spaniards and the
      Americans. There may be an appraisal of his relationship with other leaders, such as Bonifacio,
      who was executed with Aguinaldo’s approval, or with Filipino elites. His role in promoting the first
      Filipino constitution may also be considered. Candidates may evaluate his relations with the US,
      especially during and after his capture in the Philippine-American War. They may also refer to
      Aguinaldo’s role in achieving a limited degree of Filipino self-government at the end of the period
      and other factors, such as the roles of Rival and Bonifacio, and resentment of Spanish and
      American rule in the development of Filipino nationalism.

Section 6: India, Afghanistan and Burma (1750–1919)

11.   “Military success was the most important factor in the expansion of the British East India
      Company’s power.” Discuss.

      Candidates are required to offer a considered and balanced review of military success as the most
      important factor in the expansion of the British East India Company’s power up to 1857.
      Candidates may discuss battles between the British East India Company and the French in
      southern India, the Battle of Plassey against the Nawab of Bengal and the Battle of Buxar against
      the Mughals. They may also discuss the Anglo-Maratha, the Anglo-Mysore and the Anglo-Sikh
      wars. Candidates may consider the importance of other factors such as the use of diplomacy by
      the Company as a method of expansion through the Native Cover principle, the Subsidiary Alliance
      and the Doctrine of Lapse. Social and cultural policies of the Company, the absence of unified local
      opposition and the role of missionaries as a means to expand power may also be discussed.


12.   Discuss the economic and social effects of the British colonial system in Burma up to 1919.

      Candidates are required to offer a considered and balanced review of the economic, social and
      cultural effects of the British colonial system in Burma up to 1919. Economic effects may include
      the transition from agrarian self-sufficiency to reliance on foreign trade, the introduction of railways
      and steamboats and the consequences for Burmese dispossessed farmers of the arrival of Indian
      labourers in Burma. For social effects, candidates may discuss new hierarchies that arose with the
      creation of an Anglo-Burmese group due to intermarriage between the British and the Burmese.
      Social disintegration also took place with the separation of the sangha and the state. With the end
      of monarchy there was no more royal patronage for Buddhist monks. Missionaries brought
      Christianity to Burma and started schools. Candidates may consider the groups that benefited or
      suffered from these effects.
                                                  – 11 –               N18/3/HISTX/HP3/ENG/TZ0/OC/M


Section 7: Challenges to traditional East Asian societies (1700–1868)

13.   Discuss the successes and failures of Emperor Qianlong’s rule.

      Candidates are required to offer a considered and balanced review of the successes and failures
      of Emperor Qianlong’s rule. They may discuss the string of military successes at the beginning of
      his rule that, for example, enabled the formation of the “New Territory” of Xinjiang, while pointing
      out that the latter years of his rule were militarily less successful. There may be discussion of
      Qianlong’s patronage of the arts, including his huge collection of paintings, calligraphy, porcelain
      and cloisonnerie, which promoted a flowering of Chinese culture, despite large-scale censorship.
      The increasing elitism that characterized his government in later years, and the corruption centred
      on the youthful favourite Heshen, may be considered failures as may the widespread revolts that,
      although defeated, symbolized discontent with imperial rule.


14.   To what extent were the British responsible for the outbreak of the First Opium War?

      Candidates are required to consider the merits or otherwise of the argument that the British were
      responsible for the outbreak of the First Opium War. In support of the argument, candidates may
      point out that the British were motivated entirely by economic self-interest, as the opium trade
      helped to correct the imbalance of their trade with China. Furthermore, the British refused to abide
      by Chinese law, objecting to the seizure of illicit opium, and preventing the Chinese from enforcing
      laws in their territorial waters. Candidates will consider other factors, for example Chinese
      responsibility, addressing their refusal to establish cordial relations with foreign powers and their
      previous toleration of the opium trade. Candidates may also consider that the Chinese were
      motivated by self-interest, as the opium trade was, by 1841, draining silver supplies, which was
      damaging to the Chinese economy.
                                                  – 12 –                N18/3/HISTX/HP3/ENG/TZ0/OC/M


Section 8: British colonialism and emerging national identities in Oceania (1788–1919)

15.   To what extent were the Selection Acts important to the establishment of early colonial settlements
      in Australia?

      Candidates are required to consider the merits or otherwise of the suggestion that the Selection
      Acts were important to the establishment of early colonial settlements in Australia. In support of the
      argument candidates may consider the ways in which the Selection Acts increased land ownership
      and resulted in millions of acres of land being purchased and cultivated. However, candidates may
      also argue that the Selection Acts were rather limited and only directly benefited a few hundred
      settlers. The wider impact of the Selection Acts may be discussed, this could include the
      development of towns, industries and railways and the use of more modernized farming methods.
      Candidates may challenge the argument by discussing other factors that were important to the
      establishment of early settlements including immigration, land distribution, squatting and the gold
      rushes.


16.   Discuss the social and economic impact of the First World War on either Australia or New
      Zealand.

      Candidates are required to offer a considered and balanced review of the social and economic
      impact of the First World War on either Australia or New Zealand. For social impact in Australia,
      candidates may discuss the changing role of women, the problems dealing with returning soldiers
      and the development of a sense of national identity separate from the UK. Economic impact may
      include the disruption to trade, the development of Australian domestic industry focused on the war
      effort and the rise of trade unions. For New Zealand, candidates may discuss the social
      developments of nationhood and national identity as well as the changing role of women.
      Economically New Zealand experienced limited impact although it did develop a more war-focused
      economy.

Section 9: Early modernization and imperial decline in East Asia (1860–1912)

17.   To what extent did resentment of foreign influence cause the Boxer Rebellion (1900–1901)?

      Candidates are required to consider the merits or otherwise of the suggestion that resentment of
      foreign influence caused the Boxer Rebellion. Candidates may agree, partly agree or disagree with
      the suggestion. In support, candidates may consider the role of the Unequal Treaties, resentment
      of the tactics of Christian missionaries and the blaming of foreigners for natural disasters such as
      the Yangtze floods and the 1900 drought. Candidates may comment on examples of protests
      against foreigners, such as attacks on foreign diplomats and missionaries. The Manchus may be
      regarded as examples of foreign influence. Candidates may consider the importance of other
      factors, such as tensions at court over the adoption of the Guangzu reforms, the role of the
      Empress Dowager, the perceived disturbing effects of new technology such as railways and
      telegraph wires, and the patronage of the Boxers by some court factions.


18.   “The impact of social and cultural change in Meiji Japan was extensive.” Discuss.

      Candidates are required to offer a considered and balanced review of the extent of social and
      cultural change in Meiji Japan. Extensive social change came with the loss of feudal domains,
      merit-based recruitment into government positions and the expropriation of the samurai. Cultural
      changes may include discussion of developments in travel, dress, hairstyle and occupations.
      Candidates may consider the extent of educational change following the Iwakura Mission, for
      example the expansion of female education and the Imperial Rescript on Education. Nevertheless,
      there were limitations to the extent of change and many Japanese remained resistant to Western
      values. Traditional roles and values remained important and many of the changes had limited
      impact in rural areas. Candidates may also argue that Japan’s social structure remained largely
      intact as the samurai and nobility still held considerable influence.

Section 10: Nationalism and independence in India (1919–1964)

19.   Evaluate the effectiveness of the Non-Cooperation and Civil Disobedience movements in
      furthering the cause of Indian independence.

      Candidates are required to make an appraisal of the effectiveness of the Non-Cooperation and
      Civil disobedience movements in furthering the cause of Indian independence. Non-Cooperation
      may include the Champaran satyagraha, the Moplah rebellion and Chauri Chaura. Discussion may
      include reference to the legitimacy, mass participation and non-violent nature of the activities in the
      1920s. Candidates may suggest the movements had limitations; for example, big business did not
      support the economic boycotts and strikes. Candidates may question the withdrawal of non-
      cooperation in 1921 due to violence. Civil disobedience may be deemed to include responses to
      the Simon commission, the salt satyagraha, boycott of foreign goods and the no tax campaigns.
      British Government repression and non-support by Muslims may be considered in evaluating the
      effectiveness of the movements. The effectiveness of both movements may be discussed,
      although there may not be equal coverage of both.


20.   To what extent was Jinnah responsible for the partition of India in 1947?

      Candidates are required to consider the merits or otherwise of the suggestion that Jinnah was
      responsible for the partition of India. They are required to gauge the extent of Jinnah’s role in the
      partition and, in support of their argument, they may include his mobilization of the Muslim masses,
      formulation of the two-nation theory, the Day of Deliverance announcement, the Lahore
      Resolution, Direct Action Day and the acceptance of the cabinet Mission Plan. Candidates will
      consider the importance of other factors that led to partition, for example, the British policy of divide
      and rule, the failure of the Congress as a national organization to placate all sections of society,
      Gandhi’s use of Hindu terms, which may have alienated the Muslims, and the role of other Muslim
      leaders such as Iqbal and Rahmat Ali. They may also consider the rise of Hindu communalism as
      a factor.

Section 11: Japan (1912–1990)

21.   “The increasing influence of the army in the 1920s and 1930s undermined democracy in Japan.”
      Discuss.

      Candidates are required to offer a considered and balanced review of how the increasing influence
      of the army undermined democracy in Japan. In support of the argument candidates may discuss
      the increasing nationalist nature of the army. The assassinations of politicians throughout the
      1920s and 1930s may be discussed as well as the February 26 Incident, when a group of army
      officers led a violent coup against the government. Candidates may also discuss events in
      Manchuria as an example of the army acting without the authority of the government, but the
      response should be focused on events mainly within Japan. Candidates may argue that other
      factors had a greater or equal influence on undermining democracy. These could include social
      and economic problems, the Great Depression and the wider international context. Candidates
      may argue that democracy in Japan was never likely to succeed and that the military was held in
      higher regard than politicians by many Japanese.


22.   Discuss the reasons, up to 1990, for Japan’s “economic miracle”.

      Candidates are required to offer a considered and balanced review of the reasons why Japan
      experienced an “economic miracle” up to 1990. Candidates may provide balance by discussing
      which of these reasons were the most important. Reasons given by candidates may include US
      Occupation, major US investment and the important role Japan played during the Korean War. The
      creation of the Ministry of International Trade and Industry (MITI) was also an important reason for
      Japan’s economic growth. Government investment, particularly throughout the 1960s, in
      infrastructure and the communications and technology industries may also be discussed. The
      export trade was also significantly developed throughout the 1960s and the 1970s. Candidates,
      may argue that the disciplined and determined nature of Japanese society also contributed
      towards their “economic miracle”. Candidates may focus solely on the period up to 1973 or may
      extend their discussion up to 1990, either of these approaches is valid.

Section 12: China and Korea (1910–1950)

23.   Evaluate the contribution of the Treaty of Versailles (1919) to the rise of national identity in China.

      Candidates are required to make an appraisal of the contribution of the Treaty of Versailles (1919)
      to the rise of national identity in China. In appraising its contribution, candidates may highlight
      Chinese reaction to Japanese retention of German possessions in Shandong, in violation of the
      principle of self-determination that had been endorsed in Wilson’s Fourteen Points. The Chinese
      refused to sign the treaty, which was seen as another unequal treaty forced on them by foreign
      powers further stimulating nationalism. There may be an appraisal of the role of the May Fourth
      Movement, a direct reaction to the humiliation of Versailles, which called for equality with foreign
      powers, a remodelling of national institutions and the abandonment of Confucianism. Candidates
      may argue that other factors also led to increased nationalism including the impact of Japan’s 21
      Demands, the New Culture Movement, and the leadership of Sun Yixian.


24.   To what extent did the mistakes of the Nationalists lead to their defeat in the Chinese Civil War
      (1946–1949)?

      Candidates are required to consider the merits or otherwise of the statement that the mistakes of
      the Nationalists led to their defeat in the Chinese Civil War (1946–49). Nationalist mistakes for
      consideration may include: the over-extension of their forces into Manchuria and Yan’an; their
      failure to cultivate the support of the peasantry and the mismanagement of the economy leading to
      hyperinflation. The poor quality of military and political leadership of the Guomindang led to
      widespread desertion and low morale. To assess the extent to which Nationalist mistakes led to
      their defeat, candidates may consider alternative factors including the leadership, popular policies
      and tactics of the Communists. Candidates may also argue that foreign influence and the
      experiences from the Sino-Japanese War played a role in the outcome of the Civil War.

Section 13: Impact of the world wars on South-East Asia

25.   With reference to the period from 1940 to 1945, compare and contrast the activities of
      independence movements in the Dutch East Indies with those in Indochina (Vietnam).

      Candidates are required to give an account of similarities and differences between the activities of
      independence movements in the Dutch East Indies (Indonesia) with those of Indochina (Vietnam)
      from 1940 to 1945 referring to both throughout. Comparisons may include reaction to the
      occupation by the Japanese. Both regions saw the Japanese invasion as an opportunity to build a
      new nationalist force: Ho Chi Minh founded the Viet Minh, and both Sukarno and Hatta cooperated
      with the Japanese. Another factor may be the resistance of the local population to the return of
      European colonists following the defeat of Japan. For contrasts, Vichy France supported the
      Japanese in Indochina whereas the Dutch government never supported Japanese rule in
      Indonesia. Some Indonesians (Sjarifuddin, the Acehnese Ulama) were loyal to the Dutch and did
      not collaborate with the Japanese whereas the Vietnamese did not collaborate with either the
      Japanese or Vichy France. Discussion of Indo-China may be limited to Vietnam or may also
      include Cambodia and/or Laos and either of these approaches is valid.


26.   Discuss the effects of the First and the Second World War on one country in South-East Asia
      (excluding Vietnam/Indochina, Dutch East Indies/Indonesia and Malaya).

      Candidates are required to offer a considered and balanced review that includes a range of
      arguments on the effects of both the First and the Second World Wars on one country in
      South-East Asia excluding Vietnam, Indonesia and Malaya. While the effects of both wars must be
      referred to, there may be some imbalance in the extent of the discussion between the two. There
      could be different approaches as candidates may choose to comment on the long- and short-term
      effects, or the political, social, economic and international effects. As an example, they may
      comment on the political changes/actions of the government, defence and military policies and the
      rise of nationalism. Social effects may include gender issues, women’s rights, education, health
      care and the effect on minorities. The economic impact on agriculture, industry, commerce and
      changes in the traditional structure may be commented upon.

Section 14: The People’s Republic of China (1949–2005)

27.   Discuss the reasons for, and consequences of, the changing nature of Sino-American relations.

      Candidates are required to offer a considered and balanced review of the reasons for, and
      consequences of, the changing nature of Sino-American relations. The response may be focused
      on the years from 1949 to 2005 or may focus on the years of Mao (1949–1976). Either approach is
      valid. Candidates may also refer to the period before 1949 to explain the context of
      Sino-American relations. Examples of reasons for changing relations may include the Korean War,
      Taiwan, the Sino-Soviet split, the Vietnam War, Ping-Pong Diplomacy and the need for
      international trade. Consequences of this change in relations may include a discussion of Nixon’s
      visit or the official recognition of the People’s Republic of China by the UN. Post Mao, candidates
      may consider how the US and China have been cooperating more closely on trade and other
      issues; however, candidates may argue that relations had not changed extensively and that
      tensions still existed.


28.   To what extent was Deng Xiaoping a political and economic reformer in the years 1976 to 1997?

      Candidates are required to consider the merits or otherwise of the argument that Deng was a
      political and economic reformer. Candidates may agree, partly agree or disagree on the extent to
      which Deng was a reformer. Candidates may argue he was an economic reformer but that
      politically his regime was oppressive. Evidence to support the argument that he was an economic
      reformer could include the Four Modernizations, the Special Economic Zones (SEZs) and the
      opening up of China to international trade. Whether he was a political reformer is more debatable.
      Evidence to support the statement that Deng was a political reformer may include examples of how
      he rehabilitated victims of the Anti-Rightist Campaigns or how he initially supported the Democracy
      Wall. Examples to support the argument that he was not a political reformer may focus on the
      generally oppressive nature of the regime and the events in Tiananmen Square (1989).

Section 15: Cold War conflicts in Asia

29.   “The outcome of the Vietnam War had only negative economic and political effects on Vietnam.”
      Discuss.

      Candidates are required to offer a considered and balanced review of the political and economic
      effects of the outcome of the Vietnam War, focusing entirely on the period after the war ended. A
      review of political effects may include the reunification of Vietnam under national leadership for the
      first time since 1861, and the enforcement of Soviet-style communism in the South through
      security measures such as identity cards and the identification and punishment of collaborators.
      The teaching profession was purged, textbooks seized and a Marxist–Leninist curriculum
      introduced. Vietnam became a more significant power in the region as shown by their defeat of
      China in 1979. A review of economic policies may focus on the attack on the economically
      productive Chinese community and the creation of a national centrally-planned economy supported
      by Soviet subsidies, which failed to prevent famines and falling living standards.


30.   Discuss the reasons for the rise and fall of Pol Pot.

      Candidates are required to offer a considered and balanced review of the reasons for the rise and
      fall of Pol Pot, reviewing factors such as the instability of the regime of Sihanouk. This saw a
      succession of weak governments that failed to address economic stagnation and the impact of the
      Vietnam War, in particular the US bombing campaign in Cambodia. Pol Pot exploited these issues
      by securing Chinese support and employing effective political tactics, such as the forceful
      relocation of the urban population. He also projected himself as the kindly protector of peasant
      interests. The discussion of reasons for his fall may focus on the Vietnamese invasion of
      Cambodia, which resulted in Pol Pot fleeing to the north and the comprehensive defeat of the
      Khmer Rouge. Candidates may also discuss Pol Pot’s lack of visibility once in power, the failures
      of his policies and the factional disputes within the Khmer Rouge.

Section 16: Developments and challenges in South Asia after 1947

31.   Evaluate the foreign policy of Jawaharlal Nehru between 1947 and 1964.

      Candidates are required to make an appraisal by weighing up the strengths and limitations of
      Nehru’s foreign policy from 1947 to 1964. Candidates may consider the motives, philosophy and
      impact of the non-alignment policy. The strengths and limitations of India’s participation in the
      Bandung Conference, the Asian relations conference, membership of the Commonwealth along
      with the annexation of Goa may be appraised. India’s relationship with both the US and the USSR
      along with the first Indo-Pakistan war, the issue of Kashmir, the relationship with China, the
      Pancha Shila treaty, the offer of protection to the Dalai Lama and the War with China in 1962 may
      also be evaluated. Although candidates are required to refer to both strengths and limitations of
      Nehru’s foreign policy, there may be an imbalance between the two.


32.   Discuss the political challenges facing Pakistan between 1947 and 1971.

      Candidates are required to offer a considered and balanced review of the political challenges
      facing Pakistan between 1947 and 1971. In their approach, candidates may discuss internal and
      external challenges or focus on one aspect in depth. Areas of discussion may include Pakistan’s
      relationship with India and the geographical and ethnic divide with East Pakistan. Examples could
      include the refugee crisis, the issue of Kashmir and the three Indo-Pakistan wars. Following
      Jinnah’s death Pakistan faced the challenge of maintaining a democratic state and candidates may
      discuss the assassination of Prime Minister Liaqat Ali Khan and military rule under General Ayub
      Khan and General Yahya Khan. Corruption, instability and the rise of fundamentalism and violence
      may also be discussed. Friction between East and West Pakistan due to unfair political treatment
      of East Pakistan was a significant political challenge that led to the creation of Bangladesh.

Section 17: Developments in Oceania after the Second World War (1945–2005)

33.   “The policies of the Hawke/Keating government had a positive impact on Australian society.”
      Discuss.

      Candidates are required to offer a considered and balanced review of the impact of the policies of
      the Hawke/Keating government on Australian society. Candidates may agree, partly agree or
      disagree with the statement. There may be different approaches to this question for example,
      candidates may discuss the positive and negative impacts on different social groups or they may
      discuss whether social, economic or political impacts were greater. Examples of economic policies
      may include an increase in wages and pensions, providing income support and the reduction of
      child poverty. Social developments may focus on the gains made by women following the Equal
      Opportunities Act, the establishment of a Child Support Agency and a range of programmes to
      help the most vulnerable in Australian society including the homeless, aboriginals, the elderly and
      refugees. Candidates may argue that although these policies aimed to improve Australian society
      they did not fully resolve all social issues.


34.   Discuss the reasons for, and results of, the emergence of independence in Pacific Island states.

      Candidates are required to offer a considered and balanced review of the reasons for, and results
      of the emergence of independent Pacific Island states. There may be very different approaches to
      this question as candidates may choose to discuss one in depth or a broader discussion of two or
      more, either of these approaches is valid. Pacific Island states chosen could include Papua New
      Guinea, Fiji and Samoa although any Pacific Island states are valid. The reasons for the
      emergence of independent island states may include a discussion of the impact of the Second
      World War, the role of the United Nations, events in Australia and New Zealand and the growth of
      nationalist movements on the islands. The results of these states gaining independence may
      include a discussion of the establishment of democratic parliamentary government and
      constitutions, international relations, political instability and the development of a strong national
      identity and culture.

Section 18: Social, cultural and economic developments in Asia (excluding China, Japan and
            India) (1980–2005)

35.   “The tourism industry has had a significant social impact but a limited economic impact.” Discuss
      with reference to two Asian countries (excluding China, Japan and India).

      Candidates are required to offer a considered and balanced review of the statement. Candidates
      may agree, partly agree or disagree with the statement. They are required to refer to both the
      social and economic impact on two countries though there might be some imbalance between the
      two. Social impacts may include the impact on social structures and communities, the proliferation
      of hotels at the cost of housing provision, migration, new ideologies, language, fashion, education,
      ecological degradation, rise of crimes such as drinking, gambling, prostitution, and child sex
      exploitation. Economic impacts may include the impact on traditional jobs, local handicrafts,
      balance of trade, import of products needed by tourists versus basic consumer goods, change in
      the balance of trade and tax structures and governmental budgets allocated to tourism at the cost
      of education and basic healthcare.


36.   Discuss the changes in social structures in two Asian countries (excluding China, Japan and
      India).

      Candidates are required to offer a considered and balanced review of the changes in social
      structures in two applicable countries. Examples must focus on the period between 1980 and 2005
      although they need not span the whole timeframe. While candidates are required to refer to
      changes in two countries, there may be some imbalance between the two. There may be
      discussion of gender issues and women’s rights, primary and higher education, urban versus rural
      issues, the move to cities with its accompanying impact on family life, the growth of the middle
      class and its impact on ideology and society. The impact of technology on society and change in
      traditional roles and healthcare may also be discussed. Although some candidates may choose to
      use a comparative approach, this is not a requirement.
