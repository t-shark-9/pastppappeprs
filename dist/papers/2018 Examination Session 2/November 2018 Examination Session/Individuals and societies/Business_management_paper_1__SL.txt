                                                Section B
Answer the following question.

4.   AFA was at a critical point. Sam and Finn had not fully resolved their disagreements. They
     seemed to be constantly arguing but Sam could also see that new issues were emerging. At
     their most recent meeting in early 2018, Finn provided the following financial information to
     illustrate the declining trend in gross profit margin.

                           Table 1: Selected financial information for AFA

                             Year      Gross profit         Sales revenue

                             2016         142 888              2 164 486

                             2017         124 211              2 400 625

     In addition, the recruitment of new staff was becoming a problem, as the wages that AFA
     offered were much lower than fair trade competitors. In a meeting between Sam and Finn,
     they argued over the best way to financially reward and motivate newly recruited workers,
     given the lower wages paid by AFA.
     Finn argued for a reward system based on fringe payments (perks), as this was being
     offered by AFA’s main competitors, the supermarkets. Sam countered that AFA should form
     a cooperative involving all physical stores. He argued that creating a worker cooperative
     could give all members a sense of community and fulfillment and motivate them so that
     all members of the cooperative would benefit. There would also be additional stakeholder
     benefits. Finn argued that a worker cooperative was too difficult to organize and operate and
     would not solve the problem of recruiting staff.

     In the meantime, AFA was continuing to attract a good deal of publicity. Sam had appeared
     on a national television show about young, innovative entrepreneurs. After the television
     show ended, one very large international retailer with a strong online presence contacted
     Sam about the possibility of a takeover. Sam initially refused, but as the details of the
     takeover became clear he started to seriously consider the opportunity. By selling the
     business Sam would have enough fresh capital to start new, innovative businesses and
     make some of his other visions and ideas into reality. In addition to the corporate social
     responsibility (CSR) AFA was generating, the takeover would give AFA access to other
     intangible assets. However, the international retailer had indicated that it could not guarantee
     keeping all existing and newly recruited employees and managers. Finn and Kim were both
     very worried that Sam would even contemplate the takeover, which they felt was an act of
     betrayal to all the stakeholders of AFA.

     (a)   Define the term intangible asset.                                                            [2]

     (b)   (i)    Calculate the gross profit margin of AFA for 2016 and 2017.                           [2]

           (ii)   Explain one possible reason for the trend in gross profit margin for AFA between
                  2016 and 2017.                                                                        [2]

     (c)   Explain one benefit and one cost to AFA of using fringe payments (perks) to financially
           reward staff.                                                                                [4]

     (d)   Discuss whether Sam should accept the offer of a takeover.                                  [10]
