Paper 2 assessment criteria

A — Knowledge and comprehension

  Marks      Level descriptor
     0       The answer does not reach a standard described by the descriptors below.
             The answer demonstrates limited knowledge and understanding that is of marginal
    1–3      relevance to the question. Little or no psychological research is used in the
             response.
             The answer demonstrates limited knowledge and understanding relevant to the
    4–6
             question or uses relevant psychological research to limited effect in the response.
             The answer demonstrates detailed, accurate knowledge and understanding relevant
    7–9      to the question, and uses relevant psychological research effectively in support of
             the response.


B — Evidence of critical thinking: application, analysis, synthesis, evaluation

  Marks      Level descriptor
     0       The answer does not reach a standard described by the descriptors below.
             The answer goes beyond description but evidence of critical thinking is not linked to
    1–3
             the requirements of the question.
             The answer offers appropriate but limited evidence of critical thinking or offers
    4–6      evidence of critical thinking that is only implicitly linked to the requirements of the
             question.
             The answer integrates relevant and explicit evidence of critical thinking in response
    7–9
             to the question.


C — Organization

  Marks      Level descriptor
     0       The answer does not reach a standard described by the descriptors below.

    1–2
             throughout the response.
    3–4      The answer is well organized, well developed and focused on the question.
                                                   –4–                 N18/3/PSYCH/BP2/ENG/TZ0/XX/M


Abnormal psychology

1.   To what extent do cognitive factors influence abnormal behaviour?

     Refer to the paper 2 assessment criteria when awarding marks.

     The command term “to what extent” requires candidates to consider the contribution of
     cognitive factors that affect abnormal behaviour.

     Cognitive factors may include, but are not limited to:
     • cognitive approaches to treatment
     • cognitive etiologies for specific disorders
     • negative cognitive schemas influencing depression
     • distorted weight-related schema influencing bulimia
     • intrusive memories influencing panic reactions in patients with PTSD (post-traumatic
       stress disorder).

     The focus of the response should be on the cognitive factors influencing abnormal
     behaviour. However, it is appropriate and useful for candidates to address other
     factors (such as biological factors and/or sociocultural factors) in order to respond to
     the command term “to what extent”.

     The term “abnormal behaviour” can be interpreted by candidates differently – some
     candidates may focus on the extent to which cognitive factors influence only one type
     of abnormal behaviour (for example, a specific disorder) or address the term in a
     general manner by offering several examples of how some cognitive factors relate to
     several disorders. Both approaches are equally acceptable.

     Candidates may consider a small number of cognitive factors in order to demonstrate
     depth of knowledge, or may consider a larger number of cognitive or sociocultural
     factors in order to demonstrate breadth of knowledge. Both approaches are equally
     acceptable.
                                                  –5–                 N18/3/PSYCH/BP2/ENG/TZ0/XX/M


2.   Evaluate one or more examples of psychological research (theories and/or studies) related to
     approaches to treatment.

     Refer to the paper 2 assessment criteria when awarding marks.

     The command term “evaluate” requires the candidate to make an evaluation of theories
     and/or studies related to approaches to treatment by weighing up the strengths and
     limitations of the selected theory or study. Although a discussion of both strengths and
     limitations is required, it does not have to be evenly balanced to gain high marks.

     Relevant theories may include, but are not limited to:
     • systematic desensitization
     • the cognitive-behavioural model
     • social learning theory (social cognitive theory)
     • the serotonin hypothesis.

     Relevant studies may include, but are not limited to:
     • Neale et al.’s (2011) meta-analysis of published studies on the outcome of anti-
       depressants versus placebo
     • Hay et al.’s (2004) study on the effectiveness of cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT)
       in the treatment of bulimia
     • Leuchter et al.’s (2002) study on the changes in brain function during treatment with
       selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) versus during treatment with placebo
     • Elkin et al.’s (1989) controlled outcome study of treatment of depression
     • Pampallona et al.’s (2004) meta-analysis of efficacy of drug treatment alone versus
       drug treatment and psychotherapy in depression.

     Evaluation of the selected theory or study may include, but is not limited to:
     • cultural or gender considerations
     • empirical findings
     • conditions under which the explanations/findings may be applied
     • comparison to other explanations
     • methodological and ethical considerations.

     Candidates may evaluate one theory/study in order to demonstrate depth of
     knowledge, or a greater number of theories/studies in order to demonstrate breadth of
     knowledge. Both approaches are equally acceptable.
                                                   –6–                 N18/3/PSYCH/BP2/ENG/TZ0/XX/M


3.   Contrast the use of biomedical and individual approaches to the treatment of one disorder.

     Refer to the paper 2 assessment criteria when awarding marks.

     The command term “contrast” requires candidates to give an account of the differences
     between biomedical and individual approaches to the treatment of one disorder. Critical
     thinking (synthesis/analysis) may also be demonstrated by referring to an eclectic
     approach that combines biomedical and individual approaches to the treatment of one
     disorder.

     Expect a range of different approaches to treatment to be offered in response to the
     question. Individual treatments could include systematic desensitization, cognitive
     behavioural therapy (CBT) or person-centred therapy. Biomedical approaches could
     include drug therapy, electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) or psychosurgery, for example.
     Responses should provide an accurate and well-organized description of both
     approaches to treatment.

     Contrasting points addressed may include, but are not limited to:
     • the effectiveness of the two approaches to treatment
     • the assumptions about etiology upon which they are based with regard to the
       disorder
     • cultural, gender, ethical or practical issues related to the implementation of
       biomedical and individual approaches to the treatment of one disorder.

     Responses should be focused on biomedical and individual approaches to treatment of
     one specific disorder to demonstrate detailed knowledge and understanding relevant to
     the question.

     If a candidate contrasts the use of biomedical and individual approaches to treatment
     for more than one disorder, credit should be given only to the part of the response
     relevant for the first disorder.

     If a candidate contrasts the use of biomedical and individual approaches to the
     treatment with no explicit link to one specific disorder, the response should be awarded
     up to a maximum of [4] for criterion A, knowledge and comprehension, up to a
     maximum of [5] for criterion B, critical thinking, and up to a maximum of [2] for criterion
     C, organization.

     If the response contrasts group approaches to treatment to biomedical/individual
     approaches to treatment, the response should be awarded up to a maximum of [4] for
     criterion A, knowledge and comprehension, up to a maximum of [3] for criterion B,
     critical thinking, and up to a maximum of [2] for criterion C, organization.
                                                  –7–                  N18/3/PSYCH/BP2/ENG/TZ0/XX/M


Developmental psychology

4.   To what extent do biological factors influence human development?

     Refer to the paper 2 assessment criteria when awarding marks.

     The command term “to what extent” requires candidates to consider the contribution of
     biological factors that affect human development.

     Responses may refer to biological factors including but not limited to:

     • the effects of maturation of the nervous system on cognitive development
     • Waber’s (2007) MRI (magnetic resonance imaging) studies showing that as children
       mature, the speed of mental processing generally increases
     • the role of neuroplasticity in brain development
     • the role of stress hormones on faulty development
     • the role of sex hormones
     • Bowlby’s theory that the capacity for attachment is innate.

     In order to respond to the command term, it is appropriate and useful for candidates to
     discuss:
     • the issue of reductionism
     • how human development is the result of complex interactions between biological,
        sociocultural and cognitive factors
     • how biology and experience act together to produce the normal course of
        development.

     The focus of the response should be on the biological factors influencing human
     development. However, it is appropriate and useful for candidates to address other
     factors (such as cognitive factors and/or sociocultural factors) in order to respond to the
     command term “to what extent”.

     Candidates may address a small number of biological factors in order to demonstrate
     depth of knowledge, or may address a larger number of biological factors in order to
     demonstrate breadth of knowledge. Both approaches are equally acceptable.

     Animal research may be used as long as a clear link is made to human development.
                                                 –8–                 N18/3/PSYCH/BP2/ENG/TZ0/XX/M


5.   Evaluate one or more examples of psychological research (theories and/or studies) relevant to the
     formation and development of gender roles.

     Refer to the paper 2 assessment criteria when awarding marks.

     The command term “evaluate” requires candidates to make an appraisal of research
     related to the formation and development of gender roles by weighing up the strengths
     and limitations. Although a discussion of both strengths and limitations is required, it
     does not have to be evenly balanced to gain high marks.

     Relevant theories may include, but are not limited to:
     • gender schema theory that stresses the key role of cognitive processes in the
       development of gender roles
     • social learning theory that highlights the importance of the social environment and
       emphasizes the potency of observational and modelling processes
     • theory of psychosexual differentiation that is based on the assumption that gender
       roles are related to genetic sex determined by chromosomes
     • evolutionary theory that attempts to locate gender role differences in a historical
       evolutionary context
     • psychodynamic theory that is based on the assumption that gender roles appear
       when children identify with their same-sex parent.

     Relevant studies may include, but are not limited to:
     • Martin and Halvorson’s (1983) study showing the role of gender schemas on gender
       roles
     • Fagot’s (1978) study showing the influence of parents on gender roles
     • Mead’s (1935) study showing that gender roles depend upon the society
     • Money and Ehrhardt’s (1972) study claiming that children are gender neutral at birth.

     Evaluation may include but is not limited to:
     • methodological and ethical considerations
     • cultural and gender considerations
     • the accuracy and clarity of the concepts
     • contrary findings or explanations
     • the productivity of the theory in generating psychological research
     • the applications of the empirical findings.

     A candidate may evaluate one theory or study in order to demonstrate depth of
     knowledge, or may evaluate a larger number of theories/studies in order to
     demonstrate breadth of knowledge. Both approaches are equally acceptable.

     If a candidate discusses only strengths or only limitations, the response should be
     awarded up to a maximum of [5] for criterion B, critical thinking, and up to a maximum
     of [2] for criterion C, organization. Up to full marks may be awarded for criterion A,
     knowledge and comprehension.
                                               –9–                 N18/3/PSYCH/BP2/ENG/TZ0/XX/M


6.   Discuss the relationship between physical change and development of identity during adolescence.

     Refer to the paper 2 assessment criteria when awarding marks.

     The command term “discuss” requires candidates to offer a considered review of the
     relationship between physical change and development of identity during adolescence.

     Relevant content may provide an outline of the emergence of primary and secondary
     sexual characteristics then show how that affects identity formation during
     adolescence, such as:
     • Simmons and Blyth (1987) – the cultural ideal hypothesis
     • Ferron (1997) – cultural differences in the way adolescents view bodily changes
     • Mead’s cross-cultural theory
     • studies on the timing of puberty and its impact on body image, self-esteem and
       behaviour: Brooks-Gunn and Paikoff (1993); Blyth, Bulcroft and Simmons (1981);
       Jones (1965).

     Discussion may include, but is not limited to:
     • the difficulty of generalizing the psychological effects of physical changes – they
        depend on the timing of puberty and they differ in boys and girls
     • biology is not the only factor influencing the development of identity
     • culture is a strong determinant in self-perception and body shape perception
     • puberty’s effects on development of identity may not be as strong as once believed.

     Responses should focus on the link between physical changes and identity
     development. Physical changes have psychological ramifications that contribute to an
     adolescent’s sense of self.

     If a candidate only addresses development of identity or only addresses physical
     change in adolescence, the response should be awarded up to a maximum of [4] for
     criterion A, knowledge and comprehension, up to a maximum of [3] for criterion B,
     critical thinking, and up to a maximum of [2] for criterion C, organization.

Health Psychology

7.   Discuss one or more strategies for coping with stress.

     Refer to the paper 2 assessment criteria when awarding marks.

     The command term “discuss” requires candidates to offer a considered review of one
     or more strategies used to cope with stress.

     Relevant strategies (including models and techniques) may include, but are not limited
     to:
     • problem-focused and emotion-focused strategies (Lazarus and Folkman, 1988;
         1975)
     • forms of cognitive behavioural therapy such as stress inoculation training
         (Meichenbaum, 1985)
     • social support groups/networks (Brown and Harris, 1978)
     • mindfulness-based stress reduction strategies (Kabat-Zinn, 1979).

     Candidates may also address ineffective or unhealthy coping strategies, such as drug
     taking, alcohol abuse, smoking, overeating, or the use of defense mechanisms.

     Discussion of the strategies may include, but is not limited to:
     • research supporting or refuting the effectiveness of the strategy/strategies
     • presenting possible methodological, ethical or cultural considerations
     • a comparison and/or contrast of strategies
     • strengths and limitations of the strategy/strategies.

     Candidates may discuss one strategy in order to demonstrate depth of knowledge or
     may discuss a larger number of strategies in order to demonstrate breadth of
     knowledge. Both approaches are equally acceptable.
                                                – 11 –              N18/3/PSYCH/BP2/ENG/TZ0/XX/M


8.   Examine one or more prevention strategies for substance abuse and/or addictive behaviour.

     Refer to the paper 2 assessment criteria when awarding marks.

     The command term “examine” requires candidates to consider an argument or concept
     in a way that uncovers the assumptions and relationships between substance abuse
     and/or addictive behaviour and strategies designed to prevent this behaviour.

     Substance abuse and/or addictive behaviour may refer to addictions to tobacco,
     alcohol, marijuana, cocaine, sex, gambling, or food, among others.

     Relevant prevention strategies may include, but are not limited to:
     • targeting risk groups with health education
     • use of social learning in media campaigns
     • fear arousal through advertising
     • government interventions, banning advertising, increasing the cost of the substance,
       or banning smoking and alcohol.

     Relevant campaigns/studies may include, but are not limited to:
     • smoking prevention campaigns such as the TRUTH anti-tobacco campaign in
       Florida in the 1990s
     • the Australia North Coast study of the “Quit For Life” campaign, which resulted in a
       15 percent reduction in smoking over three years
     • Carr’s (1994) field study on the use of peer education in the prevention of fetal
       alcohol syndrome in Canada.

     In order to respond to the command term “examine”, candidates may refer to:
     • health beliefs within cultures
     • lifestyle and sociocultural context
     • availability of health institutions
     • socio-economic status.

     Responses may examine treatment of substance abuse and/or addictive behaviour (for
     example, Alcoholics Anonymous, nicotine patches) and this approach should be
     awarded marks if the response indicates that this treatment will prevent further
     substance abuse and/or addictive behaviour. For example, in secondary prevention
     (such as for alcohol use disorder or nicotine addiction) in order to prevent relapse.

     Candidates may address one or a small number of prevention strategies in order to
     demonstrate depth of knowledge, or may address a larger number of prevention
     strategies in order to demonstrate breadth of knowledge. Both approaches are equally
     acceptable.
                                                   – 12 –               N18/3/PSYCH/BP2/ENG/TZ0/XX/M


9.   Discuss two or more factors related to overeating and the development of obesity.

     Refer to the paper 2 assessment criteria when awarding marks.

     The command term “discuss” requires candidates to offer a considered review of two or
     more factors related to overeating and the development of obesity.

     It is not necessary for candidates to make a distinction between overeating and
     obesity.

     Factors may include, but are not limited to:
     • physiological factors – for example, genetic predisposition, the role of dopamine,
       neurobiological explanation of food addiction
     • psychological/cognitive factors – for example, low self-esteem, distorted body
       image, pessimistic thinking patterns, cognitive restraint
     • sociocultural factors – for example, sedentary lifestyle, high-fat diet, coping with
       poverty.

     Relevant research may include, but is not limited to:
     • Garn et al.’s (1981) study of correlation rates between body size in parents and their
       children
     • Stunkard et al.’s (1990) study of identical twins reared apart in terms of body size
     • Jeffery (2001): an increasingly sedentary way of life leads to more people suffering
       from the results of obesity
     • Prentice and Jebb’s (1995) study of correlation rates between obesity and physical
       activity
     • Blundel et al.’s (1997) study of obesity and percentage of fat in one’s diet
     • Volkow et al.’s (2002) fMRI (functional magnetic resonance imaging) study
       indicating that obese participants had the same deficiency in dopamine receptors as
       drug addicts
     • Nylander and Soerensen’s (2004) study of body shape attitudes and cultural norms.

     Discussion may include, but is not limited to:
     • cultural, gender and ethical considerations
     • empirical evidence and related methodological factors
     • the interaction between biological, cognitive, and sociocultural factors.

     If a candidate discusses only one factor, the response should be awarded up to a
     maximum of [5] for criterion A, knowledge and comprehension, up to a maximum of [4]
     for criterion B, critical thinking, and up to a maximum of [2] for criterion C, organization.

Psychology of human relationships

10.   Evaluate the effectiveness of two strategies for reducing violence.

      Refer to the paper 2 assessment criteria when awarding marks.

      The command term “evaluate” requires candidates to make an appraisal by weighing
      up the strengths and limitations of two strategies for reducing violence. Although a
      discussion of both strengths and limitations is required, it does not have to be evenly
      balanced to gain high marks.

      A strategy is any plan of action or programme for reducing violence. It is appropriate
      for candidates to address models and theories related to strategies for reducing
      violence.

      Examples of strategies may include, but are not limited to:
      • a community based strategy, for example, Metropolitan Area Child Study (MACS),
        2002; Olweus, 1993
      • group treatment programmes, such as the Duluth model (for example, Robertson,
        1999)
      • zero tolerance anti-bullying programmes (for example, Boccanfuso and Kuhfeld,
        2011)
      • jigsaw classrooms against bullying (for example, Aronson, 1979)
      • empathy training (for example, Feshbach and Feshbach, 1982)
      • computer-based strategies to improve empathy (for example, Figueiredo et al.,
        2007).

      Evaluation of the effectiveness of the strategies may include, but is not limited to:
      • cultural, gender and ethical issues
      • methodological issues
      • long-term versus short-term effectiveness
      • the difficulties in assessing the effectiveness of a strategy
      • supporting and/or contradictory findings or explanations.

      If a candidate focuses only on general issues related to violence and does not address
      any strategies for reducing violence, the response should be awarded up to a
      maximum of [3] for criterion A, knowledge and comprehension, up to a maximum of [3]
      for criterion B, critical thinking, and up to a maximum of [2] for criterion C, organization.

      If a candidate evaluates more than two strategies for reducing violence, credit should
      be given only to the first two discussions. However, candidates may address other
      strategies for reducing violence and be awarded marks for these as long as they are
      clearly used to evaluate one or both of the two main strategies addressed in the
      response.

      If a candidate evaluates only one strategy for reducing violence, the response should
      be awarded up to a maximum of [5] for criterion A, knowledge and comprehension, up
      to a maximum of [4] for criterion B, critical thinking, and up to a maximum of [2] for
      criterion C, organization.

      If a candidate discusses only strengths or only limitations, the response should be
      awarded up to a maximum of [5] for criterion B, critical thinking, and up to a maximum
      of [2] for criterion C, organization. Up to full marks may be awarded for criterion A,
      knowledge and comprehension.

11.   Analyse the role that culture plays in the formation and maintenance of relationships.

      Refer to the paper 2 assessment criteria when awarding marks.

      The command term “analyse” requires candidates to bring out (emphasize) essential
      aspects of the role that culture plays in the formation and maintenance of relationships.

      Candidates do not need to distinguish between the formation and maintenance of
      relationships, as the two are so closely linked.

      Candidates may address different types of relationships, for example, romantic
      relationships, marriages, friendship, family relationships, workplace relationships.

      Studies may include, but are not limited to:
      • Yelsma and Athappilly’s (1988) comparative study of arranged marriages and love
         marriages
      • Buss et al.’s (1990) study of international preferences in selecting mates (a study of
         37 cultures)
      • Levine et al.’s (1995) study on the role of love in the establishment of marriage
      • Buss’s (1994) cross-cultural study of relationships
      • Canary and Dainton’s (2003) study of Korean relationships
      • Ahmad and Reid’s (2008) study of communication styles in arranged marriages
      • Moghaddam et al.’s (1993) study on the influence of cultural dimensions, for
         example of individualism versus collectivism and the Western bias in research on
         relationships.

      Evidence of critical thinking may be provided by candidates in the following ways:
      • addressing the issue of universality (for example, equity is not a universal value in
         relationships)
      • comparing and contrasting cultural similarities and differences in relationships (for
         example, do social norms affect how appropriate it is to express dissatisfaction with
         a marriage?)
      • discussing the influence of biological factors
      • evaluation of relevant research including analysis of the methodology and/or ethical
         considerations
      • discussing evolutionary theory which suggests there are universal patterns in the
         formation and maintenance of relationships.

12.   Discuss two theories explaining altruism in humans.

      Refer to the paper 2 assessment criteria when awarding marks.

      The command term “discuss” requires candidates to offer a considered review of two
      theories of altruism in humans. Although two theories must be addressed, this does
      not have to be evenly balanced.

      Animal research may be used as long as a clear link is made to human behaviour.

      Theories may include, but are not limited to:
      • kin selection theory
      • reciprocal altruism theory
      • the negative-state relief model
      • empathy-altruism theory
      • social exchange theory.

      Discussion may include, but is not limited to:
      • strengths and limitations of the theories
      • methodological considerations of studies
      • cultural/gender considerations
      • supporting and/or contradictory empirical evidence
      • alternative explanations.

      Explanations of bystanderism, diffusion of responsibility and/or cost–benefit analysis
      should not be awarded marks.

      If a candidate discusses more than two theories, credit should be given only to the first
      two theories. However, candidates may discuss other theories/studies and be awarded
      marks for this as long as these theories/studies are clearly used to discuss one or both
      of the main theories addressed in the response.

      If a candidate discusses only one theory, the response should be awarded up to a
      maximum of [5] for criterion A, knowledge and comprehension, up to a maximum of [4]
      for criterion B, critical thinking, and up to a maximum of [2] for criterion C, organization.

13.   Discuss one or more theories relating arousal and/or anxiety to performance in sport.

      Refer to the paper 2 assessment criteria when awarding marks.

      The command term “discuss” requires candidates to offer a considered review of one
      or more theories relating arousal and/or anxiety to performance in sport.

      It is not necessary for candidates to distinguish between arousal and anxiety.

      Theories include, but are not limited to:
      • Yerkes and Dodson’s (1908) inverted-U hypothesis
      • Zajonc’s (1965) drive theory
      • Apter’s (1982) reversal theory
      • Baumeister’s (1984) explicit monitoring theory
      • Frazey and Hardy’s (1988) catastrophe model
      • Hardy’s (1996) multidimensional anxiety theory
      • Hanin’s (1997) individual zones of optimal functioning theory
      • Bandura’s (1997) theory of self-efficacy.

      Discussion of the selected research may include but is not limited to:
      • methodological considerations
      • the accuracy and clarity of the concepts
      • contrary findings or explanations
      • the productivity of the theory in generating psychological research
      • the applications of the empirical findings.

      If a candidate discusses one or more theories relating arousal and/or anxiety to
      performance in general but not relevant for sport, the response should be awarded up
      to a maximum of [3] for criterion A, knowledge and comprehension, up to a maximum
      of [3] for criterion B, critical thinking, and up to a maximum of [2] for criterion C,
      organization.

      Candidates may discuss one theory in order to demonstrate depth of knowledge, or a
      greater number of theories in order to demonstrate breadth of knowledge. Both
      approaches are equally acceptable.

14.   Explain relationships between team cohesion and performance in sport.

      Refer to the paper 2 assessment criteria when awarding marks.

      The command term “explain” requires candidates to give a detailed account, including
      reasons or causes, for relationships between team cohesion and performance.

      The word “team” should be interpreted to include sports in which all team members
      participate at the same time (for example, football) or in which team members
      participate one at a time (for example, track and field).

      Studies include, but are not limited to:
      • Ingram et al.’s (1974) study on “social loafing” as a result of team cohesion
      • Locke and Latham (1985) on the value of process goals and their potential to
         enhance team performance
      • Slater and Sewall (1994) on the bidirectional relationship between team cohesion
         and performance
      • Boone et al.’s (1997) study on individual’s perceptions of a team
      • Kenow and Williams (1999) on comparison of cohesion strategies in coaches from
         Australia and the US
      • Gould et al. (1999) on US Olympic teams’ cohesiveness and performance
      • Grieve et al.’s (2000) study on the unidirectional relationship of team cohesion
         and performance
      • Carron et al.’s (2002) study on the positive effect of team cohesion on performance.

      Evidence of critical thinking may be provided by candidates in the following ways:
      • gender and/or cultural factors
      • analysis of negative and/or positive effects
      • bidirectionality
      • factors other than team cohesion that influence performance
      • evaluation of relevant research.

      Candidates may explain a small number of relationships between team cohesion and
      performance to demonstrate depth of knowledge, or may explain a larger number of
      relationships to demonstrate breadth of knowledge. Both approaches are equally
      acceptable.

      The question is specifically asking about relationships between team cohesion and
      performance in sport. Discussion of team cohesion and performance in general is not
      the focus of the question.

      If a candidate explains relationships between team cohesion and performance in
      general but not relevant for sport, the response should be awarded up to a maximum of
      [3] for criterion A, knowledge and comprehension, up to a maximum of [3] for criterion
      B, critical thinking, and up to a maximum of [2] for criterion C, organization.

15.   Examine two or more reasons for using drugs in sport.

      Refer to the paper 2 assessment criteria when awarding marks.

      The command term “examine” requires candidates to consider an argument or concept in
      a way that uncovers the assumptions and relationships of the issue of drug use in sport.

      Candidates may address both legal (prescribed painkillers, for example) and illegal
      (anabolic steroids, for example) use of drugs in sport. A discussion of blood doping in
      sport is an appropriate topic for use in a response.

      The question is specifically asking about reasons for using drugs in sport. Discussion of
      addiction or drug abuse itself is not the focus of the question. In order to remain focused,
      candidates must direct their response toward drug use in sport.

      Reasons for using drugs in sport include, but are not limited to:
      • improvement of performance
      • prolong a career in sport
      • more rapid recovery from injury
      • stress reduction
      • pain reduction
      • increase attractiveness
      • peer pressure.

      Relevant research includes, but is not limited to:
      • Newman and Newman (1991) on the role of conformity in steroid use by Canadian
        athletes
      • Whitehead et al.’s (1992) study of steroid use in US male high school students
      • Anshel’s (1998) study on the role of social learning theory in drug use in young athletes
      • Shermer’s (2008) application of game theory (for example, prisoner’s dilemma) to drug
        usage in sport.

      Discussion points may include, but are not limited to:
      • gender differences
      • bidirectionality
      • cultural variations
      • empirical findings that support or refute the reasons for using drugs in sport.

      Candidates may discuss two reasons in order to demonstrate depth of knowledge, or may
      discuss a larger number of reasons in order to demonstrate breadth of knowledge. Both
      approaches are equally acceptable.

      If a candidate discusses only one reason, the response should be awarded up to a
      maximum of [5] for criterion A, knowledge and comprehension, up to a maximum of [4] for
      criterion B, critical thinking, and up to a maximum of [2] for criterion C, organization.

      If a candidate examines two or more reasons for using drugs in general but not relevant
      for sport, the response should be awarded up to a maximum of [3] for criterion A,
      knowledge and comprehension, up to a maximum of [3] for criterion B, critical thinking,
      and up to a maximum of [2] for criterion C, organization.
