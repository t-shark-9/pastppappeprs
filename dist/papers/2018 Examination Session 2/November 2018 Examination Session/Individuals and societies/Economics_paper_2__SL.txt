                                 South Africa’s grain millers oppose corn tariff

     	A battle is taking place between South African corn farmers and the corn millers who process
        corn. Grain South Africa (Grain SA) is the organization that represents the interests of corn
        farmers. It has asked the country’s International Trade Administration Commission (ITAC) to
        protect local corn farmers from low global corn prices by imposing a tariff on corn imports.

     	South Africa’s corn millers are opposing the request by Grain SA to implement the tariff on
        corn imports. The corn millers argue that a tariff will cause a burden for consumers and cattle
        farmers. In South Africa, corn is an essential food and also a source of feed for livestock.

     	According to Reuters news service, South Africa is “Africa’s largest corn producer and is
        relied upon by neighboring Sub-Saharan nations to [reinforce] their own corn supplies and
        feed their people.” A drought in South Africa has dramatically increased the price of corn.
        In addition, the reduced supply has prompted the need for imports. “South Africa [has
        traditionally been] a net exporter of corn ... [but] for the second year in a row, [the economy]
        will become a net importer of corn.” The need to import corn has shocked both the corn
        farmers and the government.

     	The United States (US) is the world’s largest corn producer. An unusually large harvest
        has increased US supply and more than halved the price of US corn to its current price of
        US$145 a ton. However, in South Africa, because of the drought, prices for domestically
        produced corn have more than doubled to reach an all-time high of US$348 a ton. The low
        import prices of US corn have made it very difficult for South African corn farmers to earn
        sufficient income to survive the drought, which is why they have asked ITAC for protection.

     	However, a spokesperson for the corn millers said “we are strongly opposed to any
        attempt to apply a tariff. Why do we need protection for a commodity in which we are so
        self-sufficient?” However, Grain SA have claimed that corn farmers cannot compete with
        the big corn-exporting countries, such as the US and Mexico, because their governments
        are subsidizing corn farmers. According to Grain SA, South African farmers get almost no
        assistance. This is why they have requested that ITAC implement the tariff to protect corn
        farmers from these unfair trade practices.

     	According to economists, South Africa will probably need to import about 970 000 tons of
        corn this year and a further 3.8 million tons in the following 12 months. To make matters
        worse, the rand (South Africa’s currency) has experienced a sharp depreciation against the
        US dollar. Combined, the need to import corn and the depreciation are likely to negatively
        impact South Africa’s current account.

                                                       Burundi

     	Burundi is a small landlocked African country. Densely populated, it has a population
        of approximately 10.6 million inhabitants. The economy is dominated by subsistence
        agriculture, which employs 90 % of the population, though cultivatable land is extremely
        scarce. More than a decade of conflict led to the destruction of much of the country’s
        physical, social and human capital. However, substantial improvements have occurred since
        the conflict ended in 2006, thanks largely to the success of measures implemented to reduce
        the excessive control of the military.

     	Even though Burundi is enjoying its first decade of sustained economic growth, poverty
        remains widespread. Burundi’s ranking on the Human Development Index (HDI) increased by
        2.5 % per year between 2005 and 2013 as education and health outcomes have significantly
        improved over the period, yet the country still ranks low at 180th out of 187 countries in 2013.
        Per capita gross national income more than doubled between 2005 (US$130) and 2013
        (US$280).

     	Burundi is making the transition from a post-conflict economy to a stable and growing
        economy. Economic reforms and institution building are ongoing. After significant
        improvements to achieve peace and security, the country’s development program is shifting
        gradually towards modernizing public finance. However, the government has limited
        “fiscal space” because tax collection is very hard to carry out and tax receipts are low.

     	With its limited resources, the government is attempting to strengthen basic social services
        and upgrade infrastructure and institutions, particularly in the energy, mining, and agricultural
        sectors. This has been accompanied by increasing participation of the private sector. The
        goal now is to grow a more stable, competitive and diversified economy with enhanced
        opportunities for employment and improved standards of living.

     	Over the last decade, annual economic growth in Burundi has been between 4 % and 5 %.
        Inflation continues to decline reaching 3.9 % in July 2016, down from 24 % in March 2012,
        reflecting a careful monetary policy helped by a recent decrease in the prices of imports,
        especially oil, which is an essential commodity.

     	Burundi’s main exports are agricultural; coffee and tea account for 90 % of foreign exchange
        earnings, and exports are a relatively small share of Gross Domestic Product (GDP).
