1.   (a)   Analyse varying ways in which agro-industrialization has led to environmental
           degradation.                                                                            [10]

           Agro-industrialization refers to (mostly) large-scale, mechanized food production
           and processing, often involving a high level of fertilizer, pesticide or chemical
           (antibiotic) use. In the context of global interactions, global food production is
           dominated by agro-industries (or agro-businesses). These are large TNCs
           (Cargill, Del Monte, Monsanto) with extensive production networks.

           At the national scale, ways include impacts of large-scale mechanized production on
           biodiversity, forest cover and soil fertility. For instance:
           • Removal of tropical forests for cash crops increases flooding and soil erosion.
           • Palm oil industry in Indonesia has led to widespread burning of native forest
              and smoke pollution.
           • Impacts on ecosystems of large amounts of pesticides or fertilizers entering
              the water cycle (eg, eutrophication).
           • Industrialized fish farming (aquaculture) can lead to mangrove forest loss and
              the spread of disease to wild fish populations.
           • Agri-business TNCs process food too, with implications for air and water
              quality.

           At the global scale, ways include: raised greenhouse gas emissions, due to
           methane emissions (cattle ranching), forest removal (loss of carbon store) or air
           freight movements. However, the focus should be on the way agro-
           industrialization has led to this rather than an in-depth analysis of climate change
           impacts.

           Good answers may apply (AO2) a more varied range of knowledge and
           understanding (AO1) in a well-structured way (AO4). One approach might be
           to break down large-scale environmental degradation into explicitly national and
           global effects. Another approach might be to analyse the varied impacts of
           different types of agro-industry (cattle rearing and arable systems, for instance) or
           varied impacts on different environmental domains (local, global, atmosphere,
           hydrosphere, etc).

           For band C (4–6), expect either some weakly-evidenced outlining of
           impacts/challenges of agro-industry/ modern farming.

           For band D (7–8), expect a structured, well-evidenced analysis of:
           • either varied kinds of environmental degradation (eg water/air/soil) caused by
             global-scale/large-scale mechanized/industrialized agriculture
           • or specific agro-industries/TNCs whose global operations have led to
             environmental degradation.

           For band E (9–10), expect both band D traits.
                                              –5–                 N18/3/GEOGR/HP3/ENG/TZ0/XX/M


(b)   Examine the loss of distinctiveness that some places experience as a result of
      global interactions.                                                                         [15]

      Credit all content in line with the markbands. Credit unexpected approaches
      wherever relevant.

      The focus is on the loss of distinctiveness of places (either localities, cities or
      countries). The question suggests that this may be a result of global interactions.
      Possible dimensions of loss include visible changes to/erosion of cultural
      landscapes and the built environment; also, social/identity changes for people
      living in these places (diet, languages spoken, music, etc). Also credit ideas of a
      loss of political distinctiveness (ie sovereignty) due to the growth of multi-
      governmental organizations (MGOs).

      Material dealing with ‘switched-off’ places - where change has been resisted
      altogether (eg North Korea, or Amish populations) – should not be over-credited.
      This is because the question asks for an examination of the losses that have
      happened (and not a discussion of whether or not there is any loss). In contrast,
      material that reflects critically on the degree/spectrum of loss should be credited
      highly (this could include N Korea/Amish if there is recognition that some losses
      have occurred for these populations).

      Possible applied themes (AO2) include knowledge and understanding (AO1) of:
      • issues of landscape homogenization [Guide 4]
      • the homogenizing power of global media and TNCs [Guide 5]
      • telecommunication network growth (as a vehicle for cultural transmission) [Guide 2]
      • processes of cultural diffusion linked with flows of people and commodities [Guide 5]
      • the extent to which glocalization (adaption, rather than adoption, of culture) leads to
        loss of distinctiveness [Guide 5]
      • changing political identities/distinctiveness due to MGO growth [Guide 6].

      Good answers may synthesize (AO3) three or more of these themes in a well-
      structured (AO4) way.

      Good answers may additionally offer a critical evaluation (AO3) that examines
      contrasting contexts, scales and/or aspects of place distinctiveness. One approach
      might be to examine the connections between particular types of global interaction
      and particular changing place characteristics. Another approach might be to
      examine the extent to which changes are highly distinctive (and visible) or not.
      Another approach might be to examine a spectrum of losses (ranging from places
      that have lost only a little of their original distinctiveness to those that have suffered
      a major loss; but do not over-credit accounts of places where there has been no loss
      at all, as this is outside the remit of the question).

      For band C (5–8), expect weakly-evidenced outlining of two or three relevant
      themes from the geography guide.

      For band D (9–12), expect:
      • either a structured synthesis that links together several well-evidenced and
        well-focused themes from the geography guide
      • or a critical conclusion (or ongoing evaluation).

      For band E (13–15), expect both of these traits.
                                                   –6–                 N18/3/GEOGR/HP3/ENG/TZ0/XX/M


2.   (a)   Analyse the spatial and temporal pattern of adoption of one or more branded
           commodities.                                                                            [10]

           Branded commodities, such as McDonald’s burgers or Apple iPhones, have been
           adopted in a greater number of places as more time has passed. In addition to
           the pattern of countries that have become markets, local-scale adoption patterns
           can be analysed also (eg, urban–rural divides in access to these commodities).
           Only one example is required. If two examples are used then credit breadth
           rather than depth of analysis. Answers are likely to include both descriptive and
           explanatory content in support of the analysis.

           Answers that give a variety of explanantions for the success of a branded
           commodity, yet pay little or no attention to the pattern of adoption, are unlikely to
           progress far beyond a C/D boundary mark.

           Good answers may apply (AO2) a wider range of knowledge and understanding
           (AO1) in a well-structured way (AO4). One approach might be to analyse any
           glocalized changes to the product that have accompanied its wider adoption.
           Another approach might be to analyse the national or local boundaries to adoption,
           eg an answer may analyse global poverty patterns, or may find anomalies where
           there is local resistance to product adoption for cultural, political or economic
           reasons. Good answers may also analyse the way a pattern of product adoption
           is related to trade bloc/MGO membership (eg, the spread of commodities within
           the EU).

           Other approaches may be equally valid. Marks should be allocated according to
           the markbands.

           For band C (4–6), expect some weakly-evidenced outlining of the
           adoption/spread of a brand/commodity spatially and/or over time (this may be
           implied).

           For band D (7–8), expect a structured, well-evidenced analysis of:
           • either ways in which increased adoption has been achieved in more places
             over time (eg glocalization) for one or more branded commodities
           • or the spatial and temporal pattern(s) of adoption (expect an overview, not just
             isolated examples).

           For band E (9–10), expect both band D traits.

(b)   “The rich get richer but the poor get poorer as a result of global interactions.”
      Discuss this statement.                                                                     [15]

      Credit all content in line with the markbands. Credit unexpected approaches
      wherever relevant.

      The focus here is disparities in wealth (or other interpretations of “rich”, eg happiness
      index) between people and/or places, which is a concept that can be discussed at
      varying scales (expect some structured discussion of different scales to be provided
      in a good answer). The merit of the answer is likely to depend on the variety of
      different contexts and groups of people that are discussed, and also the variety and
      sophistication of the counter-arguments.

      Possible applied themes (AO2) include knowledge and understanding (AO1) of:
      • the global core and periphery [Guide 1]
      • financial flows and their beneficiaries, including foreign direct investment and
        remittances [Guide 3]
      • the impacts of global labour flows on the wealth of places [Guide 3]
      • information flows and their economic interactions [Guide 3]
      • TNCs and consumer culture (and the beneficiaries of this) [Guide 5]
      • the economic benefits of multi-governmental organizations (and possible costs
        for non-members, eg tariffs) [Guide 6]
      • the wealth of TNCs compared with nation states [Guide 6]
      • isolated non-globalized groups/states and their relative poverty [Guide 7].

      Good answers may synthesize (AO3) three or more of these themes in a well-
      structured (AO4) way.

      Good answers may additionally offer a critical evaluation (AO3) of a wider
      range of place and people contexts to provide some balance of both increasing
      and decreasing disparities. Good answers might take a more nuanced view
      when evaluating “the rich get richer”. For example, a handful of billionaires have
      the same wealth as the poorest half the world’s population. Good answers might
      counter-argue the statement by discussing poverty alleviation since the 1990s
      (less than a billion people remain in extreme poverty, far lower than in the past).

      Answers that deal only with reasons for the existence of “poor countries” and
      “rich countries” are unlikely to meet the critical evaluation criteria required for
      band E.

      For band C (5–8), expect weakly-evidenced outlining of two or three relevant
      themes from the geography guide.

      For band D (9–12), expect:
      • either a structured synthesis that links together several well-evidenced and
        well-focused themes from the geography guide
      • or a critical conclusion (or ongoing evaluation).

      For band E (13–15), expect both of these traits.

3.   (a)   Explain how global interactions can lead to greater environmental awareness.           [10]

           Responses may focus on examples of global environmental management, or
           possibly of greater awareness in a particular country/context. Examples of the
           former include response to transboundary pollution, such as oil spills or acid rain;
           global climate change governance; global ecological/conservation initiatives such
           as Ramsar, WWF, and UNESCO.

           The work of a range of stakeholders at varying scales, including civil society
           organizations and NGOs, such as Greenpeace, or MGOs (UN, EU) can be
           described and explained. Consideration may be given to the environmental
           messages that are sent, the medium through which they are transmitted / type of
           global interaction (eg, internet, Facebook, etc) and their effectiveness.

           Another approach is to argue that global interactions are often environmentally
           damaging and that we cannot help becoming aware of them in a media-saturated
           world (eg, Gulf of Mexico oil spill or climate change).

           Good answers may apply (AO2) a wider range of knowledge and understanding
           (AO1) in a well-structured way (AO4). One approach might be to systematically
           analyse different environmental contexts (eg, climate, biodiversity, water quality).
           Another approach might be to analyse how different types of global interaction
           (social media, films, protest movements) can lead to greater awareness.

           For band C (4–6), expect some weakly-evidenced outlining of global
           environmental awareness.

           For band D (7–8), expect a structured, well-evidenced explanation that includes:
           • either a varied account of growing environmental awareness led by different
             named stakeholders
           • or a varied account of different kinds of global interaction (online, media
             reporting, tourist movements, global political agreements, etc.).

           For band E (9–10), expect both band D traits.

(b)   “Globalization is a constantly accelerating process.” Discuss this statement.          [15]

      Credit all content in line with the markbands. Credit unexpected approaches
      wherever relevant.

      Any aspect of acceleration can be discussed: likely themes include faster types of
      transport and the arrival of the internet. Different aspects of globalization
      (migration, trade, idea flows) can be “weighed” separately for evidence of
      acceleration. A counter-argument is expected also. This may make use of
      recent current affairs (the UK’s “Brexit” vote of 2016, or protectionism in the
      USA), or earlier cessations in the growth of globalization (1939–45 war; 1970s
      OPEC oil crisis; 2008 financial crisis).

      Possible applied themes (AO2) include knowledge and understanding (AO1) of:
      • changing globalization participation data (KOF index) [Guide 1]
      • growth in transport and telecommunications [Guide 2]
      • accelerating ICT adoption [Guide 2]
      • financial flows and the rate at which they have grown or lessened [Guide 3]
      • labour and out-sourcing flows and their growth or reduction [Guide 3]
      • the growing adoption of branded commodities and the diffusion of culture [Guide 5]
      • the growth of multi-governmental organization and trading agreements [Guide 6]
      • anti-global movements [Guide 6/7].

      Good answers may synthesize (AO3) three or more of these themes in a
      well-structured (AO4) way.

      Good answers may additionally offer a critical evaluation (AO3) that
      systematically discusses the acceleration or deceleration of different aspects of
      globalization (such as trade, migration and data flows). Another approach might
      be to discuss the extent to which acceleration has been constant over time, or
      whether any changes have been more complex. Another approach might be to
      examine whether there are limits to “constant” acceleration (given the implication
      of exponential growth).

      For band C (5–8), expect weakly-evidenced outlining of two or three relevant
      themes from the geography guide.

      For band D (9–12), expect:
      • either a structured synthesis that links together several well-evidenced and
        well-focused themes from the geography guide
      • or a critical conclusion (or ongoing evaluation).

      For band E (13–15), expect both of these traits.
