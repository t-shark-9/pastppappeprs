1.    Describe the difference between “disease” and “illness” in the text.                               [6]

      The question requires a mainly descriptive answer showing understanding of the
      meanings and distinction of “disease” and “illness” as discussed in the text.

      Doctors diagnose and treat diseases, whereas patients suffer illnesses. The diagnosis of
      disease by doctors is based on external medical criteria, while illness is the personal and
      cultural reaction to perceived disease, the human experience of health disorders. One
      point related to this distinction mentioned in the text is that 50% of visits to doctors are for
      complaints without a biological base.

      Stronger responses may infer that both the doctors’ conception of disease and the
      patients’ of illness as explanatory models are cultural constructions and that this
      distinction is significant not only in the case study given but also is relevant in other
      cultural contexts.

      Other relevant points or examples might include: the disregard of doctors for the patient’s
      experience of illness and/or the non-compliance of the patients. In the case of the Chinese
      patient, this distinction gave rise to the lack of understanding between the doctor and the
      patient. The Chinese patient’s attention was to the body (for example, he was suffering
      from “wind” disease caused by overindulgence in sexual relations) while the American
      doctor focused on the mental diagnosis.

      Candidates do not need to cover all of the points above, but the answer does have to be
      focused and in the candidate’s own words to obtain full marks.

2.    Using theoretical perspectives, explain how a doctor’s concept of “disease” influences
      the success or failure of treatment.                                                             [6]

      There are several points in the text which can be drawn on to answer this question, but
      stronger answers will incorporate concepts and knowledge from social and cultural
      anthropology that are relevant to the analysis and interpretation of the passage.

      Responses may identify that the clinical reality is a product of two models, that of the
      physician and that of the patient interacting to arrive at a negotiated clinical outcome.
      However, power relations are always a factor in arriving at this result and in the American
      cultural context, the assumption is that biomedicine based on scientific knowledge is superior
      to alternative explanations. Yet where only disease is treated, treatment will be less
      satisfactory for the patient and less clinically effective than where both disease and illness
      are treated together. The case introduced shows the impact cultural beliefs can have on
      patient and doctor explanations of illness/disease. It shows how divergent explanatory
      models, based on different cultural perspectives and social roles, can produce problems in
      clinical care. The Chinese cultural context of this case explicitly illustrates phenomena that
      occur in day-to-day clinical practice in the mainstream of American medical culture.
      Candidates may approach this question by discussing the success or failure of the treatment
      related to the different understandings of the disorder and recognizing that the two competing
      models are both cultural constructions.

      Candidates may approach this question from general anthropological concepts and terms
      related to different themes (for example, 2.4 Political organization, 2.6 Systems of
      knowledge, 2.7 Belief systems and practices, 2.8 Moral systems). Topics and concepts such
      as classification systems, power and resistance, meaning, ideology, community, culture,
      symbolism, cultural relativism, class, stratification, gender, ethnicity and agency can be
      explored.

      The authors’ viewpoint includes a recognition that the same symptoms may be understood in
      multiple ways, making explicit the limitations of the “medicocentric” view and that this is
      culture-specific. From the authors’ perspective, anthropological studies of American health
      culture can help us recognize important issues that have often been ignored, including the
      complexities involved in the doctor-patient relationship within and across different cultural
      contexts. Students may recognize that the authors’ viewpoint is culturally relative. The
      success or failure of treatment does not rely solely on clinical diagnosis but needs to take
      into account the patient’s experience and understanding of illness.

      (HL) Several theoretical perspectives may be discussed, including particularistic (for example
      the patient and his family believed his illness to be a physical disease, labelling it in
      traditional Chinese medical terms), universalistic (for example, the assumption by medical
      science that diagnosis of disease is free of cultural context), agency (where patients reject
      the medical diagnosis of disease), idealistic (patients’ understanding of illness is based on
      culturally-constructed ideas of cause and effect).

3.    Compare and contrast this example of people having different understandings of a single
      phenomenon with another such example in one society that you have studied in detail. [8]

      The target societies for this question are varied and many. The question requires
      candidates to demonstrate that in any given society there are multiple interpretations and
      understandings of any given phenomenon. Candidates may but do not need to select
      examples related to medical cases as any examples where multiple and diverse
      interpretations of a single phenomenon are possible and valid. These may include
      differences of interpretation of a single phenomenon between ethnic groups, teachers and
      students, social classes, leaders and followers, genders, experts and lay people, etc.

      (HL) Candidates may choose to use theoretical perspectives (ideally introduced in their
      question 2 response) to help frame their comparison.

      (All) In order to obtain full marks answers must be organized in a clear manner,
      highlighting similarities, differences and generalizations. Candidates must situate the
      comparative case in terms of place, author and historical context to gain more than [4
      marks].
