1.   (a)    Explain how the price mechanism reallocates resources when there is an
            increase in demand for a good or service.                                        [10]

            Answers may include:
            • definitions of resources, demand
            • diagram to show how an increase in demand leads to a reallocation of
              resources
            • explanation of how the signalling and incentive functions of price lead to a
              reallocation of resources when demand increases for a good or service
            • examples of goods and services where the price mechanism has
              reallocated resources because of an increase in demand.

(b)   Discuss whether an oligopolistic firm should collude rather than compete.           [15]

      Answers may include:
      • definitions of oligopoly, collusion
      • diagram to show open/formal collusion (single, downward-sloping demand
        curve as in monopoly diagram)
      • explanation of how open/formal collusion would limit competition between
        member firms and maximize joint profits as if the firms were collectively a
        monopoly and/or the term “tacit collusion”, including reference to price
        leadership by a dominant firm
      • examples of where firms have colluded
      • synthesis or evaluation (discuss).

      Discussion may include: consideration of the arguments in favour of collusion
      – economic (abnormal) profits (which can be re-invested in research and
      development and/or distributed to the shareholders); consideration of the
      arguments in favour of competition: lower prices and higher quantity for
      consumers, improved product quality/variety, increased market share for the
      competing firm(s), improved allocative and/or productive efficiency, difficulties
      of maintaining cartel structures due to the incentive of cartel members to
      cheat.

      which, if appropriate, should be rewarded.

      NB Definitions, theory, and examples that have already been given in part (a),

4.   (a)    Explain the potential effects on the economic growth rate from a substantial increase
            in the number of skilled people of working age entering a country.                      [10]

            Answers may include:
            • definitions of economic growth, growth rate
            • diagram(s) to show how an outward shift of the AD curve and/or an outward
              shift of the LRAS/production possibility curve would lead to economic
              growth
            • explanation of how an increase in the population leads to an increase in AD
              in the short term (resulting in short-term economic growth) and/or how an
              increase in the number and qualification of the workforce leads to an
              increase in the quality and quantity of labour (resulting in long-term
              economic growth)
            • examples of immigration affecting economic growth rates of countries.

                   Relevant economic terms are defined.
                   Relevant economic theory is explained and applied.
                   Where appropriate, diagrams are included and applied.
                   Where appropriate, examples are used.
                   There are few errors.

                   question.
                   Relevant economic terms are clearly defined.

(b)   Discuss the view that, apart from indicating economic growth rates over time,
      national income statistics are of little use.                                            [15]

      Answers may include:
      • definitions of economic growth, growth rate, (real) GNI/GNP (per capita),
        (real) GDP (per capita)
      • a diagram is not required but candidates may use diagram(s) to show
        economic growth, inequality in the distribution of income
      • explanation of the uses of national income statistics for making
        comparisons over time, for making comparisons between countries and for
        making conclusions about the standards of living
      • examples of such uses in practice
      • synthesis or evaluation (discuss).

      Discussion may include: consideration of “little use”, the drawbacks of using national
      income statistics to make conclusions about the standards of living, practical
      difficulties of measurement and calculation, the narrowness of such statistics,
      economic growth versus economic development.

      Examiners should be aware that candidates may take a different approach which,
      if appropriate, should be rewarded.

      Opinions or conclusions should be presented clearly and should be supported by
      appropriate examples.

      NB Definitions, theory, and examples that have already been given in part (a), and
      then referred to in part (b), should be rewarded.
