Answer one question from this section.

3.   Jacob Strutz (JS)

     Jacob Strutz (JS) is an American multinational company that produces jeans. Founded in
     1860, for 100 years JS enjoyed steady growth in sales, mostly in the United States and then
     in Canada and Mexico. In the 1960s and 1970s, when teenagers worldwide began wearing
     jeans, JS’s sales increased significantly. JS’s premier product is Strutz’s No.5 jeans, one of
     the best-known brands in the world.

     In the late 1970s, JS operated 71 factories in the United States. In 1994, its sales peaked at
     $7.6 billion worldwide, but then began to decline. In 2002, JS made the decision to close its
     last remaining factories and outsource manufacturing to foreign manufacturers, whose quality
     was more difficult to control. By 2017, annual sales were only $4.5 billion. Even sales of
     Strutz’s No.5 jeans declined, and JS faced intense competition, including foreign competition.

     JS briefly experimented with fast fashion, an industry practice developed in the United States
     in response to cheap, foreign imports. In fast fashion, new design concepts are quickly
     manufactured once they have been tested at fashion shows. Unfortunately, fast fashion
     worked against JS’s brand identity. Surveys indicated that JS’s brand has value and inspires
     loyalty, though focus groups of young consumers did not perceive JS as cool.

     JS has been a leader in corporate social responsibility (CSR). Since the 1890s, it has
     pursued profits through values. More recently, JS introduced Strutz’s chemical-free jeans.
     Because many of JS’s suppliers operate in areas with few pollution regulations, to remain
     consistent with its image of CSR, JS is insisting that suppliers follow innovative but expensive
     chemical-free processes.


     (a)   Define the term multinational company (MNC).                                                 [2]

     (b)   Explain the importance to JS of:

           (i)    brand value;                                                                          [2]

           (ii)   brand loyalty.                                                                        [2]

     (c)   (i)    Draw and label a product life cycle for Strutz’s No.5 jeans.                          [2]

           (ii)   Explain the position of Strutz’s No.5 jeans on the product life cycle.                [2]

     (d)   Discuss the role and impact of globalization on the growth and evolution of JS.             [10]

4.   Dana’s Handbags (DH)

     Dana’s Handbags (DH ) is a small manufacturer of women’s handbags. DH sells directly to
     large retail chains in Europe. The company is privately owned and has fifteen shareholders.

                                                                      2016     2017

     Beginning in 2017, DH adopted a programme of corporate social responsibility (CSR) by:
     • donating money to charities
     • encouraging employees to do three paid hours per week of community service during
       work hours
     • using only biodegradable materials in its handbags.
     This programme was expensive.

     DH’s management thought that a programme of corporate social responsibility (CSR) would
     strengthen DH’s brand. During the first year of the corporate social responsibility (CSR)
     programme, employee morale improved and DH received favourable media attention.

     However, at the annual general meeting in January 2018, financial results from 2017
     revealed that sales growth had not improved. Several influential shareholders complained
     about the high cost of the corporate social responsibility (CSR) programme. Other
     shareholders suggested that DH should develop consumer awareness that it is a socially
     responsible company.


     (a)   Identify two features of a private limited company.                                     [2]

     (b)   Calculate:

           (i)    the net profit margins for DH for 2016 and 2017;                                 [2]

           (ii)   net current assets (working capital) for DH for 2016 and 2017.                   [2]

     (c)   Explain one method of above-the-line promotion and one method of below-the-
           line promotion that DH could use to raise consumer awareness that it is a socially
           responsible company. [4]

     (d)   Discuss DH’s decision to develop a policy of corporate social responsibility (CSR).    [10]

5.   Benno

     Benno is a soft drinks manufacturer. Its mission statement is
     “to produce healthy drinks without damaging the environment”.

     Competition in the healthy soft drinks market is fierce.
     Benno uses a competitive pricing strategy. However, sales of
     Benno’s drinks have fallen significantly over the last five years,
     particularly in the 12–18 age group. The business has no
     accumulated retained profits.

     Benno is committed to innovation and corporate social responsibility (CSR). Its research
     and development division has recently invented a new biodegradable drink pack ring
     that starts to break down within two hours of contact with sea water. It dissolves fully in
     48 hours. Currently, 98 % of pack rings are made of plastic and when dumped in the sea are
     responsible for the death of many sea creatures.

     A focus group of loyal customers used regularly by Benno’s marketing department is
     wholeheartedly in favour of the new drink rings. However, the marketing director has read
     recent studies that suggest:
     • purchases of green products are not increasing, despite the positive attitude of many
        consumers towards sustainability and biodegradable products
     • consumers continue to prioritize price when purchasing soft drinks.
     To manufacture the new drink rings, machinery costing $5 million would be needed. Drink
     ring production unit costs would rise from 10 cents to 15 cents and prices of a six-pack of
     Benno soft drinks would have to increase by 5 %. Benno’s net profit margin on a six-pack
     is 10 %.

     Benno’s director of corporate social responsibility favours the change to the new drink rings
     but is opposed by both the finance director and marketing directors.
