          Daniel Rooke was quiet, moody, a man of few words. He had no memories other than of being
          an outsider.
                 At the dame school1 in Portsmouth they thought him stupid. His first day there was by
          coincidence his fifth birthday, the third of March 1767. He took his place behind the desk with his
      5   mother’s breakfast oatmeal cosy in his stomach and his new jacket on, happy to be joining the
          world beyond his home.
                 Mrs Bartholomew showed him a badly executed engraving with the word ‘cat’ underneath.
          His mother had taught him his letters and he had been reading for a year. He could not work out
          what Mrs Bartholomew wanted. He sat at his desk, mouth open.
     10          That was the first time he was paddled with Mrs Bartholomew’s old hairbrush for failing to
          respond to a question so simple he had not thought to answer it.
                 He could not become interested in the multiplication tables. While the others chanted
          through them, impatient for the morning break, he was looking under the desk at the notebook
          in which he was collecting his special numbers, the ones that could not be divided by any
     15   number but themselves and one. Like him, they were solitaries.
                 When Mrs Bartholomew pounced on him one day and seized the notebook, he was afraid
          she would throw it in the fire and smack him with the hairbrush again. She looked at it for a long
          time and put it away in her pinny2 pocket.
                 He wanted to ask for it back. Not for the numbers, they were in his head, but for the
     20   notebook, too precious to lose.
                 Then Dr Adair from the Academy came to the house in Church Street. Rooke could not
          guess who Dr Adair was, or what he was doing in their parlour3. He only knew that he had
          been washed and combed for a visitor, that his infant sisters had been sent next door to the
          neighbour woman, and that his mother and father were sitting on the uncomfortable chairs in the
     25   corner with rigid faces.
                 Dr Adair leaned forward. Did Master Rooke know of numbers that could be divided by
          nothing but themselves and one? Rooke forgot to be in awe. He ran up to his attic room and
          came back with the grid he had drawn, ten by ten, the first hundred numbers with these special
          ones done in red ink: two, three, five and on to ninety-seven. He pointed, there was a kind of
     30   pattern, do you see, here and here? But one hundred numbers was not enough, he needed a
          bigger sheet of paper so he could make a square twenty or even thirty a side, and then he could
          find the true pattern, and perhaps Dr Adair might be able to provide him with such a sheet?
                 His father by now had the rictus4 of a smile that meant his son was exposing his oddness
          to a stranger, and his mother was looking down into her lap. Rooke folded the grid and hid it
     35   under his hand on the table.
                 But Dr Adair lifted his fingers from the grubby paper.
                 ‘May I borrow this?’ he asked. ‘I would like, if I may, to show it to a gentleman of my
          acquaintance who will be interested that it was created by a boy of seven.’
                 After Dr Adair went, the neighbour woman brought his sisters back. She inspected Rooke
     40   and said loudly, as if he were deaf, or a dog, ‘Yes, he looks clever, don’t he?’
                 Rooke felt the hairs on his head standing up with the heat of his blush. Whether it was
          because he was stupid or clever, it added up to the same thing: the misery of being out of step
          with the world.

                                                The Survivors
                           I never told you this.
                           He told me about it often:
                           Seven days in an open boat – burned out,
                           No time to get food:
                       5   Biscuits and water and the unwanted sun,
                           With only the oars’ wing-beats for motion,
                           Labouring heavily towards land
                           That existed on a remembered chart,
                           Never on the horizon
                      10   Seven miles from the boat’s bow.

                           After two days song dried on their lips;
                           After four days speech.
                           On the fifth cracks began to appear
                           In the faces’ masks; salt scorched them.
                      15   They began to think about death,
                           Each man to himself, feeding it
                           On what the rest could not conceal.
                           The sea was as empty as the sky,
                           A vast disc under a dome
                      20   Of the same vastness, perilously blue.

                           But on the sixth day towards evening
                           A bird passed. No one slept that night;
                           The boat had become an ear
                           Straining for the desired thunder
                      25   Of the wrecked waves. It was dawn when it came,
                           Ominous as the big guns
                           Of enemy shores. The men cheered it.
                           From the swell’s rise one of them saw the ruins
                           Of all that sea, where a lean horseman
                      30   Rode towards them and with a rope
                           Galloped them up on to the curt sand.

                                                               R S Thomas, The Bread of Truth (1963)
