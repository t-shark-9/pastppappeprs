                                        Assessment criteria

These notes to examiners are intended only as guidelines to assist marking and as a supplement
to the published external assessment criteria for written paper 2. They are not offered as an
exhaustive and fixed set of responses or approaches to which all answers must rigidly adhere.
Good ideas or angles not offered here should be acknowledged and rewarded as appropriate.
Similarly, answers which do not include all the ideas or approaches suggested here should not be
so heavily penalized as to distort appreciation of individuality.

With reference to criterion C, the better answers will contain examples that show an adequate
sense of stylistic features with some awareness of their effects, using critical analysis and pertinent
detail.

The best answers will show a strong sense of the stylistic and comparable features of the works,
as well as the effects of these features.

Of course, some of the points listed below will appear in weaker papers, but are unlikely to
be developed.

These apply to all answers below.

A maximum of [5 marks] may be awarded for each of the five criteria.

Criteria A and B

The danger of rewarding or penalizing the use of illustration/references/quotations twice in both
these categories should be avoided.

Criterion B

“Personal response” and “independence of thought” appear as the levels of the descriptors
increase. What is sought is an engaged and individual treatment of the chosen topic. Engaged
and individual essays will usually make themselves clear by showing insight into the implications of
the question and the quality and interest of the details cited in support.

The first person singular does not automatically constitute a personal response and conversely an
impersonal academic style does not necessarily indicate a lack of personal response.

Criterion C

It is expected that every question set will provide candidates with ample opportunities to
demonstrate their awareness of the demands of this criterion. However, where a question does
not explicitly offer such opportunities, examiners should interpret criterion C broadly, to ensure that
candidates are not unfairly disadvantaged. In such cases it would be sufficient for candidates
to show, as appropriate to the question, an awareness of how elements such as plot, character,
setting, structure, voice, etc, are used by writers to meet their purposes. No matter how the
question is phrased, candidates must also address related matters of style and technique.

“Awareness” and “appreciation” of literary features are the key elements under this criterion.
The mere labelling, without appreciation, of literary features will not score the highest marks.
On the other hand, the candidate who is attentive to literary features and deals with them in a
meaningful way, but who does not consistently use the vocabulary of literary criticism, can still be
awarded the higher achievement levels.

Reminder: the term “literary features” is broad and includes elements as basic as plot, character
etc, attention to which is valid and must be rewarded as appropriate.

Criterion D

Any form of structuring to the essay will be rewarded if it is effective and appropriate.
Different conventions are in operation and therefore all approaches are acceptable and will be
judged on the basis of their effectiveness. Examiners should remember that structure does not
exist by itself, but any structure must be measured by appropriate reference to the terms of the
question and by its capacity to integrate these towards the development of an organized and
coherent essay.

Reminder: in this criterion, supporting examples must be evaluated in terms of how fluently they
are incorporated/integrated to shape/advance the argument, not in terms of their appropriateness
or accuracy.

Criterion E

If you have reservations about awarding a 4, you should ensure that these are well founded before
awarding a 3. The broadness of achievement in level three sometimes makes examiners reluctant
to award 4.

Judgment needs to be used when dealing with lapses in grammar, spelling and punctuation;
therefore, do not unduly penalize.

Mechanical accuracy is only part of this criterion. Ensure that all the other elements are
considered.

Examiners should be careful to avoid being prejudiced in their application of this criterion by
achievement levels in other criteria. It is possible to score highly on this criterion even if
candidates have scored in the lower levels on other criteria, and vice versa.

1.

        An adequate to good answer will select poems which represent a powerful response to
         chosen subjects and will examine how effectively the poets do this. The adequate to good
         answer will therefore explore the style of the selected poems. It will outline stylistic devices
         that register powerful responses. The adequate answer will identify these while the good
         answer will also explore their functionality. These are likely to take the form of striking
         images, metaphors or symbols but may also look at a verse form, rhyming structure or
         development of mood. These will be generally referenced.

        A very good to excellent answer may also demonstrate a highly specific awareness of how
         language and/or form may work to make the poems powerful utterances. This will be
         demonstrated by intelligent references to the work. There will be a strong sense of how
         style works in the poem and a more fluent sense of the effectiveness of the writing. The
         very good to excellent answer may establish interesting relationships between the poems
         and is likely to build an argument from the analysis.


2.

        An adequate to good answer will select poems which address the question and should
         focus on how rhetorical devices in the poems may persuade the reader to change their
         perception of things. The answer should be aware of how poems can do this by using
         language and style to that purpose. The adequate answer will be able to recognize how
         individual poems achieve this shift in the reader; the good answer will start to register an
         appreciation of more specific aspects of style and rhetoric pursuant to that end in the
         poetry.

        A very good to excellent answer may also see how style functions to persuade or oblige or
         insist on the change of perspective. There will be a sense for how this effect is worked and
         there will be close readings of the selected poems with analysis of stylistic devices
         employed to rhetorical purpose. The appreciation of the poem, not only as an emotional
         utterance but also perhaps as an argument, might characterize this response depending on
         the work chosen.


3.

        An adequate to good answer will select poems which register the complexity of human
         relations but the adequate answer may struggle to achieve a direct relationship between
         the complexity of the relationships and how the figurative language and form of the poem
         combine to register this for the reader. There will be an identification of and reference to
         some figurative language and a general appreciation of form with references to the parts of
         the poem. The good answer will note how figurative language and form combine to convey
         the complexity mentioned in the question. Complexity may be understood as ambiguity or
         more intriguing but less definable aspects of a relationship.

        A very good to excellent answer may also be able to explore how figurative language and
         form actively reflect these characteristics in the poetry. Reference to the poetry will be
         sharp and insightful. There may be a closer focus on tone and mood, on not only the
         figurative language used but on how it is employed and how the form of the poems
         complements it. There will be some comparative observations about the differences or
         similarities in treatment by different poets and will explore how the analysis of the poetry
         creates the building blocks for an insightful argument and conclusion.

4.

        An adequate to good answer will select poems which register pain and suffering and will
         review the content of the poems touching on striking imagery and perhaps going a little
         further to mention structure and form. Mood will obviously be a focus since this will
         distinguish poetry that has pain and suffering as its subject, as will tone, heard in the voice
         of the chosen poets. The adequate answer will identify these two elements but will not
         always see their connection with the alacrity of the good answer. The good answer will also
         make accurate reference to the poetry to bring out the subject of the question.

        A very good to excellent answer may also begin by exploring the concepts of pain and
         suffering, making careful distinctions in their choice of exemplars from the two poets under
         scrutiny. From the analysis of the poetry, it will provide a strong sense of how the nature of
         the pain and suffering is registered by the poetic voice. Tone may be distinguished as
         sincere or ironical, to give only two of many possible examples, and mood might be
         registered as dark and pessimistic. There will be careful and sensitive references to the
         poems and this will be illustrative of how poetic voice works to convey the experience of
         pain and suffering.


5.       This is a question about how mood functions in poetry. Mood may be taken to signify the
         emotional feeling or atmosphere a poem produces in the reader or listener. The question
         will involve a careful analysis of how the use of language in the poetry creates mood or
         moods, since in a poem of any length the mood will change or develop.

        An adequate to good answer will be able to select poems that convey a mood or moods to
         the reader. The test of the quality in the response will lie in how sharply and adeptly the
         candidate will be able to show the relationship between the ways that language is used in
         the creation of the mood or moods. How the mood is built and how it works in a purposeful
         way to convey some of the emotional quality of the poem is crucial for all students to
         recognise. Literary features that are important may be: figurative language or the rhyming
         structure(s) of the poem. Adequate to good responses should be able to notice these.
         Adequate to good candidates may also identify tone as an important factor in the
         establishing of the mood(s) of the poem.

        A very good to excellent answer may also note its pattern of stressed and unstressed beats
         (rhythm). It may also notice how the mood evolves or how different moods may clash or
         complement one another. The relationship between the tone of the poetic voice and how
         this contributes to the mood(s) of the poem might be analyzed by the very good to excellent
         answer. The purposeful intention informing the mood(s) of the poem can stimulate
         discussion within the response and very good to excellent answers will produce arguments
         in response to the question.

6.

        An adequate to good answer will be able to select apposite poems to the question and will
         explore the content of these poems to outline their spiritual nature. This should involve an
         appreciation of how the subject of spirituality is treated in the poems and will allow the
         candidate to demonstrate knowledge and understanding in the response with supporting
         references from the poetry. It will include some analysis of the nature of the spirituality as
         conveyed through the use of language and other stylistic effects though, in the case of the
         adequate answer, this may lack specificity.

        A very good to excellent answer may also explore the nature of the spiritual in the poetry. It
         will demonstrate how the two poets apprehend spirituality through the way they have
         chosen to write their poems and an active comparison of their approaches to the subject is
         likely to be built. The poems will be analyzed through the filter of spirituality and specific
         reference will be made to instances which reflect how the poems deal with spirituality. The
         response will tend to explore style rather than be drawn into a summary of content.
