General comment to examiners
Please note that the markscheme is provided as guidance for marking. There are many potential and
valid ways in which to approach the questions and examiners need, therefore, to use their judgment
when attributing marks to a candidate's answers.

Each question is worth [20 marks].

                                              Section A
This criterion concerns the candidate’s ability to:
• question 1 or question 2 – analyse and examine essential musical elements (including form and
  structure) within 1 of the 2 prescribed works
• question 3 (HL only) – compare and contrast the two prescribed works, emphasizing the presence of
   any significant musical links.

 Marks     Level descriptor
    0      The work does not reach a standard described by the descriptors below.
           The answers, which generally do not address the question, show a minimal level of
           musical understanding. There is limited use of musical evidence, though this is poorly
           located, or none at all. There is limited use of musical terminology or none at all.
           The answers, which generally do not address the question, […]
           There is little understanding of the demands of the question. The response consists mostly
           of generalizations or poorly substantiated assertions.
           […] show a minimal level of musical understanding.
           The response relays irrelevant knowledge, or inaccurately applies remembered content.
   1–4     There is limited use of musical evidence, though this is poorly located, or none at all.
           Musical evidence is never or rarely used. When evidence is given, it is inaccurate, superficial
           and imprecise with regards to bar/measure number(s), rehearsal number(s) and/or
           instrument(s).
           There is limited use of musical terminology or none at all.
           The responses communicate without the use of musical terminology, or where musical
           terminology is applied, it is generally not relevant and/or inaccurate. However, a rudimentary
           understanding of terminology in relation to the material/topic in question may surface on
           occasion.

       The answers, which may not always address the question, show some level of musical
       understanding. There is some use of musical evidence, though this is not located
       precisely enough. There is some use of musical terminology.
       The answers, which may not always address the question, […]
       The response indicates an understanding of the question, but only partially addresses it.
       The response is narrative and/or descriptive in nature.
       The answers show some level of musical understanding.
       The response contains some prior knowledge, but demonstrates merely recall of
5–8    information, rather than application of prior knowledge and engagement with the question
       through reasoned discussion and evaluation.
       There is some use of musical evidence, though this is not located precisely enough.
       Musical evidence is presented on occasion, but used without explanation or not relevant to
       the question under discussion. Where musical evidence is given, it is imprecise with
       regards to bar/measure number(s), rehearsal number(s) and/or instrument(s).
       There is some use of musical terminology.
       Musical terminology is applied and on occasion is relevant and appropriate with regards to
       the material under discussion, while there is also some inaccurate use of terminology
       and/or vague statements.
       The answers, which generally address the question, show an adequate level of musical
       understanding. There is use of musical evidence, though this is not always precisely located.
       There is partially effective use of musical terminology.
       The answers, which generally address the question, […]
       The response indicates an understanding of the demands of the question. The response
       contains some critical discussion, analysis, evaluation, examination, etc. However, answers
       lack clarity and development.
       […] show an adequate level of musical understanding.
       The response appropriately applies and sometimes explains prior knowledge in relation to
9–12   the question and the material under discussion.
       There is use of musical evidence, though this is not always precisely located.
       Throughout the answer musical evidence is used, which is sometimes, but not consistently,
       accurate, relevant and explained in relation to the question. Evidence is sometimes, but not
       consistently, located by using bar/measure number(s), rehearsal number(s) and/or
       instrument(s).
       There is partially effective use of musical terminology.
       The use of musical terminology is mostly relevant and accurate, but does not consistently
       support the discussion, analysis, evaluation, examination, etc. Critical terminology is
       appropriately used, although some may be ignored or unaccounted for.

        The answers, which generally address the question, may not always be convincing but show
        a good level of musical understanding. There is appropriate use of musical evidence, mostly
        precisely located. There is mostly effective use of musical terminology.
        The answers, which generally address the question, may not always be
        convincing […]
        The demands of the question are understood and addressed. The response contains some
        critical discussion, analysis, evaluation, examination, etc. Most of the main arguments are
        substantiated and lead towards suitable conclusions in the context of the question.

        The response explains prior knowledge which is appropriate and relevant in relation to the
        question and material under discussion.
        There is appropriate use of musical evidence, mostly precisely located.
        The musical evidence used is relevant and accurate and supports the context of the
        response. Musical evidence is usually located accurately by using bar/measure number(s),
        rehearsal number(s) and/or instrument(s).
        There is mostly effective use of musical terminology.
        A variety of musical terminology is used, which is usually relevant and accurate and supports
        the discussion, analysis, evaluation, examination, etc.
        The answers, which consistently address the question, are convincing and show a very good
        level of musical understanding, supported by a most appropriate use of musical evidence,
        precisely located. There is highly effective use of musical terminology.
        The answers, which consistently address the question, are convincing […]
        Responses are clearly focused and show a high degree of awareness of the demands of the
        question. Responses contain well developed critical discussion, analysis, evaluation,
        examination, etc. The main points are well substantiated, and the response argues towards
        a reasoned conclusion.

        Musical evidence is relevant, accurate and the best choice for the context of the response.
        Musical evidence is consistently located accurately by using bar/measure number(s),
        rehearsal number(s) and/or instrument(s). Where on occasion this is not the case, the
        quality and accuracy of the response are not compromized.

        The use of musical terminology is skillful, accurate, sophisticated, wide ranging, and highly
        effective in supporting the discussion, analysis, evaluation, examination, etc of the question
        and the material under investigation. Where on occasion this is not the case, the quality and
        accuracy of the response are not compromized.

     Question 1 or question 2 (SL and HL)
     The answers should refer to the appropriate prescribed work.

     Answers should address the question and be consistent and convincing in their display of musical
     understanding. Evidence should be located by using bar(s)/measure(s), rehearsal number(s),
     and/or instrument(s) in the works/extracts. Musical terminology should be effective in its use.

     Question 3 (HL only)
     The answers should refer to both prescribed works. The comparing and contrasting of significant
     musical links must focus on thematic development.

     Answers should be consistent and convincing in their display of musical understanding, and should
     be backed up by clearly located evidence.         Musical terminology should be effective in
     its use.

A     Musical elements
This criterion concerns the candidate’s ability to perceive the musical elements, such as, but not limited
to, duration, pitch, tonality, timbre/tone colour, texture and dynamics, and their significance. Articulation
and other expressive and production techniques might also be discussed.

Note: Structure is assessed in a separate criterion.

  Marks     Level descriptor
     0      The work does not reach a standard described by the descriptors below.
            The work displays insufficient and weak aural perception. The candidate has
            identified musical elements poorly, including very few, if any of the significant ones.
            There is little understanding of the musical material under investigation: the response makes
    1       irrelevant points or inaccurately labels and locates musical elements. Of the key elements
            very few, or none, are not recognized.
            The response rarely (or never) refers to the musical excerpt.


            The work sometimes displays adequate aural perception. The candidate has identified

     Bar 3   First theme (first subject) in violin I, supported by other strings, p, which then modulates
             into the relative (b) minor. In bar/measure 11 this material is then repeated a tone lower
             (C major).

     Bar 19 New section of first theme back in D major in the flutes, imitated through the woodwind
            instruments, accompanied by strings with a sparse texture, repeated in b minor, and
            E major (different orchestration each time), with bridge passage.

     Short Ride in a Fast Machine by J Adams (Identified piece)
     (no score provided)

     Musical elements
     The track consists of a number of passages with thick, chordal textures, set against the consistent
     tapping of a wood block and other instruments playing various subdivisions, which overlap and
     create shifts of patterns against the beat, giving rise to irregular and fast-changing rhythms.

     Musical structure
     There are many possible interpretations of the structure of this excerpt. Here is one of them.
     However, candidates are not expected to give such detail.

     0:00    The wood block starts alone, playing fast crotchet beats, quickly joined by ostinato on the
             clarinets and then four trumpets playing a major triad with added 6th on the strong beat.
             Introduction of other instruments – woodwind, lower brass.

     0:14    New chord (one tone lower) intermeshed with the opening chord, followed by flute and
             piccolo flourishes and addition of snare drum.

     0:34    Rhythm briefly becomes more regular before developing into polyrhythms.

     0:39    The flute and piccolo flourish is extended.

     1:02    New section, with new major chord, bass drum and strings, with a gradual addition of
             instruments, notes and increasingly complex harmonic material building to a climax –
             French horns have hunting calls/rips.

     1:40    New section, lower pitched wood block with tambourine, and the bass section seemingly
             in a different time signature, with trumpet stab chords slowly increasing in frequency.
             Chords with added notes, and a building of dissonant texture.

     2:31    New bass theme repeated in lower instruments of the orchestra.

     Musical terminology
     Some of the words that could be relevant to criterion C include (but are not limited to):
     rhythmic ostinato, cross rhythms, regular pulse, metric displacement, motivic, homophonic chords,
     layering, polyrhythm, polymeters, dissonance.

     Musical context
