    supported by suitable working. For example, if graphs are used to find a solution, you should sketch
    these as part of your answer. Where an answer is incorrect, some marks may be given for a correct
    method, provided this is shown by written working. You are therefore advised to show all working.

           The points A and B      lie on a circle, with centre O and radius 19.5cm, such that BOA = 210°.

           A piece of paper is cut into the shape of the sector BOA.

           A hollow cone with no base is constructed from the sector by joining the points A and B.
           The sector forms the curved surface of the cone.

           This is shown in the following diagrams.

In a study, measurements for arm span, Acm,     and foot length, F'cm, are taken from a   large
group of adults.

For this group, the regression line of F on A is found to be F = 0.3354 — 32.6, and
the regression line of A on F is found to be A = 2.89F+ 99.3. Each regression line passes
through the mean point.

(a)   By using an appropriate regression line, find an estimate of the arm span for an adult
      with a foot length of 19.8cm.                                                                [2]

          In a marathon race, the random variable 7 represents the time, in hours, taken for a runner
          to complete the race. No runner completes the race in less than 2.25 hours, and no runner
          completes it in more than 7.5 hours.
