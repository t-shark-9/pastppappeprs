The following are the annotations available to use when marking responses.

                                                      These are annotations which can be used to show which marking point was
                                                      used to award a mark. It is easier to use these than to pick up the tick stamp
                                                      and then the text box (they each automatically award 1 mark when stamped)

                                                      Quality marks awarded for clarity and structure (these each automatically

General Marking Instructions


     Assistant Examiners (AEs) will be contacted by their team leader (TL) through RM™ Assessor, by e-mail or telephone – if through RM™ Assessor
     or by e-mail, please reply to confirm that you have downloaded the markscheme from IBIS. The purpose of this initial contact is to allow AEs to
     raise any queries they have regarding the markscheme and its interpretation. AEs should contact their team leader through RM™ Assessor or by
     e-mail at any time if they have any problems/queries regarding marking. For any queries regarding the use of RM™ Assessor, please contact
     emarking@ibo.org.


1.     Follow the markscheme provided, award only whole marks and mark only in RED.

2.     Make sure that the question you are about to mark is highlighted in the mark panel on the right-hand side of the screen.

3.     Where a mark is awarded, a tick/check (✔) must be placed in the text at the precise point where it becomes clear that the candidate deserves
       the mark. One tick to be shown for each mark awarded. Please use lettered ticks (e.g. a) where appropriate to indicate which marking point is
       awarded.

4.     Sometimes, careful consideration is required to decide whether or not to award a mark. In these cases, use RM™ Assessor annotations to support
       your decision. You are encouraged to write comments where it helps clarity, especially for re-marking purposes. Use a text box for these additional
       comments. It should be remembered that the script may be returned to the candidate.

5.     Personal codes/notations are unacceptable.

6.     Where an answer to a part question is worth no marks but the candidate has attempted the part question, use the “ZERO” annotation to
       award zero marks. Where a candidate has not attempted the part question, use the “SEEN” annotation to show you have looked at the question.
       RM™ Assessor will apply “NR” once you click complete.

7.     If a candidate has attempted more than the required number of questions within a paper or section of a paper, mark all the answers. RM™ Assessor
       will only award the highest mark or marks in line with the rubric.

8.     Ensure that you have viewed every page including any additional sheets. Please ensure that you stamp “SEEN” on any additional pages that are
       blank or where the candidate has crossed out his/her work.

9.     Mark positively. Give candidates credit for what they have achieved and for what they have got correct, rather than penalizing them for what they
       have got wrong. However, a mark should not be awarded where there is contradiction within an answer. Make a comment to this effect using a
       text box or the “CON” stamp.

Subject Details: Biology HL Paper 2 Markscheme

Candidates are required to answer all questions in Section A and two out of three questions in Section B. Maximum total = 80 marks.

1.    A markscheme often has more marking points than the total allows. This is intentional.

2.    Each marking point has a separate line and the end is shown by means of a semicolon (;).

3.    An alternative answer or wording is indicated in the markscheme by a slash (/). Either wording can be accepted.

4.    An alternative answer is indicated by “OR”. Either answer can be accepted.

5.    An alternative markscheme is indicated under heading ALTERNATIVE 1 etc. Either alternative can be accepted.

6.    Words in brackets ( ) in the markscheme are not necessary to gain the mark.

7.    Words that are underlined are essential for the mark.

8.    The order of marking points does not have to be as in the markscheme, unless stated otherwise.

9.    If the candidate’s answer has the same “meaning” or can be clearly interpreted as being of equivalent significance, detail and validity as that in
      the markscheme then award the mark. Where this point is considered to be particularly relevant in a question it is emphasized by OWTTE
      (or words to that effect).

10.   Remember that many candidates are writing in a second language. Effective communication is more important than grammatical accuracy.

11.   Occasionally, a part of a question may require an answer that is required for subsequent marking points. If an error is made in the first marking point then
      it should be penalized. However, if the incorrect answer is used correctly in subsequent marking points then follow through marks should be awarded.
      When marking indicate this by adding ECF (error carried forward) on the script.

12.   Do not penalize candidates for errors in units or significant figures, unless it is specifically referred to in the markscheme.

Section B
Extended response questions – quality mark

  • Extended response questions for HLP2 each carry a mark total of [16]. Of these marks, [15] are awarded for content and [1] for the quality of
    the answer.

  • [1] for quality is to be awarded when:

     • the candidate’s answers are clear enough to be understood without re-reading.
     • the candidate has answered the question succinctly with little or no repetition or irrelevant material.

  • It is important to judge this on the overall answer, taking into account the answers to all parts of the question. Although, the part with the largest
    number of marks is likely to provide the most evidence.

  • Candidates that score very highly on the content marks need not necessarily automatically gain [1] for quality (and vice versa).
