Subject Details: Biology HL Paper 1B Markscheme

Candidates are required to answer all questions in Paper 1B. Maximum total = 35 marks.

1.    A markscheme often has more marking points than the total allows. This is intentional.

2.    Each marking point has a separate line and the end is shown by means of a semicolon (;).

3.    An alternative answer or wording is indicated in the markscheme by a slash (/). Either wording can be accepted.

4.    An alternative answer is indicated by “OR”. Either answer can be accepted.

5.    An alternative markscheme is indicated under heading ALTERNATIVE 1 etc. Either alternative can be accepted.

6.    Words in brackets ( ) in the markscheme are not necessary to gain the mark.

7.    Words that are underlined are essential for the mark.

8.    The order of marking points does not have to be as in the markscheme, unless stated otherwise.

9.    If the candidate’s answer has the same “meaning” or can be clearly interpreted as being of equivalent significance, detail and validity as that in
      the markscheme then award the mark. Where this point is considered to be particularly relevant in a question it is emphasized by OWTTE
      (or words to that effect).

10.   Remember that many candidates are writing in a second language. Effective communication is more important than grammatical accuracy.

11.   Occasionally, a part of a question may require an answer that is required for subsequent marking points. If an error is made in the first marking point then
      it should be penalized. However, if the incorrect answer is used correctly in subsequent marking points then follow through marks should be awarded.
      When marking indicate this by adding ECF (error carried forward) on the script.

12.   Do not penalize candidates for errors in units or significant figures, unless it is specifically referred to in the markscheme.
