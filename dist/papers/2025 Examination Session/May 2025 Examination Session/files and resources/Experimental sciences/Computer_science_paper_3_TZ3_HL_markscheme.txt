Subject details:              Computer science HL paper 3 markscheme

Mark allocation

Candidates are required to answer all questions. Total 30 marks.


General

A markscheme often has more specific points worthy of a mark than the total allows. This is intentional. Do
not award more than the maximum marks allowed for that part of a question.

When deciding upon alternative answers by candidates to those given in the markscheme, consider the
following points:

• Each statement worth one point has a separate line and the end is signified by means of
  a semi-colon (;).

• An alternative answer or wording is indicated in the markscheme by a “/”; either wording can be
  accepted.

• Words in ( … ) in the markscheme are not necessary to gain the mark.

• If the candidate’s answer has the same meaning or can be clearly interpreted as being the same as that
  in the markscheme then award the mark.

• Mark positively. Give candidates credit for what they have achieved and for what they have got correct,
  rather than penalizing them for what they have not achieved or what they have
  got wrong.

• Remember that many candidates are writing in a second language; be forgiving of minor linguistic slips.
  In this subject effective communication is more important than grammatical accuracy.

• Occasionally, a part of a question may require a calculation whose answer is required for subsequent
  parts. If an error is made in the first part then it should be penalized. However, if the incorrect answer is
  used correctly in subsequent parts then follow through marks should be awarded. Indicate this with
  “FT”.

• Question 4 is marked against markbands. The markbands represent a single holistic criterion applied to
  the piece of work. Each markband level descriptor corresponds to a number of marks. When assessing
  with markbands, a “best fit” approach is used, with markers making a judgment about which particular
  mark to award from the possible range for each level descriptor, according to how well the candidate’s
  work fits that descriptor.

General guidance

 Issue             Guidance
 Answering         • In the case of an “identify” question read all answers and mark positively up to the
 more than           maximum marks. Disregard incorrect answers.
 the quantity      • In the case of a “describe” question, which asks for a certain number of facts
 of responses        eg “describe two kinds”, mark the first two correct answers. This could include two
 prescribed in       descriptions, one description and one identification, or two identifications.
 the questions     • In the case of an “explain” question, which asks for a specified number of
                     explanations eg “explain two reasons …”, mark the first two correct answers.
                     This could include two full explanations, one explanation, one partial explanation
                     etc.

2.   (a)   Award [4] max
           Accept any [4] from the following:
           Award [1] for assigning scores, [1] for vectors, [1] for normalisation, [1] for weighted sum, [1]

     (b)   Award [4] max
           Award [1] for identifying reason, and [1] for elaboration
           LLMs have more (trainable) parameters/more complex model;
           Larger datasets are required but with insufficient data or poor regularisation;

           Scale and architecture amplify sensitivity/pre-trained on large, diverse, and noisy datasets;
           Then fine-tuned on smaller, task-specific datasets/increases the risk of narrow or biased
           content;

           LLMs have increased task versatility/required to handle a range of NLP tasks;
           This increases susceptibility to learning task-specific noise in the data;

           LLMs require greater computational resources than RNNs;
           Limited resources may constrain tuning (e.g., regularisation, early stopping)

           Unlike RNNs, LLMs do not inherently model the sequence of the data;
           This may reduce their ability to generalise across time-dependent patterns;

           LLMs lack the inductive bias of RNNs (naturally focus on recent or local input patterns);
           Without this bias, LLMs are more likely to model irrelevant or global noise;

           Mark as [2] + [2].

3.   Award [6] max
     Award [2] max for advantages, [2] max for disadvantages, and [2] for a reasoned opinion/conclusion

     Advantages
     Internet provides a vast and varied dataset, spanning many topics, styles, and linguistic patterns;
     This diversity helps train LLMs to understand different cultures, languages, and contexts/with
     sufficient qualities to enable pre-processing to filter out unnecessary data;

     Much of the internet is publicly accessible and unregulated, making it a low-cost source of data;
     Models benefit from the breadth of content without needing expensive licensing agreements;

     Up-to-date information: Internet content is constantly updated, allowing models to learn from recent
     trends, social changes, or emerging terminology;
     This can improve chatbot relevance in rapidly evolving fields like law, insurance, or healthcare.

     Disadvantages
     The Internet is not a curated source/contains unreliable information;
     The model can inadvertently learn from this misinformation and spread it;
     Leading to negative consequences (e.g. customers receiving unreliable advice/ lawsuits/decline in
     customer satisfaction);

     Internet data may contain cultural bias, harmful stereotypes, or offensive content;
     Using such data without careful filtering can reinforce prejudice in model outputs.

     Many internet users do not give permission for their content to be used in model training;
     This can lead to public backlash, legal consequences, and reputational damage for companies
     deploying LLMs;

     The internet contains vast amounts of irrelevant or off-topic material;
     Extensive pre-processing is required to extract domain-specific content, increasing time and
     computational cost.

     Conclusion
     Award [1] for weighing the benefits against the risks and [1] for suggesting a logical strategy

     Example opinions worth [2] marks
     Internet data may never be fully reliable or neutral, but its scale makes it indispensable. The key
     challenge isn't whether to use it, but how carefully it’s selected and refined. For applications like
     chatbots in regulated domains, strategic filtering and validation must be built into the model pipeline
     from the start.

     For an insurance chatbot, trust and accuracy matter more than scale. While internet data can help
     build a broad language foundation, relying on it without control risks reputational damage. A better
     long-term strategy is to pair that foundation with curated claims data and expert-reviewed language to
     align the model with industry standards and customer expectations.

     Note: For both advantages and disadvantages, award [2] for one point with expansion or two separate
     points.

4.   Award [12] max
     Some of the following points may be discussed:

     Increasing computational processing power
     Hardware and Infrastructure:
     • Upgrade hardware: use TPUs, GPUs, or more powerful CPUs.
     • Use hardware acceleration (e.g., matrix multiplication optimisations).
     • Deploy high-performance cloud infrastructure.

     Parallelisation and Scalability:
     • Implement parallel processing frameworks (e.g., batch processing or transformers' attention
        mechanisms).
     • Use distributed computing or clustered servers for inference and training.
     • Enable auto-scaling infrastructure to handle peak loads.

     Software/Architectural Optimisations:
     • Optimise APIs and backend code to reduce latency.
     • Use microservices architecture to isolate and scale critical components (e.g., the NLP engine).
     • Thread pooling or asynchronous processing to handle multiple conversations.

     Response Time Improvements:
     • Cache frequent responses (e.g., FAQs).
     • Use load balancing to distribute incoming queries.
     • Employ request prioritisation or throttling under heavy load.

     Model-level optimisation and compression:
     • Model distillation: Use smaller student models trained to mimic larger models for faster response
       times.
     • Quantisation: Reduce model precision (e.g., float32 → int8) to reduce memory use and speed up
       inference.
     • Early exiting and pruning: Skip unnecessary layers or connections during inference to improve
       efficiency.

     Improving dataset
     Data Collection and Curation:
     • Use a domain-specific dataset (insurance-specific documents, FAQs, claim data).
     • Include diverse linguistic patterns (from real customer queries).
     • Balance data to represent all demographics.

     Bias and Ethics Management:
     • Remove culturally or demographically biased data.
     • Conduct expert and ethical review of dataset inclusions.
     • Monitor for fairness in prediction across user types.

     Labelling and Structure:
     • Improve annotation quality through clearer guidelines and trained annotators.
     • Automatically label responses when appropriate, but review manually.

     Pre-processing and Engineering:
     • Clean noisy data (misspellings, irrelevant tokens).
     • Use feature engineering to add useful context (e.g., intent classification).
     • Augment data using paraphrasing, back-translation, or synthetic dialogue generation.
                                             –9–                                        2225 – 6421M


•    Discussion of trade-offs between real and synthetic datasets is creditworthy, especially where it
     links to bias, authenticity, or model performance.

Validation and Testing:
• Perform stratified validation splits (training, testing, validation).
• Cross-validate to identify overfitting.
• Collect real-world user feedback for continuous improvement.
• Define performance metrics such as accuracy, latency, F1 score, or customer satisfaction ratings.
• Human-in-the-loop testing for manual review of chatbot outputs.
• Deploy A/B testing to measure improvement over previous models in real scenarios.

Conclusion
A final measured conclusion is included in which the candidate links together the various points in
evaluating convergence.
