Questions 36–40 relate to the following case study. Please read the case study carefully and answer
the questions.

A living wall is a vertical wall of live plants. LiveWall® brings nature into urban spaces improving
aesthetics and the physical and mental wellbeing of users, see Figure 13.

A LiveWall® also reduces heating and ventilation costs by releasing moisture that cools the air during
summer and restores moisture to heated spaces in the winter.

LiveWall® manufacture the planter boxes which are mass produced from acrylonitrile butadiene styrene
(ABS) plastic and hang on aluminium extruded support rails.

The plants in the LiveWall® need regular irrigation and maintenance to avoid neglected plants becoming
overwhelmed by weeds or perishing from a lack of nutrition which would be unappealing.
