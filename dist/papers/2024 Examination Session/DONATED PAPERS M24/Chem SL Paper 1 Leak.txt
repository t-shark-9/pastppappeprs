Solution: A



The general form of a double replacement reaction is:

AB + CD → AD + CB

For the reaction given:

Na₂SO₄ + 2AgNO₃ → ?

Na₂SO₄ consists of Na⁺ (sodium ions) and SO₄²⁻ (sulfate ions).

AgNO₃ consists of Ag⁺ (silver ions) and NO₃⁻ (nitrate ions).

When these reactants undergo a double replacement reaction, the sodium ions will pair with

the nitrate ions, and the silver ions will pair with the sulfate ions.

2Na⁺ + SO₄²⁻ + 2Ag⁺ + 2NO₃⁻ → 2Na⁺ + 2NO₃⁻ + Ag₂SO₄ → Ag₂SO₄ + 2NaNO₃

Solution A:

     A. Shows molecules in a close arrangement, but not as rigid as in a solid. There is

        some disorder, which suggests some fluidity.

     B. Shows molecules with a significant amount of space between them, looks more

        like a gas than a liquid.

     C. Also shows a more spacious arrangement than expected for a liquid, with

        molecules not as tightly packed as one would anticipate for a liquid state.

     D. Shows molecules that are both closely packed and with a level of order, which is too

        structured and suggests a solid rather than a liquid state.

Solution: C

(1) SiCl₄ + (4) H₂O → (1) Si(OH)₄ + (4) HCl

Solution: A

I. This is true. Electronegativity tends to increase from left to right across a period due to

the increasing nuclear charge which attracts the bonding pair of electrons more strongly.

II. This is also true. As you move down a group, each element has an additional energy

level, making the atom larger.

III. This statement is false. Electron affinity generally increases across a period, because

as atoms gain more protons, they hold onto added electrons more tightly, thus generally

releasing more energy when an electron is added.

Solution: C

The electron configuration for Be is 1s² 2s², with no electrons in the 2p orbitals since the 2s

orbital fills up before the 2p orbitals begin to fill.



6.




Solution: A

Francium (Fr) is a member of the alkali metals group, which are known for having one

electron in their outermost energy level. This is also known as the valence shell. The electron

configuration of an alkali metal is such that this single valence electron is in an s orbital.
7.




Solution: B

relative atomic mass: (mass1 x abundance) + (mass2 x abundance)

= (54*0.05)+(56*0.95) = 55.9

*Since you don’t have a calculator solve like this:

=(54*1/20)+(56*19/20)=54/20 + 1064/20 = 1118/20 ≈ 1120/20 =112/2 = 56 ≈ 55.9

Solution: C

Covalent bonding occurs between nonmetals where they share electron pairs. We'll assess

each compound to see if it involves covalent bonding:

I. NH₃ (ammonia) is composed of nitrogen (N) and hydrogen (H), both of which are

nonmetals. Nitrogen and hydrogen atoms form covalent bonds to share electrons,

making ammonia a molecule with covalent bonding.

II. CaCO₃ (calcium carbonate) contains calcium (Ca), a metal, and a carbonate group (CO₃)

which is a polyatomic ion. In CaCO₃, the bond between calcium and carbonate is ionic;

however, within the carbonate ion (CO₃²⁻), the carbon (C) and oxygen (O) atoms are

covalently bonded to each other.

III. CH₄ (methane) is composed of carbon (C) and hydrogen (H), both of which are

nonmetals. The carbon and hydrogen atoms are bonded covalently.

*So, while CaCO₃ does contain covalent bonds within the carbonate ion, the compound itself

is typically considered an ionic compound due to the Ca²⁺ and CO₃²⁻ ions forming ionic

bonds. The question seems to be looking for molecules that are entirely covalently bonded.

Solution: C

Diamond, graphite, and graphene are all allotropes of carbon, meaning they are different

structural forms of the same element.

A. This is true for graphite and graphene, which have a planar hexagonal lattice structure

with bond angles of 120°, but not for diamond, which has a tetrahedral structure.

B. This is true for diamond, which has a tetrahedral structure with bond angles of

approximately 109.5°, but not for graphite or graphene.

C. All three carbon allotropes have atoms that are covalently bonded, making the

structure of each allotrope very strong.

D. None of these carbon allotropes contain hydrogen; therefore, they do not have

hydrogen bonds.

Solution: B

The bent molecular shape is made when there are three electron domains (two bonding pairs

and one lone pair or two lone pairs) around the central atom in a molecule, based on the

VSEPR theory.

A. NH4+ (Ammonium ion) has a tetrahedral shape with four bonding pairs and no lone

pairs on the nitrogen atom.

B. SO2 (Sulfur dioxide) has a bent shape due to two bonding pairs and one lone pair of

electrons on the sulfur atom.

C. CO2 (Carbon dioxide) has a linear shape with two double bonds and no lone pairs on

the carbon atom.

D. NH3 (Ammonia) has a trigonal pyramidal shape with three bonding pairs and one lone

pair on the nitrogen atom, but the electron domain geometry is tetrahedral, not bent.
