Examiners should be aware that in some cases, candidates may take a different approach, which if
appropriate should be rewarded. If in doubt, check with your team leader.

In the case of an “identify” question read all answers and mark positively up to the maximum marks.
Disregard incorrect answers. In all other cases where a question asks for a certain number of facts
eg “describe two kinds”, mark the first two correct answers. This could include two descriptions,
one description and one identification, or two identifications.

It should be recognized that, given time constraints, answers for part (c) questions are likely to include a
much narrower range of issues and concepts than identified in the markband. There is no “correct”
answer. Examiners must be prepared to award full marks to answers which synthesize and evaluate
even if they do not examine all the stimulus material.

     Note to examiners.
     • All part (a) questions are marked using ticks and annotations where appropriate
     • Part (b) and part (c) are marked using markbands. Use annotations and text
       comments to provide a rationale behind the marks you awarded. Do not use ticks.

     (a)   (i)     Identify two functions of an operating system.                                 [2]

                   Answers may include:
                   • provide user interface/GUI
                   • allows users to run programs
                   • manages memory
                   • controlling hard drive
                   • controlling process of time
                   • managing peripherals
                   • launching applications
                   • file management
                   • control system resources
                   • providing utilities.

                   Award [1] mark for identifying each function of an operating system up to a
                   maximum of [2] marks.

           (ii)    Identify two characteristics of random access memory (RAM).                    [2]

                   Answers may include:
                   • RAM stores data that is currently being used
                   • RAM stores information from the software programs that are currently
                     running
                   • RAM is volatile – will be erased when the computer is turned off
                   • accessing data in RAM is much faster than accessing it from the hard
                     disk
                   • when an application is run/executed the data is placed into RAM.

                   Award [1] mark for identifying each characteristic of random access
                   memory up to a maximum of [2] marks.

           (iii)   Identify two devices that could be used to store a backup of the files that
                   employees have saved on their laptops.                                         [2]

                   Answers may include:
                   • USB drive/flash drive/thumb drive
                   • external hard drive
                   • cloud
                   • DVD.

                   Award [1] mark for identifying a device that could be used to store the
                   backup to a maximum of [2] marks.

(b)       Analyse the advantages and disadvantages of using cloud-based storage for an RZX
          employee’s work files.                                                                     [6]

          Answers may include:

          Advantages:
          • files stored in the cloud can be accessed from anywhere with internet access
          • if more storage space is needed then RZX can arrange with the cloud storage
            provider to make this possible almost immediately
          • security measures are provided by the cloud service (backups, firewalls,
            access, etc) which may reduce the burden on RZX’s IT department
          • it may be cost effective for RZX to purchase cloud storage rather than
            purchasing extra storage
          • the IT department will spend less time managing staff files.

          Disadvantages:
          • files cannot be accessed if there is no internet access
          • if internet access is unavailable staff files cannot be saved in the cloud.
             Employees may save files to their laptop. This can lead to problems as files
             could be deleted/lost or even accessed by an unauthorized user
          • employees may find if there are issues relating to the storage of their data
             getting them resolved may be more time consuming than simply walking to an
             employee in the same office
          • security of staff files depends on the security measures provided by the cloud
             service. RZX needs to be assured that the cloud security is adequate.

      0          No knowledge or understanding of ITGS issues and concepts. No use of
                 appropriate ITGS terminology.
                 A limited response that indicates very little understanding of the topic or the
 1–2
                 reason is not clear. Uses little or no appropriate ITGS terminology.
                 No reference is made to the scenario in the stimulus material. The response is
                 theoretical.
                 A description, unbalanced or partial analysis of the issues related to the use of
 3–4
                 cloud-based storage for an employee’s work files. There is some use of
                 appropriate ITGS terminology in the response.

                 A balanced and detailed analysis of the relative advantages and disadvantages
 5–6
                 of cloud-based storage for an employee’s work files. Explicit and relevant
                 references are made to the scenario in the stimulus material. There is
                 appropriate ITGS terminology throughout the response.

(c)   The disposal of old IT equipment is becoming a problem. RZX is considering two options:
      • donating the equipment to a charitable organization
      • sending the equipment to a recycling service.

      Evaluate the implications of these two options.                                           [8]

      Answers may include:

      Donating the equipment:
      • may be seen as an altruistic gesture and good PR for the company
      • is a relatively simple process and ensures that existing equipment can extend
        its working life
      • there may be financial benefits from donating such as tax relief compared to
        recycling
      • donating provides IT equipment to less fortunate people
      • a disclaimer would be essential so the recipients don’t expect RZX to
        install/set up the donated equipment or fix any problems
      • all proprietary software would need to be deleted as this would breach
        licensing agreements
      • all personal and company files would need to be deleted to avoid privacy and
        security issues.

      Recycling the equipment:
      • recycling is a better option for items that cannot be donated as they are out of
        date
      • will reduce the environmental impact as less raw materials may need to be
        extracted, etc
      • may be a more straight forward process than donating, the items are simply
        collected from the offices
      • the recycling process may be unethical, for example, children working long
        hours in poor conditions in some countries.

      Issues relating to proprietary software and company/personal files also apply
      to recycling as the equipment could be taken home by someone at the
      recycling depot.

      In part (c) of this question it is expected there will be a balance in the ITGS
      terminology between IT technical terminology and the terminology related to
      social and ethical impacts.

      Please see generic markband information sheet on page 25.

2.   Medical centre budgets

     Note to examiners.
     • All part a questions are marked using ticks and annotations where appropriate
     • Part (b) and part (c) are marked using markbands. Use annotations and text
       comments to provide a rationale behind the marks you awarded. Do not use ticks.

     (a)   (i)     Identify two characteristics of voice over internet protocol (VOIP).                [2]

                   Answers may include:
                   • communication carried out using the internet
                   • may take the form of voice or multimedia
                   • an example of VOIP is Skype.

                   Award [1] mark for identifying each characteristic of voice over internet
                   protocol (VOIP) up to a maximum of [2] marks.

           (ii)    Identify the steps that Dr Schultz must follow to list only the surgeries carried
                   out by Dr Tirbau using the spreadsheet software.                                    [2]

                   Answers may include:
                   • filter the Doctor field to show only “Dr Tirbau”
                   • filter the Procedures field to show only “Surgery”.

                   Award [1] for identifying each of the steps followed by Dr Schultz in the
                   spreadsheet software to list only the surgeries done by Dr Tirbau up to a
                   maximum of [2] marks.

           (iii)   Identify two reasons why Dr Schultz would use a spreadsheet instead of a
                   database for record keeping.                                                        [2]

                   Answers may include:
                   • spreadsheets are much easier to set up than databases and can be set
                     up in-house with no cost for IT expertise
                   • spreadsheets require less staff training whereas databases can be
                     complicated for staff who are not IT literate
                   • the volume of medical data may not necessitate the time and effort
                     required to set up a database
                   • the spreadsheet software may already come as part of the pre-loaded
                     software whereas the database software may not.

                   Award [1] mark for identifying each reason why Dr Schultz would use a
                   spreadsheet for the record keeping rather than a database up to a
                   maximum of [2] marks.

(b)   Dr Schultz has arranged to speak to the local authorities in an attempt to get more
      funding for the medical centre. He intends to use presentation software to create a
      slideshow to support this speech. Dr Schultz is aware that many people in the
      audience are annoyed when slideshows are poorly designed.

      Explain three design errors Dr Schultz should avoid when creating his slideshow
      for the local authorities.                                                            [6]

      Answers may include:

      Small font size
      • Dr Schultz should avoid using a small font which makes the text difficult to
        read
      • or results in too much text on a slide reducing its effectiveness.

      Excessive/inappropriate transitions
      • Dr Schultz should ensure that the nature of the transition is appropriate for the
        audience
      • in this case he should avoid excessive flying in, etc.

      Too many slides
      • too many slides can mean that the slides do not remain visible long enough for
        the audience to engage with them
      • or the key points associated with each slide become blurred in the overall

      Poor choice of colours
      • Dr Schultz needs to ensure the mix of colours makes the slides easy to read
      • therefore may want to avoid certain combinations such as red or green that
        may cause some of the audience difficulty in reading the information.

      Inappropriate language
      • Dr Schultz should ensure the language used is appropriate for the intended
         audience
      • this should ensure that overly complex terms or specialist medical terminology
         are not used.

      Inappropriate or overuse of multimedia
      • it may be appropriate to incorporate a video (eg interview with a patient)
      • but irrelevant music/videos can be annoying and detract from the message.

      N.B. the response requires an identification of a common design error followed
      by an explanation of why it is a problem. If no design error is mentioned but from
      the explanation it can be determined this should be credited.

      Award [1] mark for identifying a common design error and [1] mark for an
      explanation why it is a problem up to a maximum of [2] marks.

      Mark as [2] + [2] + [2].

(c)   The Okavango Medical Center has received additional funding from the local
      authority. The centre is investigating the possibility of using these funds to purchase
      IT equipment that would allow surgeons in Gaborone to carry out surgery remotely.

      Evaluate the impact of the purchase of this IT equipment on the medical centre and
      its patients.                                                                      [8]

      Answers may include:

      Advantages of purchasing more IT equipment so that operations can be
      carried out remotely:
      • specialized surgeries (eg cardiac) can be done remotely
      • adding specialist surgeons to this type of clinic would be expensive and
        inefficient as there would be a limited number of cases for them
      • the doctors in Okavango could assist in and/or observe the surgery, thus
        improving their general surgical skills.

      Disadvantages of purchasing more IT equipment so that operations can be
      carried out remotely:
      • the internet connection may not be sufficient to support remote controlled
         surgery because the surgery requires high-tech video and phone links
      • latency in the connection is also a safety issue. Lag times can cause serious
         errors
      • the remote surgery equipment may not be used frequently enough to justify
         the expense
      • it might be wiser to spend the money on other medical needs
      • patients in the area might be uncomfortable with the idea of a
         remote-controlled robot
      • the data will need to be encrypted to protect patient privacy
      • robotic surgery would use public networks raising security concerns including
         hacking.

      In part (c) of this question it is expected there will be a balance in the ITGS
      terminology between IT technical terminology and the terminology related to
      social and ethical impacts.

(b)   (i)     Explain one reason why Bitcoin makes use of private key and public key
              encryption.                                                                      [2]

              Answers may include:
              • secure because every Bitcoin address has a matching private key
                (saved in the wallet file) of user
              • private keys can be kept in computer files
              • secure because it is impossible to determine a private key from
                corresponding public key.

              Award [1] for the reason identified and an additional [1] for the explanation
              why Bitcoin uses private key and public key encryption up to a maximum of
              [2] marks.

      (ii)    Explain one reason why it may be difficult to ensure the security of
              information in a large peer-to-peer network such as Bitcoin.                     [2]

              Answers may include:
              • the security may be carried out at the level of the individual user.
                This may mean that the network’s security may only be as strong as the
                weakest link
              • there is no central control which manages the security of each computer
                by providing virus protection/firewall
              • an inexperienced user may unintentionally allow access to his whole
                hard drive instead of allowing access to specific folders.

              Award [1] for the reason why the security of information may be difficult to
              maintain in a large peer-to-peer network such as Bitcoin and an additional [1]
              for the explanation up to a maximum of [2].

      (iii)   Some users of Bitcoins are concerned that their anonymity may be
              compromised by their Bitcoin address.

              Explain one way the Bitcoin address may be used to reveal information
              about a Bitcoin user.                                                            [2]

              Answers may include:
              • the Bitcoin address when transmitted may include additional information,
                such as the IP address of the user’s device
              • this information may be aggregated from a number of sources and this
                larger data set will then provide sufficient information to link the Bitcoin
                address to a person’s identity.

              Award [1] for identifying how the Bitcoin address may be used to reveal the
              name of a Bitcoin user and an additional [1] for the explanation up to a
              maximum of [2] marks.

(c)   Bitcoin is a form of digital currency. Bitcoin transactions are made between
      individuals without the knowledge of banks, governments or credit card companies.
      Some governments are investigating whether they should regulate digital
      transactions, such as those made using Bitcoins.

      To what extent is it appropriate for governments to regulate digital transactions,
      such as those made using Bitcoins?                                                        [8]

      Answers may include:
      • if transactions can be done without disclosing the name of the individuals, it could
        be a way to use money obtained illegally (money laundering)
      • governments will not be able to see all commercial transactions and therefore miss
        the possibility to tax commercial activities – informality
      • bitcoin wallet providers may have an agreement with clients not to disclose
        information – privacy invasion
      • it is also possible to send a payment without revealing your identity. This allows
        people to transfer funds across country borders without cost but also allows users to
        buy illegal products anonymously
      • unregulated services such as Bitcoin do not provide the protection of regulated
        services such as banks
      • for governments to be able to forecast financial trends they need to have all of the
        information available. If some information is withheld, this makes forecasting more
        problematic
      • there is the ongoing debate between the privacy of the user versus the security of
        the state. The questions could be reframed as what is an acceptable level of
        regulation?
      • if regulation is too strict it will stifle innovation and may prevent worthwhile
        developments in digital currency.

      In part (c) of this question it is expected there will be a balance in the ITGS
      terminology between IT technical terminology and the terminology related to
      social and ethical impacts.

(b)   (i)    The company that supplied the robots spoke with both end-users and clients.

             Distinguish between an end-user and a client.                                     [2]

             Answers may include:
             • end-user – the person who operates the system
             • client – the person who commissions/pays for the system.

             Award [1] for a response that only identifies either the nature of the
             end-user or the client.
             Award [2] for a response that covers both the end-user and client in the
             points above.

      (ii)   Explain two reasons why product development involving robots would require an
             agile project management method.                                                  [4]

             Answers may include:
             • supports the use of prototypes as needed throughout the process
             • requirements and capabilities may evolve rapidly / may involve frequent input
               from the client
             • iterative in nature so team can respond to challenges that occur during
               development
             • so it can include new features as the need for them arises
             • lends itself to a collaborative approach ie revolves around multiple small
               activities in contrast to a linear plan.

             Award [1] for the identification why any product development regarding robots
             will require agile project management method, and an additional [1] for the
             explanation of that reason.
             Mark as [2 + 2].
             Award a maximum of [4] for the question.

(c)   Toby Walsh, professor of Artificial Intelligence at the University of New South Wales,
      Australia, notes that the use of police robots raises “many important questions that
      we, as a society, have to think about”.

      To what extent should police departments rely on the human element of policing,
      rather than robots?                                                                      [8]

      Answers may include:

      Benefits of robots:
      • robots can save lives (can defuse bombs, can be sent into other situations that
        would be dangerous for humans)
      • under pressure human being can make mistakes that robots would not make
      • robot’s sensors may be able to detect things that a human could not (for
        example, smell gases, facial recognition, etc.)
      • emotions will not affect the decisions/behaviour of the robot.

      Problems with robots:
      • how do we keep robots from being hacked, ie taken over by third parties?
      • will police departments be tempted to weaponize their robots in order to minimize
        the risk to officers?
      • will communities accept their use?
      • humans can be held responsible for their actions while there is doubt about who to
        blame with a robot
      • humans can detect aspects of a situation that a robot cannot
      • people may feel safer with human officers rather than with robots.

      Decision making and guidelines that determine the extent to which robots
      can be used in policing:
      • who should decide how they are used?
      • what kinds of robots should be available to police?
      • what are the guidelines for remotely killing a human being?
      • how should police who use robots be trained?

      In part (c) of this question it is expected there will be a balance in the ITGS
      terminology between IT technical terminology and the terminology related to
      social and ethical impacts.

(b)       Google has chosen to use a neural network for this project, rather than an expert
          system.

          Distinguish between an expert system and neural network.                               [6]

          Answers may include:

          Expert systems:

          Neural networks:
          • use large quantities of data, ie examples
          • do not depend on expert knowledge
          • imitate the way electric impulses travel through neurons in the human brain
          • need training before they can be used in any practical way
          • use multiple single processors
          • learn by trial and error, not a rule-based approach
          • use a series of nodes with different weights to analyze data.

(c)   It is claimed that the NHS’s partnership with Google is beneficial for both
      stakeholders. However concerns have been raised about the ethical implications of
      this data sharing agreement.

      To what extent is it ethical for the NHS to share patient information about eye scans
      from Moorfields Eye Hospital with Google?                                               [8]

      Answers may include:

      Ethical problems:
      • can the patients decide whether to opt in or opt out?
      • Google is likely to profit from what they learn from this project
      • Google will benefit from improvements in its algorithm
      • Google will need to guarantee that the data is kept secure
      • Google will need to guarantee that the data is kept private
      • Google will need to guarantee that the data is only used for this project
      • does this scheme cause harm to the patients, is it ethical?

      Benefits for the NHS and its patients:
      • Google could provide free access to the system to the NHS vs other health
        providers
      • the knowledge gained about preserving sight could be shared with doctors around
        the world therefore benefiting many people at risk of losing their sight
      • this data may be mined and other associations established that may lead to
        preventative health care in unrelated fields
      • patients may feel the benefits of sharing their data outweigh the negative
        implications of their data being shared.

      In part (c) of this question it is expected there will be a balance in the ITGS
      terminology between IT technical terminology and the terminology related to
      social and ethical impacts.

                   • to sense the center of gravity of the wearer
                   • to sense how much pressure the wearer is exerting on the object being
                     lifted
                   • to sense vital signs (blood glucose levels, blood pressure, cardiac and
                     respiratory activities).

           (ii)    Identify two characteristics of a prototype.                                   [2]

                   Answers may include:
                   • early working model of a system or subsystem
                   • used to test the system (eg interface, functioning)
                   • used to demonstrate how the system will work
                   • used to check whether the systems will meet the target user’s
                     requirements.

           (iii)   Identify two key stakeholders involved in this project.                        [2]

                   Answers may include:
                   • manufacturer of the exoskeleton
                   • workers
                   • programmers
                   • designers
                   • employers (in the workplaces where Robo-Mate is used, i.e. the company
                     purchasing the Robo-Mate).

(b)   The researchers involved in the Robo-Mate project decided to use a Pert chart
      instead of a Gantt chart to guide the project.

      Explain why the researchers used a Pert chart instead of a Gantt chart to guide the
      project.                                                                            [6]

      Answers may include:

      Advantages of a Pert chart:
      • easy identification of order of precedence of the activities
      • shows relationships between tasks
      • easy identification of the critical path
      • shows early start, late start and slack for each activity ie more realistic estimation of
        time for each activity
      • can show slack time so resources can be moved to more critical activities
      • more appropriate for large and complex projects compared with Gantt chart which is
        appropriate for small projects.

      Disadvantages of a Pert chart:
      • charts can be very complicated
      • can underestimate completion time particularly if delays occur
      • inaccurate time estimates can make the entire plan incorrect.

      Advantages of a Gantt chart:
      • use of a Gantt chart visualizes the process, eg helps to maintain organization
      • it illustrates which tasks must be completed before the next one can begin
      • task can be viewed against a calendar showing start and end dates
      • resources required for tasks can be linked to the tasks on the chart
      • more appropriate for small projects (chart becomes too complex for larger projects).

      Disadvantages of a Gantt chart:
      • it is a linear (ie step-by-step) process so it is very inflexible. Changes are difficult
         to make
      • errors are difficult to correct
      • changes could result in significant costs
      • chart can be too simplistic and does not provide enough detail for a complex project
         (eg this chart leaves out the construction of the database)
      • it is difficult to show where there is slack time in the project
      • inaccurate time estimates can make the entire plan incorrect.

(c)   Other than for the prevention of injuries, discuss the impacts for workers and
      employers of the use of exoskeletons in the workplace.                             [8]

      Possible impacts include:
      • employers might increase expectations of workers, which could lead to more
        injuries, ie dehumanize workers
      • workers might push themselves because the exoskeleton seems to make
        work easier, possibly resulting in injuries
      • exoskeletons could collect data on the user, including private information
      • if person is injured by someone wearing an exoskeleton, who is responsible?
        The manufacturer of the exoskeleton, the user, the company that purchased
        it?
      • older workers can stay in jobs longer
      • productivity improvement
      • will workers accept the technology?
      • injured workers may be equipped with the exoskeleton and returned to work
        earlier
      • saves company money/reduces sick time
      • cost to employer of purchasing/maintaining exoskeleton
      • cost to employer of training workers to us the exoskeleton
      • reliance on the technology: What happens if it breaks down? Can workers
        still do their work?

      N.B. some students may develop the impact of injuries on the workers or the
      companies. If they go beyond what is already stated in the question, this is an
      acceptable approach.

      In part (c) of this question it is expected there will be a balance in the ITGS
      terminology between IT technical terminology and the terminology related to
      social and ethical impacts.
