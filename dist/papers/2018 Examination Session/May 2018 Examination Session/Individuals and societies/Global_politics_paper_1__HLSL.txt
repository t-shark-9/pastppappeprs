Source B                   Adapted from a speech by Christine Lagarde, Managing Director, International
                           Monetary Fund (IMF), “Doubling down on development”, Center for Global
                           Development, Washington, D.C. (2016).
“The greatest challenge we face today is the risk of the world turning its back on global cooperation.
Low income countries would be particularly affected by a breakdown of cooperation. Ironically, it is
precisely those countries that offer promise to the future global economy, as populations in advanced
and emerging markets are aging, limiting their future role in global growth.

I would like to focus your attention on three strands of work the IMF have engaged in with our member
countries in recent years. They focus on key ingredients for successful development: (i) raising
resources for development, (ii) promoting efficient infrastructure investment, and (iii) inclusive growth
(opportunity distributed fairly across society). For example, the 48 countries in sub-Saharan Africa
together generate only the same amount of electricity as just one advanced economy – Spain. Clearly, if
Africa is to realize its potential, better infrastructure is needed. The international community also needs
to prevent issues like tax evasion and we are working closely together with the OECD (Organization for
Economic Co-operation and Development) and the World Bank. There is room to lift both the level and
the effectiveness of aid – and I encourage all countries to raise their game in this area.”

Source C                    Adapted from “The true extent of global poverty and hunger: questioning the
                            good news narrative of the Millennium Development Goals”, an article by Jason
                            Hickel, Third World Quarterly (2016).

The United Nations final report on the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) in July 2015 concluded
that the project has been “the most successful anti-poverty movement in history”. But this narrative relies
on an extremely low poverty line, set at $1.25 per day. Most analysts recognise that this line is too low
to be meaningful, but it remains in favour at the World Bank and the UN because it is the only line that
shows any progress against poverty. In 2014 the Asian Development Bank (ADB) discussed moving the
line up to $1.50 per day to more accurately account for basic food needs. This would see the number of
people in extreme poverty rise by more than one billion.

Many scholars argue that the poverty line should be raised to $5 per day, the minimum necessary for
normal human life expectancy and basic nutrition. At this line, the number of people in poverty rises to
more than 4 billion.

According to international institutions, progress against poverty and hunger is considered to be the main
basis on which the legitimacy of the global economic order rests. If this is so, worsening trends would
require us to rethink the prevailing economic system. It is clear that abandoning structural adjustment2
(which is continued today through the World Bank’s and IMF’s Poverty Reduction Strategy Papers) is an
essential first move towards helping developing countries.

Source D                    Adapted from “African feminism in context”, an article by Josephine Ahikire,
                            Feminist Africa (2014). African feminism has been able to bring the key role of
                            gender in African underdevelopment to many international arenas.

To be effective in the global development arena, great effort was put into making feminist change
agendas understandable to bureaucrats and development actors. Policy-makers were quick to grab the
fact that including women is good for development. The World Bank was quick to declare that, unless
women are considered, full development would remain a futile3 exercise.

However, this implied that inclusion of women was necessary for efficiency, as opposed to a much more
subtle concern over social justice. Specifically, gender mainstreaming4 brought about a bureaucratic
approach in which development actors can hide without necessarily being accountable to women.
There is a preoccupation with delivery and outputs, referred to as “UN feminism”. Many African
governments sign up to international instruments on women’s rights and put national gender policies that
pledge commitment to gender equality in place, but then do very little when it comes to implementation
and commitment of resources.
