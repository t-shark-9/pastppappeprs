                                           Section A

Biological level of analysis

1.   Describe one ethical consideration related to one study at the biological level of analysis.           [8]

     Refer to the paper 1 section A markbands below when awarding marks.

     The command term “describe” requires candidates to give a detailed account of one ethical
     consideration related to one study at the biological level of analysis.

     The ethical consideration may be positive (what guidelines were followed) or negative
     (what guidelines were not followed).

     Ethical considerations may include, but are not limited to:
     • obtaining informed consent
     • avoiding harm or suffering of participants
     • the use of animals as subjects
     • the use of deception
     • maintaining anonymity
     • the right to withdraw
     • the need for debriefing.

     The focus of the response should be on the ethical consideration and not on the
     description of a study.

     If a candidate describes more than one study, credit should only be given to the first
     study.

     If a candidate describes more than one ethical consideration, credit should only be given to the first
     consideration. Candidates may be awarded marks if describing more than one ethical consideration,
     as long as the additional consideration(s) are used to clarify the description of the first – for example,
     explaining deception as part of a description of informed consent.

     If a candidate describes an appropriate study, but there is no link to an ethical
     consideration, apply the markbands up to a maximum of [3].

     If a candidate describes an ethical consideration but does not refer to an appropriate
     study, apply the markbands up to a maximum of [4].

Cognitive level of analysis

2.   Describe how one social or cultural factor affects one cognitive process.                              [8]

     Refer to the paper 1 section A markbands below when awarding marks.

     The command term “describe” requires candidates to give a detailed account of how one social or
     cultural factor affects one cognitive process.

     As the concepts of social and cultural factors are arguably very much related, a distinction is not
     necessary in the response.

     Cognitive processes may include but are not limited to:
     • memory
     • perception
     • attention
     • language
     • decision-making.

     Appropriate factors include, but are not limited to:
     • the impact of culture on schemas and memory (Bartlett, 1932)
     • the effect of poverty on attention, working memory and perception
     • the effects of social identity on the formation of flashbulb memories
     • the role of schooling in memory strategies (Cole and Scribner, 1974)
     • the impact of environmental stimuli on perception (carpentered world hypothesis)
     • the role of short-term and long-term orientation on decision-making (Chen, 2005).

     Additional factors may include institutionalization, deprivation and stereotypes/stereotype threat.

     If a candidate describes more than one social or cultural factor, credit should be given only to the
     first factor.

     If a candidate addresses more than one cognitive process, credit should be given only to the first
     process.

     If a candidate describes a social or cultural factor making no explicit link to a cognitive process,
     apply the markbands up to a maximum of [3].

Sociocultural level of analysis

3.   With reference to one study, describe one error in attribution.                                        [8]

     Refer to the paper 1 section A markbands below when awarding marks.

     The command term “describe” requires candidates to give a detailed account of one error in
     attribution with reference to one study.

     Appropriate attribution errors may include but are not limited to:
     • fundamental attribution error (Ross et al. (1977); Jones and Harris (1967))
     • defensive attribution bias (Walster (1966); Brickman et al. (1975))
     • actor–observer bias (Storms (1973); Nisbett et al. (1973))
     • illusory correlation (Hamilton and Gifford (1974))
     • self-serving bias (Johnson et al. (1964); Lau and Russel (1980))
     • modesty bias (Fahr, Dobbins and Cheng (1991); Kashima and Triandis (1986))

     If a candidate describes an appropriate study without describing one error in attribution, apply the
     markbands up to a maximum of [3].

     If a candidate describes one error in attribution without making reference to a relevant study, apply
     the markbands up to a maximum of [4].

     If a candidate refers to more than one study, credit should be given only to the first study.

     If a candidate describes more than one error in attribution, credit should be given only to the first
     error in attribution described. Candidates may be awarded marks for describing more than one
     type of error in attribution, as long as the additional errors are used to clarify the description of the
     first.

A — Knowledge and comprehension

  Marks      Level descriptor
     0       The work does not reach a standard described by the descriptors below.
             The answer demonstrates limited knowledge and understanding that is of marginal
    1–3      relevance to the question. Little or no psychological research is used in the
             response.
             The answer demonstrates limited knowledge and understanding relevant to the
    4–6
             question or uses relevant psychological research to limited effect in the response.
             The answer demonstrates detailed, accurate knowledge and understanding relevant
    7–9      to the question, and uses relevant psychological research effectively in support of
             the response.

     0       The work does not reach a standard described by the descriptors below.
             The answer goes beyond description but evidence of critical thinking is not linked to
    1–3
             the requirements of the question.
             The answer offers appropriate but limited evidence of critical thinking or offers
    4–6      evidence of critical thinking that is only implicitly linked to the requirements of the
             question.
             The answer integrates relevant and explicit evidence of critical thinking in response

4.   To what extent does genetic inheritance influence behaviour?                                    [22]

     Refer to the paper 1 section B assessment criteria when awarding marks.

     The command term “to what extent” requires candidates to consider the contribution of genetic
     inheritance on behaviour.

     In responding, a candidate may choose a single behaviour, or they may choose a number of
     behaviours. The term “behaviour” may be considered broadly and could include schizophrenia,
     depression, obesity, intelligence, aggression and sexual orientation.

     Candidates may use examples of inheritance from family, twin and adoption studies that look at
     concordance rates, or they may choose to look at studies of specific genes. Both approaches are
     equally acceptable. Candidates may also choose to address gene expression and gene x
     environment interactions.

     It may be appropriate and useful for candidates to address sociocultural and/or cognitive factors in
     order to address the command term “to what extent”. It would also be appropriate to look at the
     strengths and limitations of genetic evidence.

     Examples of relevant studies include, but are not limited to:
     • Heston’s (1966), Gottesman’s (1991) and Kety et al.’s (1975) studies examining the role of
       genetic inheritance in schizophrenia
     • Kendler et al. (2006), Caspi et al. (2003) and Nurnberger and Gershon (1982) on the role of
       genetic inheritance in depression
     • Garn et al. (1981) and Stunkard et al. (1990) on the role of genetic inheritance in obesity
     • Bouchard et al. (1990), Scarr and Weinberg (1977), and Plomin and Petrill (1977) on the role of
       genetic inheritance in intelligence.

     If a candidate makes reference to research from evolutionary psychology, the focus of the
     response must be on how genetic inheritance may influence the behaviour.

5.   Discuss one theory of how emotion may affect one cognitive process.                            [22]

     Refer to the paper 1 section B assessment criteria when awarding marks.

     The command term “discuss” requires candidates to offer a considered review of one theory
     demonstrating the influence of emotion on one cognitive process.

     Responses may focus on any cognitive process that is affected by emotion, such as attention,
     perception, memory or decision-making.

     Examples of theories include, but are not limited to:
     • Brown and Kulik’s flashbulb memory theory
     • Bower’s theory of state-dependent cues
     • DaMasio’s Somatic Marker Hypothesis

     Discussion of the selected theory includes, but is not limited to:
     • degree of empirical support
     • methodological considerations
     • cultural and gender considerations
     • contrary findings or explanations
     • validity of the concepts
     • application and/or usefulness of the empirical findings.

     If a candidate discusses more than one theory, credit should be given only to the first discussion,
     unless the other theory or theories are clearly used to evaluate the main theory; for example, used
     to illustrate the strengths and/or limitations of the main theory.

6.   Discuss the use of two compliance techniques.                                                 [22]

     The command term “discuss” requires candidates to offer a considered review of two compliance
     techniques. Although the response must address two techniques the discussion does not have to
     be evenly balanced to gain high marks.

     Compliance techniques that are addressed may include, but are not limited to:
     • reciprocity (Lynne & McCall,1998; Tiger & Fox, 1989)
     • foot-in-the-door (Petrova, 2007; Sherman, 1980; Freedman & Fraser, 1966)
     • door-in-the-face (Gueguen & Meineri, 2011; Cialdini, 1975)
     • low-balling (Burger & Cornelius, 2003; Palak, 1980).

     Discussion may include, but is not limited to:
     • efficacy of the technique
     • levels of compliance affected by factors such as liking, authority, etc
     • the role of cognitive dissonance
     • the need for social acceptance
     • the role of goal gradients
     • methodological and ethical considerations
     • cultural and gender considerations
     • contrary findings or explanations.

     If a candidate discusses more than two compliance techniques, credit should be given only to the
     first two compliance techniques.

     If a candidate discusses only one compliance technique, the response should be awarded up to a
     maximum of [5] for criterion A, knowledge and comprehension, up to a maximum of [4] for criterion
     B, critical thinking, and up to a maximum of [2] for criterion C, organization.
