Answer two questions from this section.

1.   (a)   With reference to Table 2, describe two advantages for Su of using a cash-flow
           forecast.                                                                                   [4]

     (b)   With reference to Su and her managers at HH and AS, explain the differences between
           leadership and management.                                                                  [6]



2.   (a)   With reference to AK Bank, describe two features of for-profit microfinance providers.      [4]

           Explain the factors (reasons) that Su may consider when deciding between the two
           locations.                                                                                  [6]

                                                Section B

Answer the following question.

4.   It is now mid-2019. Production of solar power systems has been going for over a year and sales
     have exceeded forecasts and reached 5000 systems for the year. Profits have been reinvested
     into developing new outlets and distribution channels for solar power systems in Afghanistan.
     Lean production techniques have enabled AS to keep costs low, but AS has had some quality
     issues: some cells produce lower quality systems than others. AS has found faults in components
     bought from suppliers. Some solar power systems have been damaged in the supply chain.
     Salima is thinking of instituting total quality management (TQM). She also needs to forecast sales
     for 2020 but has decided the situation is not suitable for a four-part moving average.

     In a separate development, Doorway Foundation (DF), a multibillion-dollar charity established by
     the owners of one of the world’s largest IT businesses, has approached Su. The foundation has
     a major IT initiative to bring IT to schools in Afghanistan, Myanmar and Bangladesh. By forming a
     joint venture, DF could use AS’s expertise and local knowledge to help solve some of the electricity
     supply and IT problems in Afghanistan.

     The possibility of a joint venture encouraged managers and investors to think about whether AS
     should grow. In response, Su decided to analyse the possibility of growth through change using a
     force field analysis of AS.

                                                 Section C

Answer the following question.

5.   Su is considering two options.

     Option 1: The joint venture

     If AS goes ahead with the joint venture in 2019, there will be consequences it will need to face.
     DF would have majority ownership in the joint venture, provide most of the senior managers, and
     is likely to expect changes in the way AS operates. AS would have to significantly increase the
     production of solar power systems and would have to restructure. Some managers may lose
     influence over decisions. Su is worried that her Afghanistan project (AS) would take second place.

     Having a close working relationship with DF would reduce AS’s risk of failure. Employees at AS
     have heard rumours about the joint venture and are unhappy with the idea. They fear a loss of
     identity, being overwhelmed by a much larger organization and possibly losing their jobs. Su is
     concerned that resistance to change, particularly by employees and managers, is going to be an
     important consideration in the decision. However she sees the situation as a huge opportunity to
     make a real change in young people’s lives.

     AS would invest $1 million. The net cash inflows to AS (ignoring inflows to DF and before
     deduction of the investment cost) are forecast to be $0.4 million per year, giving a net present value
     (NPV) at 6 % discount rate of $0.68 million and a payback of two years and six months. Su gives
     the project a life of five years.

     Option 2: Diversification into biomass

     The research and development section of AS has developed a portable electricity generation
     system based on biomass, a biomas power system (BPS), as an alternative to solar power
     systems. A new factory costing $3 million will be needed. BPS will be particularly useful to those
     communities that keep cattle − the dung* produced provides the fuel for BPS. Su has assembled
     some relevant information.

     Using the case study, additional information on pages 6 and 7 and appropriate planning
     tools, recommend whether Su should choose Option 1, Option 2, or neither. You will find it
     useful to calculate the ARR for Option 1.                                                       [20]
