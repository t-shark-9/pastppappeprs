Microeconomics

1.   (a)       Explain how the value of the cross price elasticity of demand (XED) for a particular
               good is determined by its relationship to other goods.                                 [10]

               Answers may include:
                definition of XED
                diagram(s) to show the impact of XED, eg using shifts of demand when
                 there is a change in price of another good, or price of X/quantity of Y type
                 diagrams to show substitutes and complements
                explanation in terms substitutes (positive XED), complements (negative
                 XED) and no relationship/a weak relationship/a strong relationship (ie
                 magnitude)
                examples of goods which are substitutes/complements.

NB Candidates can only be awarded Level 4 if they consider both positive/negative and make at least
some brief reference to magnitude, ie a maximum of Level 3 for consideration of just one or the other.

(b)   Examine the significance of both cross price elasticity of demand and income
      elasticity of demand for a firm.                                                          [15]

      Answers may include:
       definitions of XED and YED
       diagrams to show the significance of XED and YED for a firm
       explanation of the significance of XED and YED for a firm
       examples of the significance in practice
       synthesis or evaluation (examine).

      Examination may include: relative importance of other factors which may affect firms,
      eg PED, the importance of the business cycle for YED, the degree to which XED and
      YED can be measured in reality, the tendency of YED and XED to change over time,
      the possibility of mergers between firms that produce substitute goods, the possibility
      of collaboration between firms that produce complementary goods.

      Examiners should be aware that candidates may take a different approach which,
      if appropriate, should be rewarded.

      Opinions or conclusions should be presented clearly and should be supported by
      appropriate examples.

2.   (a)       Explain two factors that would lead to an increase in the demand for a product.    [10]

               Answers may include:
                definition of demand
                diagram to show a supply and demand with a shift of the demand curve to the
                 right
                explanation of how changes to the non-price determinants of demand produce
                 shifts in demand
                examples of specific products, with reference to determinants of demand.

      NB If only one non-price factor is explained, a maximum of Level 2 can be achieved.
         Also, be aware of confusion between price and non-price factors and the difference
between an increase in demand and an increase in the quantity demanded

(b)   Discuss the view that competitive markets will always achieve allocative efficiency.    [15]

      Answers may include:
       definitions of allocative efficiency, competitive market
       diagram to illustrate the principle of allocative efficiency, eg demand = supply,
        marginal benefit= marginal cost
       explanation that allocative efficiency occurs where market equilibrium occurs,
        where social (community) surplus is maximized with respect to producer and
        consumer surplus; marginal benefit equals marginal cost
       example(s) of competitive markets or markets where there is market failure
       synthesis or evaluation (discuss).

      Discussion may include: the difference between private and social optimality;
      challenges to the view expressed in the question in terms of such market failures as
      positive and negative externalities, merit goods and demerit goods, lack of provision
      of public goods, lack of information.

      NB If candidates go straight into an evaluation of the view without sufficient
      explanation of how competitive markets achieve allocative efficiency, a maximum of
      mid L3 should be awarded.

      N.B.: It should be noted that definitions, theory, and examples that have already
      been given in part (a), and then referred to in part (b) should be rewarded.

      (b)   Evaluate the view that the best way to reduce income inequality in a country is by
            using progressive taxation.                                                                [15]

            Answers may include:
             definition of progressive taxation, income inequality
             diagram to show how progressive taxation could decrease income inequality
              (inward shift of the Lorenz Curve), or a progressive tax diagram
             explanation of how progressive taxation reduces the disposable income gap
              between people of lower and higher incomes
             examples of where or how progressive taxation has been used
             synthesis or evaluation.

             Evaluation may include: the impact of progressive taxation in reducing income
             inequality including:
            tax avoidance/tax evasion; disincentive effects; effects on efficiency; consideration of
alternative approaches such as government spending on merit goods/transfer payments,
minimum wage, consideration of `best’.

      NB If only progressive taxation is considered, with explanation and evaluation of its impact, but no
alternative policy is considered, a maximum of mid-Level 3 should be awarded, as the question would not
have been fully answered in terms of `best way’

4.   (a)       Explain how expansionary fiscal policy could be used to close a deflationary

               Answers may include:
                definitions of fiscal policy, expansionary fiscal policy, deflationary (recessionary)
                 gap
                diagram to show the potential effects of expansionary fiscal policy in terms of an
                 outward shift of AD
                explanation of how an expansionary fiscal policy will boost aggregate demand
                 and increase output, thereby closing a deflationary gap
                examples of countries that have used expansionary fiscal policy.

(b)   Evaluate the view that fiscal policy is the most effective way of achieving long-term
      economic growth.                                                                        [15]

      Answers may include:
       definitions of long-term economic growth, short-term economic growth, fiscal
        policy
       diagram to show an outward shift of the PPC or a rightward shift of LRAS
       explanation of how fiscal policy leads to long-term economic growth indirectly by
        creating an economic environment that is favourable to private investment,
        and directly through government spending on physical capital goods and human
        capital formation, as well as provision of incentives for firms to invest
       examples of fiscal policy that has led to long-term economic growth
       synthesis or evaluation.

      Evaluation may include: the type of fiscal policy and how it is financed, advantages
      and disadvantages of fiscal policy, consideration of alternative policies, such as
      monetary and supply-side policies, consideration of `best’
      NB Candidates who only consider the effects of fiscal policy on AD, and do not
      consider the supply-side effects on long-term economic growth, cannot be awarded
      above Level 2.
      Examiners should be aware that candidates may take a different approach which,
      if appropriate, should be rewarded.

      Opinions or conclusions should be presented clearly and should be supported by
      appropriate examples.
