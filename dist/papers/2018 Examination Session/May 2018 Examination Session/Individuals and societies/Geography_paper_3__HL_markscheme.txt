1.   (a)   Using one or more examples, analyse the geographic challenges associated
           with transboundary pollution.                                                        [10]

           Transboundary pollution has damaging effects for more than one country. It is
           most likely that candidates will analyse an “event”, such as a major oil spill, or
           a pervasive air pollution event or period of acid rain (which could last for many
           months or even years – an example being NW Europe in the 1970s and
           1980s). Whatever examples are used, it should be made explicit who is
           affected and why the event is “transboundary”.
            “Geographic challenges” includes the consequences of the pollution, such
              as immediate human, ecological and environmental impacts.
            There are also longer clear-up operations and challenges to consider.
            Also, there is the challenge of achieving effective regulation / prevention
              with pollution management strategies, including global governance of the
              issue(s).

           Good answers may apply (AO2) a wider range of knowledge and
           understanding (AO1) in a well-structured way (AO4). One approach might
           be to analyse different categories of geographic challenge eg economic,
           political and environmental or short and long term. Another approach might be
           to compare issues for countries closer to the pollution source with issues for
           countries further away. Another approach might be to analyse the challenges
           of preventing future pollution given the physical processes involved eg
           atmospheric circulation. Another approach might be to analyse how the
           geographic challenges differ according to the scale of the problem and the
           number of states and stakeholders that are affected.

           Pollution events such as the Bhopal incident are not transboundary but may
           achieve band C if the concept of transnational has been well-analysed (idea of
           TNCs moving their pollution / unsafe operations overseas). The movement of
           recycling wastes to China may be marked in the same way (though not
           transboundary, some limited credit for the transnational aspects of the case
           study could be given). Accounts of carbon emissions and climate change
           should also be treated like this.

           For band C (4–6 marks), expect some weakly evidenced outlining of the effects
           of transboundary/transnational pollution in one or more contexts.

           For band D (7–8 marks), expect a structured, evidenced analysis of:
            either one or more detailed examples of the consequences of actual
             transboundary pollution
            or different types of geographic challenge (eg near & far challenges, short
             and long-term challenges or economic and governance challenges)

           For band E (9–10 marks), expect both band D traits.

(b)   Examine how disparities between countries give rise to different global flows.    [15]

      Credit all content in line with the markbands. Credit unexpected approaches
      wherever relevant.

      The focus is on disparities between countries or different global groups of
      countries: these may include economic, social, political or other disparities.
      The question suggests that disparities give rise to multiple flows. These range
      from financial flows to migration and the movement of ideas and information.

      Better answers will maintain a focus on flows eg FDI, remittances; weaker
      answer may at times become more descriptive of the actions or impacts of
      different stakeholders/actors eg TNCs (and flows may be implied rather than
      explicitly examined).

      Possible applied themes (AO2) include knowledge and understanding
      (AO1) of:
       labour/migration flows [Guide 3]
       financial flows, eg remittances/aid/loans [Guide 3]
       investments by global institutions such as the IMF [Guide 3]
       raw material flows [Guide 4]
       waste disposal flows [Guide 4]
       information flows routed via low-cost outsourcing centres [Guide 3]
       TNC investment into new emerging markets and profit repatriation [Guide 5]
       past/present cultural exchanges linked with core–periphery labour flows
        [Guide 6].

      Good answers may synthesize (AO3) three or more of these or other relevant
      themes in a well-structured (AO4) way.

      Good answers may additionally offer a critical evaluation (AO3) that
      examines the complexity of global disparities (there are multiple development
      gaps and disparities eg between emerging economies and the least developed
      states). Another approach might be to examine non-economic disparities eg
      differences in governance and human rights. Another approach might be to
      examine the scale of different flows/movements (eg USA and Mexico are
      neighbour countries; India and UK are distant from one another).

      Answers dealing only with movements from “poor” to “rich” places will most
      likely show only limited understanding of what could be meant by “disparities
      between countries” and are unlikely to reach the highest band even if factually
      detailed.

      For band C (5–8 marks), expect weakly evidenced outlining of two or three
      relevant themes from the geography guide.

      For band D (9–12 marks), expect:
       either a structured synthesis which links together several well-evidenced
        and well-focused themes from the geography guide
       or a developed, critical conclusion (or greater ongoing evaluation).

      For band E (13–15 marks), expect both of these traits.

2.   (a)   In a global context, analyse what is meant by “core areas” and “peripheries”.      [10]

           In a global context, “core areas” can mean developed countries (eg G7/8
           nations) while “peripheries” include a larger number of states at varying levels
           of economic development and with varying involvement in global interactions.
            The core and periphery are interdependent geographical entities that form a
              system and are linked/connected with one another in varied ways.
            Links/flows/connections include global/international movements of people,
              money, ideas, goods and resources.
            In the past, a simple core–periphery system existed, that is, “MEDCs and
              LEDCs” or “the global north and south”. However, the emergence of a
              semi-periphery (NICs / emerging economies / BRICs) has made the system
              more complex.
            One view is that countries can ‘advance’ over time from periphery to semi-
              periphery and eventually gain core status (eg South Korea); another view is
              that the core actively reproduces the poverty of the periphery.

           Good answers may apply (AO2) a wider range of knowledge and
           understanding (AO1) in a well-structured way (AO4). One approach might
           be to use the concept of scale to inform the analysis, eg there may be
           recognition that some world cities/megacities (eg Lagos) are global hubs
           (cores) despite belonging to “peripheral” countries (eg Nigeria). Another
           approach might be to analyse the way countries like China and India could be
           seen as “core” countries when viewed from a peripheral sub-Saharan African
           perspective.

           Answers dealing only with national-scale core–periphery patterns (cities and
           rural regions within a country) are unlikely to reach band C but should be
           marked positively if the work shows understanding of core–periphery
           relationships (AO1) and is well structured (AO4).

           For band C (4–6 marks), expect some weakly evidenced outlining of a basic
           global core–periphery pattern.

           For band D (7–8 marks), expect a structured, evidenced analysis of:
            either a range of global core–periphery criteria and linkages/connections
            or more varied global core–periphery patterns/scales/perspectives.

           For band E (9–10 marks), expect both band D traits.

(b)   “Globalization involves the imposition of Western culture on the entire world.”
      To what extent do you agree with this statement?                                      [15]

      Credit all content in line with the markbands. Credit unexpected approaches
      wherever relevant.

      The focus here is “Western culture”, which is a debatable concept in itself
      (expect some definition to be provided in a good answer). The merit of the
      answer is likely to depend on the variety of different cultural traits and contexts
      that are examined, and also the quality of any counter-arguments (eg many may
      argue “imposition” is the wrong word; fewer may also argue that non-Western
      cultural influences have spread globally too).

      Possible applied themes (AO2) include knowledge and understanding
      (AO1) of:
       telecommunication network growth (and thus cultural diffusion) [Guide 2]
       issues of landscape homogenization [Guide 4]
       cultural diffusion linked with flows of people and commodities [Guide 5]
       the homogenizing power of global media and TNCs [Guide 5]
       TNCs, glocalization and the adaption, not adoption, of culture [Guide 5]
       the concept of cultural imperialism [Guide 5]
       anti-globalization movements (focused on culture) [Guide 5]
       isolated groups/states unaffected by Western/other influences [Guide 7].
       diaspora groups in Western states which do not embrace Western culture
        [Guide 5].

      Good answers may synthesize (AO3) three of these or other relevant themes
      in a well-structured (AO4) way.

      Good answers may additionally offer a critical evaluation (AO3) of the
      statement, for example by evaluating the extent to which the adoption of
      Western culture is voluntary or forced. Another approach might be to examine
      the difference between broader “Western culture” and the narrower concept of
      “Americanization” (linked with a single superpower, the USA). Another
      approach might be to counter-argue the statement by evaluating the growing
      “imposition” of non-Western cultures on a global scale, eg Japanese, Indian,
      Chinese influences, or global movements linked with religion. Another
      approach might be to examine the extent to which culture is
      adapted/hybridized in local contexts, rather than simply “imposed”.

      Polarized answers that deal only with Westernized and “non-Westernized”
      isolated states/people (N Korea or the Amish people) are unlikely to meet the
      critical evaluation criterion (which is required for band E).

      For band C (5–8 marks), expect weakly evidenced outlining of two or three
      relevant themes (relating to culture) from the geography guide.

      For band D (9–12 marks), expect:
       either a structured synthesis that links together several well-evidenced and
        well-focused themes from the geography guide
       or a developed, critical conclusion (or greater ongoing evaluation).

      For band E (13–15 marks), expect both of these traits.

3.   (a)   Referring to named countries, analyse how people’s participation in
           information and communications technology (ICT) networks is changing.             [10]

           The focus here is changing participation. This could refer to people’s
           participation as either consumers of ICT services or producers eg call centre
           workers. Candidates should be able to provide one or two examples of trends,
           developments and/or patterns of adoption at the national scale. They may also
           offer an overview of the changing global “digital divide”.
            “Participation” by consumers takes many forms, from social media use to
              remittance transfers.
            Information networks may include broadband internet or mobile/smartphone
              access.
            Some answers may focus on the increased participation of India and the
              Philippines in TNC production networks (outsourcing and call centres).
            Some answers may focus on growth on informal ICT services eg new phone
              app start-ups in Kenya.
            Involvement in e-waste management is a legitimate focus.
            Explanation of changes is not required but can be credited, eg more
              companies providing citizens with internet access; “middle-class” consumer
              income growth in many countries; low wages in outsourcing countries.

           Good answers may apply (AO2) a wider range of knowledge and
           understanding (AO1) in a well-structured way (AO4). One approach might
           be to systematically analyse changes at varying scales (eg provide a global
           overview and also one example of a changing national pattern, eg the rural–
           urban divide). Another approach might be to analyse changing social patterns
           of in inclusion/exclusion (eg for different income groups, women, the elderly).

           For band C (4–6 marks), expect some weakly evidenced outlining of ICT use in
           one or more named countries, or an overview of the global “digital divide”.

           For band D (7–8 marks), expect a structured, evidenced analysis that includes:
            either detailed changes/developments in ICT participation in two contexts
            or some variety of ways in which people participate (eg covers changing
             patterns of consumption and production of ICT services).

           For band E (9–10 marks), expect both band D traits.

(b)   Examine how far the social and environmental costs of globalization can be
      reduced without also losing its benefits.                                                [15]

      Credit all content in line with the markbands. Credit unexpected approaches
      wherever relevant.

      Any aspect of environmental and social costs – and benefits – can be examined.
      Likely environmental themes include costs for the atmosphere, oceans or tropical
      rainforest. Social costs include worker exploitation or changes to society linked
      with the global growth of social media. Any action taken to tackle these costs
      needs weighing carefully against the benefits of global trade and development.

      Possible applied themes (AO2) include knowledge and understanding (AO1)
      of:
       climate change actions, possibly linked with issues such as the growth of food
          miles (air freight) [Guide 4] or the growth of polluting transport networks for
          people and commodities [Guide 2]
       growing environmental awareness fostered via NGOs Guide 4]
       political (inter-governmental) responses to transboundary pollution [Guide 4]
       the need for global action to prevent loss of tropical rainforest (linked with
          timber resource use) [Guide 4]
       calls for the regulation of global agribusinesses, polluting industries and waste
          movements [Guide 4]
       recognition that a non-globalized lifestyle [Guide 7] is one that does not enjoy
          the benefits of economic interactions and flows [Guide 2]
       recognition of the many benefits resulting from the sharing of ideas,
          information and cultures [Guide 5], which might be jeopardized by anti-global
          measures [Guide 6/7].

      Good answers may synthesize (AO3) three of these or other relevant themes in
      a well-structured (AO4) way.

      Good answers may additionally offer a critical evaluation (AO3) that
      systematically examines different aspects of globalization that do or do not need
      managing to reduce their costs. Another approach might be to examine effects at
      different scales (eg comparing local developmental benefits of industrialization
      with the global costs of carbon emissions). Another approach might be to
      examine costs and benefits from varying perspectives (“local sourcing” might be
      viewed as having more costs than benefits by a farmer who wants to export food
      globally).

      Answers that explain the costs and benefits of globalization but do little to actually
      address the question directly – that is, how far can these costs actually be
      reduced/tackled without also losing benefits? – are unlikely to reach band D.

      For band C (5–8 marks), expect weakly evidenced outlining of two or three
      relevant themes from the geography guide.

      For band D (9–12 marks), expect:
       either a structured synthesis which links together several well-evidenced and
        well-focused themes from the geography guide
       or a developed, critical conclusion (or greater ongoing evaluation).

      For band E (13–15 marks), expect both of these traits.
