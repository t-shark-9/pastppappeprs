1.   Explain two or more ethical considerations relevant to this study.                               10

     Refer to the paper 3 markbands when awarding marks.

     The command term “explain” requires candidates to give a detailed account, including reasons, for
     the relevance of two or more ethical considerations to the study.

     Responses that use the term “experiment” as a generic term for “study” should not be penalized.

     Relevant ethical considerations in this study could include, but are not limited to:
     • Anonymity/confidentiality: An important ethical consideration in all research is to guarantee
       anonymity/confidentiality. The eight participants in this study were asked to come up with
       another name to use in the research report. This indicates that the researchers have ensured
       anonymity as the participants appear under a different name – and furthermore, a name that
       they have chosen themselves. Candidates may elaborate on this and say that due to the small
       number of participants and because very few people are involved in extreme sports it is
       possible that the participants may all know each other. It may therefore be difficult to achieve
       total anonymity but the researchers have done what they could to ensure that the identities of
       the participants were not revealed in the final report.
     • Research ethics committee: According to the stimulus material an ethics committee approved
       the study. This is a standard procedure to ensure ethical standards are in line with ethical
       guidelines (eg American Psychological Association) in research involving human participants,
       for example ensuring that individuals receive sufficient information and that appropriate
       strategies are in place to protect participants from potential damaging effects of the research. It
       is also important that there is no conflict of interest between participants and the researcher.
       The interests of the participants always come first and it is obvious from the stimulus material
       that the researchers in this study took great care to ensure that the study was ethically sound.
     • Informed consent: In the stimulus material, it is stated that all participants signed informed
       consent before the study began. This is an important ethical consideration that includes that
       participants are fully informed about the purpose of the study, benefits of the research, right to
       confidentiality and participants' rights, for example, that they can withdraw their data at any
       point. Such considerations may also be explained as separate ethical considerations by
       candidates and receive marks.
     • The participants in this study were also invited to choose the location of the interview
       themselves so that they could feel comfortable and safe during the interview. Candidates may
       relate this to part of the informed consent or protection/ensuring the wellbeing of participants.

     Candidates may refer to ethical considerations taken by the researcher in the study in the stimulus
     material and/or considerations that could have been taken. Both approaches are equally
     acceptable.

     Candidates may explain two ethical considerations in order to demonstrate depth of knowledge, or
     may explain a larger number of ethical considerations in order to demonstrate breadth of
     knowledge. Both approaches are equally acceptable.

     If a candidate explains only one ethical consideration, apply the markbands up to a maximum of [5].

2.   Discuss the use of semi-structured interview in this study.                                        10

     Refer to the paper 3 markbands when awarding marks.

     The command term “discuss” requires candidates to offer a considered review of factors relevant
     to the use of a semi-structured interview in this research study.

     Responses that use the term “experiment” as a generic term for “study” should not be penalized.

     Semi-structured interviews normally use a combination of closed and open-ended questions and
     the interview is often informal and conversational in nature with many open-ended questions. The
     semi-structured interview is based on an interview guide with a number of themes to explore. This
     is a checklist to encure standardization of interviews but there is flexibility in terms of order of
     questions and how to phrase them.

     Discussion related to reasons for choosing the semi-structured interview in this study could
     include, but is not limited to:
     • Good reasons for choosing the flexibility of the semi-structured interview could be the personal
        and somewhat sensitive nature of the topic in this study. Using open-ended questions makes it
        possible for respondents to give a detailed account of their personal experiences and to reflect
        on their motives for participating in extreme sports, which would eventually provide richer data
        in relation to this rather unexplored topic.
     • The interviewer can also ask participants to elaborate if more information is needed on topics
        brought up by the respondent. This seems a major advantage in this study where the purpose
        is to get an insight into the complex motives for engaging in a sport that is potentially deadly.
     • The semi-structured interview allows researchers to not only use open-ended questions, which
        means that they get rich data, but also to get answers to specific questions, for example related
        to the specific version of extreme sport of each participant.
     • If the researchers had used a structured interview with closed questions, they would probably
        not gain the same insight into the eight participants' ideas, perceptions and feelings about
        motivations to participate in extreme sports. There is still limited research on possible
        motivations for participating in extreme sports. The results of this study could serve as a
        platform for further research into the topic, using other methods.
     • If the researchers have chosen not to use a focus group interview it is possibly because it is
        impossible to guarantee anonymity of participants, which was very important in this study.
        Another reason could be that the topic of this investigation is sensitive and with more
        participants present there is a risk that participants do not want to disclose what they really feel
        and this could compromise the purpose of this research.
     • In the discussion of the use of semi-structured interviews candidates are likely to include
        particular strengths of the semi-structured interview and link them to this specific study. One
        example could be that the more informal and conversational nature of the semi-structured as
        well as the one-on-one encounter is more likely to have participants open up and reveal their
        subjective experiences of engaging in extreme sports. This contributes useful information to this
        research in a new area.

     Candidates may (but do not have to) refer to the disadvantages of semi-structured interviews, for
     example, that analysis of data is extremely time-consuming or that there may only be limited space
     to explore themes that have not been planned beforehand. Since the researchers have chosen to
     use the semi-structured interview in spite of possible limitations, it could be because of the
     possibility to obtain rich data in a field that has only just begun to be studied by qualitative
     researchers.

     Responses may refer to other research methods and be credited for this as long as the focus of
     the response is on semi-structured interviews.

3.   Describe how researchers in this study could use inductive content analysis (thematic analysis)
     on the interview transcripts.                                                                   10

     Refer to the paper 3 markbands when awarding marks.

     The command term “describe” requires candidates to give a detailed account of how inductive
     content analysis could be used on the interview transcripts in the study.

     Responses that use the term “experiment” as a generic term for “study” should not be penalized.

     In the context of this study, candidates should describe characteristics or features of the procedure
     of inductive content analysis on the transcripts. Relevant parts of the procedure of inductive
     content analysis in this study could include, but are not limited to:
     • Reading and rereading the transcripts of the interview to identify possible categories and
         themes (coding the raw data) that relate to how the participants describe their motivation to
         participate in extreme sport.
     • After coding of data the analysis may reveal emerging themes such as “to be in the present”;
         feelings of “achievement or mastery”; and accepting suffering and physical injury as part of the
         experience.
     • The different themes should be connected with relevant quotations from the eight participants in
         the study to support the choice of each theme.
     • After initial analysis the researcher could try to identify possible low-level as well as higher-level
         themes and connect them in meaningful ways to establish hierarchies of themes.
     • Construction of a summary table of higher-order themes and illustrating with quotations, for
         example “the challenge of pushing themselves beyond their existing mental and physical limits”;
         “striving for achievement and mastery of their sport” and lower-order themes, for example
         “experiencing pleasurable feelings such as excitement or ‘adrenaline rush’” and also “accepting
         suffering and physical injury as part of the experience of doing extreme sports”.
     • The analysis will continue until saturation of the data.
     • The final task is to make interpretations based on the summary table in order to find a
         relationship between the different themes. This could lead to formulation of theory to include in
         the final report.
     • Credibility checks can take place during the whole process of inductive content analysis, for
         example checking themes with other coders or researchers as well as participants to have them
         confirm the interpretation of data. Credibility checks could also include reflexivity, that is, the
         researcher controls for own biases.

     Responses that identify themes mentioned in the stimulus material and only say that inductive
     content analysis is about finding themes in the transcripts but fail to describe specific elements of
     the process of inductive content analysis should be awarded up to a maximum of [3].

     Responses that merely quote themes mentioned in the stimulus material but fail to describe any
     elements of the process of inductive content analysis should be awarded [0].

     Responses that merely state that inductive content analysis is concerned with finding themes in the
     transcripts but fail to describe any elements of the process of inductive content analysis should be
     awarded [0].
