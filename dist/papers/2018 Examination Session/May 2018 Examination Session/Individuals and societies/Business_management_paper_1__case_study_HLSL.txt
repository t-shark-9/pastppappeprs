                                             Afghan Sun (AS)

     Suchenlin has made her fortune from the success of her business, High-end Holidays (HH),
     which sells individually designed holidays to luxury destinations in Africa, Asia and the Pacific
     islands. Suchenlin no longer takes part in the day-to-day running of HH. Instead, she has an
     input into strategic decision making and she provides the inspiration for the business.

 5   Su, as her friends know her, has made more than enough money to keep her comfortable for
     the rest of her life, but she still wants new challenges. She is looking for a completely new
     project that will allow her to give back to society.

     On a recent trip to Bangladesh, Su discovered the work of Arif Koomar. He founded a for-
     profit microfinance provider, which trades under the name AK Bank. Very successful, AK Bank
10   serves much of Bangladesh and has provided finance to over three million households to
     buy solar power systems specifically commissioned by AK Bank. Each solar power system
     generates enough electricity for a household.

     Su made an immediate decision. She would find somewhere else in the world in which a similar
     scheme would bring great benefits to communities. She eventually identified Afghanistan, a
15   country with around 34 million people. After years of war, many areas of Afghanistan lack a
     reliable supply of electricity. Su saw an opportunity to manufacture a household-based solar
     power systems similar to those used in Bangladesh and aimed at poor and often remote
     families. She set up a social enterprise called Afghan Sun (AS), which operates as a private
     limited company. Su recruited a team of volunteers from HH employees who are keen to work
20   on the project.

     After more detailed research, the team had:
     • decided the product to be made – solar power systems. These will be produced using
        cellular manufacturing. The team wish to purchase cheap raw materials, using resources
        efficiently to cut waste to enable a very low price to be charged for the units
25   • identified suppliers who share Su’s vision
     • encouraged Arif Koomar to work with AS and expand the microfinance activities of AK Bank
        into Afghanistan.

     Su thinks it very important that she maintains a leadership role for both HH and AS. However,
     she empowers her managers at HH to make day-to-day decisions, including organizing
30   resources, directing staff, coordinating, and taking tactical decisions. As well as empowering
     managers, Su thinks that it is important to empower employees and encourage teamwork by
     creating opportunities for employees to discuss working practice, quality issues and matters
     concerning employees. Su’s intention is to empower managers similarly at AS while retaining
     responsibility for strategic decisions. She believes that her managers are so well motivated and
35   committed to their work that she feels little need to interfere. There is seldom conflict between
     managers, but when there is, Su will provide advice and guidance. Managers, both at HH and
     AS, say that they are inspired by Su and have a clear understanding of her mission and share
     it. As part of her leadership role, Su also enjoys some aspects of organizing, particularly when
     fundraising events for AS are needed and meetings have to be arranged with governments
40   and non-governmental organizations (NGOs). She usually represents the businesses at such
     meetings and conferences.
                                                –3–                 M18/3/BUSMT/BP1/ENG/TZ0/XX/CS

     To help begin the project to make and sell solar power systems, Su appointed David, who,
     before asking to work on the AS project, worked in HH’s marketing department. He is an
     Afghan. She also appointed Salima, also an Afghan, who has experience with a large
45   manufacturing business as a production director. Two more senior managers will be needed,
     and Su needs to decide between selecting experienced HH managers or promoting junior
     employees from within HH.

     Salima does not want to outsource the main production facility of the solar power systems
     but does wish to outsource the production of certain components. Ideally, this would be in
50   nearby countries.

     An important decision to be made is the location of the main production facility for the solar
     power systems. Su is considering two locations, as shown in Table 1.

     facility

     David believes that commercial marketing would have more of an impact than social marketing
     because he sees the solar power systems as being product orientated rather than market
55   orientated. Customers would need to know not only about the solar power systems and the
     benefits they will bring to households but also the means to provide finance to buy them.
     However, David is unsure about which pricing and promotion methods would be appropriate
     for the solar power systems. Customers may not have much money to spend and may have
     other priorities.

60   Distribution will also be a problem, as the likely customers will be in remote locations with poor
     infrastructure. David is investigating the possibility of using local agents and local transport
     businesses to provide the link with customers.

                                                                                               Turn over

        Su had already decided that most of the finance for the production facilities would come
        from share capital provided by herself and loans from HH. She wondered whether other
   65   stakeholders in HH, both internal and external, might want to support the project through some
        kind of financial assistance. The microfinance to AS’s customers would be under completely
        separate arrangements with AK Bank or other microfinance providers.

        Su prepared a six-monthly cash-flow forecast for the first three years of operation.

        Su is aware that the project carries significant risks. Afghanistan is emerging from a long
   70   and damaging war, and in some parts of the country it remains politically unstable. Not all
        areas of the country are peaceful. International forces remain in the country to help rebuild its
        infrastructure and help the Afghan government restore peace and reinforce democracy.

        The management of AS need to make the decisions on production and distribution as soon as
        possible to get the project into action. Su is also aware that she may have to create a plan to
   75   help out when things go wrong and to prepare for possible changes in the external environment.
        AS will have to carry out very careful marketing planning and human resource planning, as well
        as ensure it is prepared for uncertainties.
