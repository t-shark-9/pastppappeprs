                                                Section A

Answer two questions. Each question is worth [20 marks].

1.   IT support for staff laptop computers at RZX

     The role of the IT department at RZX is to provide IT support to the staff at the head office.
     As many of the employees spend a considerable amount of time travelling between the various
     RZX offices, they are given a laptop computer. This laptop needs to be maintained once a year, so
     each employee must hand in their laptop before they go on vacation so that this can be done. The
     IT team will carry out the maintenance and have it ready for the employee when they return from
     their vacation.

     Employees at RZX are expected to store their files in the cloud. However some employees have
     saved many files on their laptops, and RZX has informed them that they are responsible for
     keeping secure backups of this information.

     During maintenance, hard disk drives are cleaned, defragmented or reformatted and the random
     access memory (RAM) is increased. A new version of the operating system may be installed and
     other software programs will be added, re-installed or upgraded to a newer version.

                               [Source: © International Baccalaureate Organization 2018]

     (a)   (i)   Identify two functions of an operating system.                                       [2]

		(ii)           Identify two characteristics of random access memory (RAM).                          [2]

		(iii)          Identify two devices that could be used to store a backup of the files that
                 employees have saved on their laptops.                                               [2]

     (b)   Analyse the advantages and disadvantages of using cloud-based storage for an RZX
           employee’s work files.                                                                     [6]

     (c)   The disposal of old IT equipment is becoming a problem. RZX is considering two
           options:
           • donating the equipment to a charitable organization
           • sending the equipment to a recycling service.

           Evaluate the implications of these two options.                                            [8]




                                                                                                Turn over

2.   Medical centre budgets

     Dr Schultz is the head doctor and manager at the Okavango Medical Center, Botswana.
     This medical centre is located eight hours away from the capital city, Gaborone. The medical
     centre is able to cope with routine cases, but when the doctors at the centre encounter an unusual
     case they have to communicate with specialists at the main hospital in Gaborone using either a
     telephone or voice over internet protocol (VOIP).

     Currently the Okavango Medical Center does not have any medical equipment connected to the
     IT systems at the hospital in Gaborone in real time. When there are unexpected changes in a
     patient’s condition, this makes it hard to give the necessary information to specialists in Gaborone.
     Because of this, at times Dr Schultz has to ask a specialist doctor from Gaborone to come to
     Okavango Medical Center to carry out treatment.

     The area is becoming popular with tourists, and Dr Schultz is concerned that the doctors and
     nurses at Okavango Medical Center will be unable to treat the increasing number of patients.
     He believes Okavango Medical Center needs better equipment in order to improve patient care.

     Dr Schultz created a spreadsheet of the treatments carried out by the centre over a week.
     A small part of the spreadsheet is shown below in Figure 1.

(Question 2 continued)

     (a)   (i)    Identify two characteristics of voice over internet protocol (VOIP).                    [2]

		         (ii)   Identify the steps that Dr Schultz must follow to list only the surgeries carried out
                  by Dr Tirbau using the spreadsheet software.                                            [2]

		(iii)           Identify two reasons why Dr Schultz would use a spreadsheet instead of a
                  database for record keeping.                                                            [2]

     (b)   Dr Schultz has arranged to speak to the local authorities in an attempt to get more
           funding for the medical centre. He intends to use presentation software to create
           a slideshow to support this speech. Dr Schultz is aware that many people in the
           audience are annoyed when slideshows are poorly designed.

           Explain three design errors Dr Schultz should avoid when creating his slideshow for
           the local authorities.                                                                         [6]

     (c)   The Okavango Medical Center has received additional funding from the local
           authority. The centre is investigating the possibility of using these funds to purchase
           IT equipment that would allow surgeons in Gaborone to carry out surgery remotely.

           Evaluate the impact of the purchase of this IT equipment on the medical centre and
           its patients.                                                                                  [8]

3.   Digital currency

     Bitcoin is a type of digital currency (cryptocurrency). This is money that can be sent via the internet
     and exchanged for goods, services or money in different currencies. Users can buy Bitcoins using
     real money, and then Bitcoins can either be spent or stored in a digital wallet for later use.
     Bitcoins can be used in every country, and sending Bitcoins is as simple as sending an email.

     The Bitcoin wallet is an application that can be installed on a computer or mobile device. Once a
     Bitcoin wallet is installed, the user will get a Bitcoin address to use when transferring Bitcoins to
     and from the wallet. This transfer uses private and public key encryption. Users should have a
     strong password to access their Bitcoin wallet.

     Bitcoin operates on a peer-to-peer (P2P) network and users of Bitcoins are identified by their
     Bitcoin address. Some users of Bitcoins wish to remain anonymous, but this is not
     always possible.

                              [Source: © International Baccalaureate Organization 2018]

     (a)   (i)     Identify two characteristics of a peer-to-peer (P2P) network.                         [2]

		(ii)             Identify two characteristics of a strong password.                                    [2]

		         (iii)   The use of a password is one method of authentication.

                   Identify two other methods of authentication.                                         [2]

     (b)   (i)     Explain one reason why Bitcoin makes use of private key and public key
                   encryption.                                                                           [2]

		(ii)             Explain one reason why it may be difficult to ensure the security of information in
                   a large peer-to-peer network such as Bitcoin.                                         [2]

		         (iii)   Some users of Bitcoins are concerned that their anonymity may be compromised
                   by their Bitcoin address.

                   Explain one way the Bitcoin address may be used to reveal information about a
                   Bitcoin user.                                                                         [2]

     (c)   Bitcoin is a form of digital currency. Bitcoin transactions are made between individuals
           without the knowledge of banks, governments or credit card companies. Some
           governments are investigating whether they should regulate digital transactions, such
           as those made using Bitcoins.

           To what extent is it appropriate for governments to regulate digital transactions, such as
           those made using Bitcoins?                                                                    [8]

Answer one question. Each question is worth [20 marks].

4.   The future of police robots

     In 2016, police in Dallas, Texas in the United States used a remotely-controlled robot loaded with
     explosives to kill a suspect who had barricaded himself at the end of a hallway in a community
     college. Fifty-eight staff and students were still trapped in the building. Eight of them were in a
     room on the floor below the suspect. Before the police used the robot, they had exchanged gunfire
     with the suspect. The suspect refused to surrender; negotiations with him had broken down,
     and he told police that he had planted bombs in the area. The police discussed the issue for 20
     minutes, and then decided to send in the robot and detonate the explosives.

     Law enforcement agencies, the American Civil Liberties Union and the Police Executive Research
     Forum have all expressed opinions about the legal and ethical aspects of sending a robot to
     detonate explosives that would kill or severely injure a suspect. There is concern that this action
     will be more widely used by police departments in the future.

     This kind of robot is typically used to enable police to see into areas where it would be too
     dangerous to send in a human being, such as defusing explosives or removing hazardous
     material. Robots can also be used to conduct negotiations with suspects so that police officers are
     not in danger while negotiating. The robot can be operated wirelessly or using a cable.

     (a)   (i)     Identify two characteristics of a robot.                                             [2]

		(ii)             Identify two output devices the robot might have.                                    [2]

		         (iii)   The police department has technical support staff.

                   Identify two duties of the staff that supports the robot.                            [2]

     (b)   (i)     The company that supplied the robots spoke with both end-users and clients.

                   Distinguish between an end-user and a client.                                        [2]

		(ii)             Explain two reasons why product development involving robots would require an
                   agile project management method.                                                     [4]

     (c)   Toby Walsh, professor of Artificial Intelligence at the University of New South Wales,
           Australia, notes that the use of police robots raises “many important questions that we,
           as a society, have to think about”.

           To what extent should police departments rely on the human element of policing, rather
           than robots?                                                                                 [8]

5.   Artificial intelligence (AI) in health care

     Google’s DeepMind uses a machine learning algorithm and neural network to analyse data.
     Google is now collaborating with the United Kingdom’s National Health Service (NHS) to develop
     systems that can improve the quality of healthcare.

     Its first project is to create a system that can analyse digital scans of eyes, and thus help doctors
     diagnose sight-destroying diseases in time for them to be treated. This is a complex problem for
     pattern recognition.

     Google needs large quantities of retinal scans to test the algorithm. Moorfields Eye Hospital in
     London has the largest collection of retinal scans in the world, and will share them with Google for
     free. The scans will be anonymized. Patients can opt out of sharing their data by emailing an NHS
     data protection officer. Google will use the knowledge gained from this project to help create future
     software that can eventually be marketed to health care providers.

     For this project, Google needs to pay attention to the needs and concerns of multiple stakeholders,
     including patients, doctors and the NHS. Google plans to hold four patient forums a year and set
     up a panel of independent reviewers to oversee what the company is doing. Ultimately, Google
     hopes to make a profit from this technology.

		(ii)             Identify two characteristics of pattern recognition.                                      [2]

		         (iii)   During the development of the algorithm, Google may use a data flow diagram.

                   Define data flow diagram.                                                                 [2]

     (b)   Google has chosen to use a neural network for this project, rather than an expert
           system.

		         Distinguish between an expert system and neural network.                                          [6]

     (c)   It is claimed that the NHS’s partnership with Google is beneficial for both stakeholders.
           However, concerns have been raised about the ethical implications of this data sharing
           agreement.

           To what extent is it ethical for the NHS to share patient information about eye scans
           from Moorfields Eye Hospital with Google?                                                         [8]

6.   Exoskeletons1 for workers

     Many jobs in modern manufacturing still require human workers, and many of these jobs involve
     lifting and carrying heavy loads. Some jobs require workers to maintain unnatural positions for a
     long period of time or hold tools for many hours. Workers doing these jobs are exposed to possible
     injuries, resulting in sick days or even a shortened work life. The European Union’s Robo-Mate
     project is an attempt to address these problems (see Figure 2).

     Robo-Mate is a lightweight, powered exoskeleton that uses motors and sensors to enable workers
     to bear only a small part of the weight of any load they are carrying.

     Robo-Mate has three supporting modules: one for the arms to help with lifting, one for the torso2 to
     support the back and spine, and one for the legs to support the inner thigh so lifting is easier.

                                                                         Torso module

      In addition to preventing injuries, exoskeletons can collect data about the worker’s location,
      vital signs and neural signals, as well as other information relating to the user. Overall, Robo-Mate
      should make workers’ jobs easier and faster. The ultimate goal is to make Robo-Mate available for
      sale to European industries for them to purchase for their workers.

      (a)   (i)   Identify two reasons why the Robo-Mate requires sensors.                              [2]

		(ii)            Identify two characteristics of a prototype.                                          [2]

		(iii)           Identify two key stakeholders involved in this project.                               [2]

      (b)   The researchers involved in the Robo-Mate project decided to use a Pert chart instead
            of a Gantt chart to guide the project.

            Explain why the researchers used a Pert chart instead of a Gantt chart to guide the
            project.                                                                                    [6]

      (c)   Other than for the prevention of injuries, discuss the impacts for workers and employers
            of the use of exoskeletons in the workplace.                                                [8]
