The stimulus material below is based on a research article that addresses participants’ motivation to
participate in “extreme sports”.

        Extreme sports are physical activities that are dangerous and may result in serious injury
        or even death. Researchers are interested in why people would be willing to participate in
        activities that are dangerous, although at this stage there is not yet much qualitative research in
        this area.

    5   The aim of this qualitative study was to explore motivations for taking part in sky diving or
        mountaineering (mountain climbing).

        Five males and three females who practise sky diving or mountaineering were recruited for the
        study. An ethics committee approved the research and all participants signed informed consent
        before the study. They were also asked to choose another name, which would be used to refer
   10   to them in the final report.

        A semi-structured interview was carried out with each participant. Each interview lasted an hour
        and took place in locations that each participant chose. The interviews were audio-recorded
        and then transcribed verbatim before conducting an inductive content analysis (thematic
        analysis).

   15   The inductive content analysis of the transcripts showed the following themes related to
        motivation:
        • the challenge of pushing themselves beyond their existing mental and physical limits
        • striving for achievement and mastery of their sport
        • the feeling of getting better at their sport worked as a reward for the participants
   20   • the feeling of “being in the present” and clearing all other thoughts from their mind
        • experiencing pleasurable feelings such as excitement or “adrenaline rush”
        • accepting suffering and physical injury as part of the experience of doing extreme sports.

        The researchers concluded that the participants’ own explanations suggest that pushing one’s
        limits and striving for achievement are major motivational factors that outweigh the possible
   25   risks involved in taking part in extreme sports.

Answer all of the following three questions, referring to the stimulus material in your answers. Marks will
be awarded for demonstration of knowledge and understanding of qualitative research methodology.

1.   Explain two or more ethical considerations relevant to this study.                                [10]


2.   Discuss the use of semi-structured interview in this study.                                       [10]


3.   Describe how researchers in this study could use inductive content analysis (thematic
     analysis) on the interview transcripts.                                                           [10]
