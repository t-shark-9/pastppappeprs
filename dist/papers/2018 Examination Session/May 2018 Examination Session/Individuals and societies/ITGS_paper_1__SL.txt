Answer two questions. Each question is worth [20 marks].

1.   IT support for staff laptop computers at RZX

     The role of the IT department at RZX is to provide IT support to the staff at the head office.
     As many of the employees spend a considerable amount of time travelling between the various
     RZX offices, they are given a laptop computer. This laptop needs to be maintained once a year, so
     each employee must hand in their laptop before they go on vacation so that this can be done. The
     IT team will carry out the maintenance and have it ready for the employee when they return from
     their vacation.

     Employees at RZX are expected to store their files in the cloud. However some employees have
     saved many files on their laptops, and RZX has informed them that they are responsible for
     keeping secure backups of this information.

     During maintenance, hard disk drives are cleaned, defragmented or reformatted and the random
     access memory (RAM) is increased. A new version of the operating system may be installed and
     other software programs will be added, re-installed or upgraded to a newer version.

     (a)   (i)   Identify two functions of an operating system.                                       [2]

		(ii)           Identify two characteristics of random access memory (RAM).                          [2]

		(iii)          Identify two devices that could be used to store a backup of the files that
                 employees have saved on their laptops.                                               [2]

     (b)   Analyse the advantages and disadvantages of using cloud-based storage for an RZX
           employee’s work files.                                                                     [6]

     (c)   The disposal of old IT equipment is becoming a problem. RZX is considering two
           options:
           • donating the equipment to a charitable organization
           • sending the equipment to a recycling service.

           Evaluate the implications of these two options.                                            [8]




                                                                                                Turn over

2.   Medical centre budgets

     Dr Schultz is the head doctor and manager at the Okavango Medical Center, Botswana.
     This medical centre is located eight hours away from the capital city, Gaborone. The medical
     centre is able to cope with routine cases, but when the doctors at the centre encounter an unusual
     case they have to communicate with specialists at the main hospital in Gaborone using either a
     telephone or voice over internet protocol (VOIP).

     Currently the Okavango Medical Center does not have any medical equipment connected to the
     IT systems at the hospital in Gaborone in real time. When there are unexpected changes in a
     patient’s condition, this makes it hard to give the necessary information to specialists in Gaborone.
     Because of this, at times Dr Schultz has to ask a specialist doctor from Gaborone to come to
     Okavango Medical Center to carry out treatment.

     The area is becoming popular with tourists, and Dr Schultz is concerned that the doctors and
     nurses at Okavango Medical Center will be unable to treat the increasing number of patients.
     He believes Okavango Medical Center needs better equipment in order to improve patient care.

     Dr Schultz created a spreadsheet of the treatments carried out by the centre over a week.
     A small part of the spreadsheet is shown below in Figure 1.

(Question 2 continued)

     (a)   (i)    Identify two characteristics of voice over internet protocol (VOIP).                    [2]

		         (ii)   Identify the steps that Dr Schultz must follow to list only the surgeries carried out
                  by Dr Tirbau using the spreadsheet software.                                            [2]

		(iii)           Identify two reasons why Dr Schultz would use a spreadsheet instead of a
                  database for record keeping.                                                            [2]

     (b)   Dr Schultz has arranged to speak to the local authorities in an attempt to get more
           funding for the medical centre. He intends to use presentation software to create
           a slideshow to support this speech. Dr Schultz is aware that many people in the
           audience are annoyed when slideshows are poorly designed.

           Explain three design errors Dr Schultz should avoid when creating his slideshow for
           the local authorities.                                                                         [6]

     (c)   The Okavango Medical Center has received additional funding from the local
           authority. The centre is investigating the possibility of using these funds to purchase
           IT equipment that would allow surgeons in Gaborone to carry out surgery remotely.

           Evaluate the impact of the purchase of this IT equipment on the medical centre and
           its patients.                                                                                  [8]

3.   Digital currency

     Bitcoin is a type of digital currency (cryptocurrency). This is money that can be sent via the internet
     and exchanged for goods, services or money in different currencies. Users can buy Bitcoins using
     real money, and then Bitcoins can either be spent or stored in a digital wallet for later use.
     Bitcoins can be used in every country, and sending Bitcoins is as simple as sending an email.

     The Bitcoin wallet is an application that can be installed on a computer or mobile device. Once a
     Bitcoin wallet is installed, the user will get a Bitcoin address to use when transferring Bitcoins to
     and from the wallet. This transfer uses private and public key encryption. Users should have a
     strong password to access their Bitcoin wallet.

     Bitcoin operates on a peer-to-peer (P2P) network and users of Bitcoins are identified by their
     Bitcoin address. Some users of Bitcoins wish to remain anonymous, but this is not
     always possible.

                                 [Source: © International Baccalaureate Organization 2018]

     (a)   (i)     Identify two characteristics of a peer-to-peer (P2P) network.                         [2]

		(ii)             Identify two characteristics of a strong password.                                    [2]

		         (iii)   The use of a password is one method of authentication.

                   Identify two other methods of authentication.                                         [2]

     (b)   (i)     Explain one reason why Bitcoin makes use of private key and public key
                   encryption.                                                                           [2]

		(ii)             Explain one reason why it may be difficult to ensure the security of information in
                   a large peer-to-peer network such as Bitcoin.                                         [2]

		         (iii)   Some users of Bitcoins are concerned that their anonymity may be compromised
                   by their Bitcoin address.

                   Explain one way the Bitcoin address may be used to reveal information about a
                   Bitcoin user.                                                                         [2]

     (c)   Bitcoin is a form of digital currency. Bitcoin transactions are made between individuals
           without the knowledge of banks, governments or credit card companies. Some
           governments are investigating whether they should regulate digital transactions, such
           as those made using Bitcoins.

           To what extent is it appropriate for governments to regulate digital transactions, such as
           those made using Bitcoins?                                                                    [8]

4.   Implementation of a new information system

     Savoree is a company located in Quito, Ecuador, that prepares desserts for schools and offices.
     The business has grown, and it now has a commercial kitchen where all the desserts are
     produced.

     Savoree needs a new information system to keep track of its business, and has hired TecniCo to
     design this new system. TecniCo needs to understand how the business works so it can propose
     an adequate IT solution.

                               [Source: © International Baccalaureate Organization 2018]



     (a)   (i)   Identify four ways that TecniCo could gather data about the present situation.        [4]

		(ii)           TecniCo will provide a list of requirements for the solution proposed.

                 Identify two categories of information that should be included in the requirements
                 specification provided by TecniCo.                                                    [2]

     (b)   The managers at TecniCo need to decide whether to use open source or proprietary
           software to develop the new information system for Savoree.

           Analyse these two options.                                                                  [6]

     (c)   Savoree is looking to expand its business. To make this possible, Savoree is
           considering whether to open an online shop. Customers will be able to see products
           and make online purchases.

           Discuss whether Savoree should provide an online shop as a way to expand its
           business.                                                                                   [8]
