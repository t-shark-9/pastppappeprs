Answer one question from this section.

Microeconomics

1.   (a)   With reference to the concept of excess demand, explain how a decrease in supply of
           a good would lead to a new market equilibrium.                                        [10]

     (b)   A government decides to impose an indirect tax on unhealthy drinks. Discuss the
           consequences for the stakeholders in these markets.                                   [15]


2.   (a)   Explain two factors that might give rise to economies of scale for a firm.            [10]

     (b)   Discuss the view that legislation is the best way of dealing with the problem of
           monopoly power.                                                                       [15]

Answer one question from this section.

Macroeconomics

3.   (a)   Explain the possible impact of an increase in wealth and consumer confidence on
           aggregate demand.                                                                       [10]

     (b)   Examine why, in contrast to the monetarist/new classical model, the economy will not
           automatically return to the full employment level of output in the Keynesian model.     [15]


4.   (a)   Explain how expansionary fiscal policy could be used to close a deflationary
           (recessionary) gap.                                                                     [10]

     (b)   Evaluate the view that fiscal policy is the most effective way of achieving long-term
           economic growth.                                                                        [15]
