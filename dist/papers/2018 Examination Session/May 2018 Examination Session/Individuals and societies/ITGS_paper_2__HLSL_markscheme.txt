Using assessment criteria for external assessment

For external assessment, a number of assessment criteria have been identified. Each assessment
criterion has level descriptors describing specific levels of achievement, together with an appropriate
range of marks. The level descriptors concentrate on positive achievement, although for the lower levels
failure to achieve may be included in the description.

Examiners must judge the externally assessed work at SL and at HL against the four criteria (A–D) using
the level descriptors.

• The same assessment criteria are provided for SL and HL.

• The aim is to find, for each criterion, the descriptor that conveys most accurately the level attained by
   the candidate, using the best-fit model. A best-fit approach means that compensation should be
   made when a piece of work matches different aspects of a criterion at different levels. The mark
   awarded should be one that most fairly reflects the balance of achievement against the criterion. It is
   not necessary for every single aspect of a level descriptor to be met for that mark to be awarded.

• When assessing a candidate’s work, examiners should read the level descriptors for each criterion
   until they reach a descriptor that most appropriately describes the level of the work being assessed.
   If a piece of work seems to fall between two descriptors, both descriptors should be read again and
   the one that more appropriately describes the candidate’s work should be chosen.

• Where there are two or more marks available within a level, examiners should award the upper marks
   if the candidate’s work demonstrates the qualities described to a great extent. Examiners should
   award the lower marks if the candidate’s work demonstrates the qualities described to a lesser extent.

• Only whole numbers should be recorded; partial marks, that is fractions and decimals, are not
   acceptable.

• Examiners should not think in terms of a pass or fail boundary, but should concentrate on identifying
   the appropriate descriptor for each assessment criterion.

• The highest level descriptors do not imply faultless performance but should be achievable by
   a candidate. Examiners should not hesitate to use the extremes if they are appropriate descriptions
   of the work being assessed.

• A candidate who attains a high level of achievement in relation to one criterion will not necessarily
   attain high levels of achievement in relation to the other criteria. Similarly, a candidate who attains a
   low level of achievement for one criterion will not necessarily attain low achievement levels for the
   other criteria. Examiners should not assume that the overall assessment of the candidates will
   produce any particular distribution of marks.

• The assessment criteria must be made available to candidates prior to sitting the examination.

1.   (a)   Describe one social/ethical concern related to the IT system in the article.

           Social/ethical concerns may include the following:

           Privacy of the user – who has access to the data (time or sessions online and
           apps used) …
           • stored on the user’s device
           • sent to other members of the family group
           • stored by the company
           • supplied to third parties
           • viewed by other members of the family without permission.

           Note: the definition of privacy may be implicit, for example, invasion of privacy
           occurs if data accessed/used without consent.

           Security of the data stored on the mobile device
           • if the device is stolen or hacked the data might be accessed by unauthorized
             parties.

           Security of the data sent to/stored by the company
           • the transmission of data to the company may be insecure/intercepted by others
           • data stored by the company may be insecure/at risk of unauthorized access.

           Surveillance
           • app can be used to monitor the actions of people, can be misused and cause
             embarrassment (psychological, social, work, family, physical health issues).

           Policies
           • employees of the company may misuse the data if there are no policies
             governing use by the employees about stored data.

           People and machines (addiction)
           • excessive time spent causing psychological and physical health consequences.

(b)       Describe the relationship of one primary stakeholder to the IT system in the
          article.

          Primary stakeholders may include the following:
          • the user (teenager/person) using the app to record their device usage time and
             access to other apps
          • the other members of the family group who have access to the user’s data
          • the company (including employees of the company), that produces the app and
             stores the data
          • third parties to whom the stored data may be sold/supplied
          • family members who use the application to change/alter another members
             use/access of the phone
          • user spending excessive or detrimental amount of time on social media.

2.   (a)   Describe, step-by-step, how the IT system works.
           IT system: Collecting, transmitting and storing information from a mobile device.

           Answers provided in the article include the following:
           • the app collects information from the device’s system and sensors in order to
             determine when and how it is being used
           • the app collects information about what other apps a person uses
           • the information collected by the app is stored on the device
           • the information collected by the app is shared with all members of the family
           • the information collected by the app is sent to Moment and stored by the
             company
           • other information about the device and the user are also sent to the company.
             This includes information the user entered when they first installed the
             Moment Family app
           • users/family members provide information when the app is installed - signing
             up is a development, and the details of the information provided as well
           • references to the content of the screen shot:
            o displayed on the “lock” screen (sharing information with the user) the bar
               chart represented on diagram show number of interactions with the device
               in the day/24-hour period
            o the screen does displays start time for the lock, a timer until the unlock
               comes off and instructions for the user - these are not mentioned in the
               mark scheme
           • mobile device: no details of the IT system provided in the article
           • can be used on mobile devices - computer, tablets, phones or other electronic
             devices.


           Answers with additional information to that in the article may include the following:

           Collecting the data
           • sensors used to gather information might include the accelerometers,
             microphone, camera, etc
           • system might include information about which apps are running, battery level
             indication (faster drain on the battery indicating that the device might be in
             use), whether the screen is unlocked, etc
           • the app calculates the time the user spends using the device. This is
             incremented each time the device is used in order to obtain a running total
           • the user can enter a daily time limit. Each day the app continually subtracts
             the cumulative amount of daily screen time from this limit and once the
             difference is zero the user is alerted.

           Sharing the data
           Note: how data is shared is not stated in the article so this opens up the question
           for many interpretations, eg. real-time, via a website, via a text message, alerts,
           etc - the list goes on. All realistic options should be accepted. Also, output to the
           user is not specified and is presumably on the screen so developments for output
           need to be accepted.
           • users must authenticate themselves to connect to WiFi/mobile (eg 3G, 4G,
              etc) network
           • data is shared between family members and Moment via WiFi/mobile
              connection to the internet

• other device data might include the IP address of the device, location of the
  device, the unique device identification number (IMEI, etc), the device MAC
  address
• other user data entered when they first installed the app might include their
  name, email address and gender
• logon name and password for app sign in
• data may be encrypted while transmitting.

Storing the data
• data is stored on the device in files/a database created by the app when it is
  installed
• shared data is stored on Moment’s servers and/or in the cloud
• data is stored in a database
• the devices of other members of the family group can query the database to
  retrieve data relating to the activities of all members of the group
• data may be encrypted while storage on device/ moment’s servers.

App setup
• download, a step before the installation mentioned in the article
• sign-up self and family
• enter personal and family data - must include data that links the family
  members - could be phone numbers, email addresses, social media account
  membership, moment membership user ID, etc
• configure app, give permissions/consent to app to use location/microphone,
  camera, contacts and other apps and run in the background.

Data Processing
• possibly beyond scope of collect, transmit and store - but candidates who
  describe processing of user operation against pre-set rules = ITTT rules.

Mobile Device
• as no details are provided in the article all technical descriptions are
  developments.

(b)   Explain the relationship between the IT system and the social/ethical concern
      described in Criterion A.

      Relationship of the IT system to privacy issues:

      Sharing data with family members
      • HOW - other family members can see when and for how long the user is
        accessing their device and which apps they are opening via the user interface
        of the Moment Family app. WHY - family member may not have given
        permission for sharing and/or altering the access to the apps.

      Sharing the data with Moment
      • HOW - the data sent to Moment. This data would potentially allow the
        approximate location of the user to be determined at any time if the data was
        intercepted during transmission to the company. WHY - no restrictions on the
        use by Moment, no encryption on the data transmitted.

      Relationship of the IT system to security issues:

      Storing the data on the mobile device
      • HOW - data stored on the device may be vulnerable to unauthorized access if
        the device is stolen or from malicious apps that the user might install. WHY -
        the application has access to the whole system, phone may not have a
        security setup or prevent use if stolen or lost.

      Storing the data on Moment’s servers/cloud
      • HOW - unauthorized access to the database may compromise the security of
        the stored data. WHY - lack of policies at Moment, lack of supervision at
        Moment, lack of security at Moment e.g. firewall, patches, virus checkers,
        levels of access, lack of encryption.

      Relationship of the IT system to surveillance issues
      • HOW - App monitors the use of IT system, creating a surveillance scenario
        which can be used/misused by people who can track. WHY - lack of security
        built into the app, no hierarchy/levels of access to data, all members of the
        family allowed to access the data,

      People and machines (addiction)
      • HOW - Addiction/overuse to the device or applications/systems on the device
        such as social media. HOW - App allows the user/family to limit access to
        media. WHY - addiction has psychological, relationship and potential physical
        effects.

      Candidates are expected to make reference to the relevant stakeholders,
      information technologies, data and processes. Candidates will be expected to
      refer to “how the IT system works” using appropriate IT terminology.

Criterion C — The impact of the social/ethical issue(s) on stakeholders                             [8]

3.   Evaluate the impact of the social/ethical issues on the relevant stakeholders.

     Positive impacts may include:

     For the user(s)
     • use of the app may encourage users to be more aware of or reduce the time spent
       using their own devices
     • making other family members aware of the time spent/apps used may result in users
       making more conscious choices about how they use their devices through peer
       pressure.

     For other family members
     • family members may be able to monitor the use of devices at inappropriate times
       (eg when children are supposed to be asleep/at meal times/doing homework, etc)
     • enforcing limits may encourage greater social interaction between family members.

     For the company and/or third parties
     • data gathered would be a source of commercially valuable information
     • data could be used to improve the app, and develop more features or other apps
     • profit from selling the app.
     Use of mobile device
     • there are many benefits from using mobile devices and all are acceptable, but the
       benefits need to be described with some details.

     Negative impacts may include:

     For the user(s)
     • sharing time and app usage data with other family members might result in those
       members making assumptions about what the user is doing with their device or asking
       awkward/prying questions about the user’s activities
     • the setting of limits by the user or other members of the family might be inconvenient.
       There may be times when the user needs to use the phone for longer than the limits
       allow, or at times “prohibited” by family settings
     • the interception of user data while in transmission over the internet to the company
       might expose the user to threats by malicious parties (eg determining location via IP
       address, collecting email addresses, building a profile of the user for subsequent
       criminal activities
     • sharing data with the company potentially exposes the user to negative impacts
       (eg targeted ads based on app use and/or location sent by email, the potential for the
       company to construct a detailed profile of the user, etc)
     • if the device or the company database is hacked/accessed by unauthorized people,
       the detail contained in the data could lead to the user becoming a target for criminal
       behavior (eg constructing a pattern of movements of the user, using age and gender
       information to select victims for attack or “grooming”, sending phishing emails or
       threats, etc)
     • the sharing of users’ data with third parties exposes the user to greater potential risks.
       The user has no control over whom the data is shared with and what subsequent use is
       made of that data
     • the data sent to Moment includes information about the user and the apps. This could
       include sensitive information eg from apps related to health, diet, finances, etc.

• there are also trust issues. How would you feel if you felt that your every move was
  being monitored by your parents? This is a very tricky issue and a potential hornets
  nest for parents. How much can you trust what your children are doing?
• Psychological, health, relationship, business, work and social problems arising from the
  overuse of mobile devices.

For the company
• misuse or unauthorized exposure of user’s data might make the company legally
  liable/open to prosecution.

Criterion D — A solution to a problem arising from the article                                     [8]

4.   Evaluate one possible solution that addresses at least one problem identified in
     Criterion C.

     Answers may include the following:

     Solutions to the problem of sharing time and app usage data with other family
     members
     • give the user the option to exclude specific apps from the data gathering. This would
       not impact the data gathered about the overall time spent using the device but if certain
       apps were sensitive in nature or considered private by the user they could be excluded
       from the list of accessed apps shared with family members/the company

     Solutions to the problem of the setting of limits by the user or other members of the
     family
     • allow the user the option to over-ride limits in case of particular need or emergency
     • adding extra technical features to the app to solve the problems, e.g. hierarchy of
       levels of access to data and the app features e.g. controlling what can be shared and
       who.

     Solutions to the problem of the interception of user data while in transmission
     • transmit all data using a secure protocol (eg encrypted using https, secure sockets
       layer (SSL) or transport layer security (TLS).

     Solutions to the problem of sharing data with the company
     • company policies must detail and limit exactly what the data can be used for.
       User should have the option to opt-out of specific uses of the data.

     Solutions to the problem of the device or the company database being
     hacked/accessed by unauthorized people
     • store the data in encrypted form using an encryption or hashing algorithm such as
       Secure Hash Algorithm (SHA), Advanced Encryption Standard (AES), Blowfish,
       Twofish, etc.

     Solutions to the problem of the sharing of users’ data with third parties
     • policy solution: allow users to opt-out of data sharing with third parties and/or control
       what data is shared
     • anonymize the data by removing names, email addresses, IP addresses, etc before the
       data is shared.

     Solutions to the problem of the company being legally liable/open to prosecution
     • add a clear legal disclaimer to the user agreement policy that the user must accept
       before installing/running the app.

Solutions to addiction/overuse
• the purchase of the Moment Family app is a valid response
• medical treatment for the addiction/overuse
• family policies to curb use
• using features of routers to control internet usage (time, sites, duration), using parent
  settings, using content filters, connecting to filtered internet service providers,
• removal of phone from the member of the family
• negotiation with parents
• schools have policies and discussions with students and community
• Internet addiction boot camps.
