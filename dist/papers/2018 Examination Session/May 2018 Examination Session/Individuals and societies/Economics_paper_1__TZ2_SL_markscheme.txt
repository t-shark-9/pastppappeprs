1.         (a) Explain how the price elasticity of demand for a good might be affected by the
           number and closeness of substitutes.                                                 [10]

           Answers may include:
                 definitions of price elasticity of demand and substitutes
                 diagram of goods with different price elasticities of demand.
                 explanation that the more close substitutes a good has the more
                    price elastic its demand tends to be
                 examples of how the number of substitutes a good has affects its
                    price elasticity of demand.

           (b) Examine the significance of price elasticity of demand for the decision making of
           firms and government.                                                                 [15]

Answers may include:
                 definition of price elasticity of demand (PED)
                 diagram to show how total revenue/tax revenue changes when
                    price/tax changes
                 explanation that a change in price will lead to a fall/rise in total
                    revenue/tax revenue depending on the value of PED
                 examples of goods where a change in price does lead to a rise/fall
                    in total revenue/tax revenue
                 synthesis or evaluation (examine the significance).

           Examination may include: situations where a change in price would not lead to a
           rise/fall in total revenue/tax revenue, different price elasticities, other factors
           affecting demand that cause a change in total revenue/tax revenue, the impact of
           time on PED when price changes. Responses which consider the significance of
           PED for firms or government only (not both) should not be rewarded above Level 2

           Examiners should be aware that candidates may take a different approach which,
           if appropriate, should be rewarded.

           Opinions or conclusions should be presented clearly and should be supported by
           appropriate examples.

(b) Evaluate whether the use of carbon taxes is the most effective way for the
government to deal with the threat to sustainability posed by the use of fossil fuels. [15]

Answers may include:
      definitions of carbon taxes, sustainability, negative externalities
      diagrams to show the effect of carbon taxes on the market for fossil fuels
         and how market failure is eliminated
      explanation of how carbon taxes will increase costs of production and
         increase the price of fossil fuels, leading to a decrease in their
         consumption
      examples of government responses to the threat to sustainability arising
         from the use of fossil fuels
      synthesis or evaluation.

Evaluation may include: the limitations of using carbon taxes, such as identifying the
size of the externality and estimating the impact on demand, the difficulty of
identifying which firms are liable to the tax, the fact that taxes do not stop the use of
fossil fuels but only discourage it; alternative methods, such as legislation and “cap
and trade”; references to subsidies / investment in alternative energy sources.

Examiners should be aware that candidates may take a different approach which,
if appropriate, should be rewarded.

Opinions or conclusions should be presented clearly and should be supported by
appropriate examples.

                    resources and subsequently an increase in productivity and/or how

(b) Discuss the possible consequences of economic growth on living standards,
unemployment and inflation.                                                             [15]

Answers may include:
      definitions of economic growth, living standards, unemployment and
         inflation
      diagrams might include AD/LRAS showing an increase in AD or LRAS
         and impact on real GDP/living standards and inflation and/or labour
         market diagram showing an increase in AD, and accept ADL
      explain how an increase in economic growth potentially raises living
         standards and decreases unemployment due to an increase in real
         output. Incomes are raised and due to the increase in demand for goods
         and services more workers are employed.
         In addition, the impact on inflation could be positive or negative depending
         on the cause of the economic growth
      examples of countries that have experienced economic growth and the
         subsequent effect on living standards, unemployment and inflation
      synthesis or evaluation (discuss).

Discussion may include: the impact on different stakeholders. Workers may benefit
due to there being more jobs available but consumers may not benefit because of
the increase in prices. Or living standards may not increase equitably. In addition,
the discussion may focus on the cause of the economic growth. If it is caused by an
increase in AD then it is more likely to lead to inflationary pressure than if it was
caused by an increase in LRAS. However, in the Keynesian range of the LRAS
curve any increase in AD may not necessarily lead to an increase in inflation.

Examiners should be aware that candidates may take a different approach which,
if appropriate, should be rewarded.

Opinions or conclusions should be presented clearly and should be supported by
appropriate examples.

4.         (a) Explain how expansionary fiscal policy could be used to close a deflationary
           (recessionary) gap.                                                                 [10]

           Answers may include:
                 definitions of fiscal policy, expansionary fiscal policy, deflationary
                    (recessionary) gap
                 diagram to show the potential effects of expansionary fiscal policy in
                    terms of an outward shift of AD
                 explanation of how an expansionary fiscal policy will boost aggregate
                    demand and increase output, thereby closing a deflationary gap
                 examples of countries that have used expansionary fiscal policy.

(b) Evaluate the view that fiscal policy is the most effective way of achieving long-
term economic growth.                                                                   [15]

Answers may include:
      definition of long-term economic growth, short-term economic growth,
         fiscal policy
      diagram to show an outward shift in the PPC or a rightward shift of LRAS
      explanation of how fiscal policy leads to long-term economic growth
         indirectly by creating an economic environment that is favourable to
         private investment, and directly through government spending on physical
         capital goods and human capital formation, as well as provision of
         incentives for firms to invest
      examples of fiscal policy that has led to long-term economic growth
      synthesis or evaluation.


Evaluation may include: the type of fiscal policy and how it is financed, advantages
and disadvantages of fiscal policy, consideration of alternative policies, such as
monetary and supply-side policies, consideration of ‘best.’


NB Candidates who only consider the effects of fiscal policy on AD, and do not
consider the supply side effects on long-term economic growth cannot be awarded
above Level 2
Examiners should be aware that candidates may take a different approach which,
if appropriate, should be rewarded.

Opinions or conclusions should be presented clearly and should be supported by
appropriate examples.
