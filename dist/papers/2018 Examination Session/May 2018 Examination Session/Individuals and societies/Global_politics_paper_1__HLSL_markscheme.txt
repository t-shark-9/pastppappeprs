Unit 3     Development

Bulleted lists in this markscheme indicate likely points that candidates may include in their answer: they
are not exhaustive, and examiners should credit other valid points not listed.

              Institutional factors that may promote or inhibit development

1.   Using Source A, identify three weaknesses of the Millennium Development Goals.                      [3]

     Answers may include:
     • health was not considered fully and that issues like mental health were excluded.
     • human rights were not monitored
     • implementation was weak
     • accountability was weak.

     Award [1] for each relevant point up to a maximum of [3].
                                                  –6–                 M18/3/GLPOL/BP1/ENG/TZ0/XX/M


2.   With explicit reference to Source B and to one example you have studied explain how
     development can be encouraged.                                                                     [4]

     Answers may include, but are not limited to:
     • Reference can be made to recent work by the IMF to assist with development including
       increasing resources, promoting investment in infrastructure and focusing on inclusive growth
     • The argument can be made that cooperation between institutions and states encourages
       development
     • Reference can be made to the IMF working and cooperating with other institutions, such as the
       OECD and the World Bank, to combat challenges (such as tax evasion) and therefore promote
       development
     • It can be noted that institutions such as the IMF facilitate development by publicly encouraging
       states to do more, for example in improving aid effectiveness by developing better
       infrastructure.

     Valid examples from own knowledge may include, but are not limited to:
     • Actions to facilitate development by different actors including international institutions, states,
       NGOs and local organisations can be included
     • Different approaches to development for example, sustainable, economic, socio-political or
       those linked to well-being can be drawn attention to
     • Various scales of activity or promotion, ie from UN sustainable development goals to small
       community projects can be used as examples
     • Answers can include the promotion and facilitation of development and make use of references
       to bottom up and top down processes.

     Other relevant points not listed can also be rewarded. Candidates are not expected to make four
     separate points in order to achieve full marks. For each valid point a maximum of [2] may be
     awarded, up to a total of [4]. If there is no reference to another example studied award a
     maximum of [3].
                                                  –7–                 M18/3/GLPOL/BP1/ENG/TZ0/XX/M


3.   Using Sources C and D contrast factors which inhibit development.                                   [8]

     Potential points of contrast:
     Progress in development
     • Development can be claimed in different ways and inaccuracy arguably holds back progress.
       Source C shows how measurements of development have been manipulated because the IPL
       remains a positive indicator. Source D shows how claims for gender awareness have been
       exaggerated.

     Criticisms of institutions
     • Source C is critical of institutions of world order and holds them accountable for statistical
        manipulation and misguided directions in development. Source C states that statistical
        manipulation based on structural adjustment hides a lack of progress and hinders development.
        Source C however cites the Asian Development bank as a progressive actor. Source D
        criticises governments which pledge commitment to gender equality, but do very little when it
        comes to implementation and commitment of resources. Source D also makes reference to
        both the UN and the World Bank, as well as (African) governments as bureaucracies which
        inhibit development.

     Implementation of development
     • Source C discusses the importance of top-down practices in development (UN, World Bank)
       and Source D explores the importance of bottom-up engagement (ie feminist activity).

     Gender gap
     • Source C says that development is inhibited by incorrect measurement tools (regardless of
       gender); Source D implies that progress in development is hampered by lack of engagement
       with women and gender. Source D states that gendered assumptions remain and that the
       rhetoric of “UN feminism” masks weak commitment and a bureaucratic approach to gender
       mainstreaming.

     Do not expect all of the points above, and allow other valid points. Award [2] per effective point of
     contrast up to a maximum of [8].

     If the view of only one source is discussed award a maximum of [4]. For a response which
     focuses significantly on one source with only minimal reference to the other source, award a
     maximum of [5]. For responses that discuss the sources separately, rather than in a running
     contrast, award a maximum [6].

4.   Using all the sources and your own knowledge discuss the complexity of achieving
     development.                                                                                     [10]

     Question 4 is assessed according to the markbands that follow, in conjunction with these marking
     notes.

     Issues derived from source material may include, but are not limited to:
     Approaches to development
     • Development needs are diverse and detailed. Needs may be complicated to assess due to
        differences in criteria (ie UN SDGs). Source B focuses on demographic challenges such as
        age. Source C focuses on macroeconomic approaches and promotes the dismantling of
        structural adjustment. In Source D, gender mainstreaming is promoted. Each of these
        approaches increase complexity due to the number of stakeholders and their interests.

     Importance of cooperation
     • Source A highlights the importance of cooperation which can be complex to coordinate and has
       not been achieved sufficiently in the past. Source C shows that coordination, if misdirected,
       may inadvertently worsen progress and that cooperation may be ineffective. International
       institutions such as the Asian Development Bank have challenged poverty-line criteria but this
       has been difficult to resolve. In contrast Source B celebrates the importance of international
       organisations, such as the IMF, World Bank and OECD working together to achieve
       development.

     Politics of institutions
     • Source C shows how institutions of the world order may be in a powerful or political position to
       determine development agendas to the extent of misrepresenting progress, it illustrates
       disagreement over the validity of the IPL by different institutions and implies that these issues
       are challenging to resolve. Source D shows how gender politics significantly shapes the
       responses of institutions.

     Bureaucracies and capacity
     • Source C shows how Institutions as bureaucracies can be slow to change or modify working
       assumptions (the example of superficial “UN feminism” or “gender mainstreaming” in Source D).
       In Source C development is further complicated by disagreement over the measurements that
       are used to define development and the broader challenge of critiquing structural adjustment
       policy. Implementation also needs to be addressed, therefore adding to the complexity of
       development as a phenomenon: Source A draws attention to the UN implementation framework
       and Source D refers to implementation by states.
                                            –9–                 M18/3/GLPOL/BP1/ENG/TZ0/XX/M


Own knowledge could include, but is not limited to:
• examples of complexity drawn from any developing country, highlighting any number of
  challenges which hamper or increase (competing) demands made in a development context
• institutional capacity and funding issues can be cited specific challenges such as migration (ie
  Southern Mediterranean) and conflict or environmental degradation (crop decline and water
  scarcity) can be included
• long term issues such as huge labour reserves (ie China) and low wages in a globalised
  economy can be included issues related to inequality and low levels of education and literacy
  are relevant (ie Western and Southern Africa)
• the more recent proliferation of more fragile states and their security challenges might be
  referenced since development and security agendas are increasingly dominated by western
  states.

Do not expect all of the above, and reward other relevant points and/or examples not listed.

If only source material or only own knowledge is used, the response can only be awarded a
maximum of [6].

To achieve the maximum [10], responses must refer to all four sources.
