Option A — Freshwater – issues and conflicts

1.   (a)   Outline two ways in which sediment is transported by a river.                      [2+2]

           In each case, award [1] for correctly identifying the term and [1] for including
           some specific detail of the process, eg may quantify the particle size (accept
           “large” or “small”), or use specialist vocabulary.

           For example:
            Saltation [1] is jumping/bouncing of small particles along the river bed [1].
            Traction [1] is heavier material dragged or rolled along the bed [1].

           Other possibilities include:
            solution
            suspension
            floatation.

     (b)   Using one named example of an international conflict related to freshwater,
           briefly explain:

           (i)   one cause of the conflict;                                                     [2]

                 Award [1] for identifying a named conflict and [1] for some specific
                 explanation of the cause.

                 For example: Sudan and Egypt had a conflict over the Nile river, as both
                 are in need of limited water supplies [1] to satisfy the demands of their
                 growing populations [1].

                 Other possible causes might be:
                  two countries both in need of limited water supplies
                  population/economic pressures
                  environmental/climate change
                  water security/boundary dispute
                  hydropower schemes along transboundary rivers
                  industrial pressures.
                                        –5–            M18/3/GEOGR/BP2/ENG/TZ0/XX/M


(ii)   two consequences of the conflict.                                             [2+2]

       Award [1] for each consequence identified and [1] for some further
       explanation or development.

       Possible consequences could include:
        treaties/international agreement [1] and gives further detail (which may
         include quotas and water allowances) [1]
        escalation of international conflict [1] and gives a detail, eg political
         repercussions [1]
        one country builds a dam to maximize its supply [1] and gives a detail,
         eg date of construction, or ecological/economic harm downstream, or
         navigation issues [1]
        a substitution strategy, eg desalinization [1] and gives a detail [1].

       For example: Sudan and Egypt’s conflict resulted in the Nile treaty [1],
       which set limits for water use by each country [1]. As a consequence of
       now having access to less water, the Egyptians have tried to use
       desalinization to meet their water needs [1]. This uses a process called
       reverse osmosis to remove salt and produce freshwater [1].

       Two separate consequences are needed; do not credit multiple problems
       associated with dam construction.
                                            –6–            M18/3/GEOGR/BP2/ENG/TZ0/XX/M


(c)   Examine how human activity influenced the severity of one named river
      flood event.                                                                     [10]

      Human factors that can increase flood severity include: deforestation and
      changing agricultural practices in the drainage basin, removal of wetlands,
      urbanization/increasing concrete surfaces/drainage ditches and changes to the
      channel flow.

      Human factors that can sometimes decrease severity include straightening,
      widening, building levees, etc.

      Physical factors may be highly relevant for some case studies.

      Good answers may examine how human activity can increase and/or decrease
      the risk of floods in complex ways (levees may reduce or increase flood risk).

      Another approach may be to examine how human activities along one stretch of
      river have impacts for other places on the river. Rapid emergency responses
      might also reduce the severity of the flood.

      At band D, expect a description of the ways in which human activity has caused
      the named flood event.

      At band E, expect either a more detailed explanation of a greater range of
      human activities or a structured examination of how human activity has
      influenced flood severity.

      At band F, expect both.

      Marks should be allocated according to the markbands.

2.   (a)   (i)    State the four elements of the hydrological cycle labelled A–D.                     [2]

                  Award [2] for all four correct answers, [1] for two or three correct answers.
                  A = evaporation
                  B = precipitation (accept rainfall)
                  C = infiltration (accept percolation)
                  D = groundwater flow (accept baseflow).

           (ii)   State two possible methods of artificially recharging the aquifer.                [1+1]

                  Award [1] for any of the following points, up to a maximum of [2]:
                   the creation of recharge basin lakes
                   controlled flooding/irrigation
                   water pumped down the bore hole
                   drainage diversion
                   other valid methods.

     (b)   Explain three possible ways people may modify a river channel to increase the
           flow of water.                                                                         [2+2+2]

           In each case, award [1] for correct identification of a method and [1] for a valid
           explanation of how it increases the flow of water (may make applied use of
           concepts such as wetted perimeter, hydraulic radius, channel efficiency).

           For example, straightening/shortening a river channel [1] increases the gradient
           and therefore the velocity [1].

           Other possibilities include:
            concreting the channel/decreasing the roughness
            widening/deepening/levees
            dredging.
                                            –8–            M18/3/GEOGR/BP2/ENG/TZ0/XX/M


(c)   To what extent has the management of one major wetland area been
      successful?                                                                         [10]

      Responses should clearly identify one major wetland. If more than one wetland
      is referred to, credit only the first.

      Major wetlands include, for example, the Kissimmee, the Everglades, Norfolk
      Broads.

      Responses should clearly outline the management with respect to why it was
      needed and its aims. There are numerous reasons why wetlands are managed:
      biodiversity issues, restoration of wetlands, ecotourism, natural flood defenses.
      Management can then be evaluated in terms of how successful it has been
      (or not).

      Good answers may discuss the extent to which different stakeholders have
      different perspectives on whether the strategy has been successful. Another
      approach might be to evaluate the extent to which all aims and objectives have
      been met (there may be spatial and temporal dimensions to this).

      At band D, responses should describe the management of a major named
      wetland, and may assert partial success/failure.

      At band E, there should be either greater explanation of the strengths and
      weaknesses of the management, or a critical evaluation of the extent of success.

      At band F, expect both.

      Marks should be allocated according to the markbands.

Option B — Oceans and their coastal margins

3.   (a)   (i)     Estimate the percentage of days when the wind blows from the north.                     [1]

                   15 % (accept 13–17 %).

           (ii)    Identify the direction of the most frequent wind.                                       [1]

                   ESE (accept SE).

           (iii)   State the direction towards which longshore drift is most likely to occur at X on
                   the diagram.                                                                            [1]

                   West/north west/west northwest.

           (iv)    State one landform likely to be produced by longshore drift at X.                       [1]

                   Spit.

     (b)   Explain three physical factors that affect the development of coral reefs.                  [2+2+2]

           Award [1] for each factor explaining the development (growth or decline) of coral
           and [1] for its development and/or exemplification.

           For example:
            Presence of polyps/zooxanthellae (soft animals) [1] which produce calcium
             carbonate to form the reefs [1].
            Sunlight for photosynthesis [1]; coral growth favoured in tropical oceans where
             sunlight is more intense [1].

           Other factors include:
            clear, shallow water
            optimal sea temperatures of 23–29°C
            acidity of water
            salinity of water
            where water is less saline
            natural hazards can destroy reef
            natural predators
            climate change.
                                            – 10 –          M18/3/GEOGR/BP2/ENG/TZ0/XX/M


(c)   “Coastal hazard management always creates more problems than it solves.”
      Discuss this statement, with reference to one or more areas of coastline.               [10]

      The question can be answered using any coastal hazard, including tsunamis, storm
      surges, coastal erosion and cliff failure. Answers should include a discussion of the
      conflicts involved with coastal hazard management. These may include access,
      decline of amenity value, cost, disruption of ecosystems, impact on fisheries, impact
      on transport or lack of management.

      For example, sea walls may be built to reduce the threat of tsunamis and storm
      surges but may interfere with natural ecosystems and shipping routes. Erosion may
      be managed using hard and soft engineering, but this may affect the aesthetics of
      an area and reduce its recreational/tourist impact. A “do nothing”/managed retreat
      may anger local residents land owners.

      In contrast, many people feel more secure as a result of attempts to manage
      coastal hazards, and do not see a conflict of interest.

      Good candidates may discuss different coastal hazards and stakeholders and cover
      both sides of the argument. Another approach may be to examine the scale of the
      hazard, eg a 50-year event may be planned for, but the scheme will not protect
      against an event of higher magnitude. Others may consider the possible impacts of
      climate change.

      At band D, expect a description of the hazard management of one or more areas of
      coastline.

      At band E, expect either a detailed explanation of the hazard management of one or
      more areas of coastline or a discussion of the problems created and resolved by
      hazard management.

      At band F, expect both.

      Marks should be allocated according to the markbands.

4.   (a)   Briefly outline the role of oceans as:

           (i)    a source of carbon dioxide;                                                    [2]

                  Award [1] for each of the following, up to a maximum of [2]:
                   oceans are a source of carbon dioxide, which can be transferred to
                    the atmosphere
                   carbon dioxide is released during submarine volcanic activity
                   carbon dioxide can be brought up from the ocean depths
                   respiration of marine organisms
                   other valid points.

                  Do not allow fossil fuels as a source.

           (ii)   a store of carbon dioxide.                                                     [2]

                  Award [1] for each of the following, up to a maximum of [2]:
                   the ocean is the major/largest store/sink of CO2
                   acts as a sink for some of the carbon dioxide that has passed through the
                    food chain; stored in sediments
                   credit other valid points about oceanic storage of carbon.

                  Do not allow fossil fuels as a store.

     (b)   (i)    Explain what is meant by the term “oceanic conveyor belt”.                     [2]

                  Award [1] for each of the following, up to a maximum of [2]
                   the oceanic conveyor belt (OCB), refers to part of the large-scale ocean
                    circulation
                   places/oceans/currents are linked by the OCB
                   cause or a pattern of the OCB, eg density gradients or the process of wind
                    driven surface currents.

      (ii)   Suggest two reasons why the oceanic conveyor belt is important.                   [2+2]

             Candidates may approach this question from the perspective of human
             importance and/or system importance.

             In each case, award [1] for identifying a valid reason and a further [1] for
             development or exemplification.

             Possibilities include:
              Moderation of climates [1], so the thermal growing season for agriculture is
               extended/tourist development [1].
              Important because it transfers global heat energy between latitudes [1]; if
               the circulation stopped it would cause significant climate change [1].
              The conveyer belt reduces temperature differences between oceans [1],
               therefore linking the oceans as a single global system [1].
              OCB brings nutrients to the surface [1], and this supports abundant marine
               life/fish [1].

(c)   Evaluate the success of one named conservation policy for sustainable fishing.            [10]

      Conservation policies, eg the EU’s Common Fisheries Policy (CFP), may refer to
      the total allowable catch, the harvesting of juvenile fish, limiting the number of
      vessels, checking of landings, limited access to fishing grounds.

      Sustainable fishing is the maximum number/weight/amount of fish that can be
      caught in any one year without depleting the stock/population. A sustainable fishing
      policy allows a depleted stock to recover its size.

      Good answers may evaluate critically what is meant by “successful” and the
      temporal and spatial scales this brings into consideration. Another approach might
      be to evaluate whether sustainable fish yields can cater for rising demand and
      changes in the distribution of fish.

      At band D, expect some description of an identified conservation policy in relation to
      sustainable fishing.

      At band E, expect either greater explanation of how an identified conservation policy
      tries to achieve sustainable fishing or a critical evaluation of the success of the
      policy.

      At band F, expect both.

Option C — Extreme environments

5.   (a)   (i)     State the earliest date on which there is a 50 % probability of snow depth
                   exceeding 1 metre.                                                                    [1]

                   July 15th [1]

           (ii)    Estimate the probability of snow depth exceeding 2 metres on
                   1 September.                                                                          [1]

                   27 % (accept 26–28 %) [1]

           (iii)   Briefly explain how the graph provides evidence that this ski field is located in
                   the southern hemisphere.                                                              [2]

                   Award [1] for evidence from the graph showing heaviest snow cover is in
                   August/September and [1] for explaining that this must be winter in the
                   southern hemisphere.

     (b)   Explain two environmental impacts of tourism in one named extreme
           environment.                                                                                [3+3]

           In each case, award [1] for each identified environmental impact linked to a tourist
           activity, and [2] for further development and explanation of how the physical
           environment is affected.

           Possibilities include erosion, mass movement, land degradation, vulnerability to
           hazards, water usage, waste disposal, disruption to biodiversity. Positive changes
           are possible, eg irrigation, restoration.

           For example: Erosion of land surface in high altitude areas by creating ski-field
           infrastructure (pistes, chair lifts, restaurants) [1]. This destroys the vegetation which
           helps stabilize the slopes [1], which can then contribute to soil
           erosion/avalanches/unsightly bare ground [1].

           Award up to a maximum of [3] for a generic account of tourism impacts with no
           reference to the specifics of a named extreme environment (either type or named
           region, eg Alps).
                                            – 14 –          M18/3/GEOGR/BP2/ENG/TZ0/XX/M


(c)   Compare the importance of water and wind in the development of landform features
      in hot, arid areas.                                                                    [10]

      In hot, arid areas, water action includes erosion and deposition by exotic, endoreic
      and ephemeral rivers. Flash floods can produce sheetwash. Features formed by
      river action include canyons, wadis, alluvial fans and bajadas. The role of water in
      weathering processes should also be credited.

      Wind action includes abrasion and deflation and landforms include dunes
      (barchans, seif, star, etc), deflation hollows, yardangs and zeugens.

      N.B.: Responses do not need to consider more than a few of these landforms for
      the award of full marks.

      Good answers might recognize that water and wind are equally important in forming
      features in hot, arid areas or may attempt to give credence to one over the other.
      Alternatively, a temporal element may be introduced with recognition of past pluvial
      periods or seasonal flash floods or a recognition that some landforms may be
      formed by a combination of both processes.

      At band D, expect some description of the development of both water- and wind-
      formed features.

      At band E, expect either a greater explanation of water- and wind-formed features in
      hot, arid areas or an attempt to compare the processes/features.

      At band F, expect both.

      Marks should be allocated according to the markbands.

6.   (a)   (i)    Briefly outline two human factors that are possible causes of desertification in
                  a hot, arid environment.                                                           [2]

                  Award [1] for a description of the following, up to [2]:
                   overgrazing
                   over-cultivation
                   deforestation
                   overpopulation
                   global warming
                   mismanagement of water resources.

           (ii)   Briefly outline two physical factors that influence the occurrence of flash
                  floods in hot, arid environments.                                                  [2]

                  Award [1] for a description of the following, up to [2]:
                   intensity of rainfall
                   rain exceeding infiltration
                   impermeable desert surface
                   lack of vegetation
                   other possible answers.

     (b)   Explain three reasons why there are concentrations of people in some parts of hot,
           arid areas.                                                                        [2+2+2]

           Award [1] for each valid reason, and [1] for development/exemplification.

           Possible reasons include:
            mineral deposits
            tourist attractions
            irrigation/oases
            accessible aquifers
            military installation.

           Accept other valid reasons.

           For example: In Niger, the presence of uranium [1] has led to the development of
           the town of Arlit / associated settlement and infrastructure [1].

           For example: Retirement resorts eg Palm Springs, have been built [1] which attract
           elderly/retired people who enjoy the hot, dry desert climate [1].
                                            – 16 –          M18/3/GEOGR/BP2/ENG/TZ0/XX/M


(c)   Examine the severity of the different challenges for resource development in
      periglacial areas.                                                                     [10]

      Resource development in periglacial areas is affected by the presence of
      permafrost. The challenges of coping with the constant thawing and melting require
      a range of measures in place in order to pursue resource development. Activities
      and techniques must be constantly monitored and modified in order to maintain
      infrastructure (transport, pipelines, bridges, airfields), buildings and settlement
      requirements. Other challenges might include relief, climate,
      accessibility/remoteness.

      There are economic and social challenges for the successful extraction of minerals,
      for scientific research and for ensuring the long-term viability of the nomadic
      lifestyles of indigenous people who rely on resources found in these areas.

      Good answers might examine explicitly the relative severity of a range of
      challenges. Another approach might be to examine different periglacial areas and
      the contexts and challenges they present, eg greater/more severe challenges in
      areas of discontinuous permafrost / areas with more active layer activity or climate
      change associated issues. They may also examine the extent to which some
      challenges may be overcome if the opportunities merit investment.

      At band D, expect description of some challenges for resource development in
      permafrost areas.

      At band E, expect either explanation of a range of challenges for resource
      development in periglacial areas, or a structured examination of the severity of
      these different challenges (may examine the degree to which they can be
      overcome).

      At band F, expect both.

      Marks should be allocated according to the markbands.

Option D — Hazards and disasters – risk assessment and response

7.   (a)   (i)     State the height in metres of the highest point north of the Oued Tensift
                   river.                                                                                 [1]

                   884 (metres) [1]

           (ii)    State the four-figure grid reference for this point.                                   [1]

                   2012 [1]

                   If an incorrect height is identified, but the GR is correct for that height, award
                   [1].

           (iii)   Briefly describe the distribution of fruit farming areas shown on the map.             [2]

                   Award [1] for any of the following points, up to a maximum of [2]:
                    mainly located in the west [1]
                    mainly close to Marrakech [1]
                    south of the Oued Tensift river [1]
                    located on lowland areas [1]
                    mainly below 500 metres [1].

     (b)   (i)     Explain two possible human impacts that could occur as a result of a
                   long-term drought in the area shown on the map.                                      [2+2]

                   Award [1] for each possible human impact, and [1] for explanation.

                   Relevant human impacts will reflect that the term “drought” implies a lack of
                   water, not high temperatures.

                   Possibilities in this area include:
                    irrigation systems are under strain [1] due to drying up of seasonal rivers/
                     decreased river flow [1]
                    decline in yield of food/income [1] leads to out-migration from affected
                     areas [1] to Marrakech
                    possible famine leading to increased death rates.

           (ii)    Suggest one short-term strategy that the local community could use to help
                   overcome the problem of drought in the area shown on the map.                          [2]

                   Award [1] for the strategy and a further [1] for development.

                   Possible strategies include:
                    reducing water consumption by people in Marrakech, lowering the demand
                     for water
                    adopting “dry farming” techniques, ensuring that crops are more resilient to
                     the impact of drought.

                   Do not credit long term infrastructure projects, eg reservoir construction.
                                            – 18 –          M18/3/GEOGR/BP2/ENG/TZ0/XX/M


(c)   Examine the reasons why people continue to live in areas affected by frequent
      earthquake or volcanic activity.                                                         [10]

      Allow answers that consider both earthquake and volcanic activity.

      Possible reasons might include:
       lack of knowledge/awareness of previous tectonic activity
       benefits of continuing to reside in the area outweigh possible impacts, for
        example fertile soils/tourism in volcanic areas
       lack of economic options: poverty/inertia/fatalism
       good preparation for possible impacts of hazard event, such as
        earthquake-resilient buildings
       planning and early-warning systems give sense of security
       insurance against damage caused by tectonic activity.

      Good answers may examine in a structured way how reasons may vary according
      to the type of geographical area (level of development; proximity to areas of tectonic
      activity); the frequency and magnitude of past events, and the decisions made by
      individuals and communities.

      For band D, expect some description of some reasons why people continue to live
      in areas prone to volcanic or earthquake activity.

      For band E, expect either a more detailed explanation of why people choose to
      remain in a particular area prone to earthquakes/volcanoes, or a structured
      examination of different kinds of hazards (eg at different levels of economic/social
      development).

      For band F, expect both.

      Marks should be allocated according to the markbands.
                                                  – 19 –          M18/3/GEOGR/BP2/ENG/TZ0/XX/M


8.   (a)   Outline two factors that can influence the vulnerability of a community to the
           impacts of a tectonic hazard event.                                                      [2+2]

           Award [1] for each factor and [1] for further development relating to vulnerability of
           a community to a tectonic hazard event.

           For example, a high degree of poverty [1] means that people cannot afford to build
           earthquake-resistant housing that does not collapse [1].

           Other possible factors include:
            lack of insurance
            elderly population
            a level of corruption
            time of day
            preparedness
            geographical location.

     (b)   Briefly explain the occurrence of either volcanoes or earthquakes at:

           (i)   constructive plate margins;                                                          [3]

                 Award up to [3] for any of the following points:
                 Volcanoes
                  are formed when two plates diverge as magma wells up to fill the gap [1]
                  example of constructive plate margin, such as mid-Atlantic Ridge [1]
                  usually begins as submarine volcano, but may later become island [1].
                 Earthquakes
                  are formed when two plates diverge as a result of friction and
                   movement [1]
                  the plate movement is explained, eg convection currents [1]
                  example of plate margin, such as mid-Atlantic Ridge [1].

                 Credit other valid points and/or the use of suitable annotated diagrams.

      (ii)   destructive plate margins.                                                         [3]

             Award up to [3] for any of the following points:
             Volcanoes
              explanation of two plates converging [1]
              one plate sinks / is subducted [1]
              are formed due to melting, producing magma [1]
              differences in plate density causing subduction, causing magma to rise [1]
              additional detail, eg explosive eruptions around the margins of the Pacific
               plate [1].

             Earthquakes
              explanation of two plates converging, eg convection currents [1]
              subduction of denser oceanic plate [1]
              are formed due to friction between the plates [1]
              further detail, eg deep-focus [1]
              additional locational detail, eg around the margins of the Pacific plate [1].

             Credit other valid points and/or the use of suitable annotated diagrams.

(c)   Examine the effectiveness of short- and long-term responses to one recent disaster
      caused by a hurricane (tropical cyclone/typhoon).                                        [10]

      Responses considered should be both short-term and long-term.

      Short-term responses might include search and rescue, providing essential medical
      care, emergency food and water supplies, combating the threat of disease,
      establishing essential communications and alerting outside relief agencies.

      Long-term responses continue for several months or years after the disaster, and
      might include rebuilding destroyed housing and infrastructure, re-establishing the
      local economy, undertaking protective measures and educating the local community
      in case of a future disaster, land-use zoning, establishing early-warning systems,
      planning evacuation routes.

      Good responses will examine a range of different types of response to a recent
      named hurricane disaster, and consider their effectiveness in different timescales.

      At band D, expect a descriptive account of different types of response to a hurricane
      disaster.

      At band E, expect either a more detailed account of a range of short- and long-term
      responses, or some explicit examination of their relative effectiveness.

      At band F, expect both.

      Marks should be allocated according to the markbands.

Option E — Leisure, Sport and Tourism

9.   (a)   (i)    Define the term tourism.                                                       [2]

                  Tourism involves travel away from home for at least one night [1] for the
                  purpose of leisure [1].

           (ii)   State two possible reasons why not all international arrivals can be
                  classified as tourists.                                                      [1+1]

                  Award [1] for any of the following, up to [2]:
                   transit / short-term passengers, not staying at least one night
                   refugees / asylum seekers
                   business people
                   long-term voluntary migrants (joining family/work reasons)
                   research scientists
                   returning residents.

     (b)   Explain two strategies designed to manage the environmental damage caused
           by tourism in one named large town or city.                                         [3+3]

           Award [1] for each strategy/problem/solution, and [2] for development of how it
           reduces/manages environmental damage.

           Possible strategies include:
            reduced vehicle emissions
            reduced noise pollution
            waste management
            control of effluent disposal into the sea.

           For example: Limiting the number of tourists is one way to reduce litter problems
           in Venice [1]. This has been done by limiting the number of hotel beds available
           [1] and restricting the number/capacity of visiting cruise ships [1].

           Award a maximum of [3] if there is no named town or city, or if the example is
           inappropriate, eg a rural location.
                                             – 22 –          M18/3/GEOGR/BP2/ENG/TZ0/XX/M


(c)   Discuss the view that the economic benefits of tourism in one country you have
      studied outweigh its negative social and environmental impacts.                     [10]

      Answers should consider a variety of economic benefits and social/environmental
      impacts of tourism in a specific country.

      Economic benefits might include improved employment opportunities, growth of
      local industry, improvements in infrastructure, increased GDP and incomes,
      increased standards of living.

      Negative social and environmental impacts might include increases in crime
      rates, increasing social inequality, increases in pollution and land degradation,
      excessive use of groundwater supplies.

      Good answers may provide a structured discussion of the different kinds of
      economic benefits and social/environmental costs of tourism in a particular
      country, and some evaluation of their relative importance.

      Award a maximum of band C if the answer refers to a city (eg Venice) rather than
      a country.

      At band D, expect some description of the economic benefits and
      social/environmental costs in a particular country.

      At band E, expect either a more detailed explanation of the benefits and costs of
      tourism or some discussion of their relative overall importance in a particular
      country.

      At band F, expect both.

      Marks should be allocated according to the markbands.

10.   (a)   With reference to the photograph, identify:

            (i)    one primary tourist attraction;                                                      [1]

                   Award [1] for any of the following:
                    distinctive architecture/exotic buildings
                    temples.

                   Accept other valid responses.

            (ii)   one secondary tourist attraction.                                                    [1]

                   Shops selling gifts/souvenirs/food stalls [1].

                   Accept other valid responses.

      (b)   Using photographic evidence, suggest why the perceptual carrying capacity of
            this site might have been reached.                                                          [2]

            Award [1] for photographic evidence that perceptual carrying capacity has been
            reached, and [1] for further development.

            For example: There is such a large number of visitors shown [1] that some may
            be experiencing stress due to excessive congestion and noise [1].

      (c)   For one named international sporting event, explain how one physical factor
            and two human factors influenced the choice of venue(s).                                [2+2+2]

            Award [1] for the identification of a suitable factor that might influence the choice
            of venue, and a further [1] for development.

            For example: Sochi Winter Olympics in Russia, which has a very cold climate [1],
            was chosen because of its normally abundant snowfall needed for winter sports [1].

            Other possibilities might include:
             relief
             coastal location
             attractive landscape
             good international transport links, such as airports, increasing accessibility
             good accommodation for athletes and supporters
             good local transport and infrastructure
             pre-existing venues, reducing construction costs
             government support and public opinion.

            Award a maximum of [5] if no international sporting event is named.

(d)   Examine the extent to which the aims of sustainable tourism might be achieved in
      two different environments.                                                         [10]

      The aims of sustainable tourism, involve the protection and conservation of
      primary tourist resources and support the livelihoods and cultures of local
      peoples.

      Possible strategies to achieve the aims might include:
       protection of the natural environment, eg by establishing National Parks
       managing the exploitation of local resources, such as water, fuelwood
       protection of ecosystems and respecting local wildlife
       education of tourists in the need for environmental protection and respecting
        the way of life of local communities
       managing visitor numbers
       involvement of local people in tourist activities, so that they benefit
        economically and socially
       reducing economic leakage
       supporting the culture and way of life of local people, without exploitation
       reducing the environmental impact of tourist accommodation.

      “Environments” could be interpreted in various ways; for example, different rural
      areas, urban areas, and ecosystems.

      Good answers may provide a structured examination of the environmental,
      economic and social aims of sustainable tourism and the extent to which these
      aims have been met in different areas. Another approach might be to provide a
      structured examination of different approaches to managing tourism in a
      sustainable manner in different areas.

      For band D, expect some description of the management of sustainable tourism
      in one or two different areas.

      For band E, expect either a more detailed examination of the effectiveness of
      sustainable tourism management in two different areas, or an examination of the
      extent to which the aims of sustainable tourism can be achieved in different
      areas.

      For band F, expect both.

      Marks should be allocated according to the markbands.

Option F — The geography of food and health

11.   (a)   (i)    Referring to areas on the map, describe the spread of the Zika virus
                   between 1947 and 2010.                                                             [3]

                   Award [1] for each of the following, up to a maximum of [3]:
                    starts in East/Central Africa, 1947
                    spreads to Southeast Asia 1969
                    spreads to West Africa 1975
                    spreads to Pacific Islands 2007
                    spreads to Thailand/Laos/Cambodia/Southeast Asia 2010.

                   Dates and countries/regions should be identified, if not, award marks as
                   follows:
                    3 correct regions and no dates = 2
                    2 regions and 2 dates = 2
                    2 regions and 1 date = 1
                    2 regions and 0 dates = 1

            (ii)   State what type of diffusion accounts for the spread of the Zika virus from
                   French Polynesia to Brazil.                                                        [1]

                   Relocation.

      (b)   Explain three health improvements that have led to an increase in life
            expectancy in many low-income countries in recent years.                              [2+2+2]

            Award [1] for each valid improvement, and [1] for further development.

            For example: Improved access to safe water [1] resulting in a reduction in water-
            borne diseases, such as cholera and diarrhea [1].

            Other possible improvements include:
             incidence of vector-borne diseases, such as malaria, has been reduced by
              strategies such as bed nets, spraying, clearing of stagnant water
             reduction in sexually transmitted diseases, such as HIV, due to better
              education, use of condoms
             the rollout of anti-retroviral therapies (ARTs) has increased the life expectancy
              of people with HIV
             improvements in medical care, numbers of doctors/health professionals;
              vaccinations
             improvements in food supply, reduced incidences of death from malnutrition.
                                              – 26 –          M18/3/GEOGR/BP2/ENG/TZ0/XX/M


(c)   Examine the strengths and limitations of the energy efficiency ratio as an
      indicator of sustainable agriculture.                                                     [10]

      Energy efficiency ratio is a measure of the amount of energy input into a farming
      system compared with the energy outputs. A ratio of greater than 1 is considered
      efficient, as outputs will be greater than inputs. Inputs into the system include
      labour, machinery, pesticides, fertilizers, irrigation and fuel, while outputs refer to
      the quantity/yield of food that is produced.

      Energy efficiency ratios differ for many farming systems around the world.
      Capital-intensive systems, such as irrigated rice farming, are likely to have high
      inputs and high yields, and might be considered as efficient. Subsistence
      farming systems, with high inputs of labour, might also be regarded as efficient if
      the outputs are high.

      Farming systems differ in their EERs and their relative sustainability. EER might
      be a good indicator of the efficiency of a farming system, but it neglects the wider
      environmental and social impacts of farming. Agricultural systems that have a
      high EER might produce plentiful food supplies, but they are not necessarily
      sustainable. The farming system might have an adverse impact on the land or
      water – for example, irrigation might lead to salinization and depletion of
      groundwater; pesticides might result in eutrophication, and soil quality might be
      degraded.

      Good answers may examine the extent to which EERs are a useful indicator of
      sustainability in its fullest sense (social, economic and environmental). Another
      approach might be to examine differing perspectives on the usefulness of the
      EER relative to other agricultural indicators.

      For band D, expect some description of strengths and limitations of EERs.

      At band E, expect either a more detailed explanation of the strengths and
      limitations of EERs, or a structured examination of the value of EERs in relation
      to sustainable agriculture.

      At band F, expect both.

      Marks should be allocated according to the markbands.

12.   (a)   (i)    Briefly outline what is meant by the term “food security”.                         [2]

                   Food security involves four basic concepts. Award [1] for the description of
                   each of the following concepts, up to a maximum of [2]:
                    access to food
                    sufficient amount
                    safety
                    nutritional quality/diet.

            (ii)   Outline one way in which the health of a population can be affected by
                   chronic hunger.                                                                    [2]

                   Award [1] for the problem identified and [1] for further development.

                   Possibilities include:
                    long-term under-nutrition [1] resulting in stunting/body weight loss [1]
                    increased vulnerability to disease [1] due to weaker immune system [1]
                    high maternal/infant mortality [1] due to lack of nutritious food [1].

      (b)   Explain three geographic impacts at a national scale of one named water-borne
            or sexually transmitted disease.                                                      [2+2+2]

            Award [1] for recognition of a geographic impact and [1] for further development.

            For example, HIV has impacted upon Swaziland’s GDP due to lost working hours
            / lower productivity [1]. The HIV prevalence rate in Swaziland is around 30% [1].

            Impacts might include:
             high death rates/infant mortality rates
             cost of health care
             decrease in tourism
             cost of prevention policies.

            Response should apply to one or more countries. If no example at a national
            scale is given, award a maximum of [5].
                                            – 28 –          M18/3/GEOGR/BP2/ENG/TZ0/XX/M


(c)   To what extent were physical factors responsible for one recent famine?              [10]

      A famine may be defined as a widespread shortage of food in a region that leads
      to malnutrition and hunger and results in increased mortality rates.
      Famine may be caused by a variety of physical and human factors.

      Physical factors might include:
       severe drought, caused by climatic factors
       soil exhaustion, caused by poor farming practices
       crop pests and diseases
       natural hazards, such as major earthquake
       climate change/global warming.

      Human factors might include:
       civil war/conflict/refugees
       government policies/corruption
       poor infrastructure
       widespread poverty / high food prices
       rapid population growth/population pressure
       failure of response by outside agencies.

      Reference should be made to a recent famine, preferably no earlier than the
      1990s. Responses that do not focus on a specific recent famine are unlikely to
      progress beyond band D.

      Good answers might provide a structured evaluation of the causes of a recent
      famine, and arrive at a considered view of the extent to which physical or human
      factors might matter most. Another approach might be to show how the factors
      are interrelated and interact with each other.

      For band D, expect some description of physical and/or human factors that have
      caused a recent famine.

      At band E, expect either a more detailed explanation of a range of physical and
      human factors (do not expect balance), or a structured evaluation of the extent to
      which particular factors (or the interrelationships between them) were
      responsible.

      At band F, expect both.

      Marks should be allocated according to the markbands.

Option G — Urban environments

13.   (a)   (i)     Describe what line A represents.                                                  [1]

                    It shows equality in the distribution of wealth by households/a line of perfect
                    equality [1].

            (ii)    Estimate what percentage of the city’s total wealth belongs to the wealthiest
                    10 % of households.                                                               [1]

                    32 % (Allow 30–33 %) [1]

            (iii)   Referring to the graph, outline the evidence that many households in this
                    city suffer from poverty.                                                         [2]

                    Award [1] for valid evidence, and [1] for further development, including
                    development of numerical evidence.

                    For example: The 25 % of households that are least wealthy share less
                    than 1 % of the wealth [1]. This means that many households will be living
                    on very few dollars a day equivalent and struggling to survive [1].

      (b)   Explain why people’s choice of residential location within a city might be
            influenced by their:

            (i)     ethnicity;                                                                        [3]

                    Award [1] for a description of how residential areas vary in terms of
                    ethnicity and a further [2] for development/exemplification of the reason(s).

                    For example, in many cities, such as London, there are clusters of ethnic
                    groups, such as South Koreans in New Malden [1]. Many Koreans choose
                    to live there as there are Korean restaurants/supermarkets [1] as there is
                    sufficient demand to support such specialist facilities [1].

                    Ethnic groups may also be segregated for negative reasons, eg poverty or
                    due to discrimination.

            (ii)    family status (stage in lifecycle).                                               [3]

                    Award [1] for a description of how residential areas vary in terms of family
                    status and a further [2] for development/exemplification of the reason(s).

                    Family status refers to whether a person is single, married, married with
                    children, and describes how their housing needs vary depending on the
                    size of the family.

                    For example: In some countries, single people may live in more central
                    areas [1] in rented accommodation close to work/entertainment/education
                    [1] whereas married couples may move towards the quieter suburbs [1].

(c)   Evaluate the success of one strategy designed to sustainably manage pollution
      in one named urban area.                                                              [10]

      Answers should refer to one named strategy, which can relate to one more types
      of urban pollution (atmospheric, noise, waste, water pollution, visual etc). The
      strategy may have multiple strands, eg integrated transport management,
      promotion of public transport, renewable forms of energy. The pollution
      management strategy could be part of a holistic approach to achieve sustainable
      development (circular systems)/reduce pollution, eg Beijing and the 2008
      Olympic games.

      Good candidates might evaluate success from different perspectives, eg
      businesses may resent costs of tackling pollution. Another approach might be to
      evaluate environmental and social benefits in relation to economic costs (making
      use of a sustainability framework). Another approach might be to evaluate the
      durability of any success (this depends on sustained political will, the ability to
      afford it/police it/perceived benefits).

      At band D, expect a description of a pollution strategy in a named urban area.

      At band E, expect either more detail or explanation of a pollution strategy in a
      named urban area, or an attempt to evaluate its success.

      At band F, expect both.

14.   (a)   (i)    Describe two differences between a circular city system and a linear city
                   system.                                                                         [1+1]

                   Award [1] for each valid difference.

                   Possibilities include:
                    circular is (more) sustainable, linear is less sustainable [1]
                    circular city system has smaller inputs of fossil fuels, water and products
                     than a linear system [1]
                    circular city system has smaller outputs than a linear system [1]
                    circular city system has more recycling, re-use and reduction in inputs
                     than a linear system [1].

            (ii)   Outline how one transport management strategy can contribute to a
                   circular city system.                                                             [2]

                   Award [1] for a brief description of a transport management strategy and
                   [1] for outlining its contribution to the city system dynamic, eg
                   inputs/outputs.

                   For example: Increased public transport reduces the number of cars on the
                   road [1] and therefore reduces energy inputs/atmospheric outputs [1] from
                   the city.

      (b)   Explain two reasons for the location of retail activities in the central business
            district (CBD) of one city you have studied.                                           [3+3]

            In each case, award [1] for a valid reason and a further [2] for the development
            of that reason.

            For example: In Central, the CBD of Hong Kong, retailing is located where public
            transport links converge [1]. It is a zone of high accessibility for workers and
            consumers [1], enabling stores to exceed their threshold population [1].

            Other reasons could include:
             land values
             prestige of location
             planning regulations
             city centre redevelopment schemes.

(c)   Examine the consequences of the movements of different socio-economic
      groups within a city.                                                               [10]

      There are many consequences of socio-economic groups moving into/out of
      different parts of a city. These include gentrification, suburbanization, re-
      urbanization, commuting and relocation of selected populations. Do not accept
      rural–urban migration, as this is not a movement within a city.

      Gentrification refers to the movement of higher socio-economic groups into inner
      city areas. Impacts can be positive, eg increase in house price, improvement of
      housing by owners, the growth of services, but can also be negative, eg forcing
      local residents to leave an area, housing becoming unaffordable for local people,
      etc. Relocation of people may occur due to planning or for major events such as
      the Olympic Games. Generally, it is the poor who are moved further away from
      areas of economic activity.

      Good answers may examine a structured range of positive and negative impacts
      (impacts could be for people, places, the environment, etc). Another approach
      might be to examine different timescales for movement processes (commuting,
      temporary movement, eg students, permanent relocation). Another approach
      might be to compare the dominant type of movement seen in HICs, NICs
      and LICs.

      At Band D, expect a description of one movement of socio-economic groups.

      At Band E, expect either a more detailed explanation of one or more movements
      of
      socio-economic groups in different parts of a city or an examination of the
      impacts of such movements on different parts of a city.

      At Band F expect both.
