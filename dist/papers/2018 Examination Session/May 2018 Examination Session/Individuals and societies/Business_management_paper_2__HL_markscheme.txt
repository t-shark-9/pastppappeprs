1.   (a)   Define the term unique selling point/proposition (USP).                            [2]
           A unique selling point is any aspect of the organization, brand or product that
           enables differentiation in consumers’ minds from competitors.

           N.B. no application required. Do not credit examples.

           Award [1] for a basic definition that conveys partial knowledge and
           understanding.

           Award [2] for a full definition that conveys knowledge and understanding similar
           to the answer above. There should be some reference to differentiation from
           competition.
           Candidates may refer to either the product or brand aspect of the organisation
           only.

     (b)   (i)   Construct a fully labelled balance sheet for VT for the end of 2017.         [5]

                 Balance sheet for VT for the end of 2017:

                 Fixed assets
                 Less accumulated depreciation:
                 Net fixed assets                                $27 000
                 (Accept 0 next to the above or accept just Net fixed assets)
                 Current assets:
                 Stock                              $4500
                 Debtor                              $3500
                 Cash                               $1000
                 Total CA                                          $9000

                 Current liabilities:

                 Net current assets/working capital $1500 (9000–7500)

                 Total assets less current liabilities               $28 500

                 Long-term liabilities                   $5000

       Accurate presentation refers to the correct heading, sub-heading and to the
       inclusion of all and only the relevant figures.

       Allow OFR.

       The presentation of the B/S can be done in one column.

       Award [0] if the B/S does not reach a standard described below.

       Award [1] if the B/S is not accurately constructed, and/or the calculations
       within and between the various components are not presented or largely
       incorrect. However, there is limited evidence of a general understanding
       of the format. More than four mistakes/ omissions are evident.

       Deduct 1 mark for each irrelevant addition of figures/irrelevant
       heading/ omission which includes the overall heading.

       Award [5] if the B/S is accurately constructed in the expected IBO format.
       All the relevant headings of each component/ parts are used and correctly
       classified. Do not penalise for internal order of classification. All and only
       the relevant figures are presented. No extra irrelevant figures that belong
       to the P/L are included. The calculations under each part/ component of
       the B/S are correct and well presented.
       To get full marks the candidate has to present the format in full as
       presented in the IB programme. For example, the presentation, calculation
       of working capital, the subtraction of LTL to arrive at Net Assets.


       N.B. If the candidate did not follow the IBO format award up to [2] marks.

(ii)   Calculate the acid test (quick) ratio for VT for 2018.                               [1]

       Current assets: $9000
       Stock: $4500
       Current liabilities: 47 500

                          $9000 − $4500
       Acid test ratio:                 = 0.6
                             $7500

       Award [1] for a correct answer.
       As the formulae is given and the question does not specifically ask for working, do not
       penalize for a lack of working. However, do not credit 0.6 expressed in percentage or $.
                                               – 10 –               M18/3/BUSMT/HP2/ENG/TZ0/XX/M


(c)   Explain one reason for VT to use the reducing balance method of depreciation.              [2]

      Using the reducing balance method of depreciation will reflect the reality of
      depreciation better. The use of percentage will result in higher depreciation
      figures in the early life of the asset. As a highly innovative 3D printer is used, it is
      likely, given fast-changing technology, that this asset depreciates more rapidly at
      a higher rate in the early part of the product life cycle and at a slower rate later
      on. Hence the B/S figures for each year will be more realistic and be balanced
      overall.

      Therefore, VT’s balance sheet net fixed assets will reflect more accurately the
      real value of its fixed assets.

      If the financial manager uses the reducing balance, the allowance will be higher
      in the early years of 2017/18, hence net profit before interest and tax is lower and
      therefore VT’s tax bill will be lower. In line with the financial manager’s objective.

      Accept any other relevant explanation.

      Award [1] for a relevant generic reason identified or described and [1] for any
      additional explanation in context.

      [2] cannot be awarded for the reason if the response lacks either explanation
      and/or application.
      The exact advantage/ impact/ reason to the organisation must be explained.
      For example, realistic for what? Accuracy of the B/S, payment of lower taxes
      earlier in the life of the machine before a replacement for example:
          • for an identification or a description of one reason with or without
               application [1]
      • for explanation of one reason with no application [1]
      • for explanation of the limitation and application [2].

2.   (a)   Define the term supply chain.                                                             [2]

           The term supply chain refers to a system, a process of organising people,
           activities, information and resources to move a product or service from supplier to
           customers/end users.

           Award [1] if the definition is only partial or considers supply chain as the same as
           distribution channel.

           Award [2] for a definition similar to the one above, which looks as supply chain as
           the whole mechanism of production from raw material purchase to final delivery.

     (b)   Calculate:

           For any calculation, do not penalise for the lack of $ sign.

           (i)    the total contribution of existing meals sold per month (show all your
                  working);                                                                          [2]

                  The contribution per unit of existing meals = $8 − $5 = $3

                  Number of meals sold = 800

                  Total contribution of existing meals sold per month = 800 × $3 = $2400

           Award [2] for a correct final answer of $2400 with full working.
           Award [1] for a correct answer without working.
           Do not credit when only contribution per unit is presented as a final answer.

           (ii)   the total profit or loss on existing meals for May 2018 (show all your working);   [1]

                  TR-TC=profit
                  $8x800-[$2400+$5x800]
                  $6400-[$2400+4000]
                  $6400-$6400=0

                  Accept any other method of working.

                  Candidates are not expected to set out their answer in this manner.

                  Award [1] for a correct answer with working. Candidates do not need to
                  state that Jill is breaking even. (As the question asks for working)

      (iii)   the forecast profit or loss if Jill decides to make and sell gluten-free meals
              (show all your working);                                                         [2]

              Contribution = $14 – $10 = $4 per meal
              Total contribution = 1200 x $4 = $4800
              Total forecast profit = 4800 – (2400 +400 extra fixed cost for gluten meals)
              Total forecast profit = $2000

              OR

              Profit = TR – TC
              Profit = (14 x 1200) – (2800 + (1200 x10))
              Forecast profit = 16 800 – 14 800
              Forecast profit = $2000

              Award [1] if there is one error in calculation, eg forgetting to add the extra
              fixed cost component, or the correct answer is given but there is no
              working.

              Award [2] for both the correct answer and clear and suitable working.

      (iv)    the contribution per unit of a gluten-free meal, if Jill decides to buy-in
              gluten-free meals (show all your working).                                       [1]

              The contribution per meal if Jill decides to buy-in = $14 − $8 = $6

              Award [1] for the correct answer only with working shown.

(c)   Using your answer from (b) (iii) and (iv), explain whether Jill should buy-in or
      make the gluten-free meals herself.                                                      [2]

              Buys in:
              1200x$14 – [2400+1200x$8]
              $16800- [2400+9600]
              $16800-$12000
              4800 profit

              Which is $2800 higher than in (iii) - the cost to make with profit of $2000
              Candidates do not have to repeat all of the working above if presented in
              the previous answers especially in (b)(iii).

              Or:
              Buys in:
              12000x$6 - 2400 (using contribution method)

              $16800- [2400+9600]                    $7200-$2400= $4800 profit

              $16800-$12000

              $4800 profit

              Which is $2800 higher than the profit of $2000 if she makes them herself in
              part (iii).


              Accept any other method.

Given the nature of the question regarding reference to (b)(iii) and (iv) it is
expected that the candidates incorporate references to the change in contribution
and or profit

Award [1] for just using the extra contribution to support but without reference to/
or calculation of profit before and after.

reference to or comparison with the option to make.
Award [2] for a correct numerical answer with some references to the exact
figures of profit before and after.


Do not credit a response that just says that Jill should accept the offer without
any calculation or reference to profit or contribution when buying.
Please note:
Some candidate just referred to a fall in fixed cost- not to contribution or profit. Do
not award.
Do not credit a response that does not demonstrate some attempt to calculate
the option of buying or refer to profit after buying.

           Market share can be defined as a percentage of an organization’s total sales
           revenue in relation to the total market sales revenue within a specific industry.

           Accept any other relevant definition.

           N.B. no application required. Do not credit examples.

           Award [1] for a basic definition that conveys partial knowledge and
           understanding.

           Award [2] for a full definition that conveys knowledge and understanding similar
           to the answer above. A candidate must demonstrate an understanding that the
           market share is measured as a percentage for [2].
           Accept the formula as an indication of percentage.


     (b)   Explain one advantage and one disadvantage for SD of working at almost full
           capacity utilization.                                                                   [4]
           Referring to the 98% capacity utilization as mentioned in the stimulus should not
           be treated as application.
            Some of the advantages of working at almost full capacity utilization:

           •   Almost full capacity utilization indicates that there is sufficient demand for
               SD. All resources are nearly fully utilized, in this case the delivery people, so
               it is likely that their financial rewards are higher, especially if paid by meals
               delivered. Even if a fixed salary is paid, high demand at near full capacity
               utilization may provide opportunities for working overtime.
           •   Constant work could also increase the motivation of the delivery people due
               to job security.
           •   If a fixed salary is paid, SD does not pay its workers for idle time. Better
               financial management is evident as can be seen by the high 20% GPM.
           •   Due to satisfying the assumed high demand the profit is likely to increase.
               See figures presented.

           Disadvantages:
           • SD flexibility might be reduced if a new organization approaches it to act as a
              subcontractor. SD will lose out on potential new clients in the currently growing
              market and growing competition for home delivered, freshly cooked meals.
           • The cyclists/delivery people may be overworked and unmotivated. Accidents
              are more likely to occur when the cyclists are rushed to deliver.
           • Quality compromised and SD might lose some contracts, especially as more
              competitors are entering the markets. There is evidence in the stimulus of
              some late deliveries, which reduced the quality of the meals delivered.
           • The bicycles are more likely to break down, leading to increased costs and
              further delay of the arrival of the meals to customers. SD will lose many
              contracts, especially as a stronger competitor is entering the market. SD‘s
              highest market share/ power will be eroded.

      Award [1] for identifying or describing the advantage/disadvantage for working at
      full capacity and a further [1] for a development with respect/ application to SD.
      Award a maximum of [2].

      [2] cannot be awarded per advantage/disadvantage if the response lacks either
      explanation and/or application.

      For example:
      • for an identification or a description of an advantage/disadvantage with or
        without application [1]
      • for explanation of an advantage/disadvantage with no application [1]
      • for explanation of an advantage/disadvantage and application [2].

(c)   Explain one advantage and one disadvantage for SD of using an internal growth
      strategy.                                                                             [4]

      Internal growth strategy is proposed. It is expected that candidates describe the
      nature/meaning of this type of growth where the company grows from within
      using their own resources and capabilities to expand and grow in size/market
      share by investing in scooters and employing more staff to deliver the meals.

      Advantages:
      • The management of SD will have full control of the process of growth in terms
        of speed, priorities and the amount of capital spent. As the stimulus outlines a
        large amount of finance is needed and the management could decide on the
        number of scooters etc. There will be no need for consultation and discussion
        with another organization be it through merger/takeover, joint venture or
        strategic alliance. Therefore, SD can react quickly to the current problem of
        late deliveries.
      • It appears that SD is a successful company given the profit margins and
        perhaps operating within a successful organizational culture. SD will not lose
        its independence and/or culture. Nor will it experience any cultural clashes
        with the management and employees of a different organisation. Less change
        management is required/ less disruption to SD.
      • Internal growth is likely to be cheaper than the external growth option of
        takeover. However, the stimulus outlines that a lot of capital has to be raised,
        so this option is theoretical rather than applicable. Nevertheless, the 6% return
        on the investment in scooters is relatively high and the investment is
        profitable.
      • The proposed internal growth strategy will make the working life of the staff
        easier and more efficient. Motivation is likely to increase.

      Disadvantages:
      • This method of growth is considerably slower compared to external growth.
         SD might not be able to compete with the newly merged competitors who are
         likely to be stronger. SD is likely to struggle against the new competitor and
         lose its current market leader position. SD will not be able to take immediate
         advantage of the growing market as the CEO plans.
      • Some shareholders are against this option perhaps due to a large sum of
         finance being required. Shareholders tends to expect short term, quick
         results/dividends and are likely to block the proposal. The proposed option is
         against the current trend of consolidation. SD might not be able to compete
         with the newly created powerful competitor.

         Please note that while some text books may say that internal growth is
         cheaper, there is an indication in the stimulus that this particular option
         may pose a financial challenge to SD. Options such as a strategic
         alliance or franchising could be cheaper.

      growth and a further [1] for a development with respect to SD. Award a

      explanation and/or application.

      For example:

        without application [1]
      • for explanation of an advantage / disadvantage with no application [1]
      • for explanation of an advantage / disadvantage and application [2].

(d)   Discuss two appropriate sources of finance for SD to purchase the scooters.             [10]

      Some of the possible sources of finance:

      Issuing more shares – as a private limited company, SD can definitely issue
      more shares. Currently, SD is highly geared = 65 % so the option of shares
      might be an appropriate one, especially if the banks will not offer finance. Issuing
      shares will not require any payback of the loans and will not subject SD to
      vulnerability of interest rate fluctuations. GPM (20%)/NPM (9 %)are healthy in this
      industry, so dividends are likely to be paid. The payback is relatively short and
      the ARR is quite high / reasonable. If the current shareholders buy extra shares,
      ownership will not be diluted; if other friends and family buy the shares, the
      current shareholders’ control might be diluted and they may raise objections.
      However, the current shareholders still control who buys the shares. Control will
      be not lost.

      Going public (IPO) – an expensive and very time consuming source of finance
      that may not be judged as suitable for SD as a quick reaction to the competitors
      is needed. However, SD can raise a significant amount of finance needed to
      purchase the scooters which is much needed as stated in the stimulus.
      Ownership may be diluted with a risk of losing control.
      However, a very low current ratio of 0.9 indicates liquidity problems which might
      deter investors.

      Long term bank loans – If agreed, the money can be given quickly / quicker
      than issuing shares, this is a very significant advantage for SD given the urgent
      need for action. However, the banks will be worried about SD being highly
      geared with its current obligation to pay interest as well as to pay back the loan.
      Moreover, given the low current ratio, it is likely that the bank’s financial manager
      will refuse the loan due to liquidity problems. Also,SD does not manage its short
      term liquidly- see debtors and creditors hence the bank may be worried of
      insolvency.
                                        – 17 –              M18/3/BUSMT/HP2/ENG/TZ0/XX/M


Leasing the scooters – could provide a good solution for SD. The scooters can
be leased quickly and maintained by the leased company. This fits the
managers’ objectives of a quick response. SD will pay a relatively small amount
every month, which mitigates the problem of raising a large sum pf money.
However, while, if bought, the scooters will become SD fixed assets after
3.2 years (payback), if leased, they will never be SD’s. Still, one may judge this
issue as less significant as the need for a quick reaction is vital

Venture capitalists/business angel – As SD is highly geared, coupled with the
likelihood that the banks refuse a loan, the use of the above might seem highly
suitable especially if there is potential to make a quick /significant profit as seen
given the GPM 20% and NPM 9 %. However, venture capitalists/business angels
might be reluctant to join SD due to the merger between competitors and some
discord with shareholders re: the methods of growth.
However, a very low current ratio of 0.9 indicates liquidity problems which might
deter investors.

Accept different arguments for the above option if fully justified.

Using retained profit - SD is profitable. GPM is 20 % and NPM is 4%. While we
do not know the industry norm, one may judge this option as highly suitable as
SD will not be subject to fluctuating interest rates and repayments. It is also likely
that being Ltd, the shareholders will agree to have less dividends to pursue the
strategic option of internal finance.
However, some shareholders might object to this option. Despite the percentage
given of the profit margin, it might not be sufficient to generate the large sum of
finance required and SD might have to opt for external source of finance.

Sell fixed assets – The main assets are bicycles. Selling these assets can
generate some finance. However, it might be judged as a limited source /method
to raise finance, as the bikes will not generate the cash needed, if any.
Another possibility is to sell some fixed assets like the office.

Accept different arguments for the above option if fully justified.

Please note:
• Long-term or medium-term sources of finance only should be considered.
• Do not accept some short-term sources of finance such as an overdraft, short
   term loan or creditors.
• Accept debtors or debt factoring if the candidate comments on their
   unsuitability given the liquidity problem.
• Accept ‘loan’
• If the candidate wrote ‘short term loan’ instead of just ‘loan’ but the arguments
   for /against are relevant /applicable give some credit.
• It is expected that the candidates suggest the suitability or otherwise of two
   different sources of finance. Within the above categories, candidates can
   suggest any source of finance, including some, which might not be highly
   appropriate, as long as they evaluate the appropriateness of their chosen
   sources. Candidates are expected to use the financial information provided
   as part of their evaluation. Not using any quantitative information reduces the
   quality of application and makes the response rather generic, therefore award
   up to 5 marks.
• Candidates should not divert into a solution to some cash-flow problem given
   the debtor and creditors ratios
• It is not expected that the candidate incorporate all of the above arguments.

• Accept any other relevant issue.
• Accept any other relevant discussion.

4.   (a)   Describe one role of a vision statement for HS.                                           [2]

           The role of a vision statement for HS is to inform different stakeholders of its
           preferred ideal future, direction/aspiration regarding life - long healthy eating
           habits and the recruitment of school levers.
           This will help HS to set long-term objectives regarding life - long healthy eating
           habits/ recruitment of school leavers.

           It is likely to act as an important driver for recruitment, selection and motivation of
           its young, unskilled workforce made up of school leavers.


           Award [1] for describing one role of a vision statement. Award an additional [1]
           when candidates apply their response to the stimulus.
           Award [1] if only a definition of vision statement is given rather than the role.

     (b)   Explain how the following can benefit HS:

           Please note that the question is about the benefits to an organisation - HS not to
           the employees. Do not credit just the benefits to employees without further
           explanation as to how any organisation which may be HS will benefit.

           (i)    job enlargement;                                                                   [2]

                  Job enlargement will increase the range of skills and tasks able to be
                  performed by the school leavers but at the same level in HS. The school
                  leavers lack direct experience of working and qualifications for work in a
                  national chain and or batch production. Job enlargement will give the
                  school leavers the chance to acquire new skills before they can experience
                  some job enrichment and become future managers. The employees will
                  become more motivated with all the associated benefits to HS such as
                  improved quality of their food, increased output due to being more efficient,
                  costs reduction due to economies of scale and consequently be able to
                  compete with the global fast food providers.

                  Award [1] for identification of an appropriate benefit to an organisation
                  which may be HS and an additional [1] for an explanation of the benefit and
                  application to the stimulus. Application may not be merely nominal.

           (ii)   intrapreneurship.                                                                  [2]

                  Intrapreneurship allows for risk taking, creativity and innovation by
                  employees within HS without taking their own financial or any other risks.
                  The risk is on HS. Given the intense competition from the global fast food
                  restaurants, the opportunity to school leavers to develop new healthy
                  snacks or find ways of reducing the portion will be vital to maintain market
                  share as well as keeping up with/ fulfilling HS’s social vision.

                  Award [1] for identification of an appropriate benefit to an organisation
                  which may be HS and an additional [1] for an explanation of the benefit and
                  application to the stimulus. Application may not be merely nominal.

            For example:
            • for an identification or a description of a benefit to an organisation with
              or without application [1]
            • for explanation of a benefit to an organisation with no application to HS
              [1]
            • for explanation of a benefit and application to HS [2].


(c)   Explain two possible economies of scale available to global fast food restaurants
      but not HS.                                                                            [4]

      Possible economies of scale available to the global fast food restaurants include:

      Marketing economies of scale: the global fast food companies are likely
      through their global reach to experience significant economies of scale in
      marketing/selling across a whole range of markets. HS is a national chain and
      will not be able to spread advertising/ promotion costs, for example, across a
      whole range of markets. Unit costs of marketing will be much lower for the global
      restaurants.

      Bulk-buying economies of scale: to develop and meet global demand and to fill
      supply chains, global fast food manufacturers are likely to achieve significant
      economies through the bulk-purchase of raw ingredients (a number of fast food
      manufacturers have vertically integrated with suppliers to ensure that logistics are
      in place). Again, unit costs of operations are likely to be lower than HS’s.

      Financial economies of scale: being present in global markets allows global
      fast food manufacturers to borrow funds for expansion at much lower rates than a
      national chain. It is indicated in the stimulus that HS finances its training and
      professional development through retained profits.

      Accept any other relevant economy of scale.

      Mark as a 2 + 2.
      Do not credit just a definition of the term.

      Award [1] for identification/ description of an appropriate economy of scale and
      an additional [1] for an explanation and application to the stimulus. Application
      may not be merely nominal. It is expected that the candidates refer to lower
      costs per unit rather than just lower costs.

      Maximum award per economy of scale: [2]

(d)   Discuss the two options that Tom is considering for HS in response to the
      intense competition.                                                                   [10]

      The first option, which is to implement flow production, is likely to lead to an
      increase in production and productivity because of the new technology and
      specialized roles. Currently, HS uses batch production. With improved
      productivity, HS can increase its portion size without raising prices. This will
      address the criticism found in the on line review about the portion size. HS will be
      perceived as more customers’ focus. As a result, HS may be able to compete
      more effectively with the global fast food manufacturers.

      However, the introduction of flow production may result in a reduction in the
      opportunities for job enlargement, enrichment and intrapreneurship. If the new
      production process is going to lead to specific jobs on the production, then apart
      from job rotation, the current employees may become demotivated through a
      restriction on personal growth and development opportunities. Staff turnover may
      increase as employees seek more innovative or challenging work. Moreover, the
      above may contradicts the vision statement of HS.
      It is likely to be expensive to implement flow production both in terms of the
      financing and inevitable changes in organizational culture at HS. Reduced profit
      to be put back into HS to finance job opportunities for the school leavers also
      contradicts HS’s vision statement.
      One may judge the erosion of the vision statement as a significant arguments
      against this option.

      The second option may be quicker to organize and much cheaper. The online
      reality TV show will have established HS firmly in the minds of existing and
      potential customers. A social media campaign will amplify the brand value of HS
      and should increase market share. HS will directly communicate with its target
      market who also express their discontent using social media.

      However, measuring the success of social media on market share will be difficult
      even though the target market should be familiar with this method of promotion.
      The biggest argument fr against this campaign, however, is that as a competitive
      tool against the global manufacturers it might not be successful. Emphasising the
      health benefits of the smack does not address the problem of the portion. It does
      not mention in the stimulus that there is an issue with HS’s perceived health
      benefits. There will still be this perceived difference in portion size. A social
      media campaign will not address this aspect. In fact, there is a danger that
      negative response to the campaign make reduce market share even further.

      Both of the responses have some merit, but it would appear that the first option is
      the most appropriate to tackle the issue of competition with the global fast food
      manufacturers. The changes in the production process will take some time to
      bed in and a few staff may leave to work for other snack food manufacturers who
      have more dynamic or challenging roles. However, the social media campaign
      will not close the perceived gap between the products offered by HS and those
      offered by their competitors and, thus, could backfire.

      Candidates are expected to provide conclusions and judgments (for top marks).
      Candidates may conclude that either option is better or they may conclude that
      HS should do both, given that Option 2 would not be very expensive.

      Marks should be allocated according to the markbands on page 5.

A balanced response is one that covers at least one issue for and at least one
argument against each option.

For one relevant issue that is one-sided, award up to [3]. For more than one
relevant issue that is one-sided, award up to a maximum of [4].

Award a maximum of [6] if the answer is of a standard that shows balanced
analysis and understanding throughout the response with reference to the
stimulus material but there is no judgment/conclusion.

Candidates cannot reach the [7–8] markband if they give judgment/conclusions
that are not based on analysis/explanation already given in their answer.

5.   (a)   Define the term redundancy.                                                         [2]

           When the business can no longer afford to employ a worker or the job does no
           longer exist or is considered necessary hence a person is unemployed. The
           business is eliminating the role.

           N.B. no application required. Do not credit examples.
           Candidates are not expected to word their definition exactly as above.

           Award [1] for a basic definition that conveys partial knowledge and
           understanding.

           Award [2] for a full definition that conveys knowledge and understanding similar
           to the answer above. Redundancy occurs through no fault of the employee.

     (b)   Explain one positive and one negative impact of the multinational company, RE,
           on the developing country.                                                          [4]

           Positive impacts on the developing country:
           • TM has new competition; consumers will have access to different taxi
             services, hence more choice at lower prices for the consumers.
           • Tax revenue to the government of the developing country from profits made by
             RE taxi drivers.
           • Working opportunities for drivers in the developing country will grow as any
             person with a car can download the BT app and begin his/her employment.
             Income will increase, standards of living will improve. Also, for drivers at TM
             there will be job creation and job security.
           • In the future RE, with a possible increase in demand for the BT app may
             increase capital spending/infrastructure to manage operations. The
             developing country will benefit from an increase in economic activity.
           • Technological transfer – the introduction of the BT app can be used in other
             industries to improve efficiency.

           Negative impacts on the developing country:

           • BT’s competition is threatening TM’s market position and even forcing it out of
             business.
           • RE as a multinational company, is probably a powerful company, which makes
             TM’s survival even more difficult.TM as a local business cannot compete and
             has started to experience a fall in sales and profit. TM might end up closing
             and this would lead to increased unemployment in the country which may
             result in the government intervening to ensure that the political fallout from
             such a move is minimized.
           • RE takes advantage of a lack of compulsory regulation and BT drivers have a
             higher rate of road accidents as well as safety issues- assaults and robbery.
           • Profits from RE could be repatriated to their home country. The financial
             benefits may be limited- this argument is not really applicable.
           • Award [1] for theoretical possibility.
           • Accept any other relevant positive/negative impact.

           Mark as 2 + 2.

           Award [1] for identifying or describing one positive/negative impact for TM and a
           further [1] for a development with respect to TM. Award a maximum of [2].
                                                – 24 –              M18/3/BUSMT/HP2/ENG/TZ0/XX/M


         [2] cannot be awarded per advantage/disadvantage if the response lacks either
         explanation and/or application.

         For example:
         • for an identification or a description of a positive / negative impact with or
           without application [1]
         • for explanation of a positive / negative impact with no application [1]
         • for explanation of a positive / negative impact and application [2].

(c)   With reference to Maslow’s motivation theory, explain two reasons that some
      TM drivers left to drive for BT.                                                           [4]

      • Maslow’s physical needs refer to the basic physiological requirements of food,
        water and shelter. As TM drivers’ incomes are falling they may not be able to
        earn enough money to meet essential needs. Therefore, even the lowest level of
        needs is not fulfilled hence the drivers are demotivated. They will leave TM for BT
        as it seems that many drivers are making considerably more money.
      • Maslow’s safety needs refer to the needs of security and protection. TM drivers
        may want to meet safety needs such as job security. TM is experiencing financial
        problems and there are rumors of redundancies. Uncertainty at TM could force
        many drivers to quit TM to a more stable position.
      • Poor management may lead to a lack of love and belonging on the part of the
        workers. There is evidence implied by the stimulus of a lack of teamwork and
        cooperation, as TM’s drivers are effectively self-employed. Therefore, it could
        argued that TM’s drivers cannot reach the third level- Love and belonging.
      • If the candidate does not use Maslow’s exact classification of any need Award [0]
      • The inability to fulfil the higher level of needs are not relevant/ applicable in this
        case.
      • Only credit relevant needs based on the stimulus
      • Given that only 2 marks are available per need, a full explanation of the Maslow
        theory/ model is not expected.


      Mark as 2 + 2.

      For each need:
      • for an identification or a description of one relevant Maslow need with or without
        application [1]
      • for explanation of one relevant Maslow need with no application [1] for
        explanation of one relevant of Maslow needs with and application [2].Award a
        maximum of [4] in total.
                                             – 25 –              M18/3/BUSMT/HP2/ENG/TZ0/XX/M


(d)   Discuss the new strategy to differentiate TM from BT.                                  [10]
      The focus of this question is on differentiation in the eyes of the customers.

      • TM’s new strategy is to downsize and reposition the company as a high price
        and high quality traditional taxi service. Customers that are willing and able to
        pay for a more exclusive service will probably find the service attractive. This
        will put TM in a different target segment and will enable differentiation form
        BT.
      • Current security and safety problems due to customers being assaulted by BT
        drivers and the higher rate of road accidents could help TM to develop a
        unique selling point emphasizing the fact that all TM drivers have professional
        licenses and cars have regular safety inspections.
      • Leasing new luxury cars seems to be a good financial and operational
        alternative for TM as they won’t need to cash purchase the new vehicles.
        New luxury cars emphasize TM’s USP regarding comfort and differentiation
        from BT. Moreover, the taxi can be upgraded and regularly serviced for extra
        comfort to the newly targeted segment. Furthermore, customers are unlikely to
        be concerned whether the taxis are leased or not. This issue can be judged as
        of minimal / no importance. Leasing is cheaper in the short term and might
        enable TM to stay competitive in terms of quality/ price ratio.
      • Technology can be a barrier for many people such as using mobile apps or
        even smart phones. Many customers, especially the elderly groups will find it
        simpler to telephone for a taxi instead of using a mobile app.

      On the other hand:
      • Using a mobile app to book and pay for a taxi service can be difficult for some
        groups of consumers, the increasing usage of technology and mobile apps
        shows that BT is very practical for most groups of potential consumers.
      • BT as a multinational company is a strong competitor for TM, probably
        benefitting from managerial and marketing economies of scale. They may
        also introduce a service offering an exclusive maintenance that will compete
        with TM´s new market positioning. TM cannot patent their new service. The
        idea/service is very easy to copy especially by a MNC.
      • Leasing is usually an expensive option in the long term as payments will have
        to be made over the duration of the agreement. However, this point does not
        impact on differentiation unless TM increases its price and becomes
        uncompetitive. This is unlikely.
      • Accidents could be reduced if BT makes professional driving license a
        compulsory requirement to become a driver. Getting a professional driving
        license is not an important barrier of entry for BT. TM’s USP is easy to imitate
        and could be quickly eroded.

      Overall, TM is in a very delicate situation. BT is a strong competitor and threatens
      TM’s market position. Although the new positioning strategy has several
      weaknesses it is a viable alternative to try in the short term before BT or other
      competitors move in. TM may be able to benefit significantly from first mover
      advantage. Otherwise, survival of the company is at stake.


      Marks should be allocated according to the markbands on page 5.

      •   It is not expected that the candidate incorporate all of the above arguments.
      •   Accept any other relevant issue.
      •   Accept any other relevant discussion.

                                          Section C
Questions 6–8. Please mark the candidate response using the assessment criteria on
pages 6–7.

6.    With reference to an organization of your choice, examine the impact of globalization
      on human resources strategy.                                                             [20]

7.    With reference to an organization of your choice, examine the impact of ethics on
      organizational change.                                                                   [20]

8.    With reference to an organization of your choice, examine the impact of innovation
      and culture on an organization.                                                          [20]

N.B. When the question asks for the application of one concept on another, it is still
expected that Business Management content will be aligned with the concepts especially the
second concept (the one being acted on).

Please note that candidates can conclude that there was a minimal impact, however it has to
be based on balanced arguments and evaluation.

Additional guidance in relation to the assessment criteria
For each criterion, the aim is to find the descriptor that conveys most accurately the level
attained by the candidate, using the best-fit model. It is not necessary for every single
aspect of a level descriptor to be met for that mark to be awarded.

• The highest-level descriptors do not imply faultless performance and should be achievable
  by a candidate.
• A candidate who attains a high level of achievement for one criterion will not necessarily
  reach high levels of achievement for the other criteria and vice versa.

If only one concept is addressed:
• Criteria A, B, C and E: award up to a maximum [3].
• Criterion D: full marks can be awarded.

Where the question asks for impacts of two concepts on content, examiners must allow for
unbalanced treatment of the two concepts throughout a candidate’s response. One concept
may be more significant than the other.

Criterion B
For [1]: “…connection is inappropriate” – ignore superficial.
For [2]: “…connection is not developed” should be treated the same as superficial.

Criterion C
1 + 1 arguments are expected per concepts.
• Questions 6 and 7 require consideration of the impact of one concept on a second
   concept – therefore accept 2 + 2 arguments for a balanced response.
• Justification is through logic or data.
• For [2] there is no balance as there are no counter arguments at all, or the arguments are
   all one-sided then this would be unjustified.
• For [3] there are some balanced arguments – some of which are justified.

Criterion D
• Introductions need to be concise and related to the question.
• The candidate’s response does not to have explicit headings for each structural element.
• A body is the area in which the substance of arguments occurs. It is usually located
   between the introduction and the conclusion.
• Fit-for-purpose paragraph means that ideas are presented in a clear academic way. For
   example, one idea per paragraph.

Criterion E
• One example of an “individual” could be an individual consumer or an individual manager.
   However, this cannot be considered with a “group” of consumers or a management team.
• For [4], a balanced response: look at the perspectives of both individual and group(s).
• The chosen individual, group needs to be applicable and relevant to the question with
   specific explanation.
• Candidates need to go beyond stating the stakeholder.

Candidates need not explicitly say “stakeholder”.

If a candidate chooses an organization from another part of the exam (for example, an organization in
the stimulus of section B), their response should be marked as follows:

Criterion A – Award a maximum of [1], as the candidate might understand the essence of the two
concepts but the content selected is irrelevant as the organisation is fictitious but the candidate may
display some understanding of the concepts.

Criterion B – Award [0], as there is no connection to a real organization.

Criterion C – Award a maximum of [1]. The arguments cannot be relevant and justified as the
organisation is fictitious.

Criterion D – Mark as normal.

Criterion E –Award [0]. The individual and/or group perspective(s) cannot be relevant if the organisation
is fictitious.
