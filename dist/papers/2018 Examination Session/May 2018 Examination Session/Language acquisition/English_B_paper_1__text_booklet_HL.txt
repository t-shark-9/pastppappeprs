          Nearly 1,000 walk to support the Friendship
                        Circle of Miami
         Mackenzie Dorr’s commitment to the
         Friendship Circle of Miami started slowly. Six years
         ago, she had to meet her school’s requirement
         to take part in a community service activity.
 5       So she chose Friendship Circle, a nonprofit that
         pairs children with special needs with volunteers to                Removed
         foster friendship and acceptance.                                 for copyright
                                                                              reasons
         And she has remained ever since: Dorr said she fell
         in love with the program after she was paired with
10       a little boy who was nonverbal.

         “He helped me see the value of working with kids
         with special needs,” Dorr said. “It’s not just about
         what we, teens, can teach them, it’s about what
         they give to us. I’ve learned how to be a good friend, which can be something lost on
15       our generation. And they teach us to be compassionate and patient.”

         Dorr and close to a thousand other people gathered at the Chabad Center of
         Kendall/Pinecrest over the weekend to walk for a special cause. The walk is the
         organization’s sole fundraising event and the money finances the Friendship Circle
         program, which includes home visits, sports, music, winter and summer camps, field trips
20       and youth groups.

         “With this program, we see an incredible bond between teens and their special friends,”
         Friendship Circle director Nechama Harlig said. “We hope people leave here with the
         feeling that they walked for a great cause.”

         Local mascots, Burnie from the Miami Heat and Sebastian from the University of Miami,
25       posed for pictures and cheered walkers on from the sidelines during the two-mile walk.
         Waves of people marched through the residential area behind the Chabad Center.
         They cheered, laughed, sang and held up signs that read “Walk 4 Friendship.”

         Everyone, including families and friends, later enjoyed a carnival with barbecue,
         cotton candy, bumper cars, rock-climbing, bounce houses, a merry-go-round
30       and music.

         Alexis Greenberg, a volunteer, has mild cerebral palsy* and a seizure disorder, but she
         has been seizure-free for 10 years. She said she must shield her eyes from strobe lights at
         concerts and she doesn’t like loud noises: “But nothing stops me from living.”

        “I’m so extraordinarily proud of her,” Mary Greenberg, Alexis’ mother, said. “As she was
35      growing up, I couldn’t imagine what she’d be like. She’s really outgoing, and she wants
        to do everything she can for herself and other people.”

        Alexis has volunteered with Friendship Circle for five years. She works with children with
        special needs at a community center and an early childhood development center.

        “I try to teach them that they can do anything they want to do,” Alexis said. “They can
40      help each other; they can make friends. I learned that I can do anything even though I
        have a disability.”

                              Paul’s Case: A Study in Temperament
                  It was Paul’s afternoon to appear before the faculty of the Pittsburg High School to account
           for his various misdemeanors. He had been suspended a week ago, and his father had called at
           the principal’s office and confessed his perplexity about his son. Paul entered the faculty room,
           suave and smiling. His clothes were a trifle outgrown, and the tan velvet on the collar of his
    5      open overcoat was frayed and worn; but, for all that, there was something of the dandy1 about
           him, and he wore an opal pin in his neatly knotted black four-in-hand2, and a red carnation in
           his buttonhole. This latter adornment the faculty somehow felt was not properly significant of
           the contrite spirit befitting a boy under the ban of suspension.

                 Paul was tall for his age and very thin, with high, cramped shoulders and a narrow chest.
10         His eyes were remarkable for a certain hysterical brilliancy, and he continually used them in a
           conscious, theatrical sort of way, peculiarly offensive in a boy. The pupils were abnormally large,
           as though he were addicted to belladonna3, but there was a glassy glitter about them which that
           drug does not produce.

                  When questioned by the principal as to why he was there, Paul stated, politely enough,
15         that he wanted to come back to school. This was a lie, but Paul was quite accustomed to lying—
           found it, indeed, indispensable for overcoming friction. His teachers were asked to state their
           respective charges, which they did with such a rancor and aggrievedness as evinced that this was
           not a usual case. Disorder and impertinence were among the offences named, yet each of his
           instructors felt that it was scarcely possible to put into words the real cause of the trouble, which
20         lay in a sort of hysterically defiant manner of the boy’s; in the contempt which they all knew he
           felt for them, and which he seemingly made not the least effort to conceal. Once, when he had
           been making a synopsis of a paragraph at the blackboard, his English teacher had stepped to
           his side and attempted to guide his hand. Paul had started back with a shudder, and thrust his
           hands violently behind him. The astonished woman could scarcely have been more hurt and
25         embarrassed had he struck at her. The insult was so involuntary and definitely personal as to
           be unforgettable. In one way and another he had made all his teachers, men and women alike,
           conscious of the same feeling of physical aversion.

                  His teachers felt, this afternoon, that his whole attitude was symbolized by his shrug
           and his flippantly red carnation flower, and they fell upon him without mercy. He stood
30         through it, smiling, his pale lips parted over his white teeth. Older boys than Paul had broken
           down and shed tears under that baptism of fire, but his set smile did not once desert him, and
           his only sign of discomfort was the nervous trembling of the fingers that toyed with the buttons
           of his overcoat, and an occasional jerking of the other hand that held his hat. Paul was
           always smiling, always glancing about him, seeming to feel that people might be watching him
35         and trying to detect something. This conscious expression, since it was as far as possible from
           boyish mirthfulness, was usually attributed to insolence or “smartness.”
