Complete one of the following tasks. Write 250 to 400 words.

1.   Cultural diversity

     You are on a school exchange in an English-speaking country with one of your friends.
     Although you are enjoying the experience, your friend feels left out because they feel different from
     their peers. Write a diary entry reflecting on this situation and considering ways in which you can
     help them.


2.   Customs and traditions

     Your school is thinking of banning students who have piercings from entering the school campus.
     You have strong views on this situation. Write a blog entry in which you either agree or disagree
     with the school’s proposal, giving reasons for your opinion.


3.   Health

     Several months ago, your school started to implement relaxation classes. As the editor of your
     school newspaper, write an article describing the activities carried out in these classes and
     discussing the benefits they have had on students’ well-being.


4.   Leisure

     Your teacher has set the following as your next essay topic: “Should athletes who do not make
     good role models in the world of sport be banned from competing?” Write your essay.


5.   Science and technology

     Your Principal would like to know how technology is being used to help learning in each class at
     your school. You have been asked to write a report on your English B class. Write the report,
     giving information about how technology is currently used in this class, and to what extent it is
     benefiting learning.
