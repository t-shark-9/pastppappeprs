2    Method of Marking
     (a)     All marking must be done in RM Assessor using the mathematical studies annotations and in
             accordance with the current document for guidance in e-marking Mathematical Studies SL.
             It is essential that you read this document before you start marking.
     (b)     If a question part is completely correct use the number tick annotations to award full marks.
             If a part is completely wrong use the A0 annotation, otherwise full annotations must be shown.

     (c)     Working crossed out by the candidate should not be awarded any marks.
     (d)     Where candidates have written two solutions to a question, only the first solution should be marked.
     (e)     If correct working results in a correct answer but then further working is developed, indicating a lack of
             mathematical understanding full marks should not be awarded. In most such cases it will be a single
             final answer mark that is lost. An exception to this may be in numerical answers, where a correct exact
             value is followed by an incorrect decimal.
     Example:
                      Correct answer seen             Further working seen                 Action
                 1.

                                                     (incorrect decimal value)

     Example:          Calculate the gradient of the line passing through the points (5, 3) and (0, 9) .

3    Follow-through (ft) Marks

     Errors made at any step of a solution affect all working that follows. To limit the severity of the penalty, follow
     through (ft) marks can be awarded. Markschemes will indicate where it is appropriate to apply follow through
     in a question with ‘(ft)’.

     (a)         Follow through applies only from one part of a question to a subsequent part of the question.
                 Follow through does not apply within the same part.

     (b)         If an answer resulting from follow through is extremely unrealistic (eg, negative distances or
                 incorrect by large order of magnitude) then the final A mark should not be awarded.

     (c)         If a question is transformed by an error into a different, much simpler question then follow through
                 may not apply.

     (d)         To award follow through marks for a question part, there must be working present for that part. An
                 isolated follow through answer, without working is regarded as incorrect and receives no marks even if
                 it is approximately correct.

     (e)         The exception to the above would be in a question which is testing the candidate’s use of the GDC,
                 where working will not be expected. The markscheme will clearly indicate where this applies.

     (f)         Inadvertent use of radians will be penalized the first time it occurs. The markscheme will give clear
                 instructions to ensure that only one mark per paper can be lost for the use of radians.

Example:         Finding angles and lengths using trigonometry

4    Using the Markscheme

     (a)     A marks are dependent on the preceding M mark being awarded, it is not possible to
             award (M0)(A1). Once an (M0) has been awarded, all subsequent A marks are lost in that part of
             the question, even if calculations are performed correctly, until the next M mark.
             The only exception to this will be for an answer where the accuracy is specified in the question – see
             section 5.

     (b)     A marks are dependent on the R mark being awarded, it is not possible to award (A1)(R0). Hence the
             (A1) cannot be awarded for an answer which is correct when no reason or the wrong reason is given.

     (c)     In paper 2 candidates are expected to demonstrate their ability to communicate mathematics using
             appropriate working. Answers which are correct but not supported by adequate working will
             not always receive full marks, these unsupported answers are designated G in the mark scheme as
             an alternative to the full marks. Example (M1)(A1)(A1)(G2).

Example:     Using trigonometry to calculate an angle in a triangle.

                      Markscheme                           Candidates’ Scripts                 Marking

       formula, (A1) for correct substitutions.
                                                    (ii)   A = 22.0                            (G2)
                                                    Note: G marks are used only if no working has been shown
                A = 22.0 (22.0243…) (A1)(G2)       and the answer is correct.

     (d)     Alternative methods may not always be included. Thus, if an answer is wrong then the working must
             be carefully analysed in order that marks are awarded for a different method consistent with the
             markscheme.
             Where alternative methods for complete questions are included in the markscheme, they are indicated
             by ‘OR’ etc.
                                                                                                 sin θ
     (e)     Unless the question specifies otherwise, accept equivalent forms. For example:            for tan θ .
                                                                                                 cos θ
             On the markscheme, these equivalent numerical or algebraic forms will sometimes be written in brackets
             after the required answer.
             Where numerical answers are required as the final answer to a part of a question in the markscheme,
             the scheme will show, in order:
             the 3 significant figure answer worked through from full calculator display;
                                              2               

                                              3               
             the full calculator display in the form 2.83163… as in the example above.
             Where answers are given to 3 significant figures and are then used in subsequent parts of the question
             leading to a different 3 significant figure answer, these solutions will also be given.

(f)   As this is an international examination, all valid alternative forms of notation should be accepted.
      Some examples of these are:

      Decimal points: 1.7; 1’7; 1 ⋅ 7 ; 1,7 .

      Decimal numbers less than 1 may be written with or without a leading zero: 0.49 or .49 .

      Different descriptions of an interval: 3 < x < 5; (3, 5); ] 3, 5 [ .

      Different forms of notation for set properties (eg, complement):        A′ ; A ; Ac ; U − A ;( A ;U \ A.
      Different forms of logic notation:   ¬ p ; p′ ; 
                                                      p ; p ; ~ p.
                                           p⇒q; p→q; q⇐ p.

      Significance level may be written as α .

(g)   Discretionary marks: There will be very rare occasions where the markscheme does not cover the work
      seen. In such cases the annotation DM should be used to indicate where an examiner has used
      discretion. Discretion should be used sparingly and if there is doubt an exception should be raised
      through RM Assessor to the team leader.

As with previous sessions there will be no whole paper penalty marks for accuracy AP, financial accuracy
FP and units UP. Instead these skills will be assessed in particular questions and the marks applied
according to the rules given in sections 5, 6 and 7 below.

5    Accuracy of Answers

     Incorrect accuracy should be penalized once only in each question according to the rules below.

     Unless otherwise stated in the question, all numerical answers should be given exactly or correct to
     3 significant figures.

     1.      If the candidate’s answer is seen to 4 sf or greater and would round to the required 3 sf answer, then
             award (A1) and ignore subsequent rounding.

     2.    If the candidate’s unrounded answer is not seen then award (A1) if the answer given is correctly
           rounded to 2 or more significant figures, otherwise (A0).
     Note: If the candidate’s unrounded answer is not seen and the answer is given correct to 1 sf (correct or not),
           the answer will be considered wrong and will not count as incorrect accuracy. If this answer is used in
           subsequent parts, then working must be shown for further marks to be awarded.

     3.      If a correct 2 sf answer is used in subsequent parts, then working must be shown for further marks to
             be awarded. (This treatment is the same as for following through from an incorrect answer.)

     These 3 points (see numbers in superscript) have been summarized in the table below and illustrated in the
     examples following.

    Rounding of an exact answer to 3 significant figures should be accepted if performed correctly.
                              1
    Exact answers such as       can be written as decimals to fewer than 3 significant figures if the result is
                              4
    still exact. Reduction of a fraction to its lowest terms is not essential, however where an answer simplifies to
    an integer this is expected. Fractions that include a decimal in the numerator and/or the denominator are
    acceptable for showing correct substitution, but not as a final answer.

    Ratios of π and answers taking the form of square roots of integers or any rational power of an integer
               2
    (eg, 13, 2 3 , 4 5 ,) may be accepted as exact answers. All other powers (eg, of non-integers) and values
    of transcendental functions such as sine and cosine must be evaluated.

    If the level of accuracy is specified in the question, a mark will be allocated for giving the answer to
    the required accuracy. In all such cases the final mark is not awarded if the rounding does not follow the
    instructions given in the question. A mark for specified accuracy can be regarded as a (ft) mark regardless of
    an immediately preceding (M0).

6    Level of accuracy in finance questions

     The accuracy level required for answers will be specified in all questions involving money. This will usually be
     either whole units or two decimal places. The first answer not given to the specified level of accuracy
     will not be awarded the final A mark. The markscheme will give clear instructions to ensure that only
     one mark per paper can be lost for incorrect accuracy in a financial question.

Example:     A financial question demands accuracy correct to 2 dp.

7    Units in answers

     There will be specific questions for which the units are required and this will be indicated clearly
     in the markscheme. The first correct answer with no units or incorrect units will not be awarded the
     final A mark. The markscheme will give clear instructions to ensure that only one or two mark per paper can
     be lost for lack of units or incorrect units.
     The units are considered only when the numerical answer is awarded (A1) under the accuracy rules given
     in Section 5.

     If no method is shown and the answer is correct but with incorrect or missing units award G marks
     with a one mark penalty.

     Candidates will often be obtaining solutions directly from their calculators. They must use mathematical
     notation, not calculator notation. No method marks can be awarded for incorrect answers supported only by
     calculator notation. The comment ‘I used my GDC’ cannot receive a method mark.
