      Access control;
      this means that different users will have different levels of access to the Galaxy
      Bank database;
      Therefore customers will only be able to access the information that they require
      to carry out their transactions;
      Whereas other users such as the DBA will have access to more of the database;
      Ensuring that the sensitive information within the Galaxy Bank database is secure
      from unauthorized access, editing etc.;                                              [3]

      Row locking prevents two or more database users from updating the same data
      at the same time;
      When a row is locked it means that another database session cannot update that
      data until the lock is released (which unlocks the data and allows other database
      users to update that data;
      If the database as a whole is locked, then only one database session can apply
      any updates; Locks are done using statements;                                        [3]

           The recovery method recovers a past copy of the database;
           Backed up to archival storage and reconstructs a more current state by redoing
           the operations of committed transactions, up to the time of failure.

           Deferred Update;
           To support ABORT and machine failure scenarios;
           While a transaction runs, no changes made by that transaction are recorded in
           the Database;
           On a commit, new data is recorded in a log file and flushed to the disk;
           New data is then recorded in the database itself;
           On abort, do not do anything (the database has not been changed);

3.   (a)   Award up to [3 max].
           Normalization leads to a reduction in the chance of data redundancy occurring;
           Because each item of data only occurs on one location in the database;
           Therefore this can reduce the possibility of update anomalies occurring;
           More efficient use of memory;

           Normalization reduces the likelihood of update anomalies occurring;
           Because each item of data only occurs on one location in the database;
           Therefore if the data is edited there is no chance that the data may exist in its
           original form anywhere else in the database;

           Normalization leads to smaller tables with less information in each row;
           This leads to a reduction of input/output transfers;
           Which means that the likelihood of CPU activities being suspended are
           reduced/the CPU is able to work at full capacity;

           Note: Do not award marks between clusters.                                           [3]

(e)   2NF allows non-prime attributes to be functionally dependent on non-prime
      attributes which means there are transitive dependencies at 2NF;
      While 3NF allows non-prime attributes to be functionally dependent only on the
      primary / super key and is already in 2NF;
      Therefore it is not possible for update anomalies to occur when a database is in
      3NF;                                                                               [3]

           Deviation detection is a statistical technique;
           Appropriate marketing of product;
           Which is used to detect outlying data that does not fit the assumed model;
           Therefore it can be used to predict the trends and patterns of demand for certain
           consumer goods in the future;                                                              [2]

     (b)   Award up to [3 max].
           To speed query execution, which can be especially important in data warehouses
           used by Singalytics;
           May effectively be used in data warehouses as they contain pre-joined tables that
           package data for common uses;
           If the data is all present in a single table, there will be no need for joins, hence the
           selects can be done very quickly;
           A single table with all the required data allows much more efficient index usage;
           If there is heavy read load and when the application is read intensive;
           If the columns are indexed properly, then results can be filtered and sorted by
           utilizing the same index;                                                                  [3]

           In terms or performance/ response time/ locking;
           Makes it accessible for processing on the data;
           Ensuring that historical data being extracted can be read by the current systems;
           Ensuring the different data formats being extracted can all be converted or
           scrubbed to become readable by the system and able to be formatted;
           Ensuring that the data is relevant to what the user wishes to extract and utilise;         [3]

     (d)   Award up to [2 max].
           The content in the data warehouse is only valid for a time period;
           Because the data undergoes changes dynamically;
           A data warehouse's focus on change over time is time variant;                              [2]

     (e)   Award up to [4 max].

           Award [2 max] for the explanation and [2 max] for the example(s).

           Associations:
           Correlate the presence;
           of a set of items with another range of values for another set of variables;
           Breaks up data sets by variables such as gender, location, age;
           It may be used to detect patterns independently from the geographic region,
           females buy more dark colour trousers than males;

           Examples:
           when a female retail shopper buys a cotton shirt, she is likely to buy a stole.
           Associations of the type Full arm formal shirts => Dark colour trousers; Full arm
           formal shirts => cufflinks may produce enough confidence and support to be valid
           association rules of interest;
           If the application area has a natural classification of the item sets into hierarchies,
           discovering associations within the hierarchies is of no particular interest;
           Specifically its associations across hierarchies;

(f)   Award up to [6 max].

      Award [3 max] for the feature(s) and [3 max] for supporting
      explanation/examples.

      Features:
      Enhanced modelling capabilities;
      Extensibility/support new data types;
      Object DBMS stores more complex data and relationships;
      Improved performance;
      Reusability;
      Eliminates need for user defined keys;
      Eliminates need for Joins;

      Examples:
      Inheritance property, we can re-use the attributes (size, fabric) and functionalities;
      It reduces the cost of maintaining the same data multiple times;
      All this information is encapsulated and, there is no fear being misused by other
      objects. If we need any new feature we can easily add new class inherited from
      parent class and that adds new features;
      Reduces the overhead and maintenance costs;
      So it becomes more flexible if any changes and apparel business changes with
      fashion needs;
      Codes are re-used because of the inheritance feature;                                    [6]

           There is no evidence that there are two knives to slice the bread roll;
           so one of them could already be delayed;

           There could be need of the same fillings;

      The objective of reducing turn-around time,
      May lead to hastily prepared dishes,
      Which may be lacking in quality.

      Trying to cook a batch of orders in 10 minutes,
      May require the pans to be used for multiple dishes,
      Impacting the unique taste of these dishes.

      More appliances might need to be switched on, in case of large orders demand;
      For example, an oven, which take time to heat up;
      Causing some dishes to be undercooked;

      The number of customers/orders;
      May be too high;
      To be dealt with in 10 minutes;

      Being in charge of preparing a full dish, gives job satisfaction;
      Lack of satisfaction may lead to loss of interest in the job;

            Award [2] for one reason for appropriateness with amplification.
            The features in images have been extracted in previous processing;
            And can be represented in a suitable way to be used with genetic algorithms;

            Award [2] for one reason against appropriateness with amplification
            One has to decide which features shall drive the recognition process;
            Choosing the wrong feature may lead to incorrect results;

            If the GA merges similar features to build broad classes;
            Then the recognition may not be precise enough;

            If the GA focuses on several small details taken in isolation;
            A limited number of features may be recognised;                                      [6]

            each other;
            To exchange/access information through the WWW;

            The WWW is a way to access/share/exchange information using software
            applications;
            Using the Internet as a physical medium;

            Internet allows the transmission of data;
            That constitute the information that applications on the WWW may want to
            share/access/exchange;

            The WWW provides, through hyperlinks, a level of connectivity of resources
            (logical connectivity);
            Which can be physically sparse, but connected in a network in the Internet;         [2]

      To the purpose of guaranteeing security;
      And to possibly perform other operations (tracking log-ins or transactions);

      The bank cannot send out password to be processed on the client’s side;
      This will not be a guarantee for security for the bank/it may introduce
      vulnerabilities/sensitive data cannot be sent out in the public domain;
      Hence the comparison with the individual’s entry must happen in the bank with

            Note: An expansion from the technical/computational perspective only (not
            sociological one) is expected about aspects of the chosen method of online
            interaction.

            Aspects that can gain credit:
            Editing, permissions layer, ownership, tracking of updates, security (open to
            vandalism/non-monitored contributors), open source (interoperability).

            Software for wikis provides collaborative editing sharing of information of content,
            directly from the browser;
            Updates are usually tracked in wikis (also to be removed afterwards) as they
            come from different authors / usually non-moderated / added content can also be
            removed later on (also by others);
            The evolution of a wiki is more immediate and spontaneous because updates are
            immediately visible;
            The wiki can easily be vandalized with incorrect/unauthoritative information, but it
            can also be quickly amended/corrected if this is realized quickly;                     [3]

            Lossy compression results in files of smaller size;
            It may be needed for video streaming because the server provides execution
            through scripting;
            And guaranteeing streaming without interruptions is a priority;
            It may be a choice for downloading video for local execution to manage outgoing
            traffic on popular servers/increases the speed (using smaller files);                  [4]

            Award [1 max] for identifying a technology that is needed award up to [3 max] for
            an extension describing how the technology is used and interacts with other
            components.

            Example 1:
            An interactive web page that has an auto-refresh/automatic update extension;
            So that every N seconds a script is executed to reload the page;
            The web page is linked to an underlined database/data source
            OR interrogates specific databases/news databanks;
            That are distributed and collectively provide regular updates;
            And they can be displayed back using the script;

            Example 2:
            A dynamic web page equipped with a RSS feed;
            That collects/aggregates news from sources that cover that live event;
            The feed is in form of an update in XML;
            Therefore, it can be used to feed an underlining (distributed) database or the web

13.   (a)   (i)   Award up to [3 max]:

                  Award [1] for showing understanding of the need of each of the following:
                  GPS, mapping software, underlying distributed information.

                  The GPS of the device gives its current location (coordinates);

                  Coordinates sent out through the Internet (with 3G/4G/5G/Wifi/using the
                  specific features of the mobile device OS);

                  Coordinates are linked to map software (eg Googlemaps) to retrieve
                  current’s device position and neighbourhood information (using thematic
                  databases);

                  And integrated with further annotations (relative to museums) that can be
                  provided by third-party services;
                     OR by information incrementally gathered from users;
                     OR by further databases (GIS services);
                     OR by interrogating an (incremental) database accessible from the
                     server where the app has been downloaded from, for its first installation;   [3]

      (ii)   Award up to [2 max].

             Award [1] for identifying a feature and award [1] for reasonable expansion of the
             feature up to [2 max].

             Example 1:
             The design of the front-end (the user interface) with the specific mobile
             device;
             So that the commands are specific (and built-in) within the device, to
             support interactive use;
             (With the effect that the app can be used across a range of devices and
             mobile operating systems;)

             Example 2:
             To personalize the app with a “history” on the client’s side, after the first use
             of the application;
             So that only the new information added in the database (underlying sources
             used by the app) can be fetched by the client’s script;                             [2]

(b)   (i)    Award up to [2 max].
             Number of hits;
             Popularity of linking pages;
             Amount of links to the same page departing from the source page;
             Trustworthiness of the linking domain;
             Relevance of content between source and target page;
             Time to download;
             …(there are others).                                                                [2]

      (ii)   Award up to [5 max].
             Old information is more likely to be retrieved by web crawlers;
             But this requires time to crawl;
             But this interferes with the response time for the current search;
             And it may even be penalised by policies in search engines;
             Without returning currently relevant information;
             Example of old information are old or broken links/orphan pages/old text
             masked by comments in the HTML code, and it can be revised from time to
             time;
             Cleanly written code allows for a more efficient search process;
             Which facilitates correct indexing;

             Note: Award [2 max] for a generic response.                                         [5]

(c)   Award up to [4 max].
      In P2P all machines can interchangeably be client as well as server (no division
      of client-server);
      Data and services can be replicated across sites, and be retrieved from them;
      Services are virtualized/reside on virtual machines;

      Therefore, if one node is unavailable the service can still be provided by resorting
      to other nodes;
      OR
      System updates can be made while not interrupting the provision of the service
      OR
      The failure of a node does not imply the failure of the entire network                     [4]

            Nodes represent URLs/web site/web pages;
            Each edge represents a direct link from one URLs/web sites/web pages to
            another;
            It is a small scale representation of some specific network of 16 nodes that can
            be part of the WWW;                                                                  [2]

      Collective intelligence refers to the large amount of knowledge/information that
      exists on the WWW;
      In areas such as blogs, wikis, forums (accept any suitable example);
      Text based searches are based on specific words/terms;
      Without considering the context / meaning that they are used in;
      Therefore a lot of irrelevant data would be retrieved / a lot of relevant data would
      be missed;
      The semantic web implies a different/standard way of representing data
      (audio/video/pictures);
      That allows the representation of knowledge (rather than data);
      So that more relevant information can be retrieved/collective intelligence can be
      utilized;
      And analysed directly by computers/machines;
      However, this doesn’t necessarily mean that all of the information retrieved is
      valid;
      As anyone can post on the web / not all information is correct/some might be
      biased;                                                                                [6]

Option D — Object-oriented programming

15.   (a)   public;
            Allows access to variables from outside of the class/unlimited access;

            protected;
            Allows access to variable from within the package (project) in which they are
            created/subclasses;

            final;
            Prevents variables from being modified;

            static;
            Refers to variables that act on the class as a whole (and not on individual
            objects);

            Note:
             Accept at most one example pertaining to methods.
             Do not accept two examples pertaining to the same modifier.                      [4]

      (b)   The OOP feature shown in the constructors (accept the 2 signatures) is
            overloading (accept polymorphism);
            The constructor methods have a different number / type of parameters / different
            parameters;
            The method calling the constructor / compiler will determine which of these
            methods is selected;
            By matching up with the parameters;                                                [4]

      (d)   Through the use of the (appropriate) array index / appropriate code description;

            Example:
            Individual object = allVisits[individual object’s location]                        [1]

            Award marks as follows:
            Signature;
            Correct comparison (allow use of getStatusNow());
            Return (that matches the signature – allow FT);

            Note:
             Allow the equivalent use of IF/THEN statements.
             Do not accept parameters to be passed.
             Do not allow the use of totalPoints.                                             [3]

            Award marks as follows:
            Declaring a new ArrayList (with or without the String identifier);
            Looping through the allPoints array;
            Testing for “Gold”;
            Loping through the allCustomers linked list (using the size or an iterator);
            Correct check for identical ids;
            Adding the email to the ArrayList;
            Returning the arraylist;                                                            [6 max]

            Note:
             Do not allow any methods that are not part of the LinkedList or ArrayList
              library classes – eg the length function for the linked list is invalid.
             Do not penalize more than once for omitting the “gets”.
             Allow the for loop: for (Customer currCust : allCustomers).
             Allow for loop instead of a while loop.

19.   (a)   The method calls itself;
            With a changing parameter;
            There is a base (terminating) case;                                          [2 max]

      (b)

                parameter passed to                        output

            Award marks as follows:
            Outputting 6 values;
            Correct parameter list
            First 3 output numbers correct;
            Last 3 output numbers correct;                                                   [4]

      (c)   An infinite loop / program will never end/terminate;
            Will eventually cause the program to crash;
            As it runs out of memory for the parameters stored / Stack overflow;
            As the base case is never reached;                                           [3 max]
