                                               Section B

Answer all questions.

11.   A medical centre uses a computer system to manage both patients’ data and appointments.
      This system, which is used by the doctors, nurses and secretaries, has two unordered files:
      a patients’ file and an appointments’ file, both of which can only be accessed sequentially.

      Every evening the following processing takes place:

      • a list of appointments for the next day is printed out
      • reminders are sent by SMS text messages to the patients’ mobile devices.

      (a)   Outline the pseudocode that the processing must follow when the system sends out the
            text reminders.                                                                         [5]

      (b)   Describe two different methods that the medical centre could use that would allow data
            to be restored should it be lost for any reason.                                        [4]

      The medical centre is concerned about the privacy of the data it is storing and has to make
      decisions concerning:

      • access to the data stored on this system
      • storing the data locally or through the use of a cloud service.

      (c)   Discuss the issues that should be considered before making these decisions.             [6]

12.   A company has expanded its office space into nearby rooms and has decided to set up a
      local area network (LAN) to support its operations.

      The LAN will connect the room where the server is installed to new computers in the
      additional office space. The network engineer produced the following Gantt chart for
      this task.

        computers with the cabling


      (a)   Define the term concurrent processing.[1]

      (b)   Identify two tasks that will be carried out concurrently.                                 [1]

      (c)   Identify two tasks that will be carried out sequentially.                                 [1]

      After 5 years the company decided to replace the LAN with a wireless local area network
      (WLAN).

      (d)   Outline two advantages, to this company, of installing a WLAN.                            [4]

      A WLAN will introduce additional security issues for the company.

      (e)   Discuss any two of these issues and the ways in which the company might
            resolve them.                                                                             [4]

      The company is considering expanding their network to allow employees to connect from
      anywhere in the world. The expanded network would need to provide security and allow the
      employees full functionality of the internal network.

      (f)   Explain how setting up a virtual private network (VPN) would provide a
            suitable solution.                                                                        [4]

13.   The names of students attending a science fair were recorded in a stack data structure as
      each one arrived.

                                               …

                                               Troy

                                               Mia

                                               Jane

                                               Rick

                                               Ryan

                                               Abed

                                               Zara

                                               Sophie


      The first item stored in the stack was “Sophie”.

      Note that “Troy” is currently in position 0 in the stack.

      (a)   Construct the pseudocode that will search the stack for a specific name, and output its
            position in the stack. You may assume that all names in the stack are unique.               [5]

      (b)   Explain the benefits of using a binary search tree, compared to a stack, when
            searching for a specific item.                                                              [3]

      If the tree is populated with the data from the stack, the first item popped off will become the
      root. For each subsequent item popped from the stack, a recursive procedure is followed
      until the item is correctly placed in the tree.

      (c)   Without writing code, describe this recursive procedure.                                    [4]

      (d)   By considering only the data visible in the stack shown above, sketch the binary search
            tree that has been created from the items removed from the stack.                           [3]

14.   A number of devices in and around the home can be operated by control systems.

      A home owner wishes to install automatic lights to illuminate a water fountain in her garden.
      These lights will automatically turn on at sunset and turn off at sunrise.

      (a)   Describe two hardware components that would be an essential part of this
            control system.                                                                            [4]

      (b)   Explain the concept of feedback, with respect to computer control systems in general.      [3]

      The home owner has also installed a control system that waters the flowerbeds in the
      garden. This system aims to maintain the water content of the flowerbeds between a
      minimum and a maximum value. However, the system is only activated when the light
      intensity is below a certain level.

      (c)   Outline the algorithm involved in controlling the watering system described above.         [5]

15.   A transport authority is investigating how many people use a certain direct train route.

      At the end of each day, the total number of passengers who travelled on this route is stored
      in a collection, PASSENGERS.

      The first item was written to the collection on Monday 1st May 2017.

       212

      The next items, collected on Tuesday and Wednesday, were added like this:

       212 		454			 342

      Data for 30 complete weeks was added to the collection.

      (a)    Construct pseudocode that will read PASSENGERS into the two-dimensional array,
             2D_ARRAY.[4]


       2D_ARRAY                          Monday          Tuesday       Wednesday            …
                                           [0]             [1]             [2]               …

       Week 1              [0]

       Week 2              [1]

       Week 3              [2]

       …                     …

      (b)    Construct the pseudocode for the procedure total, that takes as input a column
             number of this two-dimensional array and returns the sum of the elements in
             that column.                                                                           [4]

      The transport authority wish to know how many passengers, on average, travel on each day
      of the week.

      (c)    Using the procedure total construct the pseudocode to output the day of the week
             with the highest average number of passengers, and the value of this average.

             You should make use of the sub procedure convert() which converts the numbers
             0 to 6 into days of the week, for example convert(1) will return “Tuesday”.            [3]

      The transport authority stores details about the ticket prices in a one-dimensional array,
      FEES, where FEES[0] contains the price of a ticket for Monday to Friday, while FEES[1]
      contains the price of a ticket for Saturday and Sunday.

      The procedure salesCalculate() takes as input the column and row indices that define
      two specific days during the 30 weeks, and outputs the total amount of money generated
      from ticket sales between those two days (inclusive).

      (d)    Construct, in pseudocode, the procedure salesCalculate().[7]
