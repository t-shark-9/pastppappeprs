                                              Section A
1.   (a)   Outline the evidence that CO2 acts as a greenhouse gas.                                   [1]

           CO2 absorbs (outgoing) longwave/IR radiation/heat elevating global temperatures;

           Accept references to climate / CO2 data as causal link, eg increase in global CO2
           levels correlate with rises in global temperatures.

     (b)   State a greenhouse gas other than CO2.                                                    [1]

           methane / water vapour / nitrous oxide / tropospheric ozone / CFCs / HCFCs /
           HFCs;

           NB if candidate names more than one gas only the first one should be assessed
           (even if the first is wrong and a later one is correct).

     (c)   Outline how the mitigation strategy shown in Figure 1 is different to an adaptation
           strategy for managing climate change.                                                     [2]

           the mitigation strategy reduces the cause of climate change by removing
           CO2/greenhouse gas from atmosphere;
           whereas an adaptation strategy reduces negative/maximises positive impacts of
           climate change / addresses impacts rather than causes of climate change;

           Responses may involve giving examples of either mitigation or adaptation
           strategies, but to gain the [2 max] they must include the characteristic/distinguishing
           feature of both mitigation and adaptation (ie “reducing cause” and “addressing
           impacts”, respectively).

     (d)   Identify two mitigation strategies to manage climate change, other than carbon
           capture and storage.                                                                      [2]

           reducing energy/fossil fuel consumption through carbon tax/cap & trade;
           reducing emissions of NOx/methane/through catalytic converters/regulations;
           alternative energy sources;
           geoengineering;
           fertilizing oceans;
           afforestation/biomass production;

           Award [1] for each correct answer that will reduce emission/concentration of GHGs
           in atmosphere, up to [2 max].

     (e)   Outline how the Flows 1 and 2 shown in Figure 1 may contribute to the capture and
           storage of atmospheric carbon.                                                            [2]

           (both) flows remove CO2 released by smokestacks/power plants/fossil fuel
           combustion / store waste CO2 underground/beneath impermeable rock/in saline/oil
           reservoirs;
           however, Flow 2 is associated with extraction of fossil fuels that will release more
           CO2 (on combustion);

           Award [1] for each correct answer, up to [2 max].
                                                    –4–                 M18/4/ENVSO/SP2/ENG/TZ0/XX/M


2.   (a)   State the soil texture that has the following composition: 20 % clay; 55 % silt;
           25 % sand.                                                                                   [1]

           silt loam;

           NB if candidate names more than one soil type, examiners should only assess the
           first one listed (even if the first is wrong and a later one is correct).

     (b)   Describe how the addition of sand to a silty clay loam could alter its characteristics
           for healthy plant growth.                                                                [2 max]

           Positive effects:
           it will increase drainage / prevent water-logging;
           it will increase infiltration/permeability / reduce loss of water through run-off;
           it will increase porosity/air spaces/reduce soil compaction providing more O2 to
           roots;
           it would allow for increase flow/availability of nutrients;
           it will promote detritivore/decomposer/mycorrhizal/microbial communities;
           it will allow for easier root penetration;

           Negative effects:
           it will reduce water-holding capacity so less water for plants;
           it will increase possibility of leaching, reducing minerals for plants;
           it will reduce stability of soil giving less anchorage to plants;

           Award [1] for each correct answer, up to [2 max].
           Although question implies positive effects on soil, credit can be given for negative
           effects as long as candidates make this clear as in MPs given above.
                                                      –5–                  M18/4/ENVSO/SP2/ENG/TZ0/XX/M


(c)   (i)   Draw a flow diagram to show the flows of leaching and decomposition associated
            with the mineral storage in the “A” horizon.                                                  [2 max]


                                         Decomposition




                                           A Horizon




                                            Leaching

                    Award [1] for each correctly labelled flow with arrows in the right direction.

            (ii)    Identify one other input to the mineral storage in the “A” horizon.                     [N/R]

                    leaching/mineral flow/eluviation through from O horizon;
                    nitrogen fixation (ie of N diffusing in from atmosphere);
                    addition of inorganic/nitrate/phosphate fertilizer;
                    capillary flow up from B horizon;

                    Do not credit use of simply “fertilizers” or organic fertilizer/compost etc as this
                    would be an input from decomposition. Do not credit “water” as an input.

            (iii)   Identify one other output from the mineral storage in the “A” horizon.                    [1]

                    uptake of minerals by plants;
                    soil erosion;
                    denitrification;
                    human activities of mining/soil extraction;
                    immobilization/microbial conversion of inorganic to organic;

                    Do not credit cropping/deforestation (as in themselves they are a loss of
                    biomass, not mineral storage). Do not credit drainage/percolation
                    (synonymous with leaching).
                    Award [1] for correct answer, up to [1 max].

      (d)   Outline why leaving arable farmland fallow (unused) between growing seasons
            could lead to soil degradation.                                                               [2 max]

            roots no longer hold soil in place/stabilize soil;
            soil surface uncovered/more exposed to wind/water erosion;
            uninterrupted rainfall/percolation will increase leaching of minerals;
            greater evaporation may lead to salinization;
            reduction/change in soil fauna/microbes;
            lack of veg cover may lead to greater evaporation/drying out of soil;

            Award [1] for each correct answer, up to [2 max].
                                                 –6–                  M18/4/ENVSO/SP2/ENG/TZ0/XX/M


3.   (a)   Identify one producer in the system illustrated in Figure 3.                             [1]

           algae/seaweed/sea grass;

     (b)   Outline one reason why aquaculture production has increased globally.                    [1]

           increased food demand from increasing population/affluence;
           health benefits / change of diet preferences;
           depletion of marine fisheries / considered more sustainable;
           limited arable land for food production;
           more economically efficient/profitable;
           requires less resources/expertise (boats, fishermen, etc) than wild fisheries;
           technology/technological methods have improved;

           Award [1 max].

     (c)   Describe two negative environmental impacts that may arise from integrated
           aquaculture.                                                                         [2 max]

           escaped fish impact wild stocks through genetic degradation/disease/competition;
           high density populations lead to more disease;
           farmed species may consume/displace food species for local populations;
           loss/degradation of habitat due to clearance for aquaculture / nets/cages may
           trap/endanger local species;
           introduction of non-native species;
           pollution due to use of medication/growth hormones/pesticides;

           NB do not credit high nutrients/eutrophication/low diversity/high BOD or any other
           impacts that integrated agriculture actually limits or reduces (as indicated in
           responses to 3d below).
           Award [1] for each correct answer identified, up to [2 max].

     (d)   Explain why this system may cause fewer environmental impacts than systems that
           farm only fish.                                                                 [4 max]

           polyculture helps maintain biodiversity/complexity/resilience in the environment;
           (polyculture) allows for species to recycle wastes of other species;
           lobsters/mussels will reduce particles of organic waste/faecal matter/excess feed;
           (reduction of particles will) reduce BOD/decomposition and oxygen consumption;
           filtration by the mussels will improve water clarity/photosynthesis;
           cropping/harvesting algae will prevent build-up of nutrients/eutrophication;
           algae will absorb excess CO2 reducing acidification of water;
           algae will release oxygen limiting anaerobic conditions;
           food is provided naturally from within system/feeds made up from wild
           populations are not required;

           Award [1] for each correct answer identified, up to [4 max].
                                                 –7–                 M18/4/ENVSO/SP2/ENG/TZ0/XX/M


                                              Section B
Part (c) questions in Section B are all to be assessed using the markbands on page 21 with the
guidance given below for each question.

4.   (a)   Outline how four different factors influence the resilience of an ecosystem.             [4 max]

           Valid factors:
           greater diversity of components/species increases resilience;
           complexity of interactions/developed food webs increase resilience;
           establishment of keystone species increases resilience;
           larger storages/stores / more abundant/productive resources (nutrients, water,
           sunlight, reproductive rates, biomass etc) increase resilience (NB for credit, there
           must be indication of abundance in these resources, and if multiple examples are
           given like those in brackets, there is still only [1 max] allowed for this MP);
           larger size of the system increases resilience;
           strong negative feedback systems increase resilience;
           strong positive feedback mechanisms may decrease resilience;
           human impact degrading structure/diversity/abundance will decrease resilience;
           a steady state equilibrium/balanced inputs and outputs (as in climax communities)
           increases resilience;
           systems being close to a tipping point decrease resilience;

           Accept converse statements.
           Award [1] for each correct factor identified, up to [4 max].
           If valid factors are identified, but their effect on resilience is not, award [1] for
           each TWO factors up to [2 max] (ie FOUR factors). Eg identifying TWO factors and
           their effect on resilience, along with TWO factors but no specified effect would score
           [2+1=3] total OR eg TWO factors and their effect, along with ONE with no effect
           would score [2+0=2] total OR eg FOUR factors with no effect ([1+1=2] total).

     (b)   Explain how a community of trees in a woodland may be considered a system.               [7 max]

           A community of trees in a woodland has the following features of a system:
           individuals/species of trees are the components of the system;
           these components are interrelated/interdependent/form an integrated whole;
           eg may regulate populations through competition / contribute to succession of
           community;
           it has flows/transfers of matter/energy between components/storages;
           eg leaf fall may provide nutrients through decomposition to other trees /
           pollination/genes/food storage in seeds / glucose is transported from leaves around
           tree;
           components carry out processes/transformations;
           eg photosynthesis/respiration/growth;
           it is an open system exchanging matter and energy with surroundings;
           eg absorption of solar energy / provision of nutrients for non-tree species (NB mark
           for either example of matter or energy, not both);
           it has feedback mechanisms to maintain equilibrium/balanced inputs and outputs;
           eg more seed production → more competition between seedlings → fewer viable
           offspring / death of trees → more light entering canopy → more tree growth;

           Award [1] for each correct suggestion, up to [7 max].
           Award [4 max] for identifying relevant generic features of system (given above) and
           [4 max] for examples of these within a tree community (beware of responses
           that are looking at entire woodland ecosystem as a system rather than the tree
           community alone). Credit alternative examples of equivalent validity/relevance and
           detail.

(c)   Disturbance of the composition and processes of the atmospheric system through human
            activity always disturbs the equilibria of marine systems.

           Discuss the validity of this statement with reference to named examples.                  [9 max]

           The following guide for using the markbands suggests certain features that may be
           offered in responses. The five headings coincide with the criteria given in each of
           the markbands (although “ESS terminology” has been conflated with “Understanding
           concepts”). This guide simply provides some possible inclusions and should not be
           seen as requisite or comprehensive. It outlines the kind of elements to look for when
           deciding on the appropriate markband and the specific mark within that band.

           Answers may include:

           • understanding concepts & terminology of greenhouse gases; global warming;
             thermal expansion; rising sea-level; melting ice caps; salinity; ocean acidification;
             ozone depletion; UV radiation; global productivity; tropospheric ozone; acid rain
             (worth noting here that acid rain is NOT a significant cause/contributor to ocean
             acidification); etc
           • breadth in addressing and linking impacts on atmospheric systems (increased
             CO2; global warming; ozone depletion; tropospheric ozone; acid rain; etc) with
             disturbances in marine systems (rising sea level; ocean currents; fish migration;
             acidification; destruction of coral reefs; phytoplankton / marine food chains; etc)
           • examples of relevant atmospheric pollutants/disturbances; ocean currents; coral
             communities; migratory fish; marine food chains; etc
           • balanced analysis of the extent to which each atmospheric disturbance causes
             disturbance in marine systems whether significant, minimal or none at all,
             acknowledging relevant counter-arguments/alternative viewpoints;
           • a conclusion that is consistent with, and supported by analysis and
             examples given e.g. generally, the statement is valid regarding large scale
             disturbances to the atmosphere such as global warming and ozone depletion but
             more localized disturbances like tropospheric ozone and acid rain have fairly
             minimal impact; NB This is only an example of a possible conclusion. Candidates’
             conclusions do not have to agree.

           Please see markbands on page 21.

5.   (a)   Distinguish between the terms niche and habitat with reference to a named species. [4 max]

           habitat is the kind of (biotic and abiotic) environment in which a species normally
           lives;
           eg lions are found in tropical grasslands;
           whereas its niche refers to all its interactions with its (biotic and abiotic)
           environment;
           eg the prey that it eats / its vulnerability to parasites / access to fresh water;
           habitat may be shared by many species / niche is more limited to a single species;
           eg different cat species inhabit tropical grasslands but only lions hunt in groups and
           so tend to take larger prey;

           Award [2 max] if no examples are given. “Role of species within ecosystem” would
           be acceptable as definition of species, but not “job” which is anthropomorphic and
           only addresses impact of species on system, not the mutual relationship.
           Accept any relevant/valid/equivalently detailed examples to those given.
           Award [1] for each correct answer, up to [4 max].

     (b)   Suggest the procedures needed to collect data for the construction of a pyramid of
           numbers for the following food chain:

                               Plants       Snails       Birds                                      [7 max]

           quadrats can be used for counting/sampling snail/plant populations;
           need to be randomly distributed within area of system;
           total estimated by multiplying mean of samples by total area/sample area;
           mark–release–recapture/Lincoln index can be used for bird/snail species;
           individuals are caught using traps/nets/bait;
           individuals marked by some means that is indelible/harmless/easily visible to
           investigators;
           individuals released/allowed to redistribute before resetting traps;
           ratio of marked : unmarked in recapture is recorded and used to estimate total
           population;
           bird populations may be estimated by aerial photographs/birdsong recordings that
           allow capture/recapture analysis;
           bars/histograms proportional to each total population are drawn;

           Award [1] for each correct suggestion, up to [7 max].
           Accept alternative procedures of equivalent validity.

(c)   Quantitative models are frequently constructed to show the flow of energy and
      cycling of matter in natural systems.

      To what extent can these models be useful in assessing the sustainability of named
      food production systems.                                                           [9 max]

      seen as requisite or comprehensive. It outlines the kind of elements to look for when
      deciding on the appropriate markband and the specific mark within that band.

      Answers may demonstrate:

      • understanding concepts & terminology of models; energy flow through trophic
        levels; mineral cycles; sustainability; gross and net productivity; sustainable yield;
        natural capital and income; stock; storages; energy loss; harvesting; depletion of
        minerals; desertification; inorganic fertilizers; run-off; eutrophication; irrigation;
        leaching; etc
      • breadth in addressing and linking models of energy flow and cycles of matter
        with balance of inputs and outputs; sustainability; agricultural strategies/activities;
        impacts related to energy flow / mineral cycles; other impacts; limitations of
        models; etc
      • examples of a food production system; associated agricultural practices
        (sustainable and unsustainable); impacts addressed by models of energy flow /
        mineral cycles; other impacts; etc
      • balanced analysis of ways in which models of energy flow and mineral cycles
        reveal sustainability of the food production system or fail to address them
        accurately, acknowledging relevant counter-arguments/alternative viewpoints;
      • a conclusion that is consistent with, and supported by analysis and
        examples given eg these models are very effective at quantifying certain
        aspects of food production related to balancing inputs and outputs but there are
        many peripheral unsustainable aspects such as soil erosion, transport, use of
        pesticides that they do not address; NB This is only an example of a possible
        conclusion. Candidates’ conclusions do not have to agree.

6.   (a)   With reference to named examples, distinguish between a primary and secondary
           pollutant.                                                                              [4 max]

           a primary pollutant is one which is active on emission / directly impacts the
           environment;
           eg CO2 is released from burning fossil fuels and actively contributes to global
           warming / CFCs are released from aerosols and actively contribute to ozone
           depletion;
           a secondary pollutant is one formed from a primary pollutant through
           physical/chemical change;
           eg CO2 combines with sea water to form carbonic acid that leads to impacts on
           calciferous shelled organisms or corals / NOx combines with water to form acid
           precipitation / NO2 forms PAN/ozone (that contributes to photochemical smog);

           Award [2 max] if no examples are given.
           Examples of primary pollutants need to include their direct impact (eg NOx can be
           either primary or secondary without such specification) and examples of secondary
           need to include the process leading to their pollutionary impact).
           Award [1 max] for example of primary, and [1 max] for example of secondary.

     (b)   Explain how organic waste may be an effective fertilizer in terrestrial systems but a
           source of pollution in aquatic systems.                                                 [7 max]

           In terrestrial systems [4 max]:
           organic waste such as cattle manure/compost can be added to soil as fertilizer;
           its decomposition releases nitrates/phosphates/nutrients that promote plant growth;
           the slow release will help to prevent run-off/eutrophication/red tide/algal bloom of
           water bodies;
           improves soil quality/structure / making it less prone to erosion/compaction /
           increases plowability;
           it is similar to the natural organic waste in a terrestrial system so may not be a
           pollutant;

           In aquatic systems [4 max]:
           organic waste eg sawdust/domestic sewage/agricultural run-off can be discharged
           into aquatic systems;
           increases turbidity/floats on surface/algal growth reduces light penetration and
           primary productivity of system;
           its decomposition leads to bacterial absorption of O2 / adds high BOD reducing O2
           availability;
           this is a limiting factor in aquatic (not terrestrial) systems (negatively) impacting
           aquatic life;
           (decomposition also) releases nitrates/phosphates/nutrients leading to
           eutrophication/red tide/algal blooms;
           domestic sewage/sawmill effluent may contain non-biodegradable organic
           pollutants/toxins/pathogens;
           can pollute drinking water sources for human populations/animal species;

           Award [1] for each correct explanation, up to [7 max].

(c)   To what extent can different environmental value systems contribute to both causing
      and resolving the problem of water scarcity?                                        [9 max]

      The following guide for using the markbands suggests certain features that may be
      offered in responses. The five headings coincide with the criteria given in each of
      the markbands (although “ESS terminology” has been conflated with “Understanding
      concepts”). This guide simply provides some possible inclusions and should not be
      seen as requisite or comprehensive. It outlines the kind of elements to look for when
      deciding on the appropriate markband and the specific mark within that band.

      Answers may demonstrate:

      • understanding concepts & terminology of environmental value systems;
        technocentric; anthropocentric; ecocentric; pro-growth agenda; intensive
        agriculture; unsustainable extraction; industrialization; water contamination;
        climate change and rainfall patterns; desalination; rainwater harvesting; water
        taxes; grey-water cycling; etc
      • breadth in addressing and linking range of environmental value systems with
        impacts of unsustainable extraction; contamination; distribution of water supply
        and solutions through technology; changes in behaviour; social controls; etc
      • examples of value systems; impacts on water availability; specific strategies for
        addressing water scarcity; appropriate technology; etc
      • balanced analysis of extent to which different value systems have promoted
        causes of water scarcity and/or effectively addressed resolving the issue;
        acknowledging relevant counter-arguments/alternative viewpoints;
      • a conclusion that is consistent with, and supported by analysis and
        examples given eg it is the technocentric pro-growth agenda that has largely
        contributed to the problem of water scarcity and while technocentric solutions are
        available to address it, it is only the ecocentric solutions that address the root
        cause and attempt to curb consumption; NB This is only an example of a possible
        conclusion. Candidates’ conclusions do not have to agree.

7.   (a)   Outline four different ways in which the value of named resources have changed
           over time.                                                                          [4 max]

           cultural influence eg rising environmental awareness led to value of straw as
           building material;
           social influence eg animal rights leading to devaluing of animal furs in fashion;
           economic influence eg increased investment in industrial processes led to higher
           value of fossil fuels;
           technological influences eg progress in nuclear technology led to higher value of
           uranium;
           political influences eg increasing concern for energy security in US has led to
           devaluing of oil / increased value of tar sands;
           ecological influences eg greater understanding of ecosystems/ecology has led to
           high value attached to biodiversity;

           NB As question does not specify further, and syllabus makes reference to
           marketable value (price), responses made in such terms should be credited.
           Award [1 max] if four influences are identified without examples.
           Award [1] for each correct reason identified, up to [4 max].
           Valid influences/reasons may not be categorized in precisely the same way as
           above, but examples need to demonstrate different kinds of influence to gain
           separate credit.

(b)   The use of renewable resources is not always sustainable due to the activities
      involved in their production.

      Justify this statement for a named source of renewable energy.                         [7 max]

      eg hydropower (accept other valid examples of renewable energy):
      hydropower is renewable because the water flow is replenished by the water
      cycle;
      building the dam will inhibit migration of fish reducing their populations;
      involve the flooding/destruction of terrestrial ecosystems;
      cause sedimentation that will lead to more flooding upstream;
      involve use of non-renewable building materials;
      construction/maintenance involves heavy use of fossil fuels/GHG production;
      reduced downstream flow threatening riverine populations/species;
      (reduced downstream flow threatening) associated terrestrial systems dependent on water
      flow eg floodplains/wetlands;
      building of access roads/growth of recreational activity may lead to damage of
      terrestrial/riparian systems;
      may increase water loss/scarcity through increased evaporation rates;
      impacts of dam may reduce sustainability of local populations through eg reduced
      fishing/breeding ground for parasites/loss of agricultural land;

      eg solar energy:
      solar energy is renewable because of continuous input/insolation;
      energy for panel construction/extraction of silicon involves use of fossil fuels/GHG
      production;
      production utilizes plastics derived from (non-renewable) fossil fuels;
      manufacture results in plastic waste that is non-biodegradable;
      require metals/elements that are non-renewable resources;
      (metals/elements) extracted through mining that damages habitats/ecosystems;
      manufacture involves use/production of many industrial toxins/hazardous waste;
      manufacture/operation requires considerable water supply (for cooling etc);
      transport of materials for manufacture/installation impacts environment;
      limited life span/decommissioning will lead to further waste;
      solar farms can take up/displace large areas of natural ecosystems;

      Award [3 max] if example of energy source is non-renewable or unnamed.
      Award [1] for each correct answer given above or for any other points of
      equivalent relevance, validity and significance, up to [7 max].
      If candidate addresses more than one valid resource, limit total credit to highest
      scoring one.

(c)   Increasing concern for energy security is likely to lead to more sustainable energy
      choices.

      Discuss the validity of this statement, with reference to named countries.               [9 max]

      The following guide for using the markbands suggests certain features that may be

      Answers may include:

      • understanding concepts & terminology of energy security; renewable/
        non-renewable energy; sustainability; fossil fuels; nuclear; solar, biomass,
        hydropower, wind, wave, tidal or geothermal energy; emissions; etc
      • breadth in addressing and linking different countries’ issues of energy security
        with their energy choices and the relative sustainability of renewable/
        non-renewable energy sources; etc
      • examples of renewable/non-renewable energy sources; countries’ energy
        choices; issues of energy security; impacts of exploiting energy resources; etc
      • balanced analysis of whether energy choices driven by concern for energy
        security are more or less sustainable; acknowledging relevant
        counter-arguments/alternative viewpoints;
      • a conclusion that is consistent with, and supported by analysis and
        examples given eg although more sustainable renewable energy choices will
        usually provide energy security, in some countries, because of local availability of
        non-renewable sources, the concern for security has been met by less
        sustainable sources eg US exploitation of tar sands; NB This is only an example
        of a possible conclusion. Candidates’ conclusions do not have to agree.
