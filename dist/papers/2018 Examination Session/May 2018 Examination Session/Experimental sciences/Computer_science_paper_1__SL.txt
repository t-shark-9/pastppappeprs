Answer all questions.

10.   A medical centre uses a computer system to manage both patients’ data and appointments.
      This system, which is used by the doctors, nurses and secretaries, has two unordered files:
      a patients’ file and an appointments’ file, both of which can only be accessed sequentially.

      Every evening the following processing takes place:

      • a list of appointments for the next day is printed out
      • reminders are sent by SMS text messages to the patients’ mobile devices.

      (a)   Outline the pseudocode that the processing must follow when the system sends out the
            text reminders.                                                                         [5]

      (b)   Describe two different methods that the medical centre could use that would allow data
            to be restored should it be lost for any reason.                                        [4]

      The medical centre is concerned about the privacy of the data it is storing and has to make
      decisions concerning:

      • access to the data stored on this system
      • storing the data locally or through the use of a cloud service.

      (c)   Discuss the issues that should be considered before making these decisions.             [6]

11.   A company has expanded its office space into nearby rooms and has decided to set up a
      local area network (LAN) to support its operations.

      The LAN will connect the room where the server is installed to new computers in the
      additional office space. The network engineer produced the following Gantt chart for
      this task.

        of new office space

        Connect the new
        computers with the cabling


      (a)   Define the term concurrent processing.[1]

      (b)   Identify two tasks that will be carried out concurrently.                                 [1]

      (c)   Identify two tasks that will be carried out sequentially.                                 [1]

      After 5 years the company decided to replace the LAN with a wireless local area network
      (WLAN).

      (d)   Outline two advantages, to this company, of installing a WLAN.                            [4]

      A WLAN will introduce additional security issues for the company.

      (e)   Discuss any two of these issues and the ways in which the company might
            resolve them.                                                                             [4]

      The company is considering expanding their network to allow employees to connect from
      anywhere in the world. The expanded network would need to provide security and allow the
      employees full functionality of the internal network.

      (f)   Explain how setting up a virtual private network (VPN) would provide a
            suitable solution.                                                                        [4]



                                                                                                 Turn over

12.   (a)    The collection DATA contains the following data:

                                       2, 4, 1, −2, −4, 1, 0

             Consider the following pseudocode:

             COUNTER = 0
             SUM = 0
             DATA.resetNext()
             loop for X from 0 to 6
               if DATA.getNext() > 0
             		 ARRAY[X] = DATA.getNext()
             		 COUNTER = COUNTER + 1
             		 SUM = SUM + ARRAY[X]
               end if
             end loop
             output SUM/COUNTER

             Trace the pseudocode using the table below:                                              [4]

                 X         ARRAY[X]           COUNTER             SUM            output




      A transport authority is investigating how many people use a certain direct train route, which
      is used every day of the week.

      At the end of each day, the total number of passengers who travelled on this route is stored
      in a collection, PASSENGERS.

      The first item was written to the collection on Monday 1st January 2018.

       212

      The next items, collected on Tuesday and Wednesday, were added like this:

       212 		454			 342

      (b)    Assuming that the first item read from the collection is from Monday 1st January 2018,
             construct pseudocode that will read PASSENGERS into an array, P_ARRAY.[4]

      (c)    Using P_ARRAY, construct pseudocode to output the day of the week with the highest
             average number of passengers. Use the sub procedure convert() which converts
             the numbers 0 to 6 into days of the week, for example convert(1) will return “Tuesday”.

             Note: you should not assume that data for an exact number of weeks is stored.            [7]
