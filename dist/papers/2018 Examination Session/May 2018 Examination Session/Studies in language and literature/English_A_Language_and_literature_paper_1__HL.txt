            In a high-ceilinged laboratory at Children’s National Health System in Washington, D.C., a
            gleaming white robot stitches up pig intestines.

            The thin pink tissue dangles like a deflated balloon from a sturdy plastic loop. Two bulky
            cameras watch from above as the bot weaves green thread in and out, slowly sewing together
     5      two sections. Like an experienced human surgeon, the robot places each suture deftly,
            precisely — and with intelligence.
                                                    –3–                   M18/1/AYENG/HP1/ENG/TZ0/XX


           Or something close to it.

           For robots, artificial intelligence means more than just “brains”. Sure, computers can learn how
           to recognize faces or beat humans in strategy games. But the body matters too. In humans,
     10    eyes and ears and skin pick up cues from the environment, like the glow of a campfire or the
           patter of falling raindrops. People use these cues to take action: to dodge a wayward spark or
           huddle close under an umbrella.

           Part of intelligence is “walking around and picking things up and opening doors and stuff,” says
           Cornell computer scientist Bart Selman. It “has to do with our perception and our physical
     15    being”. For machines to function fully on their own, without humans calling the shots, getting
           physical is essential. Today’s robots aren’t there yet — not even close — but amping up1 the
           senses could change that.

           “If we’re going to have robots in the world, in our home,
           interacting with us and exploring the environment, they
     20    absolutely have to have sensing,” says Stanford roboticist
           Mark Cutkosky. He and a group of like-minded scientists
           are making sensors for robotic feet and fingers and skin —
           and are even helping robots learn how to use their bodies,
           like babies first grasping how to squeeze a parent’s finger.

     25    The goal is to build robots that can make decisions based
           on what they’re sensing around them — robots that can
           gauge the force needed to push open a door or figure out
           how to step carefully on a slick sidewalk. Eventually, such
           robots could work like humans, perhaps even caring for the
     30    elderly.

           Such machines of the future are a far cry from that shiny
           white surgery robot in the D.C. lab, essentially an arm atop
           a cart. But today’s fledgling2 sensing robots mark the slow
           awakening of machines to the world around them, and
     35    themselves.

           “By adding just a little bit of awareness to the machine,” says pediatric surgeon Peter Kim of
           the children’s hospital, “there’s a huge amount of benefit to gain.”

           TIKTOK AND
          THE NOME KING

                 HE Nome1 King was unpleasantly angry. He had carelessly bitten his tongue at
                 breakfast and it still hurt; so he roared and raved and stamped around in his underground
                 palace in a way that rendered him very disagreeable.

         It so happened that on this unfortunate day Tiktok, the Clockwork Man, visited the Nome King to
  5      ask a favor. Tiktok lived in the Land of Oz, and although he was an active and important person,
         he was made entirely of metal. Machinery within him, something like the works of a clock, made
         him move; other machinery made him talk; still other machinery made him think.

         Although so cleverly constructed, the Clockwork Man was far from perfect.
         Three separate keys wound up his motion machinery, his speech works, and
 10      his thoughts. One or more of these contrivances was likely to run down at
         a critical moment, leaving poor Tiktok helpless. Also some of his parts were
         wearing out, through much use, and just now his thought machinery needed
         repair. The skillful little Wizard of Oz had tinkered with Tiktok’s thoughts
         without being able to get them properly regulated, so he had advised the
 15      Clockwork Man to go to the Nome King and secure a new set of springs,
         which would render his thoughts more elastic and responsive.
         “Be careful what you say to the Nome King,” warned the Wizard. “He has a
         bad temper and the least little thing makes him angry.”
         Tiktok promised, and the Wizard wound his machinery and set him walking in the direction of
 20      the Nome King’s dominions, just across the desert from the Land of Oz. He ran down just as
         he reached the entrance to the underground palace, and there Kaliko, the Nome King’s Chief
         Steward, found him and wound him up again.
         “I want to see the King,” said Tiktok, in his jerky voice.
         “Well,” remarked Kaliko, “it may be safe for a cast-iron person like you to face his Majesty this
 25      morning; but you must announce yourself, for should I show my face inside the jewel-studded
         cavern where the King is now raving, I’d soon look like a dish of mashed potatoes, and be of no
         further use to anyone.”
         “I’m not a-fraid,” said Tiktok.
         “Then walk in and make yourself at home,” answered Kaliko, and threw open
 30      the door of the King’s cavern.

         Tiktok promptly walked in and faced the astonished Nome King, to whom he
         said: “Good morn-ing. I want two new steel springs for my thought-works and
         a new cog-wheel for my speech-pro-du-cer. How a-bout it, your Maj-es-ty?”
         The Nome King growled a menacing growl and his eyes were red with rage.
 35      “How dare you enter my presence?” he shouted.
         “I dare an-y-thing,” said Tiktok. “I’m not a-fraid of a fat Nome.”
                                                     –5–                  M18/1/AYENG/HP1/ENG/TZ0/XX


         This was true, yet an unwise speech. Had Tiktok’s thoughts been in good
         working order he would have said something else. The angry Nome King
         quickly caught up his heavy mace2 and hurled it straight at Tiktok. When it
    40   struck the metal man’s breast, the force of the blow burst the bolts which held
         the plates of his body together and they clattered to the floor in a score of
         pieces. Hundreds and hundreds of wheels, pins, cogs and springs filled the
         air like a cloud and then rattled like hail upon the floor.
         Where Tiktok had stood was now only a scrap-heap and the Nome King was
    45   so amazed by the terrible effect of his blow that he stared in wonder.

             By the time John Miller realized just how many bees were dying, the almonds were in bloom
             and there was nothing to be done. It was February 2005, and the hives should have been
             singing with activity, plump brown honeybees working doggedly to carry pollen from blossom
             to blossom. Instead they were wandering in drunken circles at the base of the hive doors,
      5      wingless, desiccated, sluggish. Miller is accustomed to death on a large scale. Even when
             things are going well, a hive can lose 1,000 bees a day. In a matter of weeks, Miller lost almost
             half of his 13,000 hives – around 300 million bees.

             When it happened, Miller was in California’s Central Valley, where each February, when the
             almond trees burst into extravagant pink-and-white bloom, hundreds of beekeepers descend
     10      with billions of bees. More than 580,000 acres of almonds flower simultaneously there, and
             wild pollinators such as bumblebees, beetles, bats and wasps simply cannot transport enough
             pollen from tree to tree. Instead, almond growers depend on traveling beekeepers who, like
             retirees, winter in warm places such as California and Florida, and head north to the Dakotas in
             the summer, where fields of afalfa and clover produce the most coveted honey.

     15      This annual bee migration isn’t just a curiosity; it’s the glue that holds much of modern
             agriculture together. Without the bees’ pollination services, California’s almond trees – the
             state’s top export crop – would produce 40 pounds of almonds per acre; with bees, they can
             generate 2,400 pounds. Honeybees provide the same service for more than 100 other crops,
             from lettuce to cranberries to oranges to canola, up and down the West Coast.
                                                    –7–                   M18/1/AYENG/HP1/ENG/TZ0/XX

    20    Miller likes to call the annual pilgrimage of the beekeepers the “native migrant tour,” and he
          likes to call himself the tour’s “padrone1”. He is not the biggest beekeeper in the United States,
          nor is he the most politically connected – South Dakota’s Richard Adee, with his 70,000 hives
          wins that distinction. But Miller does, like the gentle, dark Carniolan bees he tends, have
          impeccable breeding. His apian2 pedigree dates back to 1894, when his great-grandfather,
    25    a farmer named Nephi Ephraim Miller, traded a few bushels of oats for seven boxes of bees.
          Nephi found he had a talent for beekeeping, and in 1907, he traveled from Utah to California
          to learn more efficient ways to process his swelling supplies of beeswax. While there, he
          noticed that California bees gathered nectar long after those in Utah had huddled in for winter.
          It occurred to him that if he shipped his bees somewhere warm in the cold months, he might
    30    halve his winter losses and double his honey production. This innovation paved the way for
          migratory beekeeping, which permitted the harvest of previously inconceivable amounts of
          honey. Nephi Miller was the first to enlist rail cars for long distance transport, and in only a few
          years he produced the first million-pound crop of honey, brought beekeeping into the industrial
          age and inspired generations of beekeepers to follow suit. He was, in short, the Henry Ford3 of
    35    the apiaries.

          Today, some elements of a commercial beekeeper’s life remain the same. John Miller’s bees
          ply some of the same fields that hosted his great-grandfather’s hives. He sells his honey on
          a handshake to the same processors his grandfather used and competes with the sons of the
          same men his father vied against. He spends 300 days a year with his bees and gets stung
    40    almost every day, as many as 50 times on a bad day. Just the same, he counts bees among
          his most reliable companions. “I understand bees,” he says, “I don’t understand people very
          well.”

          Recently however, even the simple task of understanding has become more difficult. The
          beekeeper’s biggest enemy in recent years has been a miniature, blood-red arachnid called the
    45    varroa mite. A remarkably adaptive, ticklike creature, the mite burrows into the unborn brood
          and adults alike, feeding, as a tick does, on the bee’s body fluids. It is, said Miller, a sinister
          predation that slowly saps the strength and vigor from a hive, either killing the brood outright or
          causing deformities that weaken adult bees and make them more susceptible to viruses. And
          this mite is – besides labor, pasture, honey prices, pollination prices, bacteria, fungi, unpleasant
    50    neighbors and other invading insects – what beekeepers think most about these days. “This is
          going to be the challenge of my career, there is no question about that. My grandfather never
          heard of it; my dad was barely aware of it; it occupies much of my problem-solving time. This
          varroa mite,” said Miller, “swaggers like a colossus4 across beekeeping in North America.”

                                         Why bees matter
                                         Bees pollinate flowers, plants and crops that support other species
                                         (including humans). Without bees, our economy and the future wellbeing of
                                         our children and grandchildren would be at risk.

                                         That’s why it’s so worrying that 20 bee species have become extinct in the
                                         UK since 1900 and a further 35 are on the threatened species list.

                                         Three reasons Britain’s bees need your help today:

                                            The loss of habitat is the most pressing problem facing British bees:
                                            97% of our vital grasslands have been lost in the past 60 years.
                                            Bees pollinate 75% of our main food crops worldwide, including some
                                            of our favourite produce like apples, strawberries and tomatoes.
                                            Scientists estimate that it would cost over £1.8 billion every single year
                                            to pollinate UK crops by hand.
