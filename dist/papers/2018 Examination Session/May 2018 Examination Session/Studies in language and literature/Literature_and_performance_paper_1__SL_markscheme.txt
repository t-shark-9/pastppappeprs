You must make sure you have looked at all pages. Please put the           annotation on any blank
page, to indicate that you have seen it.

When using the On page comment annotation, please keep the following in mind:
  • Avoid covering the candidate’s own writing. This can be done by writing your comments in
    the margins then running the arrow attached to the “On page comment” annotation to the
    appropriate place.
  • Provide all comments in the target language.
  • You may provide summative comments at the end of the script, but please do NOT record
    numerical marks on the scripts.

                                         Assessment criteria

These notes to examiners are intended only as guidelines to assist marking and as a supplement
to the published external assessment criteria for written paper 1. They are not offered as an
exhaustive and fixed set of responses or approaches to which all answers must rigidly adhere.
Good ideas or angles not offered here should be acknowledged and rewarded as appropriate.
Similarly, answers which do not include all the ideas or approaches suggested here may still be
very good answers.

Of course, some of the points listed below will appear in weaker papers, but are unlikely to
be developed.

Criterion A                                                                                     [5 max]

The task is essentially focused on an analysis of a chosen passage from a prose text. Through
this analysis the level of understanding will be evaluated by the examiner. This “understanding” of
the text should include the relevance of the passage and its place in the context of the novel as a
whole.
A synopsis of the plot of the text may be a first step towards demonstrating understanding but
“good” and “perceptive” understanding will evaluate style and theme as well as plot detail. The
analysis of these elements of the text will always be conducted with a view to the performance of
the chosen passage. The importance of support and validation of all ideas through reference to
the text is crucial. The text is fundamental and reference to it mandatory.


Criterion B                                                                                    [10 max]

The “ideas” for performance are generated from the text and should not be independent of it.
The textual “justification” required to support the “ideas for performance” in Criterion B will be
drawn from a thorough contextualization of the passage and a secure understanding of its
relevance to whatever issues the questions raise.

The association of “good” and “excellent” with the word “practical” attests to the value of ideas that
can be realized in a practical staging context. These are ideas for the stage or a staging area and
temptations to propose grandiose scenarios more applicable to “blockbuster” cinema than theatre
should be resisted.

The candidate may draw diagrams or make sketches if it is thought that these are necessary to
communicate the “ideas for performance” but such visual additions are not mandatory.


Criterion C                                                                                     [5 max]

This criterion evaluates the clarity and coherence of the language used in the essay and looks at
the appropriateness of the register, style and terminology which the candidate employs.

Clearly in an exercise which demands a facility in two disciplines, namely literature and
performance, the candidate will be expected to demonstrate a facility in the use of the terminology
specific to each discipline. As a writer of prose the candidate will be assessed on clarity, variety,
precision and concision. The clarity of a written communication depends on accuracy in grammar,
spelling and sentence construction. The effectiveness of a written communication will depend on
effective use of vocabulary and a combination of preciseness and conciseness which results in an
economy of expression. The persuasiveness of a piece of writing will depend on choice of idiom
and style.

1.   An adequate to good answer will:
     • choose an appropriate scene and place it in context in the novel
     • give a brief or sufficient summary of the scene and identify the symbol or the symbolic
       action that is being foregrounded
     • propose some aspects of the way the scene is to be staged, finding a way to ensure that
       the audience will see or hear the weight of the symbolic material
     • include specific references to the prose of the original in order to support and elaborate
       the details of the proposal
     • contain a degree of plausibility and justification for the proposal which should be firmly
       based in the text and the devising of the scene through salient theatrical features
     • reveal at least some sense of what it means to transfer materials from page to stage,
       using a good range of theatrical terminology.

     A very good to excellent answer may also:
     • reveal itself, first, by a felicitous choice of a passage that effectively foregrounds a symbol
        or a symbolic action which is apt and credible
     • clearly describe and contextualize the passage or scene, highlighting the symbolic
        material
     • pursue a method that clearly delivers the weight of symbol or symbolic action through a
        well-balanced use of proxemics, set, lighting, sound: whatever is most appropriate
     • show the relation and interaction of the details of the theatrical proposal to a sense of a
        theatre audience.


2.   An adequate to good answer will:
     • choose a scene that convincingly represents a turning point or shift in the direction of the
       action
     • provide a wider sense of the context so that this shift is validated in terms of effects on
       characters
     • include useful references to the prose text that indicate a sense of how it is constructed
     • offer ideas for performance of the scene that are mostly credible
     • provide justification for such choices as kind of stage as well as set design, lighting and
       sound
     • ensure that the proposal is in harmony with the manner in which the turning point or shift
       is delivered in the text
     • choose an approach that is clearly theatrical rather than cinematic, using terms
       appropriate to the theatre.

     A very good to excellent answer may also:
     • choose a scene that is clearly arguable as a turning point or shift in the direction of the
        plot
     • provide a rationale that indicates a sense of the whole sweep of the text, indicating solid
        understanding of the way the narrative is constructed
     • provide telling details of the original text that will become theatrical elements
     • use theatrical terminology precisely to describe the adaptation of the materials from page
        to stage.

3.   An adequate to good answer will:
     • select a passage from the novel that arguably suggests some later events, a change in a
       character, or a significant revelation or resolution
     • briefly discuss the events predicted as coming to fruition in the larger scope of the novel
     • deliver sufficient details to validate the choice of scene
     • offer practical ideas for the adaptation of the prose into a dramatic presentation
     • speak about the devising of the scene in theatrical terms, including stage, set, lighting,
       etc.
     • maintain a focus on those elements of the question that address foreshadowing or
       prediction.

     A very good to excellent answer may also:
     • make a judicious and convincing choice of scene in relation to the question
     • deliver a persuasive explanation of what the scene foreshadows or predicts and how that
        is connected to the chosen scene
     • offer a viable proposal for creating the desired scene, accompanied by credible and
        perhaps inventive ideas for its staging
     • manage to convey some of the subtler elements of the scene as they are conveyed in the
        prose version, whether in imagery or dialogue or similar features.
