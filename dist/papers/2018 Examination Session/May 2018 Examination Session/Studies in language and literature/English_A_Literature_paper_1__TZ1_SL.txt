                April 1962
                Porto Vergogna, Italy

                 The dying actress arrived in his village the only way one could come directly—in a boat
          that motored into the cove, lurched past the rock jetty, and bumped against the end of the pier.
      5   She wavered a moment in the boat’s stern, then extended a slender hand to grip the mahogany
          railing; with the other, she pressed a wide-brimmed hat against her head. All around her, shards
          of sunlight broke on the flickering waves.
                 Twenty meters away, Pasquale Tursi watched the arrival of the woman as if in a dream.
          Or rather, he would think later, a dream’s opposite: a burst of clarity after a lifetime of sleep.
     10   Pasquale straightened and stopped what he was doing, what he was usually doing that spring,
          trying to construct a beach below his family’s empty pensione1. Chest-deep in the cold Ligurian
          Sea, Pasquale was tossing rocks the size of cats in an attempt to fortify the breakwater, to keep
          the waves from hauling away his little mound of construction sand. Pasquale’s “beach” was
          only as wide as two fishing boats, and the ground beneath his dusting of sand was scalloped
     15   rock, but it was the closest thing to a flat piece of shoreline in the entire village: a rumor of a
          town that had ironically—or perhaps hopefully—been designated Porto despite the fact that
          the only boats to come in and out regularly belonged to the village’s handful of sardine and
          anchovy fishermen. The rest of the name, Vergogna, meant shame, and was a remnant from
          the founding of the village in the seventeenth century as a place for sailors and fishers to find
     20   women of… a certain moral and commercial flexibility.
                 On the day he first saw the lovely American, Pasquale was chest-deep in daydreams
          as well, imagining grubby little Porto Vergogna as an emergent resort town, and himself as a
          sophisticated businessman of the 1960s, a man of infinite possibility at the dawn of a glorious
          modernity. Everywhere he saw signs of il boom—the surge in wealth and literacy that was
     25   transforming Italy. Why not here? He’d recently come home from four years in bustling
          Florence, returning to the tiny backward village of his youth imagining that he brought vital
          news of the world out there—a glittering era of shiny macchine2, of televisions and telephones,
          of double martinis and women in slender pants, of the kind of world that had seemed to exist
          before only in the cinema.
     30          Porto Vergogna was a tight cluster of a dozen old whitewashed houses, an abandoned
          chapel, and the town’s only commercial interest—the tiny hotel and café owned by Pasquale’s
          family—all huddled like a herd of sleeping goats in a crease in the sheer cliffs. Behind the
          village, the rocks rose six hundred feet to a wall of black, striated mountains. Below it, the
          sea settled in a rocky, shrimp-curled cove, from which the fishermen put in and out every day.
     35   Isolated by the cliffs behind and the sea in front, the village had never been accessible by car
          or cart, and so the streets, such as they were, consisted of a few narrow pathways between
          the houses—brick-lined roads skinnier than sidewalks, plunging alleys and rising staircases
          so narrow that unless one was standing in the piazza San Pietro, the little town square, it was
          possible anywhere in the village to reach out and touch walls on either side.
     40          In this way, remote Porto Vergogna was not so different from the quaint cliff-side towns of
          the Cinque Terre to the north, except that it was smaller, more remote, and not as picturesque.
