                          Discover some of Tasmania’s best-kept secrets and destinations




         In an increasingly accelerated world the need to snap out of our wifi-induced comas, ignore
         the urge to check emails, and seek relief from busy routines has never been greater.

         Heading somewhere unexpected and unknown is just the prescription you need to relieve the
         boredom and stresses of modern day life. The medicine – nature.

    5    But not the nature you might expect.

         With our lives so caught up with what’s going on above ground, we don’t give a thought to
         what lies beneath. An underworld separated from the rush above, where you can sink deeply
         into yourself and listen to your truest thoughts. Taking a moment to stop and appreciate
         nature makes you feel connected to a tiny part of a massive universe.

   10    Deep you go, beyond the surface to a land submerged
         under a shallow sea. Where time is measured by drips
         of water, and things glow brighter without light. Caves
         that came into being when Tasmania was still a part of
         the supercontinent Gondwana. Shaped when glaciers
   15    grew, and melted, and burrowed into the limestone leaving
         behind the cave systems you see today.

         For a small island, it might surprise you to find more caves in Tasmania than anywhere in
         Australia – and Tassie has the deepest, longest and wildest of them all. At 394 meters below
         ground Niggly Cave is by far the deepest. With a length of 23km, Exit Cave is the longest.
   20    The Kubla Khan cave is long, but it’s better known for its whopping 18 metre high stalagmite.
                                                     –5–                    M18/1/AYENG/SP1/ENG/TZ0/XX

         Tasmanian caves have a better natural integrity. Rivers still flow through them and keep them
         active. Stalagmites form in front of your eyes, although if you stop to watch them you might
         not notice – growing at a rate of ten centimetres every thousand years. You can also expect
         the temperature to drop to about nine degrees when you step through a cave entrance. You
25       could liken it to walking through the entrance of a David Jones store and being greeted by a
         blast of cool air conditioning. It makes you feel alive.

         Although there are over 300 caves in Tasmania, most are not “tourist” caves. Separated into
         “show” and “wild” caves, most wild caves are restricted to avoid degradation. Not to worry,
         Tasmania has some of the most beautiful caves on show. Park guides keen to show off these
30       otherworldly caverns will take you on an underworld exploration into Tasmania’s show caves,
         showing you how these extraordinary worlds form. But if you’re tired of crowds and concrete
         paths Wild Cave Tours in the Mole Creek area can take you into wild caves.

         MOLE CREEK KARST NATIONAL PARK

         Mole Creek is a town in the upper Mersey Valley, in the central north of Tasmania. The
35       name Mole Creek comes from a nearby stream which flows above ground, and in portions
         underground through the caves underlying the area. The caves of the nearby Mole Creek
         Karst National Park are a world of subterranean adventures that would satisfy any modern
         cave dweller.

         Guides teach the difference between stalagmites,
40       stalactites, shawls, columns and flowstones in Marakoopa
         Cave. See sparkling crystals, reflection pools, the Great
         Cathedral and glow-worms. For those not shy to belt
         out a tune, the dimly lit expanse of the Great Cathedral
         cavern gives a chance to test the vocals. It’s lights out
45       in the glow-worm cavern. As your eyes adjust, the tiny
         larvae fill the pitch-black walls like city lights turning on at
         dusk.

         Operating near Mole Creek, Wild Cave Tours expert crew can take as few as two people on
         half-day guided tours of stream caves, glow-worm chambers and honeycombed hills in some
50       of these lesser-known wild caves. These unusual experiences invigorate the soul.

         You’ll be geared up from head to toe in overalls, and a helmet with head lamp and be led
         down horizontal caves, through streams into glow-worm caverns, coming out the other end
         for a gourmet picnic spread of local organic salads, homemade pickles and preserves and a
         selection of cheeses from nearby Ashgrove Farm.

     –     In what ways does the interplay between image, layout and language help the guide to
           achieve its purpose?

     –     How do Leahy’s language choices and style of writing indicate the assumptions she is
           making about the target audience and their expectations?
