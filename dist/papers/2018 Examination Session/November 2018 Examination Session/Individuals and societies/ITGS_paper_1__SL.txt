Answer two questions. Each question is worth [20 marks].

1.   Google healthcare data

     Google is developing an app* to help hospital staff monitor patients with kidney disease. In order
     to develop this app, Google has signed an agreement with the UK’s National Health Service (NHS)
     that will give Google access to data on 1.6 million patients held in the NHS database.

     The database includes health-related data as well as personal data, some of which is sensitive.

     Google plans to use data mining techniques to analyse the data and provide information that can
     be used to improve the app. Once the app has been developed, it will be provided to the NHS.

     (a)   (i)     Identify two items of health-related data that could be used to improve the
                   treatment of patients.                                                                 [2]

		         (ii)    Identify two characteristics of data mining.                                           [2]

		         (iii)   Identify two reasons why NHS records are stored in a database rather than
                   a spreadsheet.                                                                         [2]

     (b)   The agreement between Google and the NHS includes policies for the collection,
           storage and sharing of patient data.

           Explain why it is important that the agreement between Google and the NHS includes
           policies for the collection, storage and sharing of patient data.                              [6]

     (c)   Evaluate the decision by the NHS to share patient data with Google.                            [8]

2.   Cell phone farmers

     Many farmers in Cameroon are not able to use the internet due to the very limited communication
     infrastructure in their country. In addition, accessing the internet is expensive for most farmers.

     As many farmers have cell/mobile phones, they could make better use of technologies such as text
     messaging (texting or SMS*) to access information that would assist them in their farming.

     Recent research has suggested that a lack of internet access is not the main factor limiting the
     development of farming in Cameroon. The main factor is farmers’ lack of IT knowledge.

     Some farmers in Cameroon are trialling a system called Agritexte that uses SMS to provide
     information on the market prices of produce such as cassava leaves and cocoa, see Figure 1.

(Question 2 continued)

     (a)   (i)     Identify two advantages of using text messaging to communicate.                   [2]

		         (ii)    Identify two items that contribute to the cost of accessing the internet.         [2]

		         (iii)   Outline the difference between the internet and the World Wide Web.               [2]

     (b)   Analyse the effectiveness of using face-to-face (F2F) training compared to distance
           learning to train farmers to use Agritexte.                                               [6]

     (c)	
         The government of Cameroon is watching the results of the Agritexte initiative. It is
         considering two options:
         • Extend the functionality of Agritexte into a web-based information system.
         • Invest in education and training on the use of the existing Agritexte SMS system.

           Evaluate these two options.                                                               [8]

3.   Sports photographs

     Action Link Click Photography (ALC Photography) is a company that specializes in taking
     photographs of participants in large sporting events, such as cycling and running events.
     ALC recently photographed the participants in a cycle event, see Figure 2.

     ALC’s photographers were positioned at five different points on the course, including the start
     and finish lines. Each photographer was equipped with a digital camera that takes
     high-resolution images. The photographer’s job is to photograph as many participants as possible.

     After the event, the photographs are compressed using lossless compression and transferred
     from the cameras’ memory cards to the ALC database. The photographs have tags added by the
     software, which recognizes the race participant by the number pinned to their bike.

     The images for each participant have their resolution reduced and are watermarked before they
     are added to ALC’s website. The participants are then able to purchase high-resolution copies of
     the photographs that do not have watermarks.

     It is also possible for anybody who views the image to purchase and download a
     high-resolution copy.

(Question 3 continued)

     (a)   (i)     Identify two image file formats that ALC could use for its photographs.           [2]

		         (ii)    Define the term resolution.                                                       [2]

		         (iii)   Outline the differences between lossless and lossy compression.                   [2]

     (b)   Explain why each image has its resolution reduced and is watermarked before it is
           uploaded to the ALC’s website.                                                            [6]

     (c)   Some people feel uncomfortable about having their photographs taken and posted on a
           public website.

           To what extent is it acceptable for ALC Photography to take photographs of
           participants, post them online and sell them?                                             [8]

4.   Uber taxis

     Uber Technologies Inc is a company that has developed an app* that allows a customer to submit
     a trip request on their smartphone. The app allows the customer to select the starting point and
     final destination of the journey, and uses a global positioning system (GPS) to determine the route.

                             Figure 3: Taxis in the vicinity of Franklin Street




                                        Removed for copyright reasons




     The app captures the real-time details of the journey, including the starting point, route, distance
     travelled, the speed of the car and the final destination. The app integrates this information with
     real-time traffic information, such as closed roads or accidents. Fares can be estimated before the
     journey and the customer can pay with their credit card or by PayPal.

     Some traditional taxi drivers in cities such as Paris and Rio de Janeiro have campaigned against
     the introduction of the Uber app. They claim these new private drivers, using their own cars,
     do not have the same knowledge and training as taxi drivers working for a taxi company.

(Question 4 continued)

     (a)   (i)    Identify two characteristics of real-time processing.                           [2]

		         (ii)   Identify the steps that a global positioning system (GPS) follows to give
                  an accurate location.                                                           [4]

     (b)   The Uber app was created using the product development life cycle (PDLC). Explain
           why the developers would have included a feasibility study, project schedule and
           user evaluation.                                                                       [6]

     (c)   To what extent should the taxi driver rely on the Uber app rather than their own
           knowledge of the city when determining the best route?                                 [8]
