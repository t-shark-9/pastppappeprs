Examiners should be aware that in some cases, candidates may take a different approach, which if
appropriate should be rewarded. If in doubt, check with your team leader.

In the case of an “identify” question read all answers and mark positively up to the maximum marks.
Disregard incorrect answers. In all other cases where a question asks for a certain number of facts
eg “describe two kinds”, mark the first two correct answers. This could include two descriptions,
one description and one identification, or two identifications.

It should be recognized that, given time constraints, answers for part (c) questions are likely to include a
much narrower range of issues and concepts than identified in the markband. There is no “correct”
answer. Examiners must be prepared to award full marks to answers which synthesize and evaluate
even if they do not examine all the stimulus material.

                  Award [1] for identifying each item of health-related data that could be used
                  to improve the treatment of patients up to a maximum of [2].

           (ii)   Identify two characteristics of data mining.                                    [2]

                  Answers may include:
                   large data sets are interrogated
                   automated techniques are used to interrogate data
                   this interrogation searches for previously unknown patterns
                    or associations
                   the results can be used for marketing
                   measures probabilities of patterns being significant
                   requires intense processing power.

(iii)   Identify two reasons why NHS records are stored in a database rather than a
        spreadsheet.                                                                  [2]

        Answers may include:

        Reasons to not use spreadsheets
         spreadsheets cannot accommodate very large data sets /
          only have 105 000 rows
         spreadsheets are designed to perform calculations
         spreadsheets do everything in memory so any unsaved data can be lost
          if the system crashes.

        Reasons to use a database
         databases generally have more intuitive user interfaces
         complex queries can be set up and applied to the data set
         reports can be generated
         a DBMS (database management system) usually has security features
          to keep the data safe.
         data is written to disc immediately
         related data tables can be linked
         reduces data redundancy.

        Award [1] for identifying each reason why NHS records are stored in a
        database rather than a spreadsheet up to maximum of [2].

(b)   The agreement between Google and the NHS includes policies for the collection,
      storage and sharing of patient data.

      Explain why it is important that the agreement between Google and the NHS
      includes policies for the collection, storage and sharing of patient data.                [6]

      Answers may include:

      A policy is required for the Collection:
       so that only the relevant information is collected (with such a large data set,
        large amounts of data could be collected, much of which are not relevant)
       so that it is made clear to the data subjects/patients the purpose of collecting
        the data is / what data will be collected.
       so that it is clear who is responsible for collecting the data.
       so that it is clear how the data will be collected.
       to ensure that only the information of patients who have consented to the use
        of their data is collected or that they have a way to 'opt-out' of their data being
        used
       so that the accuracy of the data collection can be ensured.
       to ensure that the data is collected consistently

      A policy is required for Storage as:
       ensure that data is stored securely
       make it clear who is responsible for the security of data storage
       make it clear who should be accountable for the security of the data.
       make it clear where the data is stored (it is likely that most of it is confidential)
       make it clear who has access to the data
       ensure that data is stored in an accessible manner for authorized users
       make it clear that data storage will comply with the law
       make it clear how the data will be stored
       make it clear how long the data can be stored.

      A policy is required for the Sharing:
       so that it is clearly identify with whom the data will be shared,
       to make it clear how the data will be shared (will they be safe during the
        transmission?)
       to make it clear what happens to the data once it is shared.
       to make it clear for what purpose the data will be shared (it is likely that a large
        part of the data linked to patients is confidential)

      N.B.: the response requires an explanation of why a policy is required rather than
      discussion of what is included in the policy. There must be an explanation for
      why each policy is required.

      Award [1] for identifying why a policy for the collection, storage and sharing of
      patient data is required and [1] for a development of the explanation up to a
      maximum of [2].

      Mark as [2] + [2] + [2].

(c)   Evaluate the decision by the NHS to share patient data with Google.                 [8]

      Answers may include:

      Reasons for sharing the patient data with Google
       Google may have access to data analytics tools that can interrogate the data
        far more effectively than the NHS data analytics systems
       Google may provide additional IT expertise that the NHS can use
       Google may be able to provide additional health related information
       Google may be able to integrate this NHS data with existing applications such
        as Google Maps to provide meaningful visual data / Google may provide
        additional resources such as data visualization tools
       data can be analysed against other data sets.

      Reasons for not sharing the patient data with Google
       there may be no way of knowing which other third parties Google is sharing
        the NHS information with
       the NHS may find that the patient data becomes integrated onto Google’s
        tools so that they cannot extricate themselves from the contract
       the NHS may find as part of the agreement Google imposes conditions that
        may mean the data is not used in an optimal manner, or not used for the
        purposes it was intended
       once the data is shared it is hard to guarantee that is deleted when it is no
        longer needed
       patient privacy is a concern. Is data anonymized and does Google have
        sufficient security measures in place?
       rejection of patients' consent to share their data with Google.

2.   Cell phone farmers

     Note to examiners.
      All part a questions are marked using ticks and annotations where appropriate
      Part b and part c are marked using markbands. Use annotations and text
       comments to provide a rationale behind the marks you awarded. Do not use ticks.

     (a)   (i)     Identify two advantages of using text messaging to communicate.                 [2]

                   Answers may include:
                    easy to use
                    not dependent on internet access
                    cheap
                    can be done from very old hardware
                    messages get sent when there is reception even if they are written when
                     there is no reception
                    quick communication
                    messages get stored in the device
                    allows the communication with people that are a long distance away.

                   Award [1] for identifying each advantage of using text messaging up to a
                   maximum of [2].

           (ii)    Identify two items that contribute to the cost of accessing the internet.       [2]

                   Answers may include:
                    subscription to ISP / cost of data bundles
                    cost of hardware
                    line rental
                    cost of electricity
                    the cost of education to learn how to use equipment.

                   Do not accept costs related to the limited infrastructure.

                   Award [1] for identifying each item that contributes to the cost of
                   Internet access up to maximum of [2].

           (iii)   Outline the difference between the internet and the World Wide Web.             [2]

                   Answers may include:
                    the internet is a global network of interconnected computers / a network
                     of networks
                    the World Wide Web is software / a service that runs on the hardware of
                     the internet and provides access to content / a collection of pages that
                     can be accessed through hyperlinks / a way of accessing and sharing
                     the information that is held on the internet in webpages
                    the World Wide Web uses the http protocol. This is only one of the
                     many protocols used by the internet.

                   The response must make reference to both the internet and the
                   World Wide Web. Do not award marks if only one is mentioned.

                   Award [1] for identifying each difference up to maximum of [2].

(b)   Analyse the effectiveness of using face-to-face (F2F) training compared to
      distance learning to train farmers to use Agritexte.                                   [6]

      Answers may include:

      Advantages of F2F training
       the workshop leader/teacher can adapt their teaching to the needs of
        the students
       specific questions can be addressed in the moment
       the teacher can observe participants using the technology first-hand to assess
        their progress
       easier for farmers to concentrate if they have a block of time away from
        farm duties
       access to Internet is not required.

      Disadvantages of F2F training
       it is costly to send a person to run the training or to send farmers to
         a workshop
       classes might be large and so students will not get much personal tutoring by
         the teacher
       if a student misses something the teacher says they might get lost and have
         misunderstandings
       if a student is unable to attend a session they will miss out on that information
         and training
       there could be personality clashes between the teacher and their students
       could be difficult to fit training around farmers’ work schedules.

      Advantages of distance learning
       can be accessed 24/7 – farmers can still run their farms
       learning can be self-paced
       teaching material can be viewed as many times as students need in order to
        be able to understand it
       it is easier to spread the training over several weeks allowing farmers to try the
        technology in between classes
       it would be cheaper than running workshops.

      Disadvantages of distance learning
       some technology would be required by farmers to access the training
         materials
       farmers will need to be trained to use the training technology
       if students don’t understand something in the training materials it is harder for
         them to ask for further explanation
       there would be significant set-up costs
       access to Internet is necessary. An unstable connection to Internet may affect
         the quality of the learning as it may caused frustration amongst the farmers.

(c)   The government of Cameroon is watching the results of the Agritexte initiative. It is
      considering two options:
      • Extend the functionality of Agritexte into a web-based information system.
      • Invest in education and training on the use of the existing Agritexte SMS system.

      Evaluate these two options.                                                             [8]

      Answers may include:

      Extend the functionality of Agritexte
       many more services can be offered
       this would be an investment in the future giving farmers the potential to access
        developing/new technologies
       the current system can still continue to operate as it has been doing and the
        new functionality will only add to the system
       the extension into a web based information system could inspire citizens to
        educate themselves
       the extension into a web based information system could inspire citizens to
        explore other things that they can do on the web
       farmers’ lack of IT knowledge is already a problem so they may have difficulty
        using the web based system so training will be required.

      Invest in education and training
       training would allow more people to access the information that
         currently exists
       training would extend people’s skill sets and they could use those skills to
         improve their lives
       it would be a very visible investment from the government
       other beneficial things could be included in the education program
       education would improve the community connections
       the money would be spent training farmers to use a technology with
         limited functionality
       lack of internet availability might limit farmers’ ability to access the system
       development and maintainence of the system woud incur costs.

3.   Sports photographs

     Note to examiners.
      All part a and part b questions are marked using ticks and annotations where
       appropriate
      Part c is marked using markbands. Use annotations and text comments to provide
       a rationale behind the marks you awarded. Do not use ticks.

     (a)   (i)     Identify two image file formats that ALC could use for its photographs.        [2]

                   Answers may include:
                    Jpg/jpeg
                    Bmp
                    Tiff
                    PNG
                    Raw
                    gif.

                   Award [1] for identifying each appropriate file format up to maximum of [2].

           (ii)    Define the term resolution.                                                    [2]

                   Answers may include:
                    the detail of an image, such as number of pixels per inch
                    the ability to determine individual elements (pixels) within the
                     digital image
                    how densely packed the pixels are in the photo
                    determines the visual quality of an image.

                   Award [1] for each appropriate comment about resolution up to maximum
                   of [2].

           (iii)   Outline the differences between lossless and lossy compression.                [2]

                   Answers may include:
                    lossy compression results in the loss of detail and lower
                     resolution/quality in the image in the image when it
                     is decompressed
                    lossless compression means that the file size is compressed but the
                     picture quality remains the same
                    with lossless compression the original file can be recovered, with lossy
                     compression this is not the case
                    lossy compression - discards similar data that does not affect the view
                     how the image looks
                    lossy compression - convert to the same color pixels with similar colors
                     to reduce size
                    lossless compression - stores the color and the times it repeats.

                   Award [1] for each difference identified up to a maximum of [2].

(b)       Explain why each image has its resolution reduced and is watermarked before it is
          uploaded to the ALC’s website.                                                           [6]

          Answers may include:
           reducing the resolution of an image reduces its size so that it can be uploaded more
            quickly. This ensures that the maximum amount of data may be transferred in the
            shortest possible time, which in the case of a cycle event means the competitors
            can see images immediately after a race
           reducing the resolution reduces file size so more photos can be included on the
            website (viewers can see more images)
           reducing the resolution of an image reduces its size so web pages load more
            quickly when competitors are trying to view them
           using low resolution images means people are less likely to download them without
            paying, because the image quality makes it not suitable to be printed
           watermarking ensures that the image available on screen is not suitable for use
            beyond being seen as a preview – prevents people downloading a printable copy
            without paying the company
           watermarking means that the identity of the photographer is easily visible to the
            prospective purchaser of the image so the participant can easily select between
            different photographers
           watermarking creates an identity of the company that owns the photograph.

(c)   Some people feel uncomfortable about having their photographs taken and posted on
      a public website.

      To what extent is it acceptable for ALC Photography to take photographs of
      participants, post them online and sell them?                                       [8]

      Answers may include:

      Arguments for it being acceptable
       it is acceptable if participants (or their parents) signed an agreement for the
        photo to be taken when they entered the race
       it is acceptable if the images are not offensive or infringe the privacy of the
        riders (ie it is not possible to aggregate information from a number of sources
        to determine the identity of the rider)
       ALC provides the riders with a number of professional photographs of them
        that they may want to use on their own websites, or for social networking sites
       as the photographers are reputable and have been sanctioned by the race
        organizers, there is no problem
       the photos may be circulated by riders anyway so the issues related to privacy
        may be unfounded.

      Arguments for it not being acceptable
       if ALC has not sought the agreement of the riders there could be issues linked
        to the privacy of the riders being compromised. Parental permission would be
        needed if minors (under 18 years) are involved
       some riders may not want their photos published on public websites –
        there may be reasons they do not wish to publicise that they were in the race
        (eg off work due to supposed illness)
       riders may feel that publicly shared photos don’t show them in their
        best moments
       riders don’t get to choose which photos are available publicly
       some riders may have sponsorship deals that include clauses about how
        images of them are used
       some photos may be inappropriate – photographers need to abide by a code
        of ethics to ensure photos are appropriate.

       comments to provide a rationale behind the marks you awarded. Do not use ticks.

     (a)   (i)    Identify two characteristics of real-time processing.                            [2]

                  Answers may include:
                   information is captured when the taxi is in service
                   this allows the software to interact with the users to inform them of
                    their activity
                   the results of processing are fed back almost instantly
                   input data is processed in milliseconds so that results are available
                    virtually immediately to feedback to the system from which it originated.

                  Award [1] for identifying each appropriate statement relating to real-time
                  processing up to maximum of [4].

           (ii)   Identify the steps a global positioning system (GPS) follows to give an
                  accurate location.                                                               [4]

                  Answers may include:
                   the GPS receiver receives data from satellites that circle the earth
                   the GPS receiver receives information about the orbits of each satellite
                    (so it knows where each satellite will be at any given moment)
                   the GPS receiver calculates the how far away from each satellite it is
                    and therefore where it is on the surface of the earth
                   it measures the distance to each satellite by calculating the amount of
                    time it takes to receive its signal
                   once the GPS receiver has a minimum of three satellites in its fix it can
                    calculate its position on earth
                   it uses a process trilateration
                   with two satellites in its fix a GPS receiver can calculate its latitude and
                    longitude (2D fix)
                   with three satellites in its fix a GPS receiver can calculate its latitude,
                    longitude and altitude (3D fix)
                   with four or more satellites in range the GPS receiver can compensate
                    for time differences between the receiver’s clock and the satellites’
                    clocks.

                  Award [1] for identifying each step that Global Positioning Systems (GPS)
                  follow to give an accurate location up to maximum of [4].

(b)   The Uber app was created using the product development life cycle (PDLC).
      Explain why the developers would have included a feasibility study, project
      schedule and user evaluation.                                                       [6]

      Answers may include:

      Feasibility study
       this provides the project manager with an indication about whether the project
        is realistic (possible solutions, identification of end-users)
       the feasibility study may include an analysis of constraints such as cost, time
        required, technical expertise, IT infrastructure.

      Project schedule
       this provides the project manager with a possible timeline for the
        implementation of the app
       this will enable the project manager to have an overview of the respective
        tasks, how they relate to each other and potential pinch points in the
        development process.

      User evaluation
       this will provide the developers with first hand feedback about the performance
        of the app
       this will inform the developers of potential issues that may arise when the app
        is released and potential areas for improvement in the app.

      Award [1] for explaining why a feasibility study, project schedule and user
      evaluation have been included and [1] for a development of the reason identified
      up to a maximum of [2].

      Mark as [2] + [2] + [2].

(c)   To what extent should the taxi driver rely on the Uber app rather than their own
      knowledge of the city when determining the best route?                              [8]

      Answers may include:
       the Uber app provides the route that the software generates and may be
        considered the most efficient route
       the app takes away the route-finding requirements of drivers which may mean
        that some drivers will not have to focus on this element of their job
       the app will act as a support mechanism for the new drivers
       the app may be programmed based on a set of circumstances that may not be
        the same as the road conditions the drivers face
       the app can generate routes that cross/pass by unsafe places or
        neighborhoods making customers feeling distrust
       the application can be used by drivers who do not know the city, therefore they
        do not know how to find routes when there are particular circumstances
       the app may lead to employment of drivers who lack the knowledge of how to
        find routes when there are unusual circumstances such as road closures,
        accidents or roadworks. This is a disadvantage for customers
       the app may make drivers reliant on the technology rather than relying on their
        judgment and intuition
       the app may lead to issues relating to accountability, for example if the
        driver is travelling the wrong way down a one way street “the app told me to
        go this way”.
