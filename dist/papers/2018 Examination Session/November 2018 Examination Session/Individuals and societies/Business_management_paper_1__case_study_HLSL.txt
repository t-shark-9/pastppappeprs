                                              As Fair As (AFA)

     Sam Temperton attended a large international school in the capital of a developing country.
     The school had students from many different nationalities and cultures. At the age of sixteen,
     Sam demonstrated several qualities of an entrepreneur, such as determination, resilience and
     creativity, by setting up his own business at school. He bought chocolate bars at a supermarket
 5   and then added a small mark-up. Sam sold chocolate bars to his schoolmates when he saw the
     long queues at the school shop. Sam only ever traded in cash. The cost-plus (mark-up) pricing
     strategy was very popular with Sam’s target market. He sold chocolate bars to classmates well
     below the high prices charged by the school shop.

     Students were not allowed to engage in trade for profit on the school premises. In response,
10   Sam started selling chocolate bars to students just off the school premises.

     After completing his International Baccalaureate diploma in 2015, Sam decided to turn his
     business into something more substantial. At school, he had studied motivation theory and he
     liked Daniel Pink’s ideas. He wanted to become a successful entrepreneur working on his own
     and to make a difference to the lives of stakeholders. In his business management classes,
15   the fair trade movement inspired Sam. From secondary market research conducted by a
     non‑governmental organization (NGO), Sam had learned, to his surprise, that the only places to
     buy fair trade products were supermarkets. He had the idea of creating a shop fully dedicated
     to fair trade products. Sam wanted to practice corporate social responsibility (CSR) in his
     business operations, which he hoped would eventually operate at a global level.

20   Sam hoped to set up a retail store selling fair trade chocolate, but he had insufficient funds.
     He created a marketing plan for a local bank manager who was offering young entrepreneurs
     the chance to seek business finance and advice. The manager was impressed with Sam’s
     enthusiasm but was concerned about some elements of the plan and Sam’s poor understanding
     of accounting and finance. The bank manager thought that Sam did not know the difference
25   between cash flow and profit and that selling only chocolate would not be enough to sustain
     the business.

     Undeterred, Sam came across the idea of pop-up stalls1 to sell fair trade chocolate. A growing
     trend, pop-up businesses are flexible and agile and can be established quickly. With his new
     idea and an improved marketing and business plan, Sam was able to raise enough finance to
30   open his first pop-up stall. However, in his hastily prepared application for a pop-up business
     licence, Sam forgot to include some important accounting and finance information. His business
     goals were not seen as ethical and his application was declined. Realizing his mistake, Sam
     hired an old school friend, Kim, to prepare a second application and help with the businesses’
     accounts and finances. Soon, his business – named As Fair As (AFA) – was registered.

35   Sam set up a pop-up stall near a local train station, a crowded location with limited space.
     Here, the logistics would be difficult but there would be high foot traffic2, especially commuters
     and young travellers. Other pop-up businesses had been located in a less busy part of
     the station. However, Sam’s location decision worked well: AFA’s sales revenue and profits
     grew quickly.

40   Encouraged by the success of AFA’s first pop-up stall, Sam decided to expand the range of fair
     trade products and open three additional pop-up stalls, each run by a new manager. To do this,
     he needed to find new suppliers of fair trade products, which were proving to be very popular
     with his customers. These fair trade products included coffee, clothing and stationery, many of
     which could be sourced locally.
                                                –3–              N18/3/BUSMT/BP1/ENG/TZ0/XX/CS

45   At first, some suppliers of these fair trade products were not willing to supply Sam, as his
     order and re-order quantities were very small. However, as AFA grew and the suppliers
     understood Sam’s purpose, they became more willing to supply AFA. Sam worked with two
     types of suppliers:
     • wholesalers that imported products from many parts of the globe
50   • local producers that met fair trade standards.

     Sam decided to build on the success of his pop-up business by creating an e-commerce
     business to consumer (B2C) website on which to offer his fair trade products.

     By 2017, AFA was a great success. Sales revenue had grown significantly and Sam had
     opened four traditional brick-and-mortar retail outlets selling a much larger range of fair trade
55   products. Instead of using the stalls at semi-permanent locations, such as the train station,
     he now used them at temporary venues, such as festivals and concerts. Sam made most of
     the growth decisions himself with limited consultation with Kim. One of the decisions that later
     caused problems was his promotion of the four pop-up stall managers to managers of the new
     retail outlets and the recruitment of school leavers to replace the managers at the pop‑up stalls.

60   Faced with growing complexity, Sam decided that some form of restructuring of AFA was
     required. He invited a close friend, Finn, to become his second business partner. With Kim
     promoted to chief financial officer, Finn was recruited to become chief operations officer.
     Finn’s responsibilities included supervising the four managers of the new retail outlets and
     being in charge of the e-commerce website. Sam retained overall control of AFA.

65   Signs soon began to appear indicating that business growth was outstripping Sam and Finn’s
     ability to manage. Despite lower transport costs and greater bulk buying, some diseconomies of
     scale were affecting AFA’s operations. Gross and net profit margins were being eroded, so Finn
     increased prices. Sam accepted this decision but reminded Finn that AFA’s vision was to create
     opportunities for both internal and external stakeholders. Finn responded by telling Sam that if
70   costs were not kept under control then AFA would have to adopt some new pricing strategies.
     By following the fair trade movement, AFA was creating opportunities but Sam was concerned
     that new pricing strategies could undermine AFA’s position in the retail market.

     Sam generally did not participate in the day-to-day running of AFA. He focused on developing
     strategic plans, ensuring AFA remained true to its mission, and strengthening relationships with
75   stakeholders. Finn was methodical and risk averse. He focused on financial details, logistics,
     tactics and day-to-day operations.

     Sam was generally pleased that Finn ran the administration of AFA. Sam got bored easily and
     was always restless, constantly looking for new ways to grow the business. Finn enjoyed the
     challenges of managing systems. He had previously worked in an industry that was highly
80   bureaucratic and centralized, with narrow spans of control and top-down communication.

     As growth of the four stores and the e-commerce website continued, Finn argued that a further
     restructuring was inevitable, but Sam was concerned about Finn’s leadership style. Sam had
     heard rumours that the managers of the four stores were complaining to each other that they
     had little input in decision making. Rarely visiting any of the stores, Sam effectively left Finn to
85   manage AFA on his own. Sam was spending an increasing amount of time visiting countries to
     source new suppliers of fair trade goods and speaking to NGOs and charities about ways that
     AFA could help them.




                                                                                               Turn over
                                                    –4–              N18/3/BUSMT/BP1/ENG/TZ0/XX/CS

          The combination of increasing costs and management unhappiness led to Finn calling an urgent
          meeting with Sam to discuss organizational issues. At the meeting, Finn argued that AFA
     90   worked well as a concept but that changes were needed. He felt that the current management
          system was unable to cope with the growth of the business.

          Sam wondered whether he should convert AFA to a cooperative, with managers acting as
          associates rather than being paid a salary. Sam felt this conversion would align AFA with the
          ideas of Daniel Pink. He asserted that Pink’s theory should be extended to the managers of the
     95   four stores and to Kim. Finn did not like this idea and felt that he was not being listened to. He
          feared that the mission and corporate social responsibility aspects of AFA would be lost. He
          saw these as essential aspects of the positioning (perception) of the business.

          Thinking that Sam was still not listening to his concerns, Finn brought up his latest management
          idea to highlight the problems at AFA. Finn revealed that, unknown to Sam, he had hired a
    100   mystery (secret) shopper to visit two of the stores. She had visited stores at their busiest times.
          Finn was appalled at what she had reported, including:
          • poorly organized stores
          • unhelpful staff
          • a failure to regularly mention the importance of fair trade at the checkout.

    105   Finn was left wondering whether these two stores were devaluing the vision and mission of AFA
          as a fair trade store.

          Though Sam was disappointed with what the mystery shopper reported, he was angry at
          Finn’s deception. Finn countered that his decision to use a mystery shopper revealed the true
          nature of some of AFA’s problems. The meeting broke up without any final decision being
    110   reached. It was their first significant disagreement about the current situation and strategic
          direction of AFA.
