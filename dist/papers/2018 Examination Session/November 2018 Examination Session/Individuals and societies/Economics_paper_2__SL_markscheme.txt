               supply of the rand and a fall in the exchange rate or for an
               explanation that the increase in imports of corn would result in
               selling the rand (to buy US dollars), thus increasing the supply of
               the rand and lowering its exchange rate.
       2       There is a correct diagram and an accurate written response.          3–4
               For drawing an exchange rate diagram showing an increase in

      Candidates who incorrectly label diagrams can be awarded a maximum of [3].

      For an exchange rate diagram the vertical axis may be exchange rate, price of rand
      in dollars, or US dollars per rand, or USD/rand, or rand/USD. The horizontal axis
      should be quantity or quantity of rand or quantity of rand traded. A title is not
      necessary.

(c)   Using a demand and supply diagram, explain the effect of government subsidies on
      the US corn market (paragraph ).                                                        [4]

       1       There is a correct diagram or an accurate written response.          1–2
               For drawing a D&S diagram showing a shift of supply to the
               right, with a decrease in price and an increase in quantity or an
               explanation that a subsidy will cause a decrease in the costs of
               production of US corn farmers, therefore leading to an increase
               in supply, resulting in a lower price and an increased quantity.
       2       There is a correct diagram and an accurate written response.         3–4
               For drawing a D&S diagram showing a shift of supply to the
               right, with a decrease in price and an increase in quantity and
               an explanation that a subsidy will cause a decrease in the costs
               of production of US corn farmers, therefore leading to an
               increase in supply, resulting in a lower price and an increased
               quantity.

      Candidates may include a World Supply Curve/Line and should not be penalized for
      doing so. It may be positioned in such a way as to impede imports or to promote
      exports. Both are valid approaches. So long as the explanation and diagram explain
      why the domestic supply line shifts right and the correct effects on the price and the
      quantity of corn produced in the USA, the answer can receive full marks.

      Candidates who incorrectly label diagrams can be awarded a maximum of [3].

      The use of P and Q on the axes is sufficient for a demand and supply diagram.
      A title is not necessary.

                There is synthesis/evaluation, supported by appropriate theory
                and evidence.

      Command term
      “Evaluate” requires candidates to make an appraisal by weighing up the strengths
      and limitations. Opinions and conclusions should be presented clearly and
      supported with appropriate evidence and sound argument.

      Responses may include:
      • a definition of trade protection
      • an international trade diagram to explain impact of requested tariff on consumers,
        producers and importers (paragraph ).

      Advantages:
      • US subsidies distort the functioning of the free market and can result in an
        inefficient allocation of resources.
      • Helps to protect South African corn farmers from unfair practices since US
        subsidies artificially lower the price of US corn imported into South Africa
        (paragraph ).
      • It would prevent a deterioration of South Africa’s current account balance
        since import expenditure falls as the result of decreased corn imports and the
        depreciation of currency (paragraph ).
      • Tariff allows domestic corn farmers to maintain higher revenues / incomes to
        help them to survive the drought (paragraph ).
      • Corn farmers can compete with subsidized US corn that has caused the global
        glut and subsequent low prices.
      • May only be a short-term measure.
      • A source of tax revenue for the South African government.
      • Agriculture is a strategic industry.

      Disadvantages:
      • Domestic supply of corn in South Africa is likely very price inelastic so the tariff
         would not increase domestic production significantly.
      • Tariff will increase input costs for millers and food-related businesses requiring
         corn as an input (paragraph ).

• Impact of rising corn prices on low income households when corn is an
  essential food (paragraph ).
• Tariff will cause rising input costs for livestock producers further increasing
  food prices (paragraph ).
• Corn is likely to be a major input to food manufacturing hence tariff could
  cause decrease in SRAS due to rising input costs and thus cause cost-push
  inflation and lower real GDP.
• Price of South African food exported to other countries will rise in trading
  partner countries.
• Trading partners might retaliate by imposing their own protectionist measures.
• The corn industry is not an infant industry (paragraph ).
• The depreciation of Rand is already reversing the low price of imports.

      For AD/AS, the vertical axis may be “average (general) price level”, “APL” or “price
      level”. For the horizontal axis, “real output”, “real national output”, “real income”,

          and evidence.

Command term
“Evaluate” requires candidates to make an appraisal by weighing up the strengths
and limitations. Opinions and conclusions should be presented clearly and
supported with appropriate evidence and sound argument.

Responses may include:
• definitions of fixed and managed exchange rate systems.

Strengths:
• Will not need to use foreign currency reserves as much, which have fallen, to
   control the exchange rate (paragraph ).
• The lower exchange rate should improve the balance of trade and so increase
   aggregate demand, helping to combat the negative economic growth
   (paragraph ).
• The lower exchange rate may attract foreign investment.
• Interest rates will be free for use in other policies.
• Could reduce levels of speculation.
• Lower export prices and higher import prices may increase AD and cause
   economic growth (paragraph ).
• Could encourage import substitution (paragraph ) and help to diversify the
   Nigerian economy.

Limitations:
• There may still be some need to use reserves to maintain the “managed float”
  (paragraph ).
• The fall in the value of the naira will raise the prices of imported necessity goods,
  negatively affecting poverty.
• Increased uncertainty and harder to plan ahead which may limit the inflow of FDI.
• The falling value of the naira may cause cost-push inflation/imported inflation
  (paragraph ).
• There may be a need for a tighter monetary policy to deal with the higher
  inflation. This would increase the exchange rate and undo many of the benefits
  (paragraph ).

To reach level 3, students must be aware of the particular situation in the Nigerian
economy, not just present a discussion of changing from a fixed exchange rate to a
floating exchange rate in general.

      a range of arguments, factors, or hypotheses. Opinions or conclusions should be
      presented clearly and supported by appropriate evidence.

      Responses may include:
      • a definition of economic development
      • a diagram and explanation of the poverty trap (poverty cycle).

      Education and health:
      • Increased employment opportunities for young people (paragraph ).
      • Improvements in health and education lead to more productive workforce, raising
        incomes and increasing the standard of living of the people.
      • Micro-credit is often accompanied by provision of basic skills that enable the
        borrowers to make better use of the loans – Feed the Future project provides
        training in land management (paragraph ).
      • Training for indigenous farmers to help them adopt better water management
        practices to promote food security and help break the poverty trap (paragraph ).

        to provide students with a better understanding of water management and
        conservation practices in order to prepare them for jobs in commercial
        agriculture” (paragraph ).

      The use of appropriate technology:
      • Use of agriculture strategies; provide rainwater tanks, improve irrigation systems,
        spread fertilizer, and practice crop rotation (paragraph ) to reduce impacts of
        future droughts and reduce malnutrition.
      • Use of appropriate technology to overcome the problems caused by deforestation
        (paragraph ).

• A definition of micro-credit (paragraph ).
• Micro-credit provides a means of escaping the poverty trap (paragraph ).
• Micro-credit gives access to poor and indigenous farmers to obtain loans that
  they are unable to access from financial institutions as a result of having no
  security to offer (paragraph ).
• Micro-credit fosters self-reliance and entrepreneurship skills through self-
  employment (paragraph ).
• Gives farmers the finance necessary to purchase the technology needed to deal
  with climate change (paragraph ).

The empowerment of women:
• Micro-credit given to women allows them to improve their physical and social
  well-being, and gives them the opportunity to raise the standards of living for their
  children (paragraph ).
• Micro-credit gives borrowers the opportunity to earn more income from their land
  (paragraph ).

      For a PPC, the axes could be two alternative products, one on each axis, eg Good A
      and Good B or Schools and Motor Cars; or two groups of products, eg Consumer
      Goods and Producer Goods.

(c)   Using an AD/AS diagram, explain why the “decrease in the prices of imports,
      especially oil” might reduce inflationary pressure (paragraph ).                        [4]

                Candidates may also approach this question in this way:

                An AD/AS diagram showing a shift of the AD curve to the left
                and a fall in the average price level or an explanation that a fall
                in the price of imports would increase spending on imports, a
                component of AD and hence reduce inflationary pressure in the

      For AD/AS, the vertical axis may be “average (general) price level”, “APL” or “price
      level”. For the horizontal axis, “real output”, “real national output”, “real income”,
      “real national income”, “real GDP” or “real Y”. Any abbreviations are acceptable.
      A title is not necessary. “AS” is a valid label for the SRAS curve.

      Command term
      “Evaluate” requires candidates to make an appraisal by weighing up the strengths
      and limitations. Opinions and conclusions should be presented clearly and
      supported with appropriate evidence and sound argument.

      Responses may include:
      • definition of economic growth
      • definition of economic development.

      Discussion of factors affecting growth and/or development
      • Landlocked country (paragraph ) making access to markets difficult, and difficult to
         access resources.
      • High population density (paragraph ), affecting the quality of life.
      • Dependence on subsistence agriculture (paragraph ) leads to low incomes.
      • Scarcity of cultivatable land (paragraph ) limiting production of agricultural goods.
      • Destruction of capital (paragraph ) during conflict, expensive to rebuild from
         (limited) public funding.
      • Widespread poverty (paragraph ) and existence of the poverty trap.
      • Per capita gross national income is still very low (paragraph ), despite doubling
         over eight years.
      • Low tax receipts (paragraph ) limit the ability of the government to finance
         development objectives.
      • Over-specialization (paragraph ) on a narrow range of (agricultural) exports makes
         Burundi vulnerable to international price changes.
      • Low agricultural export revenue (paragraph ) with low income elasticities and high levels
         of global competition implies lower prospects for growth.
      • Possibility of debt (increasing) due to public spending and a narrow tax base (paragraph
         ).
      • It is likely that inequality is high, because poverty is widespread, which makes
         development more difficult to achieve (paragraph ).

• However better prospects for growth because of lower import prices and use of
  government monetary and other policies (paragraphs  and ).

Any reasonable discussion.
