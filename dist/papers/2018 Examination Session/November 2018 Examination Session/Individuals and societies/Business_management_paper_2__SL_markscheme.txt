                                            Section A
1.   (a)   Define the term capital expenditure.                                                   [2]

           Capital expenditure refers to the purchase by a business of long-term assets
           (assets that have a useful life longer than one year).

           Award [1] mark for partial understanding and knowledge and [2] for a complete
           definition as the above (though candidates do not have to use the precise
           wording above).

     (b)   Using Table 1, calculate for PI:

           (i)    gross profit (X);

                  Gross profit is $10 000 000. Candidate is not required to show workings.

                  Award [1] for the correct answer.

           (ii)   tax (Y).

                  Tax is $860 000.

           Candidate is not required to show workings. Award [1] for the correct answer.

           If a candidate provides NR or some other answer that appears incorrect but then
           calculates tax correctly in (c) below, award [1].

     (c)   Using Table 1 and your calculations in (b)(i) and (ii), construct a profit and loss
           account for PI.                                                                        [2]

                                                           All figures in 000s
                    Sales revenue                               25 000
                    Cost of goods sold                          15 000
                    Gross profit                                10 000              X

                    Net profit before interest and
                                                                 5300

                    Net profit before tax                        4300
                    Tax                                           860               Y
                    Net profit after interest and tax            3440

           If the candidate has some idea what a profit and loss account is, award an
           additional [1] mark. If the candidate produces a profit and loss account that is
           correct and conforms to the IB format (as above), award [2].
           Maximum award: [2].

           N.B. The candidate must follow the IB format. However, be flexible if candidates
           use slightly different wording, such as “Pre-tax profit” rather than “Net profit
           before tax,” as long as the correct meaning is conveyed.

(d)   Using Table 2, calculate the net cash flow (Z) for PI for 2019 (show all your
      working).                                                                           [2]

      Net cash flow is $1 500 000 calculated as follows:
        $24 000 000 total receipts
        $22 500 000 total payments
         $1 500 000 net cash flow

      Award [1] for the correct answer and [1] for workings. Accept alternative methods
      provided they are correct methods.

(e)   Explain the difference between profit and cash flow.                                [2]

      Profit is typically calculated on an accrual basis (when revenue or expense
      actually accrues to the business) but does not reflect the actual movement of
      funds. Cash flow reflects the actual movement of funds – when a business
      receives payment and makes a payment. Thus, a timing difference can exist
      between the accrual of a revenue or an expense and the actual receipt of funds.

      Award [1] for partial understanding and explanation and [2] marks for a complete
      understanding and explanation. A candidate does not have actually to use the
      word accrual, but they must convey understanding of a timing difference between
      the profit and loss account and the cash flow.

      An alternative way that a candidate can earn [2] is by defining profit (revenue
      minus expenses) and then explaining that cash flow is the movement of funds
      such as external financing (an inflow) or debt service (an outflow) or some other
      specific examples of inflows and outflows.

2.   (a)   Define the term batch production.                                                    [2]

           Batch production involves making a group of identical items together, and each
           stage of operation is performed on the whole group before it moves on to the
           next stage.

           Candidates are not expected to word their definition exactly as above.

           Award [1] for a basic definition that conveys partial knowledge and
           understanding.

           Award [2] for a full, clear definition that conveys knowledge and understanding,
           such as stating that batch production involves a group of identical items made at
           the same time and then moving on to the next stage together.

     (b)   (i)    Calculate the break-even level of output for PF for 2019 (show all your
                  working).                                                                     [2]

                  Fixed costs: €24 000 + €6000 + €11 000 + €40 000 + €18 000 = €99 000

                  Contribution: €100 – €50 – €5 = €45

                  €99 000
                          = 2200 chairs must be sold to break-even.
                    €45

                  Award [1] for working or formula and [1] for the correct answer. Award up
                  to a maximum of [2].

           (ii)   Construct a fully labelled break-even chart, to scale, for PF for 2019.       [4]
                                        –9–                  N18/3/BUSMT/SP2/ENG/TZ0/XX/M


        Award marks as follows:
         [1] for both appropriately labelled axes.
         [1] for an accurately drawn and labelled total revenue curve.
         [1] for an accurately drawn and labelled total costs curve.
         [1] for the identification of the break-even level of output.

        Award [0] if a candidate produces a table, and award no more than [2] if
        the chart is not neat, not drawn with a straight-edge, or is not to scale.
        Ideally, the candidate will draw an arrow pointing to the break-even point
        and label the arrow. However, accept as an “appropriately labelled” break-
        even point a vertical line from the x-axis to the break-even point.

(iii)   Calculate the forecasted profit if PF sells 2400 chairs in 2019 (show all your
        working).                                                                        [2]

         2400 x €100 = Sales revenue                   €240 000
         Less: Variable costs (€50 + €5) x 2400       <€132 000>
         Less: Fixed costs                             <€99 000>
         Forecasted profit                               €9000

        Another possible response is:
        (2400 – 2200)  45 = 9000

        Reward other acceptable methods of calculating forecasted profit on sales
        of 2400 chairs.

        Award [1] for working or formula and [1] for the correct answer. Award up
        to a maximum of [2].

                                              Section B
3.   (a)   Define the term multinational company (MNC)                                          [2]

           A multinational corporation is a company that operates in two or more countries.
           A multinational company needs to have a base in those countries, not just sell
           goods and services there.

           Award [1] for a partial understanding that conveys some understanding and [2]
           for a complete response that shows full understanding. Candidates do not have
           to word exactly as above. If candidates equate being a multinational corporation
           with being a global organization without any further qualification or explanation,
           maximum award: [1].

     (b)   Explain the importance to JS of:

           (i)    brand value;                                                                  [2]

                  Brand value refers to the premium customers or potential customers are
                  willing to pay for a product compared to the competition. For example, if
                  jeans roughly comparable to Jacob Strutz’s products sell for $10 less, some
                  dollar amount can be specifically attached to the value of the JS brand.

                  For [2], candidates must define, explain, and apply the concept of brand
                  value to JS. Award [1] for some partial response.

           (ii)   brand loyalty.                                                                [2]

                  Brand loyalty refers to the loyalty that customers attach to a particular
                  brand, whether for repeat purchases of the same product (jeans) or the
                  purchase of new products traded under the brand name(jeans jackets, for
                  example). In the case of JS, it has strong brand loyalty based upon on 100
                  years of successful marketing. Many customers are loyal to JS even though
                  they could buy other jeans for less or buy jeans that have a certain
                  trendiness now.

                  For [2], candidates must define, explain, and apply the concept of brand
                  loyalty to JS. Award [1] for some partial response.

(c)   (i)    Draw and label a product life cycle for Strutz’s No.5 jeans.                        [2]




             Award [1] mark for some idea of the product life cycle. Award [2] if a
             candidate draws a product life cycle and correctly provides at least four
             stages. Maximum award: [2].

             N.B. If the candidate has not labelled the axes or has incorrectly labelled the axes,
             maximum award: [1]. Please be flexible if the candidate uses wording slightly different
             than in the markscheme: sales or revenue rather than sales revenue is fine. However,
             for the Y-axis, do not accept “market value” or “value of the product” or other wording
             that suggests some limited understanding but is otherwise inaccurate.

      (ii)   Explain the position of Strutz’s No.5 jeans on the product life cycle               [2]

             JS’s position is in the decline stage of the product life cycle. Despite strong
             brand loyalty, an ageing baby-boomer population is buying fewer jeans
             (thus, JS’s sales are down) while, presumably, young people are buying
             cheaper jeans made outside the US or more “fashionable” jeans made by
             designers. Regardless, JS’s sales are down considerably from their peak.

             For [2], candidates must explain and apply the concept of product life cycle
             to JS. Award [1] for some partial response.

(d)   Discuss the role and impact of globalization on the growth and evolution of JS.          [10]

      The role and impact of globalization on JS has been considerable and includes:
       sales growth to $7.6 billion dollars, which, the stimulus implies, was based
         upon sales around the world
       the opportunities for offshoring, which has led to the closure of all of JS’s
         manufacturing facilities in the US and, presumably, allowed JS to cut costs
         and remain competitive
       foreign competition, which has proven significantly challenging for JS, whose
         sales have decline considerably
       the nature of JS’s program of corporate social responsibility (CSR), which has
         a very globally fashionable “triple bottom line” focus, especially its Strutz’s
         chemical-free jeans.

      Accept any other relevant point.
                                                 – 12 –            N18/3/BUSMT/SP2/ENG/TZ0/XX/M


         In each of these ways, Strutz has been influenced by globalization. Some have
         been very positive for JS (increased sales for many years and lower costs), and
         some have taken a toll on JS (foreign competition and pressure for more
         expensive programmes of CSR).

         JS must continue to seek out opportunities and minimize threats from a changing
         world. Of importance for JS is either to find extension strategies that will makes
         its core products relevant again in the global market place or find new products to
         sell under its highly recognized and valued brand.

         For a balanced argument, a candidate must have two arguments showing the
         benefits of globalization and two arguments showing how globalization has posed
         some challenges. At least one of the arguments for and against can be purely
         theoretical, while at least one argument for and one argument against must be
         based upon application to the stimulus. If the candidate does not make
         judgements on conclusions, maximum award: [6].

4.   (a)   Identify two features of a private limited company.                                   [2]

           Features of a private limited company include:
            shareholders have limited liability.
            ownership of shares is restricted to a small number of investors (varies from
              country to country but in general is a low number).
            information does not have to be shared publicly.
            it is less costly to manage shareholders because of lesser disclosure and
              other legal requirements.
            it is a separate legal entity distinct from the owners of its shares.

(c)   Explain one method of above-the-line promotion and one method of below-the-
      line promotion that DH could use to raise consumer awareness that it is a socially
      responsible company.                                                                    [4]

      Methods of above-the-line promotion that DH could use include:
       television advertising
       radio advertising
       advertising in newspapers, journals, magazines, or trade journals
       cinema advertising
       billboards.

      Methods of below-the-line promotion that DH could use include:
       direct mailing

       sponsorship
       public relations
       celebrity endorsement
       personal selling.

      Do not accept word of mouth as a form of below-the-line promotion.

      Award [1] for an appropriate below-the-line method identified and an additional
      [1] for development of the explanation illustrating the appropriateness of the
      method with respect to DH. Maximum award: [4].

      If the answer has methods but no application (or just mentions the name of the
      business) then award a maximum of [2] overall.

(d)   Discuss DH’s decision to develop a policy of corporate social responsibility
      (CSR).                                                                                 [10]

      DH’s decision to develop a policy of corporate social responsibility (CSR) fits well
      with trends in business today, whereby many companies are doing so. Indeed,
      sometimes today stakeholder groups exert powerful pressure on companies to
      practice CSR. The pressure to follow triple-bottom line reporting is also
      influencing companies to act in a more socially responsible way (despite some
      criticism of CSR by certain economists).

      DH has adopted several approaches that are popular today: giving profits,
      lending employees, and being more environmentally friendly. All these methods
      have garnered DH favourable media attention, though less clear is if DH’s brand
      identity has benefited. Sales growth has not improved. The gross profit margin
      decreased from 50 % to 48.28 %, and the net profit margin declined from 4.89 %
      to 4.48 %. The costs of donating profits, lending employees and presumably
      higher-priced biodegradable materials took a toll on profits. The situation also
      negatively affected the balance sheet, which saw a deteriorated working capital
      position, falling from $2 000 000 to $1 700 000.
                                        – 15 –             N18/3/BUSMT/SP2/ENG/TZ0/XX/M


One of the commonly cited reasons for practicing CSR is that it is a form of
enlightened self-interest: doing good for others will in the long run lead to greater
profits. In the case of DH, perhaps that was its intention. Employee morale
improved, which can lead to greater productivity and loyalty (labour turnover
would probably decline). CSR would enhance DH’s reputation, socially
responsible consumers would find an additional reason to purchase DH products,
and, over time, the company would make more profits than it otherwise would
have.

Some shareholders, however, are not satisfied with the results so far. At the
annual general meeting, they complained about unimproved sales growth and
lower margins, which they directly linked to the CSR programme. Several
shareholders suggested that DH develop consumer awareness that it is a socially
responsible company. The favourable media attention in the first year was
insufficient to make an impact on the revenue side. Were DH to take this
approach, reshape its brand identity and raise consumer awareness, it would
have to invest in a promotional and public relations campaign, which might be
costly. Profits and margins might go down before they go up, and possibly even
more shareholders will be dissatisfied.

5.   (a)    Define the term innovation.                                                                 [2]

            Innovation is about putting a new idea or approach into action. It can be
            described as the process of translating an idea/invention into a service/good that
            creates value. Innovation can be achieved by improving existing goods,
            processes or services

            Candidates are not expected to word the definition exactly as above. Award [1] if the
            candidate recognizes that innovation is the creation or invention of something original. Award
            [2] marks if the candidate also recognizes that the new invention or process has value [2].

            N.B.: no application required. Do not credit examples on their own.

            understanding.

     (b)    Explain two roles of Benno’s mission statement.                                             [4]

            The roles of a mission statement include:
             communicating the purpose of the organization to stakeholders
             informing decision making and strategy development
             developing the measurable goals and objectives by which to gauge the
               success of the organization's strategy.

            For Benno, the mission statement has provided a way for the business to
            differentiate itself from its competitors, especially at a time when competition in
            the healthy soft drinks market is intense.

      The mission statement is also a way to attract new investors who may have
      empathy with the direction of Benno. This is an important role given the need for
      Benno to be committed to innovation and CSR.

      Award [1] for a basic answer that shows an understanding of a role of a mission
      statement.

      Award [2] for an answer that shows an understanding of two roles of a mission
      statement.

      Award [3] for an answer that shows a good understanding of two roles of a
      mission statement and one of these is suitably applied to Benno.

      Award [4] for an answer that shows a good understanding of two roles of a
      mission statement and both of these is suitably applied to Benno.

      Do not reward marks for describing/defining a mission statement.

(c)   Explain one advantage and one disadvantage for Benno of using a focus group
      of loyal customers.                                                                  [4]

      Advantages of a focus group of loyal customers:
       Can obtain detailed information about your own customers about their
         feelings, perceptions and opinions.
       Are cheaper than performing individual interviews.
       Provide an opportunity to clarify any issues or problems.

      Disadvantages of a focus group of loyal customers:
       They can be hard to control and manage.
       You are only getting the views of loyal customers – it tells you nothing about
         consumers who prefer rival brands and why they prefer them to your soft
         drink.
       The results are difficult to analyse, especially if the focus group provides
         qualitative feedback.
       Members may not reveal their own feelings but are swayed by the majority
         view.
       May not be representative of the target market as a whole.

      Possible application:
      For Benno, an advantage of using a regular focus group is that they will be aware
      of the company’s products and mission. This will reduce the amount of statistical
      noise and save time in the discussions when looking at new product ideas, such
      the biodegradable rings.

      However, having a regular group for Benno increases bias and reduces
      objectivity of the data researched. It might be a useful exercise for Benno to ask
      customers who are not overly familiar with their products to achieve a more
      balanced qualitative view.

(d)   Recommend whether Benno should replace its plastic drink rings with the new
      biodegradable drink rings.                                                                 [10]

       It fits in well with its mission statement “to produce healthy drinks without
         damaging the environment” and this may be important in maintaining
         customer loyalty.
       It fits into its belief in corporate social responsibility, as the current drink rings
         damage the environment and harm creatures in the seas, such fish.
       Competition in this drinks market is very intense – this could act as a
         strengthening of its USP for Benno and retain loyal customers and attract
         customers from rivals. It will strengthen its image as a business that has
         “green” credentials.
       Sales of Benno’s drinks have fallen significantly over the last five years– so it
         is important that Benno does something to stem this tide.
       Accept any other reasoned arguments.

      Against:
       It will cost $5m to buy the machinery to produce the new rings and the
         business has no accumulated retained profits – therefore the funds will need
         to be raised, probably externally via a bank loan, which will lead to interest
         charges and an increase in operating costs. It may take time to find a suitable
         angel investor to help finance this project. Will the angel investor wish to exert
         some control over Benno’s operations?
       The unit cost increase is 50 %, a rise from 10 cents to 15 cents per ring, and
         the business only has a net profit margin of 10 %. As the market is
         competitive and reports suggest that consumers are price sensitive, a price
         rise – passing on the cost of the new rings – is probably not going to be
         possible. The result is that Benno’s net profit margin will fall.
       Sales are falling, particularly to the 12–18 age group – are they going to be
         energized into buying a product that is more environmentally friendly,
         particularly when reports suggest purchases of green products are not
         increasing?
       In terms of a new way forward for Benno, the introduction of the new rings
         has a great deal of merit. There are a large number of marketing
         opportunities available in a competitive market and this idea will strengthen
         Benno’s brand. However, the forecasted financial implications of this idea are

         not ideal and if sales volumes do not increase significantly then Benno may
         find itself financially worse off if profits do not increase. One solution may be
         to wait until some more objective market research via a new untested focus
         group have given their thoughts on the new ring.
        Accept any other reasoned arguments.

   Marks should be allocated according to the mark bands on page 3 with further
   guidance below.

   A balanced response is one that provides at least two arguments for and two
   arguments against the option.

   For one relevant issue that is one-sided, award up to [3]. For more than one
   relevant issue that is one-sided, award up to a maximum of [4].
   Award a maximum of [6] if the answer is of a standard that shows balanced
   analysis and understanding throughout the response with reference to the
   stimulus material but there is no judgement/conclusion.

   Candidates cannot reach the [7–8] markband if they give judgement/conclusions
   that are not based on analysis/explanation already given in their answer.

                                                Section C

Marks should be allocated using the assessment criteria on pages 4 to 5 with further
guidance below.

N.B.: examiners should include a breakdown of each mark awarded per criterion and a
brief note explaining the mark awarded at the end of each candidate’s response.

The main aim of paper 2 (SL or HL) section C is to assess candidates’ understanding of the
six major concepts (change, culture, ethics, globalization, innovation, strategy) within a
business context. Candidates are to demonstrate their understanding through an
organization of their choice. The expectation of the use of an organization is to allow
assessment of the depth of candidates’ understanding through their ability to apply the
concepts and their knowledge.

Assessment of candidates’ knowledge of the organization itself is not an aim of the
assessment. If a candidate makes minor factual errors and these minor errors have no
genuine bearing on whether the candidate understands the concepts, examiners should not
penalize. For example, a minor error of historical fact (the year when a company was
founded, or the year in which a change was implemented) which has no genuine bearing on
candidates’ understanding of the concepts does not warrant penalty.

6.     With reference to an organization of your choice, examine the impact of innovation on
       promotional strategy.                                                                       [20]

7.     With reference to an organization of your choice, examine the impact of globalization
       on change in operations management.                                                         [20]

8.     With reference to an organization of your choice, examine the impact of ethics and
       culture on human resource management.                                                       [20]

It is expected that the candidate explains the chosen theoretical direction / content of their
response.

Additional guidance in relation to the assessment criteria
For each criterion, the aim is to find the descriptor that conveys most accurately the level
attained by the candidate, using the best-fit model. It is not necessary for every single aspect
of a level descriptor to be met for that mark to be awarded.

    The highest-level descriptors do not imply faultless performance and should be
     achievable by a candidate.
    A candidate who attains a high level of achievement for one criterion will not necessarily
     reach high levels of achievement for the other criteria and vice versa.

If only one concept is addressed:
 Criteria A, B, C and E: award up to a maximum [3].
 Criterion D: full marks can be awarded.

Where the question asks for impacts of two concepts on content, examiners must allow for
unbalanced treatment of the two concepts throughout a candidate’s response. One concept
may be more significant than the other.
                                                  – 21 –               N18/3/BUSMT/SP2/ENG/TZ0/XX/M


In section C, the question rubric explicitly states that “organizations featured in sections A
and B and in the paper 1 case study may not be used as a basis” to candidate’s answers to
questions 6, 7 and 8. When this happens please award marks as follows:

Criterion A
Award a maximum of [1]. The business management content cannot be relevant if the
organization is fictitious.

Criterion B
0 marks – there is no connection to a real-world organization.

Criterion C
Award a maximum of [1]. The arguments cannot be relevant if the organization is fictitious.

Criterion D
Mark as normal.

Criterion E
Award up to a maximum of [1]. The individual and/or group perspective(s) cannot be relevant
if the organization is fictitious.

Criterion B
For [2]: “…connection is not developed” should be treated the same as superficial.

Criterion C
 Questions 6 to 8 require consideration of the impact of one concept on a second concept
    – therefore accept 2 + 2 arguments for a balanced response.
 Justification is through logic or data.
 For [2] there is no balance as there are no counter arguments at all, or the arguments are
 all one-sided then this would be unjustified.
 For [3] there is some balanced arguments – some of which are justified.

Criterion D
 Introductions need to be concise and related to the question.
 The candidate’s response does not to have explicit headings for each structural element.
 A body is the area in which the substance of arguments occur. It is usually located
    between the introduction and the conclusion.
 Fit-for-purpose paragraph means that ideas are presented in a clear academic way. For
    example, one idea per paragraph.

Criterion E
 One example of an “individual” could be an individual consumer or an individual
    manager. However this could not be considered with a “group” of consumers or a
    management team.
 For [4], a balanced response: need to look at the perspectives of both individual and
    group(s). The chosen individual, group needs to be applicable and relevant to the
    question with specific explanation.
 Candidates need to go beyond stating the stakeholder.
 Candidates need not explicitly say “stakeholders”.
