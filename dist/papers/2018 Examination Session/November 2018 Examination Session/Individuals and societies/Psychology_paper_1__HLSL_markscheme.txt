                                                Section A
Biological level of analysis

1.   Explain how one principle that defines the biological level of analysis has been demonstrated
     in one example of research (theory or study).                                                   [8]

     Refer to the paper 1 section A markbands below when awarding marks.

     The command term “explain” requires candidates to give a detailed account, including
     reasons or causes, of how one theory or study clearly demonstrates a principle
     relevant to the biological level of analysis.

     Acceptable principles may include, but are not limited to:
     • behaviour is, to some extent, genetically based
     • animal research may inform our understanding of human behaviour
     • there are biological correlates to human behaviour.

     Responses should focus on the link between the principle and the theory or study – for
     example, a specific example of what animal research teaches us about human
     behaviour.

     If a candidate explains more than one principle in relation to one or more theories or
     studies, credit should be given only to the first principle explained in the first theory or
     study used.

     If a relevant principle and research are described but the link is not explicitly explained,
     then apply the markbands up to a maximum of [6].

     If a candidate explains a relevant principle making no link to an example of research at
     the biological level of analysis, up to a maximum of [4] should be awarded.

     If a candidate makes reference to a study or theory at the biological level of analysis
     but there is no relevant principle outlined, up to a maximum of [3] should be awarded.

2.   With reference to one study, describe how one biological factor may affect one cognitive process.   [8]

     Refer to the paper 1 section A markbands below when awarding marks.

     The command term “describe” requires candidates to give a detailed account of how
     one biological factor may affect one cognitive process.

     A specific biological factor must be clearly identified. Possible cognitive processes
     include, but are not limited to, memory, language acquisition, problem solving, and
     perception.

     Research studies may include but are not limited to:
     • Broca’s (1861) or Wernicke’s (1874) studies on the role of damage to specific
       regions of the brain on language production and language understanding
     • Martinez and Kesner’s (1991) investigation of neurotransmission and memory
       consolidation
     • Milner et al.’s (1968) case study of HM or Blakemore’s (1988) case study of Clive
       Wearing, investigating the role of the hippocampus on memory consolidation and
       retrieval
     • Newcomer (1998) or Meaney’s (1988) studies on the role of glucocorticoids
       (cortisol) on memory impairment.

     The focus of the response should be on how the biological factor affects the cognitive
     process, not solely on describing the study.

     If a candidate only describes an appropriate study without describing how one
     biological factor may affect one cognitive process, apply the markbands up to a
     maximum of [3].

     If a candidate describes how one biological factor may affect one cognitive process
     without making reference to a relevant study, apply the markbands up to a maximum of
     [4].

     If a candidate refers to more than one study, credit should be given only to the first
     study.

     If a candidate refers to more than one biological factor, credit should be given only to
     the first biological factor.

     If a candidate refers to more than one cognitive process, credit should be given only to
     the first cognitive process.

3.   With reference to one study, outline the role of situational and/or dispositional factors in
     explaining behaviour.                                                                           [8]

     Refer to the paper 1 section A markbands below when awarding marks.

     The command term “outline” requires candidates to give a brief account of how
     situational and/or dispositional factors may explain human behaviour.

     Answers may refer to attribution theory, self-serving bias, modesty bias or other
     relevant research to help outline the role of situational and dispositional factors. It
     would also be appropriate to refer to studies such as Milgram or Zimbardo in support of
     situational factors.

     If a candidate addresses the role of situational and/or dispositional factors in explaining
     behaviour without referring to an appropriate study, apply the markbands up to a
     maximum of [4].

     If a candidate makes reference to an appropriate study and outlines the role of
     situational and/or dispositional factors without making an explicit link between the
     factors and the study, apply the markbands up to a maximum of [6].

     If a candidate describes an appropriate study, but does not refer to situational or
     dispositional factors, apply the markbands up to a maximum of [3].

4.   Discuss one or more effects of the environment on one or more physiological processes.   [22]

     Refer to the paper 1 section B assessment criteria when awarding marks.

     The command term “discuss” requires candidates to offer a considered review of one
     or more effects of the environment on one or more physiological processes.

     Examples of how the environment may affect physiological processes include, but are
     not limited to the effects of:
     • daylight hours on levels of melatonin
     • poverty on neuroplasticity
     • environmental stressors on physiological stress response
     • interaction with the environment and brain development.

     Examples of studies include, but are not limited to:
     • Maguire et al.’s (2000) study on neuroplasticity in the hippocampus of taxi drivers
     • Marmot et al.’s (1997) Whitehall study on perceived control of workplace stress and
       cardiovascular health
     • Meaney’s (1988) study on how environmental stressors lead to hippocampal cell
       loss in rats
     • Rosenzweig and Bennett’s (1972) study on stimulating environments and dendritic
       branching
     • Bremner et al.’s (2003) study on environmental stressors and the reduction of
       hippocampal volume.

     Discussion of the effects may include, but is not limited to:
     • methodological and/or ethical issues
     • supporting and contrary findings
     • application of the findings
     • contributing factors other than the environment affecting physiological processes.

     Candidates may discuss one effect of the environment or one physiological process in
     order to demonstrate depth of knowledge, or may discuss a larger number of effects of
     the environment or physiological processes in order to demonstrate breadth of
     knowledge. Both approaches are equally acceptable.

5.   Discuss one or more ethical considerations related to one or more research studies at the
     cognitive level of analysis.                                                                [22]

     Refer to the paper 1 section B assessment criteria when awarding marks.

     The command term “discuss” requires candidates to offer a considered and balanced
     review of one or more ethical considerations related to one or more research studies at
     the cognitive level of analysis.

     Ethical considerations may be positive (what guidelines were followed) or negative
     (what guidelines were not followed).

     Ethical considerations may include, but are not limited to:
     • deception
     • protection from physical or mental harm
     • briefing and debriefing
     • right to withdraw from a study
     • informed consent
     • anonymity/confidentiality.

     Discussion of ethical considerations may include, but is not limited to:
     • why deception is used
     • the need for debriefing
     • a cost–benefit analysis approach with regard to ethical considerations
     • the meaning of “informed” consent and who has the right to give it
     • changes over time in adherence to ethical standards/guidelines
     • the importance of minimizing physical and/or psychological pain
     • why anonymity/confidentiality of data is important
     • whether the study is justified or could it have been conducted in alternative ways.

     Candidates that discuss the use of animals in research should use studies that are
     clearly cognitive and not studies that focus on the effects of biological factors on
     cognitive processes.

6.   Examine two or more factors influencing conformity.                                           [22]

     Refer to the paper 1 section B assessment criteria when awarding marks.

     The command term “examine” requires candidates to consider how two or more factors
     influence conformity in a way that uncovers the assumptions and relationships between
     each of these factors and conformity.

     Appropriate factors influencing conformity may include but are not limited to: culture,
     minority influence, group size, unanimity, confidence, self-esteem, intellectual
     competence and leadership ability. Candidates may refer to normative influence and
     informational influence as factors leading to conformity.

     Candidates may refer to a number of studies that may include but are not limited to:
     • Asch’s (1951, 1952, 1956) studies on the influence of group size, unanimity and the
       difficulty of the task
     • Crutchfield’s (1955) study on intellectual competence, ego strength, leadership
       ability and authoritarian personality
     • Perrin and Spencer’s (1988) study on confidence
     • Moscovici et al.’s (1969, 1976, 1985) studies on the influence of a minority
     • Berry’s (1967) study or Bond and Smith’s study (1996) on cultural differences.
     • Abrams (1990) study on the role of social identity.

     In order to respond to the command term “examine”, candidates may refer to:
     • our inherent need to belong and the role this plays in normative social influence
     • that we understand ourselves through social comparison
     • our behaviour is influenced by others, even when we believe that we are acting
        independently.
     • gender and cultural considerations – such as the role of cultural dimensions on our
        behaviour.

     Candidates may examine two factors influencing conformity in order to demonstrate
     depth of knowledge, or may examine a larger number of factors in order to
     demonstrate breadth of knowledge. Both approaches are equally acceptable.

     If a candidate examines only one factor influencing conformity, the response should be
     awarded up to a maximum of [5] for criterion A, knowledge and comprehension, up to a
     maximum of [4] for criterion B, critical thinking, and up to a maximum of [2] for criterion
     C, organization.

     If factors influencing obedience or compliance, rather than conformity, are discussed,
     no marks should be awarded for this discussion. Marks should only be awarded for a
     discussion of the Stanford Prison Study if the response focuses on relevant factors
     influencing conformity, for example referent informational influence.
