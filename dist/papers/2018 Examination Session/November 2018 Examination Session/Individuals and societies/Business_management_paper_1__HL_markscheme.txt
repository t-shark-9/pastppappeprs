                                        Section A

1.   (a)   Describe two elements of a marketing plan (line 21) for AFA.                          [4]

           The main elements of a marketing plan are:
            details of the marketing objectives of the business including target market
            sales forecasts
            marketing budget including financial projections
            marketing strategies (which may include 4Ps at SL, 7Ps at HL)
            detailed action plan.

           Context:
            Sam has poor understanding of finance, so the budget may not have been
             done well.
            He may have had problems with forecasts as this is a new business.
            One objective was to only sell coffee.
            Sam had CSR as one of the objectives, which, presumably applied to
             marketing.

           The two elements can both come from the 4Ps provided they are clearly
           distinguished.

           Do not allow elements from a business plan, eg vision statement, unless they are
           clearly linked to marketing.

           Mark as 2 + 2.

           Award [1] for each correct element identified and [1] for a description of how that
           feature relates to AFA. Award a maximum of [2] per element.

     (b)   With reference to AFA, explain why applying appropriate principles and ethics of
           accounting practice is important.                                                     [6]

           Accounting principles and ethics include:
            integrity – being straightforward, honest and truthful
            objectivity – avoiding bias, conflict of interest
            professionalism – accounts produced to relevant professional standards
            confidentiality
            accounts need to comply with legal obligations and be compliant with
             standards set by professional bodies.

           Context: in the context of AFA the business is run on ethical and fair trade
           concepts. Failing in any of the accounting principles and ethics could damage the
           reputation of the business and AFA could lose sales and customers. Investors
           will also need reassurance in relation to the ethics of the business. Other
           stakeholders, such as pressure groups concerned with fair trade, may need to be
           satisfied.

           Discussion of ethics in a wider sense is allowed but [6] can only be achieved if
           there is some reference to accounting principles.
           If ethics are general, and no mention of accounting principles/ethics then
           maximum award is [3].
           If accounting principles only with no reference to ethics/accounting ethics then
           maximum award is [3].

Be aware that context is difficult, so the same context can be used for the various
different principles/ethics.

Accept any other relevant explanation.

Marks should be allocated according to the markbands on page 3.

Award a maximum of [3] for a theoretical answer.

Award a maximum of [5] if the explanation is mainly descriptive, but in context.

2.   (a)   Describe two external stakeholders of AFA, other than customers.                        [4]

           External stakeholders include:
            customers (not allowable for this question)
            suppliers – originally nervous about supplying Sam’s new business. Need to
             conform to fair trade principles. Could include mystery shopper if it is clear that
             this is not an employee
            government – for taxes, data etc. Includes a Companies House role for proper
             accounts. Could include trading standards for ethics. Could include licensing
             issues. No evidence as to whether government wants to encourage fair trade
             or not
            banks and other creditors – at times AFA needs finance for expansion
            special interest groups/pressure groups, eg charities, NGOs, pressure groups
             – there is a fair trade movement (no need to use terms like special interest
             groups)
            the community – little evidence in case so not a good one to choose to get
             context mark
            competitors – supermarkets also stock fair trade products
            possible external sources of finance.

           N.B.: Shareholders are NOT external.

           Mark as 2 + 2.

           Award [1] for each correct element identified and [1] for a description of how that
           feature relates to AFA. Award a maximum of [2] per element.

     (b)   With reference to AFA, explain the importance of branding.                              [6]

           The importance of branding to AFA can be classified in a number of areas:
            competition: branding can be used to differentiate eg from supermarkets
            USP: AFA seeks to be the only dedicated fair trade store. Branding can
             enhance this USP
            pricing: A well-developed brand can help AFA set premium prices, helping
             profits which need improving.

           The importance can be developed through:
            the need to attract customers (eg, to the new stores)
            the need to encourage repeat purchases, eg through brand loyalty.

           Accept any other relevant explanation.

           Marks should be allocated according to the markbands on page 3.

           Award a maximum of [3] for a theoretical answer, often a pre-prepared textbook
           answer.

           Award a maximum of [5] if the explanation is mainly descriptive, but in context.

3.   (a)   With reference to AFA, outline one benefit and one cost to Sam of opening a
           new e-commerce website (lines 51–52).                                                [4]

           Main context: Sam’s vision to operate at a global level. Management issues.
           Need to reduce costs.

           Benefits include:
            targeting new customers locally, nationally and even globally, which is Sam’s
             vision
            sales volumes will increase, revenue will grow and – assuming costs are kept
             under control – AFA’s profits will increase
            economies of scale, eg with suppliers.
            possible reduced operating costs eg fewer sales assistants, lower rents
             without retails outlets.

           Costs include:
            designing the website
            managing the website, maintenance costs
            managing orders – paying packers etc
            dealing with increased sales (eg, recruiting people, paying additional wages,
             more warehousing etc)
            other setup costs, eg for online payment systems
            diseconomies of scale (Sam and Finn are not managing well).
            opportunity cost – if developed.

           N.B. Costs do not include general disadvantages

           Mark as 2 (benefits) + 2 (costs)

           Award [1] for each correct cost or benefit identified and [1] for a description of
           how that cost or benefit relates to AFA. Award a maximum of [2] per cost or
           benefit. There can be no more than one of each (cost or benefit).

     (b)   Distinguish between the leadership styles of Sam and Finn.                           [6]

           N.B.: Culture is not on the SL guide.

           Sam:
            Sam clearly wishes to remain in charge of AFA as a paternalistic or (soft)
             autocratic leader.
            Allow laissez faire and other leadership styles if explained effectively.
            There is evidence from the stimulus that Sam prefers to be a “big picture”
             thinker.
            He is mostly involved in the setting of the mission and vision of AFA.
            He does not enjoy the day-to-day running of the business and has left this to
             Finn.
            However, there is also evidence that Sam, given his positive thoughts towards
             Daniel Pink’s theory, is a “soft” autocrat, given that he is willing to delegate
             and empower some of the managers to run their own individual retail stores.
            Some candidates might mention that, using Handy’s classification from the
             Gods of Management, Sam is clearly a Zeus figure. – there is no need to
             mention these.

Finn:
 Finn clearly aligns his leadership to a more structured or bureaucratic style.
 He seemingly enjoys monitoring the details, which Sam finds boring.
 Finn enjoys centralization and control, which is tied to the way in which he
   communicates.
 Finn clearly believes in formal organization and his leadership style typifies
   this.
 His decision to employ a mystery shopper to effectively spy on his managers
   indicates that he is slightly paranoid and wishes to know about everything
   occurring in the business.
 Some candidates might mention that, using Handy’s classification form the
   Gods of Management, Finn is typically showing the leadership style inherent in
   an Apollo figure. There is no need to mention these.

Candidate can be rewarded if they argue that the styles are both the same
(usually autocratic) provided, they support their argument.

Accept any other relevant explanation.

Marks should be allocated according to the markbands on page 3.

Award a maximum of [3] for a theoretical answer.

Award a maximum of [3] if only Sam or Finn.

Award a maximum of [5] if the explanation is mainly descriptive, but in context.
Eg if both are explained but not distinguished.

                                         Section B
4.   (a)   State two elements of an organizational culture.                                        [2]

           References could be made to:
            style of management/leadership
            vision/mission statements/goals
            nature of the workforce – simple reference to employees is not enough
            nature of the business
            norms/values/beliefs/morals including tradition
            organizational structure.

           Where these are shown above as either/or this can only be rewarded as one
           element eg if both leadership and management are stated this is only one
           element.

           References could be made to power culture, role culture, task culture and person
           culture.

           Elements should relate to internal factors and not external factors such as the
           culture of the country.

           Award [1] for each element to a maximum of [2]. This answer does not need to
           be in context.

     (b)   (i)    Calculate the inventory/stock turnover for woolen hats.                          [2]

                                                                     1250
                  Stocks = 500, annual sales = 1250 so turnover =         = 2.5 times a year.
                                                                      500

                           500
                  Allow         365 = 146 days.
                          1250

                  Award [2] for a correct answer which must include “2.5 times” or “2.5 times
                  per year” or 146 days.

                  Award [1] for an attempt (eg calculating days sales in stocks as 146 days,
                  or, making a mistake or no units).

                  If the [2] mark answer does not appear in (i) but does appear in (ii) then (i)
                  can be rewarded retrospectively – you will have to go back to mark entry for
                  (i).

                                                500
                  Do not reward 500+1250 or         .
                                               1250

           (ii)   Comment on your result in (b)(i).                                                [2]

                  Seems very low – is the product seasonal? Is there poor management of
                  stock control?

                  Use OFR.

                  Award [1] for a simple statement and [2] if the statement is in context.
                  Do not reward simply putting the answer into words.

(c)   Explain the usefulness of a Gantt chart to AFA in planning the implementation of
      a new process.                                                                      [4]

      Usefulness includes:
       clarity in planning
       determining the likely project time of 20 weeks (context)
       identifying tasks that can be done concurrently, eg researching other
        businesses and appointing consultants (context)
       exploring the consequences of delays eg delays in training managers
        (context)
       help scheduling, eg training (context)
       help monitoring progress.

      Context could also be lean production.

      Usefulness could also be considered using shortcomings of Gantt.

      An explanation will usually include at least two uses/features of a Gantt chart.

      Award [4] for a good explanation using context effectively.

      Award [3] for either:
       an explanation but weak context; or
       a weak explanation but effective context.

      Award [2] for an explanation, but no context.

      Award [1] for some understanding.

(d)   Discuss the value to AFA of lean production methods.                               [10]

      Contextual issues:
       poor stock control
       poor order management
       poor quality control

      Aspects of lean production:
       lean production examines processes to find and eliminate all forms of waste.
       production processes adjusted to eliminate waste such as JIT, increased
        efficiency, eg with suppliers, managing employees more effectively, increasing
        capacity utilisation.

      Might include: Kaizen, total quality management (TQM), cell production, flexible
      specialisms, simultaneous engineering, JIT and process innovation, such as
      greater use of IT.

      Most likely are JIT, total quality management (TQM), process innovation, Kaizen.

      However:
       some techniques are not appropriate for AFA
       there are costs involved, eg IT, costs of changing. Can AFA afford these?
       are low levels of stocks suitable for retailers such as AFA?

Marks should be allocated according to the mark bands on page 4.

Theoretical answer or context limited to naming the business max [4].

One-sided discussion limited to [5].

Both sides considered, good use of evidence, particularly from section B, but no
effective conclusion award a maximum of [8].

For [10] the answer needs to be clearly relevant to AFA with good use of context
and a clear sense of the value to AFA argued convincingly.

                                       Section C
5.   Using the case study, additional information on pages 4 to 7 and appropriate business
     tools, recommend whether AFA should take over ABC.                                       [20]

     Arguments for:
      Might solve supply problems, such as lateness of deliveries and wrong orders.
      Better control of quality is possible particularly as lean production is an option.
      Easier to manage the supply chain.
      Could be a good time to buy – ABC’s share price is low (down 25 %), shareholders
        are dissatisfied and at the current share price the business seems cheap.
      Sam is impatient to grow the business – vertical integration would help.
      Market growth is very strong (forecast 10 % in 2019).
      More marketing by ABC may solve ABC’s problems.
      ABC has potential to exploit this growth by maintaining its market share (market
        share forecast to fall in 2019).
      An increase in ABC’s marketing budget may produce good results
      Sam is ambitious

     Arguments against:
      Potential for bad publicity about ABC to damage AFA. Not using organic materials
        would destroy Sam’s business model.
      Productivity is falling, strikes are threatened. Can Sam solve these problems?
      Maybe solve other problems first, eg disagreements, poor management,
        unresponsiveness, lack of training, quality issues.
      Falling sales at ABC may be due to poor products (sales forecast down from $6.5m
        to $5.9m).
      Doing nothing is always a useful option.
      ABC has liquidity problems. The current ratio decreases from 1.0 to 0.6.
      Business is highly geared – should Sam take this on? Is it a risk? Gearing up from
        400 % to 500 %, high and rising. High and rising gearing is a worry.
      Falling sales and profits at ABC are a real worry.
      Falling return on equity for ABC (equity constant, huge drop in profits (from $1m to
        $0.25m)
      Growing number of competitors. (competitors forecast up from 5 to 20 in 2019)
      Increasing worries of growing current liabilities (up from $2m to $5m in 2019).
      Falling share price. Why?
      Managerial conflict at AFA – could they take on more problems?

     The decision is likely to hang on the extent to which Sam/AFA can solve ABC’s
     problems.

     Accept any other relevant discussion.

Criterion A: possible theories, management tools and techniques include: Accounting
techniques and ratios, interpreting data, mergers/takeovers, Fishbone, Boston Matrix, Ansoff,
marketing issues, HRM/management issues, SWOT/Force Field/Decision trees (if used with
a sense of purpose), the importance of assumptions.

For [4]: Tools, techniques and theory understood and developed well with some relevance to
the additional stimulus material.

For [2]: some understanding of at least two tools, techniques or theories, but not developed.

Criterion B: the tools, techniques, theories and stimulus applied to the decision. Application
will be judged by the use of the stimulus material.

For [4]: relevant tools, techniques and theories are applied well to the case study context and
additional stimulus material, the application is convincing and relevant.

Remember, understanding has been rewarded in Criterion A.

For [2]: some limited context/application but not developed. Use of tools limits candidate’s
ability to make reasoned arguments.

Criterion C: Takeover discussed in balanced way, conclusions drawn and recommendation
made/supported.

For [4]: There needs to be a clear recommendation supported by the data.

For [2]: Some limited arguments but not justified. Or limited analysis (e.g. one-sided
argument) but candidate arrives/draws a reasoned conclusion.

Criterion D: Structure: This criterion assesses the extent to which the student organizes his
or her ideas with clarity, and presents a structured piece of writing comprised of:
 an introduction
 a concluding paragraph. Please note this can be different from the concept of a
    conclusion/recommendation in Criterion C. D can be rewarded without a
    recommendation.
 fit-for-purpose paragraphs. This means: not too long, each focused on distinct issues,
 structure. This means how the reader is guided through the discussion, how the
    paragraphs are sequenced.

For [4]: all four elements present, clearly organized.

For [2]: No logical structure but other elements present or logical structure with other
elements missing.

Criterion E: Stakeholders:
 individuals: Sam (most likely), Finn, Kim, individual consumers.
 groups: Managers, employees, (both at either business) customers, communities,
    governments.

For [4 Individual(s) and group(s) are considered in a balanced way. ie needs 1 or more of
both individuals and groups

For [2]: one individual or group considered appropriately, or several individuals or groups
considered superficially.
