Source B                                                         From “The U.S. is no longer a ‘full democracy’ a new study warns”, an article by
                                                                 Amanda Erickson, The Washington Post (2016).

The government of the United States got a downgrade this week: We’re no longer a “full democracy”,
according to the [Democracy Index produced by the Economist Intelligence Unit]2. For the first time, we
were [lowered to] “flawed”, thanks to an “erosion of public trust in political institutions”.

According to the report’s authors, a flawed democracy has free elections but “weak governance, an
underdeveloped political culture and low levels of political participation”. Other countries that [are
considered flawed democracies] include Italy, Japan, France and India. Rankings are based on a
country’s electoral process, civil liberties, the functioning of government, political participation and
political culture...

Faith in our public institutions – including Congress, newspapers and banks – has been in decline for
decades... Three-quarters [of Americans] believe that most elected officials put their own interests
ahead of the country... [Worldwide], just five percent of the world’s population live in a “full democracy”;
[thirty-four percent] live under authoritarian regimes.

Source C                Adapted from “Global Human Rights Under Siege Worldwide”, a testimony
                        by Mark P. Lagon (Freedom House3) to the USA Foreign Affairs Committee
                        Hearing (2016).

Freedom House has documented the tenth year of global decline in freedom, with 105 states experiencing
a decline over the last decade. Thirty-six percent of the world’s population lives in countries ranked as
“not free”. The sharpest declines have occurred in the areas of freedom of expression, rule of law, and
freedom of association.

Economic pressures have increased the decline. Declining economies have led to public unrest which has
been suppressed by many of the world’s authoritarian rulers. One argument popular with undemocratic
leaders is that the crushing of dissent is necessary to maintain peace and stability. There is a difference
between the superficial appearance of stability based on repression and stability that democracy brings.

Many states resort to anti-terrorism laws, blasphemy or insult laws, and laws governing the registration
and foreign funding of non-governmental organizations (NGOs) to effectively silence civil society.
Azerbaijan, China, Egypt, Ethiopia, Russia and Turkey, among others, all utilize such laws to varying
degrees. Protests break out because citizens have no other ways to engage in the political system or
express discontent. All too often, democracies only say that they uphold democratic principles while
sacrificing them for short-term economic and strategic gains.


Source D                Adapted from “Is Western Democracy Backsliding4? Diagnosing the Risks”, an
                        article by Pippa Norris, Journal of Democracy (2016).

Setbacks to democracy have occurred among several non-Western regions, developing societies, and
fragile states. Some of the worst backsliding during the last decade has happened in “hybrid regimes”,
such as Russia, Venezuela, Kenya and Turkey. Hybrid regimes are neither full democracies nor full
autocracies. In contrast, there have been improvements seen in Mongolia, Nepal, Bhutan, Tunisia and
Côte d’Ivoire. However, core institutions safeguarding political rights and civil liberties have not yet
declined in Western states. The most serious contemporary threats to Western liberal democracies arise
from two forces that each, in different ways, seek to undermine governments: (i) terrorist attacks on
domestic soil, which damage feelings of security, and (ii) the rise of populist-authoritarian forces.

The growth of populist-authoritarianism5 threatens liberal democracy by challenging tolerance, rule of law,
human rights and freedoms in Western societies. Populist rhetoric emphasizes that legitimate political
authority is based on popular sovereignty and majority rule. Populism undercuts the legitimacy of the
checks and balances on executive power in liberal democracies.

The argument that Millennials6 have become disillusioned with liberal democratic institutions and values
in the West has attracted considerable attention, going viral in media commentary. However, in the United
States and in many European countries, voters supporting populist-authoritarian parties and leaders are
drawn disproportionately from the older generation, not the Millennials.
