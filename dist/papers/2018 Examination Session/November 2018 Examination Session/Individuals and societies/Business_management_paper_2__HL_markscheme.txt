                                           Section A
1.   (a)   Describe one limitation of a break-even analysis.                                       [2]

           Some of the limitations may include:
            The break-even model assumes that all units produced are sold, therefore
             total revenue received if not all of the dolls/quantity is sold can be lower, which
             will have a negative impact on the break-even point.
            The break-even model assumes a linear relationship between output and total
             variable cost, whereas in reality the costs per unit can go down due to
             economies of scale. This will have a negative impact on the break-even point.
            The break-even model assumes that the price stays constant at all levels of
             output. In reality, price can be reduced or increased with direct impact on the
             break-even quantity.

           Accept any relevant description. There is no need for further explanation of the
           exact impact on the break-even point.

           Application is not expected.

           Award [1] for each relevant identification / list of one limitation of the model.

           Award [1] for a description up to a maximum of [2].

     (b)   Calculate:

           (i)   the number of dolls that DD needs to sell to reach $4000 level of profit
                 (show all your working);                                                          [2]

                 Fixed costs + target profit = 10 000 + 4000 = 14 000 = 700 dolls

                 Contribution per unit = 50 – 30 = 20 [shows that it’s part of given formula]

                 OR

                 Profit = total revenue – total cost

                 4000 = 50X – (10 000 + 30X)

                 20X = 14 000

                 The number of dolls needing to be sold to reach a profit of $4000 = 700

                 Award [1] for working and [1] for the correct answer.

                 Award a maximum of [2].

                 For a correct response that demonstrates understanding and application of
                 the formula, even if no specific headings are presented, award full marks.

                 Working must be shown for full marks. Accept a graphical calculation of BE
                 if drawn and stated accurately ie sufficient to extract correct data (do not
                 penalize labeling errors).

                               = 500 dolls

                                     500 dolls
       Capacity utilization rate =             = 0.55  100 = 55.55 %
                                     900 dolls

       Accept 55.5% or 55.56 %

       An alternative method would be:

       Total revenue  total costs, where:
        total revenue  price  quantity sold
        total costs  total fixed cost  total variable costs.

                               500
       Capacity utilization=        100 = 55.55 %
                               900

       Accept 55.5% or 55.6 %

       Do not credit for using the formula as it is given. Do not fully credit if the
       figure is not expressed in %.

       Award [1] for correct working, which includes the calculations of the break-
       even point and [1] for the correct answer in %. Award up to a maximum of [2].

       If only the correct breakeven is present, then award [1] only if working is shown.

       For a correct response that demonstrates understanding and application of
       the formula, even is no specific heading are presented, award full marks.

      (iii)   The profit or loss in the first year if DD sells 400 dolls (show all your
              working).                                                                       [2]

              Margin of safety times contribution per unit
              400–500 = (100)  20 = [$2000]

              Do not credit for the calculation of the break-even point but allow OFR even
              if correct. It is application of the MOS-BE formula which gets the mark for
              workings.

              Accept any other relevant method:

              Total revenue – total costs

              Price  quantity – (total fixed costs + total variable costs)

              400 $50 – [$10 000 + (400 $30)]

              $20 000 – [$10 000 + $12 000]

              $20 000 – $22 000

              $(2000) = a loss

              Award [1] for correct working and [1] for the correct answer. Award up to a
              maximum of [2].

              For a correct response that demonstrates understanding and application of
              the formula, even if no specific headings are presented, award full marks.

(c)   Assuming that the quantity of dolls to be sold in the second year is 550 and costs
      remain unchanged, calculate the price per doll that DD would need to charge to
      make a $6500 profit.                                                                    [2]

      Target profit = total revenue – total costs

      $6500 = $550X – [10 000 + ($30  550)]

      $6500 = $550X – [10 000 + 16 500]

      $6500 = $550X – $26 500

      $6500 + $26 500 = 550X

      $33 000 = 550X

      X = $60

      Price that DD has to charge is $60.

      Accept any other method provided that working is shown.

      Award [1] for working and [1] for the correct answer.

      Award a maximum of [2].

(c)   Explain one possible strategy, other than elimination of credit sales, for Papel to
      improve its liquidity position.                                                             [2]

      Liquidity is the ability to pay short-term debts. Papel’s liquidity position is delicate.
      Working capital is zero and Papel´s acid test is 0.75, which means that Papel has
      less than $1 of liquid assets with which to repay every $1 of its short-term debts.

      Papel could improve its liquidity position by keeping a tight credit control with
      debtors. Many are not paying on time, which means that Papel does not keep a
      check of customers’ accounts.

      Papel could use a debt factoring service to recoup some of the debt as a way to
      boost its liquidity.

      Papel should monitor debtors and chase them to pay on time and to respect the
      credit periods established and agreed.

      Creditors are increasing even though 80 % of accounts are settled in cash. To
      improve the liquidity position, Papel could try to negotiate improved credit terms
      with its suppliers.

           similar to the answer above.

     (b)   With reference to QS, explain two features of cradle to cradle manufacturing.             [4]

           Cradle to cradle is a sustainable form of manufacturing. QS seeks to create
           manufacturing principles that attempt to use production techniques that are
           efficient but also sustainable and waste free. Two features of using cradle to
           cradle with reference to QS are as follows:

           As its name suggests, QS will design and produce its air conditioners in such a
           way that most, if not all, of the materials used are recyclable. These materials
           (like glass, metal, plastic) that form parts of the air conditioners will be recyclable
           and used again for the production of future models. This will minimise waste.

           Cradle to cradle manufacturing with also allow QS to reuse some of the ready
           components of the old air conditions in the new models instead of disposing of
           those parts. QS might have to offer some financial incentives for the customers to
           return their old/outdated air conditioners.

           The air conditioners will also be built with biodegradable materials if QS cannot
           recycle the materials: for example, the carton for packaging of the air
           conditioners. This aspect will allow QS to reduce the environmental impact of its
           air conditioners.

           Accept any other relevant examples and explanation.

           Application here is very difficult – all of the stimulus info is about KA and gives no
           real links to QS – hence I believe to avoid generic responses, candidates should
           at least make reference to ‘air-conditioners” ie if responses just refer to QS and
           this could be replaced with any other company – then this is generic and only [1].

           Mark as 2 + 2.

           Award [1] for each relevant feature explained and [1] for appropriate application
           to the organization/type of products to a maximum of [2].

           [2] cannot be awarded for the difference if the response lacks either explanation
           and / or application.

              application [1].

(c)   Explain two possible human resource strategies that KA management could use
      to reduce employees’ resistance to change.                                           [4]

      Two possible change management strategies as part of overall HR strategies that
      can be used by KA management to reduce the impact of employees’ resistance
      to change.

      The employees are currently not involved in any decision making, so it can be
      assumed that there is not much communication between employees and
      management; as such, open and clear communication with the employees can
      be seen as one possible change strategy. The management should be honest
      and fully explain the reasons for the change. The management should
      emphasize the positive outcome of outsourcing as a way to overcome some of
      the weaknesses of KA, like an opportunity to improve customers’ perceptions.
      The possibility of new opportunities for employees in the marketing department
      should be emphasized as a new and motivating challenge. The management
      should not lie about some of the negative outcomes, like job losses of those who
      are not going to be employed in the marketing department.

      Before a final decision is taken, KA management should change the non-
      participative way/culture/lack of involvement in decision making and encourage
      bottom-up participation and consult with the employees and listen to their
      suggestions and opinion. Some of the more motivated employees might come up
      with some alternative strategies and/or express their preferences.

      Management should acknowledge the fear of the unknown and the possibility of
      resistance to change due to fear of inability to cope with new challenges. A
      promise of training should be provided for those who are going to be employed in
      the marketing department if option 2 is chosen or for all employees if option 1 is
      chosen.

      Another strategy is to appoint a change champion among the employees to
      encourage those employees who are reluctant to change to see the benefits of
      both option 1 and 2. Perhaps inviting the Trade Union to put forward solutions to
      minimizing the negative effects or in fact making the union the change champion.

      Do NOT accept – “raising salaries/wages” unless tied to Option 1. Clearly this
      strategy is not feasible for those laid off in Option 2.

      Accept any other relevant change HR strategy.

      Award [1] for a relevant generic HR (change management) strategy identified or
      described and [1] for any additional explanation in context.

      [2] cannot be awarded for the chosen (change management) HR strategy if the
      response lacks either explanation and / or application.

      For example:
       For an identification or a description of an HR strategy with or without
         application [1].
       For explanation of an HR strategy with no application [1].

(d)   Evaluate the two options that KA is considering.                                      [10]

      Given the fact that KA redesigned their product, both options will have the same
      starting point of being more energy efficient.

      Some of the possible arguments for option 1:
       Option 1 will not result in redundancy and possible negative impact on the
        motivation of the remaining employees. Moreover, with appropriate training in
        order to implement the TQM and lean production practices, employees might
        enjoy the new challenge and motivation might even increase further, resulting
        in more efficiency and cost saving.
       The implementation of TQM/lean production should result in KA becoming
        considerably more environmentally friendly and by adapting to the market
        pressure/customers demand. KA might be able to capture part of the increase
        in demand. Moreover, KA should further be able to benefit from a growing
        demand in the market due to increase capacity of 10 %.
       However, the capacity will only increase by 10 %. One may argue that this is
        a relatively small percentage for a growing market and perhaps suits KA well
        in the short run but it will face a major strategic decision again in the medium
        term. Still, with increasing competition perhaps a 10 % increase is sufficient.
       The financial return, albeit forecasted, seems reasonable (do not penalise if
        candidates argue the opposite) although we do not have information on the
        current interest rate for comparison. Three years of payback also seem
        reasonable but technology is changing very rapidly and KA might have to
        replace the machine quite soon afterwards.
       The current lack of finance perhaps should be judged as of less significance,
        as KA is a PLC and shares can be issued, especially to ethical and
        ecologically sustainable minded investors, who may also be encouraged to
        purchase given the stated market growth.

      Some of the possible arguments for option 2:
       With outsourcing, KA should be able to capture the growing markets and
        satisfy the growing demand with excellent quality sustainable air conditions
        and production process. One may judge this argument as highly significant
        for this option.
       The excellent quality should enable KA to differentiate itself in a current
        undifferentiated market and create a strong USP. The customer service –
        which is possibly one of the reasons for a fall in demand in a growing market
        – should also improve significantly. Making the marketing of KA its core
        activity with the money saved should enable KA to be successful. KA now
        has the finance to do so.
       However, the shareholders might disagree with such a risky strategic move
        as KA will move away from its current core activity of manufacturing air-
        conditioners This move might be perceived as too risky. There might be other
        ways of improving customer service especially if TQM is to be implemented,
        as customers are constantly listened to.
       Moreover, closing down the production facility is a significantly risky decision.
        It will be very difficult to rebuild one. Perhaps KA should not rely on QS
        especially given the fact that every 2 years the contract has to be negotiated.
        Terms and conditions could be changed in favour of QS when KA lost its
        bargaining power. KA’s management needs to pay attention to a potential
        loss of control.

Overall, both options can potentially enable KA to become a more
environmentally and ecologically sustainable organization. The second option will
enable KA to achieve this in the short term, however the possibility of strike
action is real and this will require some significant conflict resolution strategies by
KA’s management. Some of the good will enjoyed by KA will be undermined by
this move.

     (b)   Explain two advantages for LB of using on the job training.                             [4]

              On the job training is cheaper than sending recruits on external training. This
               is particularly advantageous for LB, as there are no hotel training schools
               nearby. External training will mean travelling and hosting costs that LB is
               unlikely to face due to cash-flow problems. Adding on external training costs
               could worsen LB’s cash-flow postilion.
              On the job training will enable new recruits to familiarize themselves with the
               hotel’s culture and Felix´s way of doing things. A recent survey has revealed
               that guests are pleased with LB due to employees’ polite and helpful attitude,
               which means that Felix’s on the job training has been effective. It is unlikely
               that new recruits will acquire this specific know-how with external training.
              With on the job training, trainees will actually serve guests while they receive
               training. This could help LB with its cash-flow problems, as labour costs could
               be saved.
              Felix will be able to watch the new recruits closely to follow their training. He
               will be able to screen closely their potentialities and weaknesses and transmit
               the hotel’s culture to them.

(c)   Explain the importance to LB of two elements of the extended marketing mix.          [4]

      Physical evidence is referred to as the environment in which the goods or
      services are delivered. It is a crucial element for hotels like LB, as hotel
      customers make their choices based on the appearance and state of hotel
      facilities to a great extent. Guests’ judgements will be based on LB’s physical
      evidence, including its location at the beach, to decide whether or not to book a
      room. There is, however, evidence from the stimulus that LB’s facilities need
      upgrading.

      People makes reference to the way employees relate to and communicate with
      customers. This is another crucial element for a hotel. LB’s employees are polite
      and helpful and particularly good with children. This has proved to be very
      important for LB’s brand loyalty and customers’ perceptions of it, and also
      provides a service that is perceived as very good value for money.

      Process could be related to the way LB provides a unique way of making
      payment for guests. LB provides a mechanism that allows customers the
      opportunity to pay on departure and avoid paying in advance.

(d)   Discuss whether LB should implement proposal 1 or proposal 2.                         [10]

      Proposal 1
       LB could follow Felix’s proposal to solve its cash-flow problems by reducing
         cash outflows and raising additional finance. It is probably a lower-risk
         strategy than Rose’s.
       Negative cash outflows could be reduced by delaying payment to suppliers in
         winter, instead of paying cash. However, LB could lose the generous
         discounts they get, which in turn could lead to increasing direct costs.
         Eventually, some suppliers may not accept delayed payments and may
         demand cash on delivery.
       LB could also delay hotel maintenance and refurbishments. However, LB
         already needs some upgrades. Deteriorated facilities could t negatively affect
         customer perception and brand loyalty. Sales may eventually fall.
       LB can cut other overhead spending such as advertising or promotion costs.
         These costs will reduce payments without affecting the quality of the service
         provided. However, future demand may fall if LB is not promoted effectively.
       Felix could lay-off some hotel staff or ask them to switch to part-time working.
         He may even close the hotel completely for the winter season. However this
         risks losing the services and know-how of key staff, who may not return in the
         high-season.
       Felix has also proposed to raise additional finance. LB could ask for a short-
         term loan or look for a new business partner. Probably, interest rates will be
         lower than overdraft rates and LB could save on some costs by substituting
         the overdraft for a less expensive source of finance. A new business partner
         will probably require some form of managerial control but fresh/innovative
         thinking can be introduced into LB.
       Alternative short-term sources of finance, such as the sale of assets and
         debts factoring, seem unlikely to work for LB. It seems that LB does not have
         assets to sell and there is no evidence that LB has many debtors.

      Proposal 2
       On the other hand, Rose believes that LB’s cash flow problems are due to
         low capacity utilization in winter. She has proposed to attract a new segment
         of customers.
       If new business customers come in winter, cash inflows will increase.
         However, to attract these customers, LB will need to build new facilities, such
         as a convention centre or a gymnasium, to cater for the needs of this
         particular market segment. This would involve a significant amount of finance
         that LB does not have.
       LB could try to find external finance, such as a long-term loan, equity finance
         or a venture capitalist. However, these alternatives seem unlikely for LB in the
         short term. All of them take time to be found. Bank loans are expensive and
         LB may not have enough assets to present as collateral. Floating the
         company could be quite expensive for a family-owned business.
       Venture capitalists are not easy to find, particularly if the business is not a
         promise of extraordinary profits.
       LB will need to conduct extensive market research around the new market
         segment and currently this will increase outflows at a time when monthly cash
         flows are negative.
                                      – 19 –              N18/3/BUSMT/HP2/ENG/TZ0/XX/M


It can be concluded that Rose’s alternative seems to be more risky and
expensive than Felix’s. What if business customers are not attracted? LB will be
indebted with facilities that would remain obsolete for its current market segment.
Felix’s proposal, on the other hand, seems more plausible and conservative.
Some of the alternatives, such as delaying payments, could work without much
risk involved. However, LB should also find a way to increase inflows by tackling
its capacity utilization problem. Diversifying into another market segment (such as
elderly tourism?) that may not involve a great investment could help to increase
inflows in winter.

5.   (a)   Define the term innovation.                                                           [2]

           Innovation is about putting a new idea or approach into action. It can be
           described as the process of translating an idea/invention into a service/good that
           creates value. Innovation can be achieved by improving existing goods,
           processes or services

           Candidates are not expected to word the definition exactly as above.

           N.B.: no application required. Do not credit examples on their own. It is not
           necessary to highlight different types of innovation although credit where present.
           Do not credit vague description of ‘change’

           Award [1] for a basic definition that conveys partial knowledge and
           understanding.

           Award [2] for a full definition.

     (b)   Explain two roles of Benno’s mission statement.                                       [4]

           The roles of a mission statement include:
            communicating the purpose of the organization to stakeholders
            informing decision making and strategy development
            developing the measurable goals and objectives by which to gauge the
              success of the organization's strategy.
            Inspiring and motivating both internal and external stakeholders

           N.B.: for full marks roles should be linked to some mention of stakeholders

           For Benno, the mission statement has provided a way for the business to
           differentiate itself from its competitors, especially at a time when competition in
           the healthy soft drinks market is intense.

           The mission statement is also a way to attract new investors who may have
           empathy with the direction of Benno. This is an important role given the need for
           Benno to be committed to innovation and CSR.

           Award [1] for a basic answer that identifies a role of a mission statement.

           Award [1] for a basic answer that identifies/explains a role of a mission statement

           Award [2] for an answer that identifies/explains the roles of a mission statement
           with application.

           Do not reward marks for describing/defining a mission statement.

(c)   Explain one advantage and one disadvantage for Benno of using a focus group
      of loyal customers.                                                                    [4]

      Advantages of a focus group of loyal customers:
       Can obtain detailed information about your own customers about their
         feelings, perceptions and opinions.
       Are cheaper than performing individual interviews
       Less time-consuming than individual interviews
       Provide an opportunity to clarify any issues or problems.

      Disadvantages of a focus group of loyal customers:
       They can be hard to control and manage.
       You are only getting the views of loyal customers – it tells you nothing about
         consumers who prefer rival brands and why they prefer them to your soft
         drink.
       The results are difficult to analyse, especially if the focus group provides
         qualitative feedback.
       Members may not reveal their own feelings but are swayed by the majority
         view.
       May not be representative of the target market as a whole.

      Possible application:
      For Benno, an advantage of using a regular focus group is that they will be aware
      of the company’s products and mission. This will reduce the amount of statistical
      noise and save time in the discussions when looking at new product ideas, such
      as biodegradable rings. Can help to support or otherwise, secondary research
      regarding the importance of ‘green’ credentials and of price in the soft drinks
      market.

      However, having a regular group for Benno increases bias and reduces
      objectivity of the data researched. It might be a useful exercise for Benno to ask
      customers who are not overly familiar with their products to achieve a more
      balanced qualitative view. Difficult to organize particularly in the target group of
      12-18 year olds since they are minors and need consent to participate.

      Accept any other relevant advantage / disadvantage.

      Accept any other relevant explanation.

(d)   Recommend whether Benno should replace its plastic drink rings with the new
      biodegradable drink rings.                                                                 [10]

      For:
       It fits in well with its mission statement “to produce healthy drinks without
         damaging the environment” and this may be important in maintaining
         customer loyalty.
       It fits into its belief in corporate social responsibility, as the current drink rings
         damage the environment and harm creatures in the seas, such fish.
       Competition in this drinks market is very intense – this could act as a
         strengthening of its USP for Benno and retain loyal customers and attract
         customers from rivals. It will strengthen its image as a business that has
         “green” credentials.
       Sales of Benno’s drinks have fallen significantly over the last five years– so it
         is important that Benno does something to stem this tide.
       Accept any other reasoned arguments.

      Against:
       It will cost $5m to buy the machinery to produce the new rings and the
         business has no accumulated retained profits – therefore the funds will need
         to be raised, probably externally via a bank loan, which will lead to interest
         charges and an increase in operating costs. It may take time to find a suitable
         angel investor to help finance this project. Will the angel investor wish to exert
         some control over Benno’s operations?
       The unit cost increase is 50 %, a rise from 10 cents to 15 cents per ring, and
         the business only has a net profit margin of 10 %. As the market is
         competitive and reports suggest that consumers are price sensitive, a price
         rise – passing on the cost of the new rings – is probably not going to be
         possible. The result is that Benno’s net profit margin will fall.
       Sales are falling, particularly to the 12–18 age group – are they going to be
         energized into buying a product that is more environmentally friendly,
         particularly when reports suggest purchases of green products are not
         increasing?
       In terms of a new way forward for Benno, the introduction of the new rings
         has a great deal of merit. There are a large number of marketing
         opportunities available in a competitive market and this idea will strengthen
         Benno’s brand. However, the forecasted financial implications of this idea are
         not ideal and if sales volumes do not increase significantly then Benno may
         find itself financially worse off if profits do not increase. One solution may be
         to wait until some more objective market research via a new untested focus
         group have given their thoughts on the new ring.
       Accept any other reasoned arguments.

      Marks should be allocated according to the mark bands on page 3 with further
      guidance below.

      A balanced response is one that provides at least two arguments for and two
      arguments against the option.

      For one relevant issue that is one-sided, award up to [3]. For more than one
      relevant issue that is one-sided, award up to a maximum of [4].

                                                  Section C

Marks should be allocated using the assessment criteria on pages 4 to 5 with further
guidance below.

N.B.: examiners should include a breakdown of each mark awarded per criterion and a
brief note explaining the mark awarded at the end of each candidate’s response.

The main aim of paper 2 (SL or HL) section C is to assess candidates’ understanding of the
six major concepts (change, culture, ethics, globalization, innovation, strategy) within a
business context. Candidates are to demonstrate their understanding through an
organization of their choice. The expectation of the use of an organization is to allow
assessment of the depth of candidates’ understanding through their ability to apply the
concepts and their knowledge.

Assessment of candidates’ knowledge of the organization itself is not an aim of the
assessment. If a candidate makes minor factual errors and these minor errors have no
genuine bearing on whether the candidate understands the concepts, examiners should not
penalize. For example, a minor error of historical fact (the year when a company was
founded, or the year in which a change was implemented) which has no genuine bearing on
candidates’ understanding of the concepts does not warrant penalty.

6.     With reference to an organization of your choice, examine the impact of innovation on
       promotional strategy.                                                                       [20]

7.     With reference to an organization of your choice, examine the impact of globalization
       on change in operations management.                                                         [20]

8.     With reference to an organization of your choice, examine the impact of ethics and
       culture on human resource management.                                                       [20]

It is expected that the candidate explains the chosen theoretical direction / content of their
response.

Additional guidance in relation to the assessment criteria
For each criterion, the aim is to find the descriptor that conveys most accurately the level
attained by the candidate, using the best-fit model. It is not necessary for every single aspect
of a level descriptor to be met for that mark to be awarded.

    The highest-level descriptors do not imply faultless performance and should be
     achievable by a candidate.
    A candidate who attains a high level of achievement for one criterion will not necessarily
     reach high levels of achievement for the other criteria and vice versa.

If only one concept is addressed:
 Criteria A, B, C and E: award up to a maximum [3].
 Criterion D: full marks can be awarded.

Where the question asks for impacts of two concepts on content, examiners must allow for
unbalanced treatment of the two concepts throughout a candidate’s response. One concept
may be more significant than the other.

In section C, the question rubric explicitly states that “organizations featured in sections A
and B and in the paper 1 case study may not be used as a basis” to candidate’s answers to
questions 6, 7 and 8. When this happens please award marks as follows:

Criterion A
Award a maximum of [1]. The business management content cannot be relevant if the
organization is fictitious.

Criterion B
0 marks – there is no connection to a real-world organization.

Criterion C
Award a maximum of [1]. The arguments cannot be relevant if the organization is fictitious.

Criterion D
Mark as normal.

Criterion E
Award up to a maximum of [1]. The individual and/or group perspective(s) cannot be relevant
if the organization is fictitious.

Criterion B
For [2]: “…connection is not developed” should be treated the same as superficial.

Criterion C
 Questions 6 to 8 require consideration of the impact of one concept on a second concept
    – therefore accept 2 + 2 arguments for a balanced response.
 Justification is through logic or data.
 For [2] there is no balance as there are no counter arguments at all, or the arguments are
 all one-sided then this would be unjustified.
 For [3] there is some balanced arguments – some of which are justified.

Criterion D
 Introductions need to be concise and related to the question.
 The candidate’s response does not to have explicit headings for each structural element.
 A body is the area in which the substance of arguments occur. It is usually located
    between the introduction and the conclusion.
 Fit-for-purpose paragraph means that ideas are presented in a clear academic way. For
    example, one idea per paragraph.

Criterion E
 One example of an “individual” could be an individual consumer or an individual
    manager. However this could not be considered with a “group” of consumers or a
    management team.
 For [4], a balanced response: need to look at the perspectives of both individual and
    group(s). The chosen individual, group needs to be applicable and relevant to the
    question with specific explanation.
 Candidates need to go beyond stating the stakeholder.
 Candidates need not explicitly say “stakeholders”.
