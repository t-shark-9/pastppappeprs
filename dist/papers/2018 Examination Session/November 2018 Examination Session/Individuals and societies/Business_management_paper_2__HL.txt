Answer one question from this section.

1.   Designer Dolls (DD)

     Designer Dolls (DD) is a start-up business that will create hand-crafted unique dolls using
     a job/customized production method. As part of their business plan DD undertook a break-
     even analysis.

                   Table 1: Forecasted figures for DD for the first year of operation

                                   Fixed costs                      $10 000

                                   Variable costs per doll              $30

                                   Price per doll                       $50

                                   Full productive capacity        900 dolls


     (a)   Describe one limitation of a break-even analysis.                                          [2]

     (b)   Calculate:

           (i)     the number of dolls that DD needs to sell to achieve a profit of $4000 (show all
                   your working);[2]

           (ii)    the capacity utilization rate at the break-even quantity for DD for the first year of
                   operation (show all your working);[2]

           (iii)   the profit or loss in the first year if DD sells 400 dolls (show all your working).[2]

     (c)   Assuming that the quantity of dolls to be sold in the second year is 550 and costs
           remain unchanged, calculate the price per doll that DD would need to charge to make a
           $6500 profit.                                                                              [2]

2.   Papel

     Papel manufactures and sells paper bags. It pays cash for 80 % of its raw materials but,
     to remain competitive, it must sell on credit to all customers. Many debtors are not paying
     on time and creditors (suppliers) are increasing. The board of directors is concerned about
     Papel’s liquidity position.

     The finance manager has provided information from Papel’s accounts.

     (c)   Explain one possible strategy, other than elimination of credit sales, for Papel to
           improve its liquidity position.                                                              [2]

                                              Section B

Answer two questions from this section.

3.   KA

     KA is a public limited company that designs, manufactures and sells air conditioners.
     KA’s unionized employees are motivated and efficient despite not being involved in any
     decision making. However, they are resistant to change.

     The market and competition for air conditioners are growing rapidly. KA operates at full
     capacity but stock turnover has slowed.

     Primary market research revealed that:
     • consumers do not differentiate KA air conditioners from those of its competitors. All
        products are perceived as medium price and medium quality
     • KA’s customer service is rated as poor
     • customers demand energy-efficient products using ecologically sustainable production
        methods.

     To exploit opportunities and overcome weaknesses and threats, KA’s management has
     decided to redesign its products so that they are energy efficient. KA is considering two
     options:
     • Option1: Implement lean production methods, which includes investing in ecologically
        sustainable machines that will increase capacity by 10 %. Total quality management
        (TQM) will also be implemented. However, the financial manager is worried about KA’s
        ability to meet high initial costs. The forecasted payback period is three years and
        average rate of return (ARR) is 4 %.
     • Option 2: Outsource the production to QS, a company known for its reliability and high
        capacity to produce excellent quality air conditioners using cradle to cradle manufacturing
        principles. However, QS refuses to sign an exclusive long-term contract with KA, insisting
        instead on renegotiating the contract every two years. KA will have to close its production
        facility and will use the cost savings to improve customer service and to reposition and
        differentiate its air conditioners.

     Employees have heard rumours of both options and fear for their jobs. Strike action is being
     considered.


     (a)   Define the term public limited company.[2]

     (b)   With reference to QS, explain two features of cradle to cradle manufacturing.              [4]

     (c)   Explain two possible human resource strategies that KA management could use to
           reduce employees’ resistance to change.                                                    [4]

     (d)   Evaluate the two options that KA is considering.                                          [10]

4.   La Bonita (LB)

     La Bonita (LB) is a beach hotel owned by Felix and Rose Sanchez. Its current target market
     is families seeking beach holidays. LB offers high-quality service. Customers do not pay in
     advance and pay in full on departure. LB is located near a capital city.

     As there are no hotel training schools locally, Felix provides on the job training to all new
     recruits. A recent survey by LB to assess brand loyalty found that existing customers remain
     loyal because:
     • they appreciate not having to pay in advance, as required at other local hotels
     • employees are polite and helpful and particularly good with children
     • the services provided are perceived as very good value for money.
     However, many customers have commented that the hotel needs to upgrade its facilities.

     In winter, LB has a very low capacity utilization and monthly cash flows are negative. LB
     gets through these months using bank overdrafts while continuing to pay its suppliers in cash
     to get generous discounts. Felix is concerned that the cash-flow situation is unsustainable
     and could get worse because the hotel facilities need upgrading. He proposes that LB raises
     additional finance and finds ways of reducing cash outflows in the winter (proposal 1).

     Rose believes that the cash-flow problem is mainly due to low capacity utilization in the
     winter months. She wants to diversify and attract a new segment for the winter: business
     customers. However, this would involve significant expenditure, including upgrading and
     adding new facilities to the hotel (proposal 2).


     (a)   Define the term brand loyalty.                                                           [2]

     (b)   Explain two advantages for LB of using on the job training.                              [4]

     (c)   Explain the importance to LB of two elements of the extended marketing mix.              [4]

     (d)   Discuss whether LB should implement proposal 1 or proposal 2.[10]




                                                                                              Turn over

5.   Benno

     Benno is a soft drinks manufacturer. Its mission statement is
     “to produce healthy drinks without damaging the environment”.

     Competition in the healthy soft drinks market is fierce.
     Benno uses a competitive pricing strategy. However, sales of
     Benno’s drinks have fallen significantly over the last five years,
     particularly in the 12–18 age group. The business has no
     accumulated retained profits.

     Benno is committed to innovation and corporate social responsibility (CSR). Its research
     and development division has recently invented a new biodegradable drink pack ring
     that starts to break down within two hours of contact with sea water. It dissolves fully in
     48 hours. Currently, 98 % of pack rings are made of plastic and when dumped in the sea are
     responsible for the death of many sea creatures.

     A focus group of loyal customers used regularly by Benno’s marketing department is
     wholeheartedly in favour of the new drink rings. However, the marketing director has read
     recent studies that suggest:
     • purchases of green products are not increasing, despite the positive attitude of many
        consumers towards sustainability and biodegradable products
     • consumers continue to prioritize price when purchasing soft drinks.
     To manufacture the new drink rings, machinery costing $5 million would be needed. Drink
     ring production unit costs would rise from 10 cents to 15 cents and prices of a six-pack of
     Benno soft drinks would have to increase by 5 %. Benno’s net profit margin on a six-pack is
     10 %.

     Benno’s director of corporate social responsibility favours the change to the new drink rings
     but is opposed by both the finance director and marketing directors.

     (b)   Explain two roles of Benno’s mission statement.                                           [4]

     (d)   Recommend whether Benno should replace its plastic drink rings with the new
           biodegradable drink rings.                                                               [10]
