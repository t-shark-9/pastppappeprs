                                     India’s First 3D Art Museum




           Art is one of the most fascinating experiences, and it only gets better when it’s interactive.
           Chennai’s self-taught artist, A P Shreethar, seems to think the same way, which is why he has
           launched India’s first 3D art museum.

           WHAT IS IT?
    5      Located on the East Coast Road, Click Art Museum is a great addition to the city’s art scene. Using
           3D art, the interactive experience consists of 2D images that create the illusion of a third one.
           Fulfilling his long-term desire to do something unique in the field of art, A P Shreethar has created
           the 3D art frames in such a way that every piece is finished only when the viewer enters the frame.

           WHAT TO EXPECT
   10      There are 24 interactive works at this museum. The huge life-like images trick the eyes and
           recreate scenes into works such as Charlie Chaplin* offering a flower, a fire-breathing dragon,
           a selfie-clicking chimpanzee and much more.

           Once you are in, the museum trip starts with a brief tour and interpretation by a staff member.
           You’ll be provided with an overview of the museum, the trick-art paintings and you are also given
   15      a quick tutorial on how to position yourself for the maximum effect of the illusions. There are even
           tutorial videos available at major spots inside the museum on how to click the perfect photograph
           of the art pieces.

           Where: VGP Snow Kingdom, 159, 5/108, East Coast Road, Akkarai, Injambakkam
           Entry: Rs 150 for adults, Rs 100 for children

                                  How A Crisis Can Be An Opportunity
         In the Chinese language, the word for “crisis” also means “turning point”,
         as the word, which is Wēijī is made up of two characters, one meaning
         “danger” and the other “opportunity”. It represents the understanding
         that no matter how difficult a crisis might be, it also holds within
                                                                                                    Wēijī
    5    it opportunities.

         When you are in the midst of a crisis it can be really difficult to see this as you are focused on
         resolving or dealing with whatever challenges you are facing. The tough part can be to hold on
         to hope as you are going through it.

         Resolving a crisis needn’t be difficult. Here are 5 simple ways to help you to hold on to hope and
   10    move through a crisis in order to grow stronger and to go forward positively:

         1.    Have a vision. This gives you the necessary purpose and drive to get through and head
                towards the best outcome possible.

         2.    [ – X – ]. Even if you feel like hiding away, it’s important to keep good positive support
                around you as much as you can. Always have people you can rely on around you; it’s those
   15           that build us up and are there when we need them the most who are the ones you know
                you can really rely on as friends.

         3.    [ – 11 – ]. When you are going through tough times it can be easy to reach for the wrong
                foods or sometimes not eat much at all. Yet it is at these times that you need the strength
                and energy that good nutrition provides.

   20    4.    [ – 12 – ]. In every crisis there are lessons, not only in how to avoid similar times in the
                future but also, and most importantly, lessons about yourself. Take time to recognise what
                you can take from the situation and how you can grow from it.

         5.    [ – 13 – ]. As you go through a crisis you are experiencing a significant change, which means
                there will be things to let go of. Seeing this and allowing the process can be helpful in
   25           moving forward.

                          ‘In the midst of every crisis, lies great opportunity’ ~Albert Einstein

                                  Bob Marley – Enduring Icon
           Mention Jamaica, and many foreigners who scarcely know
           where the country is, will cry in recognition, “Bob Marley!”
           The musician and Reggae artist Robert Nesta Marley is one
           of the most famous figures Jamaica has produced.

     5     In our world dominated by western media, musicians accepted
           by Europe and America tend to become known worldwide. But
           it’s not just music that has made Marley an international icon. His
           songs are inseparable from the handsome, dreadlocked person
           that made him a visually ideal global icon. As he was of mixed-
    10     race, this meant every race could identify with him.

           Marley died at the age of 36. Most dominant twentieth century
           icons – Elvis, James Dean, Princess Diana for instance – died
           before 40, or in John F. Kennedy’s case, looked it. While their
           surviving contemporaries slowly dwindled into aged mortality,
    15     in the public mind they stayed forever young and glamorous.

           To those who are living, the early dead remain forever young and immune to the ravages of age.
           They become untarnished blank canvases on which we paint our dreams of the ideal. Marlon
           Brando may have been a better actor than James Dean, and Johnny Cash a superior artist to Elvis.
           But in the popular mind, the accomplishments of fat, old Marlon and wrinkled Johnny just can’t
    20     compete with handsome, sleek, airbrushed Jimmy1.

           None of this brings Marley’s greatness into question, although [ – X – ] avid admirers get carried
           away. The man was a singer and songwriter - who, like all musicians, produced the [ – 24 – ] bad
           tune - not some perfect person. He certainly [ – 25 – ] claimed such a role for himself. Marley
           has become a posthumous international symbol of resistance against oppression. Protestors
    25     in all corners of the globe have spoken of the inspiration they have gained from Bob’s songs of
           freedom. It’s [ – 26 – ] impossible now to imagine any march against injustice [ – 27 – ] that is not
           accompanied by strains of “Emancipate yourself from mental slavery, none but ourselves can free
           our mind”2.

           Without doubt one of the 20th century’s finest musicians, Marley’s almost unparalleled global
    30     popularity seems to encompass all humanity. Men, women, the young, the old, the middle-aged –
           everyone seems to like Bob Marley’s music. And his lustre simply keeps growing.


                                                                      © The Gleaner Company (Media) Limited
