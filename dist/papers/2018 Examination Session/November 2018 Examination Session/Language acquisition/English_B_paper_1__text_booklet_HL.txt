                                    Boston DJs support ZUMIX
         In this day and age, some smartphone-wielding tech
         snobs might argue that live radio isn't relevant any more.
         But for ZUMIX, launching an FM radio station in 2016
         was one of the biggest steps in its 25-year history.

     5   Founded in 1991, ZUMIX, an East Boston non-profit
         organization and community center, is dedicated to
         providing access to top-quality arts experiences for
         a low-income, under-served neighborhood. At ZUMIX,
         children and teens can learn how to play an instrument,
   10    record music, or they can become an on-air radio
         personality.

         To celebrate the anniversary of its founding, the
         organization is hosting an event "Boston DJs for
         ZUMIX" this Friday (March 31). The occasion will feature performances from musicians and guest
   15    DJs, including "Morning Guy Tai" Irwin, the organizer of the event.

         "I've long admired ZUMIX for their hands-on work with teenagers, work that gets results, and
         launches kids into young adulthood, college, and a creative, productive life;' Irwin tells Vanyaland.
         "When ZUMIX acquired a radio station, I got involved with the community center and quickly saw
         the advantages and opportunities that it was providing to Boston youth;' he added.

   20    Irwin tells the story of working in a Long Island ice cream parlour as a teenager, when his career
         path took an unlikely turn as a result of a free ice cream cone.

         "On slow nights I called WLIR radio and made requests. Most of the DJs would answer the phone,
         and many played my requests. In return I'd offer them ice cream. One DJ, Denis McNamara,
         actually came into the store, which was located about a mile from their studios, and took me up
   25    on an offer of a free ice cream. We talked for a while and he then invited me to come up there and
         just hang out.

         "A few nights later, while I was visiting the studios, an announcer asked me to read one line of a
         commercial - so I said 'Long Island Honda in Hicksville' and I was immediately addicted to being
         on air. Now I had direction, focus and an identity that I would never lose. For the next 30 years,
   30    radio was my world:'

         Irwin hopes that the Boston radio community will support 94.9 FM so that the station can continue
         its youth radio program and give participants the same career boost he received as a teenager.

         "I love being involved with all aspects of ZUMIX;' says Irwin. "I see what it does for the kids in East
         Boston, and I immediately relate to them. ZUMIX is not just another after-school program;' he says,
   35    "it's the soul of East Boston, the soul of young Boston, of young America:'

           The Great Barrier Reef is dying: we need to act now!




                                     April 05, 2017   4:00PM     By Lorna Gray

         There’s nothing quite like being surrounded by beautiful, vibrant corals, stunning fish and
         exotic sea creatures. But have you ever snorkelled the Great Barrier Reef? I’m lucky enough
         to say I have. It’s not only beautiful but it is the largest reef ecosystem on Earth. It’s no
    5    wonder people flock from every corner of the globe to snorkel there.

         But did you know that the reef, which also happens to be one of the seven natural wonders
         of the world, is in trouble? In fact, it’s in grave danger.

         Sure, you’ve probably heard about this in the media but the seriousness of the situation
         is terrifying. In fact, it’s currently suffering through a severe bleaching event for an
  10     unprecedented second year in a row.

         We now know that bleaching is caused by a drastic rise in sea temperatures and this causes
         the corals to turn ghostly white — they’re basically revealing their skeletons. In effect, it kills
         the corals.

         Since 1985, the Great Barrier Reef has suffered a loss of 50 % of its stunning corals. This is
  15     due to a variety of factors, the most important being pollution. The mass bleaching of corals
         that occurred in 2016 and again in 2017 has been absolutely catastrophic for the reef.
         81 % of the corals are now bleached and this means they’re at risk of dying.

         “The coral bleaching is a warning sign,” says conservationist John Rumney. “We need to pay
         attention to it.”

  20     “The coral on the Great Barrier Reef is the building block for biodiversity,” says Rumney.
         “There are 600 different species of coral, and two and a half thousand species of fish. You
         wipe the corals out and you wipe out their food chain. And if the corals collapse, the fishing
         industry will collapse too. The reef, as we know it, may never come back if we humans keep
         polluting it.”
                                              –5–                N18/2/ABENG/HP1/ENG/TZ0/XX/T


25   So what will happen to the Great Barrier Reef next, you might ask. Um… well, nobody
     actually knows what will happen if or when…

     “Researchers can only hazard a guess,” says Dr Dean Miller, Science Director at Great
     Barrier Reef Legacy.

     “Tiny marine algae live inside the corals’ tissue and [ – X – ] they provide the corals with the
30   energy they need to grow and reproduce,” explains Dr Miller.

     “But when that coral is bleached, the algae will often die from overheating, or simply leave.
     The corals starve [ – 17 – ] they’re without their main food and energy source.”

     Dr Miller also believes that the 2016 coral bleaching was the worst on record. [ – 18 – ],
     more than two-thirds of corals were killed in some areas.

35   It’s worth noting that this is a worldwide epidemic [ – 19 – ]. Corals have been bleaching
     continuously across the Pacific Ocean since mid-2014 and this is a worldwide cause for
     concern. [ – 20 – ] we can act to save this global asset and Australian icon. But we need
     to start caring now.

                                                                                  Bauer Media Pty Ltd

                        Why water is becoming the "new oil"




         The average North American does not think twice when they turn on the water for a shower, or to
         clean their hands. We have all enjoyed access to clean, fresh water for years without a single worry.
         Unfortunately, this is likely to change in the future. For drought-afflicted states like California, that
         future is arriving rather quickly. Californians already have to deal with water restrictions. These will
    5    likely be extended to other states as time progresses. This is because water is the "new oil".
         It is a phrase that you will likely hear over and over again in the near future. Let's take a look at why
         people are taking up this new refrain.

         Why water is the "new oil"

         Political pundits like to claim that water is the "new oil" because both are finite resources that serve
   10    as the basis for conflicts. As we march toward the future, water will likely replace oil as the most
         valued resource simply because it is fundamental to the survival of humanity and we do not have
         enough of it for our growing population. Eventually, humanity will likely run out of fresh water.
         When we reach the point where we only have salt water, desalinization will be of the utmost
         importance. This is a process that takes the salt and various minerals out of salt water to produce
   15    drinking water. However, the desalinization process is expensive and takes a significant amount of
         time to complete.

         What will the future look like?

         If humanity fails to limit population growth, wars will inevitably be fought for access to fresh water,
         just like they were fought over oil in the 20th century. However, it is doubtful whether countries
  20     around the world can institute family planning programs to curb population growth. Engineers
         broadly agree that humanity will eventually figure out how to fuel vehicles with a substance other
         than oil, yet humanity will probably not figure out how to survive without fresh water. Politicians,
         economists, demographers and just about anyone else "in the know" agree that access to clean
         and fresh water will soon become humanity's most important challenge.

   25      Humanity's 21 st century water challenge

          We are tasked with determining how to make the most efficient use of our existing fresh water
          resources. Our water must be used in a much more sustainable manner with an eye on posterity.
          As an example, consider hydro-fracking* companies that contaminate millions of gallons of water
          in an effort to secure the natural gas positioned beneath the surface of the earth. Critics argue
   30     that fracking will therefore lead to increased competition for our existing water resources. Nor is it
          prudent to use massive amounts of water to maintain lush green golf courses throughout the year.
          If we continue our wasteful ways, water could eventually become even more valuable than oil.
          Such a statement seems exaggerated when uttered today yet it could easily come to fruition in the
          next two decades.

                An extract from As I Walked Out One Midsummer Morning




         Presently I got up and dressed, stuck my violin under my jacket, and went out into the
         streets to try my luck. It was now or never. I must face it now, or pack up and go back home.
         I wandered about for an hour looking for a likely spot, feeling as though I were about to
         commit a crime. Then I stopped at last under a bridge near the station and decided to
    5    have a go.

         I felt tense and shaky. It was the first time, after all. I drew the violin from my coat like a
         gun. It was here, in Southampton, with trains rattling overhead, that I was about to declare
         myself. One moment I was part of the hurrying crowds, the next I stood nakedly apart, my
         back to the wall, my hat on the pavement before me, the violin under my chin.

   10    The first notes I played were loud and raw, like a hoarse declaration of protest, then they
         settled down and began to run more smoothly and to stay more or less in tune. To my
         surprise, I was neither arrested nor told to shut up. Indeed, nobody took any notice at all.
         Then an old man, without stopping, surreptitiously tossed a penny 1 into my hat as though
         getting rid of some guilty evidence.

   15    Other pennies followed, slowly but steadily, dropped by shadows who appeared not to see
         or hear me. It was as though the note of the fiddle 2 touched some subconscious nerve that
         had to be answered - like a baby's cry. When I'd finished the first tune there was over a
         shilling 3 in my hat: it seemed too easy, like a confidence trick. But I was elated now; I felt that
         wherever I went from here this was a trick I could always live by.
                                                   –9–                N18/2/ABENG/HP1/ENG/TZ0/XX/T



    20     I worked the streets of Southampton for several days, gradually acquiring the truths of the
           trade. Obvious enough to old-timers, and simple, once learnt, I had to get them by trial and
           error. It was not a good thing, for instance, to let the hat fill up with money - the sight could
           discourage the patron; nor was it wise to empty it completely, which could also confuse him,
           giving him no hint as to where to drop his money. Placing a couple of pennies in the hat to
    25     start the thing going soon became an unvarying ritual; making sure, between tunes, to take
           off the cream, but always leaving two pennies behind.

                                               Give me Wi-Fi!
                        How to get Internet and Wi-Fi when backpacking in New Zealand

         [–X–]
         When you get to New Zealand, it will be so much easier and
         cheaper if you get a New Zealand SIM card. If you are crazy
    5    about social media, get a phone plan which includes a lot
         of network data capacity. This will be your saviour if you are
         staying somewhere with expensive Wi-Fi.

         [ – 47 – ]
         It can be cost-effective to pay for internet for limited
   10    periods of time. One internet service worth having is
         Global Gossip: you either pay NZ$4 for 24 hours or NZ$12
         for 7 days to connect to Wi-Fi at any Global Gossip hotspot.

         [ – 48 – ]
         For those backpacking, one of the selling points for a lot
   15    of New Zealand hostels is that they are not only affordable but also offer free Wi-Fi. However,
         don’t expect a super speedy connection. Nonetheless, if you purchase a Youth Hostel Association
         membership, there’s free Wi-Fi at more than 25 youth hostels around the country.

         [ – 49 – ]
         Customers on a monthly phone plan can use the 1000+ free Wi-Fi zones all over the country.
   20    Internet cafes are another obvious solution, but be prepared to pay.

         If you are on a shoestring, the best way to get Wi-Fi while in a New Zealand town or city is to buy a
         coffee. Many cafes have free Wi-Fi that is ample for uploading photos and videos. Some cafes have
         time or bandwidth limits on Wi-Fi.

         While cruising New Zealand’s major cities, there are also a number of free public Wi-Fi hotspots you
   25    can access. In other towns, is not uncommon to find free Wi-Fi in libraries. Some have functioning
         connections, others don’t.

         [ – 50 – ]
         If you are on a working holiday in New Zealand, you will probably rent somewhere. Most rented
         accommodation will include a monthly charge for Wi-Fi. Otherwise, you may have to pay
   30    separately for broadband services. In such cases, you can subscribe to a budget option, as long as
         you are willing to sacrifice faster download and upload speeds.

         So, while in New Zealand, look out for the best internet connections and be prepared to pay a little
         for them. Happy travels!
