Please start each question on a new page. Full marks are not necessarily awarded for a correct answer
with no working. Answers must be supported by working and/or explanations. In particular, solutions
found from a graphic display calculator should be supported by suitable working. For example, if
graphs are used to find a solution, you should sketch these as part of your answer. Where an answer
is incorrect, some marks may be given for a correct method, provided this is shown by written working.
You are therefore advised to show all working.

     Two independent random variables X and Y follow Poisson distributions.
     Given that E(X ) = 3 and E(Y ) = 4 , calculate

     (a)   E(2X + 7Y ) ;[2]

     (b)   Var(4X - 3Y ) ;[3]

     (c)   E(X 2 - Y 2) .[4]

     The times t , in minutes, taken by a random sample of 75 workers of a company to travel to
     work can be summarized as follows


                                          ∑ t = 2165 , ∑ t = 76475 .
                                                           2




     Let T be the random variable that represents the time taken to travel to work by a worker of
     this company.

     (a)   Find unbiased estimates of

           (i)    the mean of T ;

           (ii)   the variance of T .                                                               [3]

     (b)   Assuming that T is normally distributed, find

           (i)    the 90% confidence interval for the mean time taken to travel to work by the
                  workers of this company;

           (ii)   the 95% confidence interval for the mean time taken to travel to work by the
                  workers of this company.                                                          [3]

     Before seeing these results the managing director believed that the mean time was 26 minutes.

     (c)   Explain whether your answers to part (b) support her belief.                             [3]

     (a)   Mr Sailor owns a fish farm and he claims that the weights of the fish in one of his lakes
           have a mean of 550 grams and standard deviation of 8 grams.

           Assume that the weights of the fish are normally distributed and that Mr Sailor’s claim
           is true.

           (i)      Find the probability that a fish from this lake will have a weight of more than
                    560 grams.

           (ii)     The maximum weight a hand net can hold is 6 kg. Find the probability that a
                    catch of 11 fish can be carried in the hand net.                                         [6]

     (b)   Kathy is suspicious of Mr Sailor’s claim about the mean and standard deviation of the
           weights of the fish. She collects a random sample of fish from this lake whose weights
           are shown in the following table.

                   Fish           A         B          C         D          E         F        G         H

           Using these data, test at the 5% significance level the null hypothesis H0 : µ = 550
           against the alternative hypothesis H1 : µ < 550 , where µ grams is the population mean
           weight.

           (i)      State the distribution of your test statistic, including the parameter.

           (ii)     Find the p-value for the test.

           (iii)    State the conclusion of the test, justifying your answer.                                [6]

     (c)   Kathy decides to use the same fish sample to test at the 5% significance level whether
           or not there is a positive association between the weights and the lengths of the fish in
           the lake. The following table shows the lengths of the fish in the sample. The lengths
           of the fish can be assumed to be normally distributed.

               Fish               A         B          C         D          E         F        G         H

           (i)      State suitable hypotheses for the test.

           (ii)     Find the product-moment correlation coefficient r .

           (iii)    State the p-value and interpret it in this context.                                      [6]

     (d)   Use an appropriate regression line to estimate the weight of a fish with
           length 360 mm.                                                                                    [3]
