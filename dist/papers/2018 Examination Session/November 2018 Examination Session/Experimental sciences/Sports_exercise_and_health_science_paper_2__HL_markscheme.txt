         OR
         it is the time delay in reaction time caused by the arrival of a second stimulus
         before the first is processed ✔                                                      Award 4 [max] if only strengths or

                                                                                              Award [4 max] if no example given
         in sports you can use PRP as an advantage by introducing a dummy stimulus
         before the real movement ✔

         strengths:
         can be used to help a performer have greater chances of success eg pretending
         to pass / run one direction then quickly changing to pass / run the other way ✔                                            6 max
         provides a performer with a greater range of options in their play ✔
         external noise eg: other players calling, or crowd noise can enhance the
         effectiveness of the PRP ✔
         the more options that a player has will increase the reaction time to the stimulus
         <Hick’s law> ✔

         limitations:
         if a performer uses it too often, they will become predictable and this limits
         success✔
         PRP may be reduced by anticipation/early cue detection / effective coach analysis
         / practicing «open» skills ✔
         anxiety might make the performer get the timing wrong and thus the PRP is not
         effective ✔
