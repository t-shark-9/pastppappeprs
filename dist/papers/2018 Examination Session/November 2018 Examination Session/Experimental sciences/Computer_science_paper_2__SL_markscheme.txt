Option A — Databases

1.   (a)   Award up to [3 max].
           Award [1] for a definition of an information system, [1] for a definition of a
           database and [1] for the relationship between the two.
           An information system is the collection of software, hardware, networking
           infrastructure, human resources and databases that provide the storage,
           processing and communication/distribution of information;
           A database is an organized collection of data (organized so that its contents can
           easily be accessed, processed, and updated);
           A database is a subset of the information system;                                      [3]

     (b)   Award up to [8 max].
           Award up to [2 max] for each of the four properties,
           Award [1] for an explanation of the property and [1] in relation to the money
           transfer transaction.

           Example answers:

           Atomicity:
           Ensures that either all changes to data are performed as if they are a single
           operation or none of them are performed;
           In moving money from one account to another, it ensures that if a debit is made
           successfully from one account then the corresponding credit is made to the other
           account;

           Consistency:
           Ensures that data is in a consistent state when a transaction begins and when it
           ends / ensures that only valid data is written in the database;
           In transferring money from one account to another, it ensures that the total value
           of money in both the accounts is the same at the beginning and at the end of
           each transaction;

           Isolation:
           Ensures that intermediate state of a transaction is invisible to other transactions;
           In moving money from one account to another the isolation property ensures that
           another transaction might see one account or the other but cannot see both
           accounts;

           Durability:
           Ensures that after a transaction successfully completes, changes to data persist
           and are not undone even in the event of a system failure;
           In moving money from one account to another durability property ensures that the
           changes made to each account are permanent;                                            [8]
                                            –4–                N18/4/COMSC/SP2/ENG/TZ0/XX/M


(c)   Award up to [6 max].
      Award [1] for identifying an advantage of these databases being open to
      interrogation and an additional [1] for each development of that advantage up to
      [3 max].
      Award [1] for identifying a disadvantage of these databases being open to
      interrogation and an additional [1] for each development of that disadvantage up
      to [3 max].
      Award [1] for a valid conclusion.
      If there is no conclusion, award [5 max].

      Advantages:
      Sharing the information may enable it to be made accessible to organizations
      such as the Police or the Government that may not have access to it;
      This means that it could be used to detect fraudulent financial activities;
      Leading to reduced insurance or health insurance premiums as monies are not
      lost from the system that create artificially high premiums;

      Disadvantages:
      Misuse of information / security issues;
      Information from this database may enable the account details of the clients to be
      shared with third parties;
      Who may use this information to take money from their accounts;

      Conclusion:
      Although the information may be shared, the overall benefits from a reduction in
      fraudulent crime or inflated insurance premiums is greater than the potential for
      this information to get into the wrong hands;                                        [6]

2.   (a)   Award up to [1 max].
           A database management system (DBMS) is a set of programs that allows to
           read, store, change /extract data in a database;                                    [1]

     (b)   Award up to [3 max].
           Award [1] for each characteristic of logical schema identified up to [3 max].
           All attributes for each entity in database are specified;
           The primary key for each entity is identified;
           Includes all entities and relationships among them;
           Keys identifying the relationship between different entities (foreign keys) are
           specified;
           Normalization occurs at logical level;                                              [3]

     (c)   Award up to [2 max].
           Award [1] for each identifying the role of Data Definition Language (DDL) and [1]
           for an expansion or explains how it may be used up to [2 max].
           The Data Definition Language (DDL) are commands which define the different
           structures/objects in a database;
           Database administrators use these commands during the setup and/or removal
           of a database and database objects (such as tables, indexes, and users);            [2]

     (d)   Award up to [2 max].
           Award [1] for each task that a database administrator carries out to ensure the
           security of the database up to [2 max].
           DBA sets access levels and passwords;
           DBA manages back-up procedures (allow examples of this);

                   SELECT Prod_Name FROM Greengrocer
                   WHERE Supp_Name == 'Veggy Co.' AND Prod_Price >= 4.00 AND
                   Prod_Price <= 10.00

                   Example answer 2:
                   SELECT Prod_Name FROM Greengrocer
                   WHERE NOT (Prod_Price <4.00 OR Prod_Price >10) AND
                   Supp_Name == 'Veggy Co.'

                   Example answer 3:
                   SELECT Prod_Name FROM Greengrocer
                   WHERE NOT (Prod_Price <4 OR Prod_Price >10 OR Supp_Name !=

     (b)   Award up to [2 max].
           Redundant data unnecessarily repeats in a relation;
           Supplier data (name, phone, contact) are repeated;
           For every item that is supplied by the same supplier;

           For example,
           Items P118, P122 and P220 have the same supplier (Veggy Co)
           Items P219, P111, P121 and P211 have the same supplier (Fruit and Veggie)

           Note: Accept any correct example from the table given, such is the following:

            Prod_ID Prod_Name Prod_Price                 Supp_Name            Supp_Contact Supp_Phone

                 P211      Apples          5.00       Fruit and Veggie         Ines Bond    542 9800

                 P121      Onions          3.00       Fruit and Veggie         Ines Bond    542 9800

                                                                                                       [2]

(c)     (i)     Award up to [2 max].
                Award [1] for explaining a problem that may arise (such as inconsistency,
                inaccuracy / unnecessary additional/repeated work needed when updating).
                Award [1] for including example with reference to the relation given.

                Example answer:
                When inserting a tuple supplied by the existing supplier, for example,
                inserting:

                   P189        Potatoes        9.90      Veggy Co.      234 7654        Mia Abiss

                All data about supplier should be accurately entered;
                And consistent with the data about this supplier in all other tuples;                 [2]

        (ii)    Award up to [2 max].
                Award [1] for explaining a problem that may arise (such as inconsistency,
                inaccuracy).
                Award [1] for including example with reference to the relation given.

                Example answer:
                Deleting a tuple could remove data which is not intended to be lost;
                For example; deleting the following tuple.

                   P265       Tomatoes         7.45      New Fruits     John Smith        677 7895

                Which is the only tuple in the relation which holds data about New Fruits
                suppliers (all data about this supplier will be lost);                                [2]

        (iii)   Award up to [2 max].
                Award [1] for explaining a problem that may arise (such as inconsistency,
                inaccuracy/unnecessary additional/repeated work needed when updating.
                Award [1] for including example with reference to the relation given.

                Example answer:
                Modifying/changing the phone number for Fruit and Veggie. would require
                that each and every tuple containing item supplied by Fruit and Veggie
                should be modified (unnecessary work);

 Prod_ID        Prod_Name        Prod_Price       Supp_Name           Supp_Contact       Supp_Phone

      P211         Apples           5.00        Fruit and Veggie       Ines Bond           542 9800

      P121         Onions           3.00        Fruit and Veggie       Ines Bond           542 9800
                                              –8–                 N18/4/COMSC/SP2/ENG/TZ0/XX/M


             Otherwise the data in the relation would be inaccurate (for example, would
             contain different/incorrect phone numbers for the same supplier);

 Prod_ID       Prod_Name       Prod_Price       Supp_Name         Supp_Contact      Supp_Phone

      P211       Apples              5.00     Fruit and Veggie      Ines Bond        542 9800

      P121       Onions              3.00     Fruit and Veggie      Ines Bond        542 1811
                                                                                                 [2]

(d)    Award up to [8 max].
       Award [1] for explaining/clearly showing each of the steps.
       Award [1] for identifying two entities (Product and Supplier) in Greengrocer.
       Award [1] for choosing/identifying a primary key in relation Supplier.
       Award [1] for clearly showing that the relation must be in 1NF and then could be
       put to 2NF.
       Award [1] for showing that each tuple in 2NF has a primary key.
       Award [1] for showing that in 2NF all attributes are on the whole dependent of the
       primary key.
       Award [1] for introducing new relations or using a foreign key.
       Award [1] for showing that the relation must be in 2NF and then could be put to
       3NF.
       Award [1] stating that there are no transitive dependencies in 3NF.

       Note: Because there is significant inconsistency in textbooks’ accounts of
       precisely what constitutes 1NF and 2NF, award marks depending on the
       explanation. Please see the two different example answers.

       Example answer 1:
       Given relation
       Greengrocer(Prod_ID, Prod_Name, Prod_Price, Supp_Name, Supp_Phone,
       Supp_Contact)

       There are two entities in this relation (Product and Supplier).

       Product(Prod_ID, Prod_Name, Prod_Price)
       Supplier(Supp_ID, Supp_Name, Supp_Phone, Supp_Contact)

       Primary key (Supp_ID) in relation Supplier is added to make sure that it is unique
       because it might be that two suppliers have the same name.

       Product(Prod_ID, Prod_Name, Prod_Price, Supp_ID)
       Supplier(Supp_ID, Supp_Name, Supp_Phone, Supp_Contact)

       To construct to 2NF relation must be in 1NF;
       Each tuple in 2NF must have a primary key;
       And all attributes in the 2NF must be dependent on the whole of the primary key.

       New relation is introduced.

       Product(Prod_ID, Prod_Name, Prod_Price)
       Supplier(Supp_ID,Supp_Name,Supp_Phone,Supp_Contact)
       ProdSupp(Prod_ID, Supp_ID)
                                     –9–                N18/4/COMSC/SP2/ENG/TZ0/XX/M


There are two different contacts with the same name (Mia Abiss) at the two
different companies.
Assuming that each contact has a unique phone number, a new relation could be
introduced in which Supp_Phone is a key.

Supplier(Supp_ID, Supp_Name)
SupplierContact(Supp_Phone, Supp_Contact)
Product(Prod_ID, Prod_Name, Prod_Price)
ProdSupp (Prod_ID, Supp_ID)

The relation is in the 2NF and there are no attributes which are not dependent on
the key.
There are no transitive dependences so it is in the 3NF.

Example answer 2:
The table is already in 1NF because all values are atomic. There are no “fake”
attributes/columns, like Supp_Phone1, Supp_Phone2;
So there are no repeating groups, either obvious or created by repeating columns
for what is really the same attribute;
To be in 2NF, in addition to being in 1NF;
Every non-prime attribute must be dependent on the whole of every key;
To be in 3NF, in addition to being in 2NF;
All the attributes in a relation must be determined only by the key(s);
And there should not be any transitive dependences;

There are two entities (Supplier and Product);
Supp_ID should be introduced;

Supplier(Supp_ID, Supp_Name, Supp_Phone, Supp_Contact)
Product(Prod_ID, Prod_Name, Prod_Price, Supp_ID*)

Where underlining marks primary key(s) and *foreign key(s);

There are two different contacts with the same name(Mia Abiss)at the two
different companies.

A new relation introduced in which Supp_Phone is a key;

SupplierContact(Supp_Phone, Supp_Contact, Supp_ID*)
Supplier(Supp_ID, Supp_Name)
Product(Prod_ID, Prod_Name, Prod_Price, Supp_ID*)                                   [8]

5.   (a)   The model is a static description of some rules;
           In this case a list of appliances and their water consumption (min or max);
           Whereas the simulation is the use of that model;
           With input from real parameters (such as those that families may input);           [4]

     (b)   Award up to [4 max].
           There may be missing data:
           For example, watering plants (allow any suitable example);
           The consequences, eg the totals will be underestimated;
           The data may be inaccurate;
           For example, the shower times may exceed the stated;
           The consequence, eg the results of the simulation may not be valid;                [4]

     (c)   The answer shows the use of columns and rows;
           The data from part (b) is included together with the addition of a TimesPerWeek
           variable;
           Weekly total formula for each variable is included;
           Overall weekly total has correct formula;
           TimesPerWeek is adjusted until target is met;                                      [5]

     (d)   Award up to [2 max].
           Individual and individualistic use:
           They don’t know each other, and they do their laundry separately, not full load;
           They don’t cook together and consume more water consequently;
           Somebody washes the car every week without telling the others;

           Special occasions:
           Some of them may be athletes and need to wash the sport gear separately;
           Somebody invites friends over night/for dinner and the water consumption
           increases;

           Technical reasons:
           There are water leaks in the house and they are not aware about them;
           The counter was manipulated by the landlord years ago;                             [2]

6.   (a)   Award up to [4 max] as follows:
           Award [1 max] for identifying an advantage and [1 max] for an expansion.
           Award [1 max] for identifying a disadvantage and [1 max] for an expansion.

           Advantages (requires an expansion):
           They may see a complex situation numerous times / gain confidence in using the
           surgical tools;
           Without putting patients at risk / or keep practicing until they feel confident that
           they will be able to get it right in reality;

           Disadvantages (requires an expansion):
           They don’t have real-life experience;
           Therefore, we don’t know whether they will faint at the sight of blood;

           They may be trained just on the software (a unique body shape);
           But body shapes are different and students might find themselves at odds;

           They do not get an idea of how hectic the theatre can be/space
           available/interferences among people;
           And this training alone will be useless;                                               [4]

     (b)   Award up to [3 max].
           It needs sensors to assess the pressure of the hand on the instrument;
           Its positioning with respect to the touchscreen needs to be tracked
           (for example by an external camera);
           Its inclination with respect to the touchscreen needs to be tracked;
           The change of tools held should be quickly reflected in the image that is
           displayed (affects communication);
           The specific tool needs to be recognized;                                              [3]

     (c)   The representation of (abstract) data;
           In a way that is understandable by humans;                                             [2]

     (d)   Award up to [6 max].
           Award [1 max] for identifying an advantage of the use of 3D and [1 max] for an
           expansion up to [3 max] for discussing the advantages of the use of 3D;
           Award [1 max] for identifying a disadvantage of the use of 3D and [1 max] for an
           expansion up to [3 max] for discussing the advantages of the use of 3D;
           Award [1 max] for a considered conclusion;

           Note to examiners: To achieve [6] a conclusion must be provided.
           If there is no conclusion the maximum mark is 5.

           A 3D simulation will be more realistic;
           As depth can be shown;
           Patient’s body can be rotated; // allow up to [2] for example;

           But, a 3D simulation takes more time to render / more calculations have to be
           made;
           So, may not be displayed in real time;
           It is more demanding on memory / may exceed available memory;

           For an application, as serious as medical training, adequate hardware and
           software should be made available so that 3D simulations can be carried out;           [6]

Option C — Web science

7.   (a)   Award up to [2 max].
           Provide a reference to the source/provider;
           Obtain permission from the interviewee;                                               [2]

     (b)   Award up to [2 max].
           To better control access to their servers;
           Because it could be cause of bottleneck on the server / to reduce/minimize risks
           of DDoS;

           To better manage the UI;
           So that the offer of podcasts is well visible also from small devices;

           To have a smaller system that is easier to maintain;
           That can be maintained more effectively also remotely by one person;                  [2]

     (c)   Award up to [1 max].
           (accept for general sound format:) MP3, FLAC, WAV, WMA;                               [1]

     (d)   Award up to [5 max]:
           Award up to [4 max] for comparing lossless and lossy.
           Award [1] for a conclusion with reference to the scenario.

           In terms of audio quality for spoken language there is not much difference in
           using lossy or lossless compression/ lossless compression does not really bring
           benefit to the spoken audio;

           A minor benefit could be in using lossy compression in relation to transmission
           while downloading (and also in streaming);

           And it is relevant, in general, in a situation with low bandwidth;

           However, these files are small in size anyway, because their duration is limited to
           10 minutes;

           And this suggests that for the specific nature and size of the files (spoken and 10
           minutes duration) lossy might be slightly preferable for some users for
           downloading without compromising on quality of audio.                                 [5]

(e)   Award up to [2 max].
      Award [1] for identifying a reason why buffering may occur and [1]
      expansion/example up to [2 max].

      Too many people are using their own Internet access point at home
      simultaneously;
      Possibly on different devices, including tablets, smartphones on WiFi;

      There is low bandwidth because it is peak time;
      Possibly too many people are downloading simultaneously;

      Old router/modem/computer / outdated software may slow performance;
      Computer that is not protected by antivirus may have performance affected by
      malware;
      Performance;

      There are too many applications running simultaneously on the computer;
      So, memory is insufficient and one should close some applications;                   [2]

(f)   Award up to [4 max].
      Award up to [2 max] for the use of dynamic scripting.
      Award up to [2 max] for the means of tracking a person’s preferences.

      Dynamic web pages / scripting
      Podcasts are associated to XML objects;
      So, that the list of podcasts can be processed by scripts that can re-arrange the
      order of the XML objects;
      To present them in a way that takes into account the previous uses from the user;
      By monitoring their preferences, over time;

      Tracking a person’s preferences
      For example, counting the clicks and themes to extract regularities / support data
      analytics;
      That can be identified for example by the IP of their device when this is not
      anonymised;
      And also stored in the history of the browser/by use of cookies;                     [4]

8.   (a)   Award up to [2 max].
           HTTPS authenticates the identity of the website;
           And encrypts data that are transmitted between web browser and web
           server/between two parties;                                                              [2]

     (b)   Award up to [4 max].
           Award [1] for step that the Domain Name System (DNS) server will take in order
           to locate the correct IP address for this request from the browser up to [4 max].

           The DNS server configured to the browser’s computer / the ISP (Internet Service
           Provider) checks through its own database to see if the (domain) name is there;
           If it is, it will return the corresponding IP address to the browser;
           If it isn’t the request is passed onto the next DNS server (in the hierarchy);
           This continues until the (domain) name is found;
           Or the top level / authoritative DNS server if reached;
           When IP address is found, it is sent back to the original DNS server;                    [4]

     (c)   Award up to [2 max].
           The required layout style for the footer is saves as a CSS file;
           Each time the footer section/element appears it calls this CCS file;                     [2]

     (d)   Award up to [4 max].
           Award [1] for each comment that indicates the function of the code up to
           [4 max].
           Award [1] realising the modelling centred on a session (intuition of what
           $_SESSION[] is)
           Award [1] realising that session user identifier shall be unique.
           Award [1] realising the existence of users_db.
           Award [1] realising that this database is interrogated with this session identifier to
           retrieve all fields of the record;
           Award [1] to instantiate a variable $userRecord.

           The shopping basket is modelled centred on the “session”;
           A global array $_SESSION exists, holding a session identifier associated with any
           user;
           And a new sessionUserID is added to the array and instantiated by a unique
           value for identifier;
           That is generated by the function new random_number();
           This element of the array $_SESSION[] is used to retrieve in the user db (users
           database) the entire record for the user;
           Relative to the user and specific to that particular session;
           And used to instantiate the variable $userRecord for further processing;
           For example the final billing or confirmation of payment/dispatch.                       [4]

     (e)   Award up to [2 max].
           The identifier “id” that is passed in the variable $_REQUEST['id'];

9.   (a)   Award up to [2 max].
           Award [1] for describing the challenge resulting from some limitation and [1]
           expansion, possibly with example up to [2 max].
           Old computers impose memory and processing constraints;
           It is likely that they cannot make sophisticated web pages;
           For example, they may need to reduce the number of interactions/transmissions;
           By deciding not to have dynamic web pages;
           To the purpose of not generating loss of processing power on their side;

           The software might not be up-to-date/the OS is old;
           This poses a threat for viruses or deliberate attacks (attack the weakest nodes);
           To the point that not even the charities will link to their website, rather just listing
           the name of the association;
           To limit the risk of propagating malware;                                                  [2]

     (b)   Award up to [4 max].
           Award [1] for each reason how the use of cloud-based services may help Harvest
           to overcome the limitations of the available technologies up to
           [4 max].
           They can host the website on the cloud;
           Enabling a sophisticated site to be created / bypassing their own limitations;
           The cloud could store all of their data;
           As they will have limited storage on their own equipment;                                  [4]

     (c)   Award up to [4 max].
           Award [1] for identifying how the use of cloud-based services may cause
           problems and [1] for an expansion / development up to [2 max].
           Mark as [2] and [2].
           The costs are likely to be high;
           And Harvest is clearly a company with limited funds;

           The cloud company will be bound by rules and regulations in the country in which
           it is registered;
           These may cause conflicts with regard to the type of information that Harvest
           deals with;                                                                                [4]

     (d)   Award up to [5 max].
           Award [1] for identifying an advantage of using black hat techniques and an
           additional [1] for each development of that advantage up to [2 max].
           Award [1] for identifying a disadvantage of using black hat techniques and an
           additional [1] for each development of that disadvantage up to [2 max].

           Award [1] for a valid conclusion.

           Advantages:
           The use of black hat techniques + an example (eg hidden links, or reciprocal
           links, keyword stuffing, hidden content, content theft, etc);
           May temporarily improve its ranking;

           Disadvantages:
           However, this is unethical;
           This may not sit well with its image as a charity;

           Conclusion:
           Search engines will eventually discover that these techniques are being used;
           This may lead to the site being banned;                                                    [5]

Option D — Object-oriented programming

10.   (a)   (i)     Award up to [1] for each part of a suitable definition up to [2 max].
                    An object is an abstract entity;
                    and its components are data and/or actions;                                    [2]

            (ii)    Award up to [1] for identifying each disadvantage and [1] for an elaboration
                    of this disadvantage, up to [2 max].
                    Mark as [2] and [2].                                                           [4]
                    Unsuitable for minor projects;
                    since OOP increases complexity for little gain;

                    OOP programs are larger than other programs;
                    and therefore slower;

                    OOP programs take more effort to construct;
                    because of the decomposition needed to achieve abstraction;

            (iii)   Award [1] for identifying an advantage and [1] for an elaboration of this
                    advantage up to [2 max].                                                       [2]

                    Example answers:
                    Faster development;
                    Because different programming teams can work on different modules;

                    Easier to debug;
                    Because the smaller modules will have fewer mistakes than one big
                    program;

                    Easier to update (in the future);
                    Because it is easier to update a module than the full program;

                    Re-usability;
                    Modules can be stored in libraries and reused for different programs;

      (b)   Award up to [1] for any indication of aggregation.

              Binary search is much faster than sequential search;
              Because it halves the search range for every comparison;                        [2]

      (ii)    Award up to [2 max].
              Award [1] for identifying a disadvantage of using a binary search and [1] for
              an elaboration of the disadvantage up to [2 max].

              However, it is not applicable to unsorted data sets;
              Because the data must be sorted first which adds to computational cost;         [2]

            Example answer:
            Encapsulation allows to make instance variables (and methods) of a class private
            to that class;
            So that the main program / other classes can't accidentally access / change the
            data in an object;
