                             Figure 7(a): Fact file on North American beavers

• 1 family per square km of river.
• Live in family groups, with 2 adults and up to 3 young (kits) born each year between April and June.
• Mortality rates are high due to severe weather, lack of suitable habitats and predation.
• North American beaver population:
  ◦◦estimated at 250 million before fur trade hunting
  ◦◦today approximately 9 million.
• Feed off tree bark.
• Construct lodges from wood and mud:
  ◦◦a safe place for eating, sleeping, and raising young
  ◦◦remain in lodges during winter
  ◦◦protect their own lodge from other beavers.
• Beavers are being reintroduced in Europe to help restore wetlands.

                                  Figure 7(b): Fact file on beaver hunting

• By 1900 beavers had been hunted almost to extinction for their pelts (skin and fur).
• The IUCN classify beavers as “least concern” on the Red List.
• There are 19 registered trap lines in Algonquin Provincial Park where beavers may be trapped for
  their pelts by First Nation (indigenous) people.
• All trappers must have a licence, and may only trap during the hunting season using ethical traps.
• 135 000 beavers are still trapped and killed in Canada each year.
• The price for a beaver pelt was US$19 in 2015, compared to US$500 a pelt in 1940.
• Many landowners trap beavers on their property because of the damage they cause. (Beavers cut
  timbers and their dams can create floods causing millions of dollars of economic damage.)

              Figure 9(a): Dossier sobre la función de los castores en el ecosistema

• Los castores construyen represas con palos, creando lagunas y ralentizando el flujo de los ríos.
• Las lagunas de castores:
  ◦◦son menos adecuadas para los peces de ríos, como por ejemplo, la trucha de arroyo
  ◦◦proporcionan nuevos hábitats a las plantas acuáticas como, por ejemplo, los nenúfares amarillos,
     o a las larvas de libélulas, ranas toro u otros peces como, por ejemplo, ciprínidos.
• La represa puede causar inundaciones; si el agua cubre las raíces de los árboles de las riberas, los
  árboles pueden morir y proporcionar más lugares de anidación a las aves.
• En el borde de las lagunas de los castores se pueden formar zonas pantanosas.
• Las gramíneas y ciperáceas colonizan los limos ricos en nutrientes del fondo de la laguna, creando lo
  que se conoce como pradera de castor.
• En las praderas de castor la luz penetra más, la humedad del suelo es mayor, hay más nitrógeno y la
  vegetación es diferente de la del bosque de ribera fluvial adyacente.
• Las represas pueden derrumbarse debido a fuertes lluvias o a deshielos primaverales, o si el castor
  que la mantiene es cazado por un depredador.

                              Figure 10(a): Fact file on Algonquin wolves

• Population of Algonquin wolves is estimated to be between 250 and 1000.
• Status in Canada: threatened.
• Wolves live in packs, are highly territorial and typically have a range of 35 km2.
• Wolf faeces contain 63 % beaver remains in summer and 12 % in winter.
• Since 2004 it has been illegal to hunt or trap wolves and coyotes in Algonquin Provincial Park and in a
  buffer zone around the edge of the park; hunting coyotes outside the park is legal.
• Algonquin wolves look very similar to coyotes.
• It is easy for a hunter or trapper to accidentally kill an Algonquin wolf while intending to kill a coyote.
