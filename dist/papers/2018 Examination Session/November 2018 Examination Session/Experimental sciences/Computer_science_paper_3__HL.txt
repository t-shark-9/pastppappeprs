Answer all questions.

1.   (a)	State the requirements for an autonomous vehicle to be classed at Level 5 on the
           Society of Automotive Engineers’ (SAE) scale for autonomous driving.                         [2]

     (b)   Define max-pooling.[2]


2.   (a)	Outline the reasons for the inclusion of both GPS and high density mapping in
           autonomous car systems.                                                                      [4]

     (b)   In the case study Sven states that “…human error contributes to 90 % of all traffic
           accidents.” He also points out that beta-testing of autonomous car systems are being
           carried out on public roads.

           Evaluate, from an ethical point of view, the decision taken by manufacturers to carry
           out the beta-testing of autonomous vehicles on public roads.                                 [4]


3.   The convolutional layer in convolutional neural networks makes use of filters to produce a
     series of feature maps. Each of these feature maps will identify the presence of a specific
     feature if it appears anywhere in the image.

     Explain the processing that is carried out in the convolutional layer which allows this to happen. [6]


4.   Two initiatives in the Levangerstadt plans are the bus and the taxi projects.

     The diagram below shows a subset of the town’s intersections and the distances between
     them. Taxis will make use Dijkstra’s algorithm to calculate the shortest route between two
     points (intersections) and buses will make use of the nearest-neighbour algorithm to plot a
     route that will link any combination of points.

                                                    B

                                                                        2
                                        5                                             E
                                                            6
                                                                        3
                         A                  6

                                                    D
                                    2                                            3
                                                        1           6


                                                C               7
                                                                            F


     The autonomous vehicles used for these two projects must not only be able to safely
     navigate the chosen routes but also be able to respond to any temporary changes in the
     environment.

     In the case study Sven emphasized that they were creating a completely new environment
     using the latest technology available.

(Question 4 continued)

     By focusing on the relevant technologies, protocols and path-finding algorithms, discuss how
     the unique characteristics of this project will contribute to its chances of success. You should
     make reference to the computer science identified in this case study.

     Note: there is no need to calculate specific routes, but the diagram can be used to illustrate
     any points in your discussion.                                                                    [12]
