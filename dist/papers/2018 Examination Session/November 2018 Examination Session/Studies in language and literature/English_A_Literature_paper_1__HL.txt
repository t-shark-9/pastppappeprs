Write a literary commentary on one of the following:

1.

                   I received one evening a telephone call from my wife saying that she was about to jump
           in the river. In the midst of a despair which had become so tremendous as to freeze all emotion
           I suddenly heard her tearful voice announcing that she could stand it no longer. She was calling
           to say good-bye—a brief, hysterical speech and then click! and she had vanished and her
      5    address was the river. Terrible as I felt I nevertheless had to conceal my feelings. To their query
           as to who had called I replied—‘Oh, just a friend!’ and I sat there for a moment or two gazing at
           the minute spot which had become the infinitesimal speck in the river where the body of my wife
           was slowly disappearing. Finally I roused myself, put on my hat and coat, and announced that I
           was going out for a walk.
     10            When I got outdoors I could scarcely drag my feet along. I thought my heart had stopped
           beating. The emotion I had experienced on hearing her voice had disappeared; I had become a
           piece of slag1, a tiny hunk of cosmic debris void of hope, desire, or even fear. Knowing not what
           to do or where to turn I walked about aimlessly in that frozen blight which has made Brooklyn
           the place of horror which it is. The houses were still, motionless, breathing gently as people
     15    breathe when they sleep the sleep of the just. I walked blindly onward until I found myself on
           the border of the old neighbourhood which I love so well. Here suddenly the significance of
           the message which my wife had transmitted over the telephone struck me with a new impact.
           Suddenly I grew quite frantic and, as if that would help matters, I instinctively quickened my
           pace. As I did so the whole of my life, from earliest boyhood on, began to unroll itself in swift
     20    and kaleidoscopic fashion. The myriad events which had combined to shape my life became
           so fascinating to me that, without realizing why or what, I found myself growing enthusiastic.
           To my astonishment I caught myself laughing and weeping, shaking my head from side to side,
           gesticulating, mumbling, lurching like a drunkard. I was alive again, that’s what it was. I was
           a living entity, a human being capable of registering joy and sorrow, hope and despair. It was
     25    marvellous to be alive—just that and nothing more. Marvellous to have lived, to remember so
           much. If she had really jumped in the river then there was nothing to be done about it. Just the
           same I began to wonder if I oughtn’t to go to the police and inform them about it. Even as the
           thought came to mind I espied a cop standing on the corner, and impulsively I started towards
           him. But when I came close and saw the expression on his face the impulse died as quickly
     30    as it had come. I went up to him nevertheless and in a calm, matter-of-fact tone I asked him
           if he could direct me to a certain street, a street I knew well since it was the one I was living
           on. I listened to his directions as would a penitent prisoner were he to ask the way back to the
           penitentiary2 from which he had escaped.
                   When I got back to the house I was informed that my wife had just telephoned. ‘What did
     35    she say?’ I exclaimed, almost beside myself with joy.
                   ‘She said she would call you again in the morning,’ said my mother, surprised that I should
           seem so agitated.
                   When I got to bed I began to laugh; I laughed so hard the bed shook. I heard my father
           coming upstairs. I tried to suppress my laughter but couldn’t.
     40            ‘What’s the matter with you?’ he asked, standing beside the bedroom door.
                   ‘I’m laughing,’ I said. ‘I just thought of something funny.’
                   ‘Are you sure you’re all right?’ he said, his voice betraying his perplexity. ‘We thought you
           were crying. ...’

                                                 Call
                               So many voices, throwing floodlights
                               on our lives.
                               My hand shields the phone.
                               After all the clatter and the shouting
                          5    I stand alone, in the small space
                               made by the candle that is your voice,
                               trying to open a window back to home.

                               Everywhere, the noise,
                               the sound of tills*, traffic,
                          10   sirens, electric drills.
                               Even the birdsong
                               has a different accent,
                               hustling the day along.
                               I came here to stand still,
                          15   after weeks of hesitating
                               at other people’s doors,
                               seeing their lives in lighted windows,
                               looking in at basements, at dinner
                               being made, smelling the food,
                          20   all the tables laid.

                               I measure out your voice in seconds.

                               I have rung to see
                               if our tamarind tree is still there,
                               where my brothers are,
                          25   because home moved house
                               to bring me here,
                               and faces crumpled with the years.
                               Fields shifted
                               further and closer with the drift
                          30   of light and shade, and the seasons
                               made different clothes for me,

                               heavy, weighed down by wool.
                               And you are sitting alone
                               in a room in a house in another country.
