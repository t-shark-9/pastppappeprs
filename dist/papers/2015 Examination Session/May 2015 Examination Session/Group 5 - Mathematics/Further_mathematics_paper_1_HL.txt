Full marks are not necessarily awarded for a correct answer with no working. Answers must be
supported by working and/or explanations. In particular, solutions found from a graphic display
calculator should be supported by suitable working. For example, if graphs are used to find a solution,
you should sketch these as part of your answer. Where an answer is incorrect, some marks may be
given for a correct method, provided this is shown by written working. You are therefore advised to
show all working.

     (a)   Sami is undertaking market research on packets of soap powder. He considers the
           brand “Gleam”. The weight of the contents of a randomly chosen packet of “Gleam”
           follows a normal distribution with mean 750 grams and standard deviation 20 grams.

           (i)    the probability that a randomly chosen packet of “Gleam” has a total weight
                  exceeding 780 grams.

                  packets of “Gleam” exceeds 3800 grams.                                                  [8]

           chosen packets of “Bright” weigh more than the contents of five randomly chosen
           packets of “Gleam”.                                                                            [4]

      A wheel of radius r rolls, without slipping, along a straight path with the plane of the wheel
      remaining vertical. A point A on the circumference of the wheel is initially at O . When the
      wheel is rolled, the radius rotates through an angle of θ and the point of contact is now at B ,
      where the length of the arc AB is equal to the distance OB . This is shown in the following

      Sarah is the quality control manager for the Stronger Steel Corporation which makes steel
      sheets. The steel sheets should have a mean tensile strength of 430 MegaPascals (MPa) .
      If the mean tensile strength drops to 400 MPa, then Sarah must recommend a change in
      composition. The tensile strength of these steel sheets follows a normal distribution with a
      standard deviation of 35 MPa. Sarah defines the following hypotheses

                                              H0 : μ = 430
                                              H1 : μ = 400

      where μ denotes the mean tensile strength in MPa. She takes a random sample of n steel
      sheets and defines the critical region as x ≤ k , where x ≤denotes

      of the sample in MPa and k is a constant.
