Maximum marks will be given for correct answers. Where an answer is incorrect, some marks may
be given for a correct method, provided this is shown by written working. Write your answers in the
answer boxes provided. Solutions found from a graphic display calculator should be supported by
suitable working, for example, if graphs are used to find a solution, you should sketch these as part of
your answer.

      The volume, V , of the cuboid can be expressed as V = ax2 − 6x3 .

      (a)   Find the value of a .                                                                                         [3]

      (b)   Find the value of x that makes the volume a maximum.                                                          [3]
