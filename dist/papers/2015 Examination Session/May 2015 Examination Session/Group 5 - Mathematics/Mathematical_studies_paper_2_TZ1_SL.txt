Answer all questions in the answer booklet provided. Please start each question on a new page.
You are advised to show all working, where possible. Where an answer is incorrect, some marks may
be given for a correct method, provided this is shown by written working. Solutions found from a graphic
display calculator should be supported by suitable working, for example, if graphs are used to find a
solution, you should sketch these as part of your answer.

     In a debate on voting, a survey was conducted. The survey asked people’s opinion on
     whether or not the minimum voting age should be reduced to 16 years of age. The results
     are shown as follows.


                                          Age 18–25         Age 26–40   Age 41+         Total
