This markscheme is confidential and for the exclusive use
of examiners in this examination session.

It is the property of the International Baccalaureate and
must not be reproduced or distributed to any other person
without the authorization of the IB Assessment Centre.

                                       Instructions to Examiners

Abbreviations

M     Marks awarded for attempting to use a valid Method; working must be seen.

(M)   Marks awarded for Method; may be implied by correct subsequent working.

A     Marks awarded for an Answer or for Accuracy; often dependent on preceding M marks.

(A)   Marks awarded for an Answer or for Accuracy; may be implied by correct subsequent working.

R     Marks awarded for clear Reasoning.

N     Marks awarded for correct answers if no working shown.

AG    Answer given in the question and so no marks are awarded.


Using the markscheme

1     General

      Mark according to RM™ Assessor instructions and the document “Mathematics HL: Guidance
      for e-marking May 2015”. It is essential that you read this document before you start marking. In
      particular, please note the following:

       Marks must be recorded using the annotation stamps. Please check that you are entering
        marks for the right question.
       If a part is completely correct, (and gains all the “must be seen” marks), use the ticks with
        numbers to stamp full marks.
       If a part is completely wrong, stamp A0 by the final answer.
       If a part gains anything else, it must be recorded using all the annotations.
       All the marks will be added and recorded by RM™ Assessor.

2     Method and Answer/Accuracy marks

       Do not automatically award full marks for a correct answer; all working must be checked,
        and marks awarded according to the markscheme.
       It is not possible to award M0 followed by A1, as A mark(s) depend on the preceding M mark(s),
        if any.
       Where M and A marks are noted on the same line, eg M1A1, this usually means M1 for an
        attempt to use an appropriate method (eg substitution into a formula) and A1 for using the
        correct values.
       Where the markscheme specifies (M2), N3, etc., do not split the marks.
                                                    –4–                 M15/5/MATHL/HP1/ENG/TZ1/XX/M


     Once a correct answer to a question or part-question is seen, ignore further correct working.
      However, if further working indicates a lack of mathematical understanding do not award the final
      A1. An exception to this may be in numerical answers, where a correct exact value is followed by
      an incorrect decimal. However, if the incorrect decimal is carried through to a subsequent part,
      and correct FT working shown, award FT marks as appropriate but do not award the final A1 in
      that part.


       Examples

              Correct answer seen         Further working seen            Action
        1.                                  5.65685...                     Award the final A1
                  8 2                       (incorrect decimal value)      (ignore the further working)
        2.        1
                    sin 4 x                 sin x                           Do not award the final A1
                  4
        3.        log a  log b             log (a  b)                     Do not award the final A1



3   N marks

    Award N marks for correct answers where there is no working.

     Do not award a mixture of N and other marks.
     There may be fewer N marks available than the total of M, A and R marks; this is deliberate as it
      penalizes candidates for not following the instruction to show their working.

4   Implied marks

    Implied marks appear in brackets eg (M1), and can only be awarded if correct work is seen or if
    implied in subsequent working.

     Normally the correct work is seen or implied in the next line.
     Marks without brackets can only be awarded for work that is seen.

5   Follow through marks

    Follow through (FT) marks are awarded where an incorrect answer from one part of a question is
    used correctly in subsequent part(s). To award FT marks, there must be working present and
    not just a final answer based on an incorrect answer to a previous part.

     If the question becomes much simpler because of an error then use discretion to award fewer
      FT marks.
     If the error leads to an inappropriate value (eg sin   1.5 ), do not award the mark(s) for the final
      answer(s).
     Within a question part, once an error is made, no further dependent A marks can be awarded,
      but M marks may be awarded if appropriate.
     Exceptions to this rule will be explicitly noted on the markscheme.

6     Mis-read

     If a candidate incorrectly copies information from the question, this is a mis-read (MR).
     A candidate should be penalized only once for a particular mis-read. Use the MR stamp to indicate
     that this has been a misread. Then deduct the first of the marks to be awarded, even if this is an
     M mark, but award all others so that the candidate only loses one mark.

      If the question becomes much simpler because of the MR, then use discretion to award
       fewer marks.
      If the MR leads to an inappropriate value (eg sin   1.5 ), do not award the mark(s) for the
       final answer(s).

7    Discretionary marks (d)

     An examiner uses discretion to award a mark on the rare occasions when the markscheme does
     not cover the work seen. In such cases the annotation DM should be used and a brief note written
     next to the mark explaining this decision.

8    Alternative methods

     Candidates will sometimes use methods other than those in the markscheme. Unless the
     question specifies a method, other correct methods should be marked in line with the markscheme.
     If in doubt, contact your team leader for advice.

      Alternative methods for complete questions are indicated by METHOD 1, METHOD 2, etc.
      Alternative solutions for part-questions are indicated by EITHER . . . OR.
      Where possible, alignment will also be used to assist examiners in identifying where these
       alternatives start and finish.

9    Alternative forms

     Unless the question specifies otherwise, accept equivalent forms.

      As this is an international examination, accept all alternative forms of notation.
      In the markscheme, equivalent numerical and algebraic forms will generally be written in
       brackets immediately following the answer.
      In the markscheme, simplified answers, (which candidates often do not write in examinations),
       will generally appear in brackets. Marks should be awarded for either the form preceding the
       bracket or the form in brackets (if it is seen).

        Example: for differentiating f ( x)  2sin (5 x  3) , the markscheme gives:

                        f  ( x)   2cos (5 x  3)  5     10cos (5 x  3)                A1

              Award A1 for  2cos (5 x  3)  5 , even if 10cos (5 x  3) is not seen.

10   Accuracy of Answers

     Candidates should NO LONGER be penalized for an accuracy error (AP).

     If the level of accuracy is specified in the question, a mark will be allocated for giving the answer to
     the required accuracy. When this is not specified in the question, all numerical answers should be
     given exactly or correct to three significant figures. Please check work carefully for FT.

11    Crossed out work

      If a candidate has drawn a line through work on their examination script, or in some other way
      crossed out their work, do not award any marks for that work.

12    Calculators

      No calculator is allowed. The use of any calculator on paper 1 is malpractice, and will result in no
      grade awarded. If you see work that suggests a candidate has used any calculator, please follow
      the procedures for malpractice. Examples: finding an angle, given a trig ratio of 0.4235.

13    More than one solution

      Where a candidate offers two or more different answers to the same question, an examiner
      should only mark the first response unless the candidate indicates otherwise.

14.   Candidate work

      Candidates are meant to write their answers to Section A on the question paper (QP), and
      Section B on answer booklets. Sometimes, they need more room for Section A, and use the
      booklet (and often comment to this effect on the QP), or write outside the box. This work should
      be marked.

      The instructions tell candidates not to write on Section B of the QP. Thus they may well have done
      some rough work here which they assume will be ignored. If they have solutions on the answer
      booklets, there is no need to look at the QP. However, if there are whole questions or whole part
      solutions missing on answer booklets, please check to make sure that they are not on the QP,
      and if they are, mark those whole questions or whole part solutions that have not been written on
      answer booklets.
