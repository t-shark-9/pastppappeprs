Please start each question on a new page. Full marks are not necessarily awarded for a correct answer
with no working. Answers must be supported by working and/or explanations. In particular,
solutions found from a graphic display calculator should be supported by suitable working. For example,
if graphs are used to find a solution, you should sketch these as part of your answer. Where an answer
is incorrect, some marks may be given for a correct method, provided this is shown by written working.
You are therefore advised to show all working.

     to 420 . To model these data the year 1985 was designated as year zero. The increase in
