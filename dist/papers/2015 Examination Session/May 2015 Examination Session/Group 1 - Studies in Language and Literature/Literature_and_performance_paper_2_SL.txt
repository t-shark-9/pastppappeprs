Answer one question. Refer closely to the works of at least two poets you have studied.

1.   Hope and/or pessimism are sometimes reflected in poetry.  In the work of at least two poets
     you have studied, examine either or both of these attitudes and the way in which the poets have
     chosen to convey them.


2.   “The language of a poem is often that of one thing compared to another.”  In the work of at least
     two poets you have studied, explore how poets have made their subjects come alive through
     different means of comparing them.


3.   “Poets often withhold certitude, which can at the same time empower readers to think creatively.”
     Consider the works of at least two poets you have studied in which ambiguity has enabled readers
     to reach their own conclusions about meaning and implications.


4.   What poets do with historical materials can be delivered with very different intents and effects.
     Choosing at least two poets you have studied, compare two approaches found in their work and
     discuss in what ways these contribute to the overall effect of the poems.


5.   Poets may arrange their material to encourage the reader to move rapidly through the lines or in a
     way that encourages reflection.  In the work of at least two poets you have studied, consider how
     the pace of poems is created and its relation to the way meaning is delivered.


6.   Choose a similar subject that is covered by at least two poets you have studied and compare both
     the content and the style, offering a personal evaluation of their relative success with both aspects.
