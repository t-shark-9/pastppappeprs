                                           Assessment criteria

These notes to examiners are intended only as guidelines to assist marking and as a supplement to the
published external assessment criteria for written paper 1. They are not offered as an exhaustive and
fixed set of responses or approaches to which all answers must rigidly adhere. Good ideas or angles not
offered here should be acknowledged and rewarded as appropriate. Similarly, answers which do not
include all the ideas or approaches suggested here may still be very good answers.

Of course, some of the points listed below will appear in weaker papers, but are unlikely to be
developed.

Criterion A                                                                                          [5 max]

The task is essentially focused on an analysis of a chosen passage from a prose text. Through this
analysis the level of understanding will be evaluated by the examiner. This “understanding” of the text
should include the relevance of the passage and its place in the context of the novel as a whole.
A synopsis of the plot of the text may be a first step towards demonstrating understanding but “good”
and “perceptive” understanding will evaluate style and theme as well as plot detail. The analysis and
understanding of these elements of the text will always be conducted with a view to the performance of
the chosen passage. The importance of support and validation of all ideas through reference to the text
is crucial. The text is fundamental and reference to it mandatory.


Criterion B                                                                                        [10 max]

The “ideas” for performance are generated from the text and should not be independent of it.
The textual “justification” required to support the “ideas for performance” in Criterion B will be drawn from
a thorough contextualization of the passage and a secure understanding of its relevance to whatever
issues the questions raise.

The association of “good” and “excellent” with the word “practical” attests to the value of ideas that can
be realized in a practical staging context. These are ideas for the stage or a staging area and
temptations to propose grandiose scenarios more applicable to “blockbuster” cinema than theatre should
be resisted.

The candidate may draw diagrams or make sketches if it is thought that these are necessary to
communicate the “ideas for performance” but such visual additions are not mandatory.


Criterion C                                                                                          [5 max]

This criterion evaluates the clarity and coherence of the language used in the essay and looks at the
appropriateness of the register, style and terminology which the candidate employs.

Clearly in an exercise which demands a facility in two disciplines, namely literature and performance, the
candidate will be expected to demonstrate a facility in the use of the terminology specific to each
discipline. As a writer of prose the candidate will be assessed on clarity, variety, precision and
concision. The clarity of a written communication depends on accuracy in grammar, spelling and
sentence construction. The effectiveness of a written communication will depend on the use of
vocabulary, a sense for precision or accuracy of expression and concision which argues for an economy
of expression. The persuasiveness of a piece of writing will depend on choice of idiom and style.
                                                   –4–                  M15/1/TEXTP/SP1/ENG/TZ0/XX/M



The following elements are particularly relevant to Criteria A, B and C:

1.    Credible to good candidates will identify a passage from the text that is appropriate to the question.
      They will indicate its relevance to the question by placing it into the context of the novel; this may
      involve a summary of the content of the passage and why the appearance of the character in the
      specific setting is a pivotal event in the novel. Attention will be paid to the staging choices the
      question asks the candidate to make. The area of focus is character and setting with attention paid
      to elements which may lend themselves to intrigue or surprise. The credible candidate may
      respond to this in quite general terms but the good candidate will already be narrowing his
      perspective around the consequences of the appearance and the significance of the setting.

      Credible to good responses will attempt to focus on the question but may not always succeed in
      doing so. They are likely to introduce references from the novel and be largely descriptive in their
      account, tending towards a narrative register. The candidates who achieve good responses will be
      establishing some analytical points. Specificity will distinguish the good from the credible
      candidate. Since the question specifies character and setting as focal points, the chosen
      performance space should be stated by the candidate as part of the introduction of the essay. The
      appearance of the character in the specific setting should be carefully considered and varying
      levels of relevance and focus will distinguish the credible from the good candidate as will their
      capacity to stage the passage in a way that communicates surprise and/or intrigue to the audience.

      Credible to good approaches to the movement from page to stage will vary from the candidate who
      may effect a literal translation from one genre to the other, to the candidate who will be more liable
      to explore both text and stage for how the style of the prose description might be transformed into
      a dramatic space for a dramatic appearance, and a series of intriguing actions that might engender
      surprise, even shock in the audience. The presentation of character will be set up against a
      backdrop that is designed to project this to an audience in particular ways. The examiner might
      reasonably expect to see lighting and staging used in conjunction to enhance these
      representations for an audience. Staging effects like design, lighting and sound are likely to be
      broadly drawn with more detail again registering a difference in the quality of the response.
      The good candidates will be able to see how use of the stage setting, either spatially or through
      design (or both), can be manipulated to shape communication for an audience and will not
      perceive representation in an exclusively literal manner. Attention to the role of sound, lighting and
      costume will contribute to staging and this attention will vary depending on choices the candidates
      make on where they choose to place their emphasis and on the quality of the work.

      Credible to good ideas for performance will be plausible and have a justification from the text.
      The overall concept for staging may rely on a generalized grasp of the production elements, as this
      grasp becomes steadier, more assured and more nuanced the work begins to characterize that
      expected in a good candidate. The understanding of stage craft may well be a defining factor in
      responses to this question especially if candidates decide to engage in special effects. If they do,
      these should be practical and feasible, not outlandish or cinematic. Particular design gambits and
      specific uses for production and design elements serving as dramatically articulate support for the
      designated character, are all important to the discussion the candidates will engage in as they
      describe their staging concept and how they intend to move the audience.

      Credible to good writing will be legible and clear. The credible candidate will express ideas
      reasonably well, there may be redundancy, and a lack of precision, technical vocabulary will be
      subject to error as will the terminology particular to each genre. The register will be appropriate but
      a greater “care” and a subsequent enhancement of accuracy will be noted in the written work of the
      good candidate. Concept and execution will be clearly evident in the structure of the response.
                                             –5–                 M15/1/TEXTP/SP1/ENG/TZ0/XX/M



The excellent candidate will choose a passage that is immediately apposite. There will be a
powerful understanding of why the appearance of the character in a specific setting is crucial to the
novel and this will have more than one application both within the passage and to the work as a
whole. The candidate will immediately focus on key detail and show an ability to be selective in the
analysis of the literature, focusing only on the material that is responsive to the question.
Embedded quotation will be used and this will allow both for a more concise writing style and for
illuminating reference. The tone, mood and indeed the vitality of the text will be captured by the
way the candidate addresses the task of analyzing the passage in relation to the foci of the
question. The essence of the work will be captured in the quality of the writing as the challenge of
staging it is taken up. Quotation may also be used structurally in the response as a device which
achieves transition between one idea and another; it will be continually relevant to the question.

Excellent ideas for performance will be conveyed in precise terminology, the candidate will make
staging and acting/action choices on the basis of conveying the range of meanings both explicit
and implicit to the passage in the chosen performance space for an audience. Communication for
an audience will be the agent of staging ideas and these will reflect a sophisticated understanding
of the genre and the possibilities inherent in the application of the production and design elements
to the staging concept. The candidate will be aware of the dramatic context as fluent and
malleable. The chosen performance space will be a location where action and movement will
combine with carefully directed presentational strategies to register meaning and significance to an
audience in an intriguing or surprising way. The aesthetics of performance will be keenly felt and
the encouragement this question gives to the creation of character and setting will not be
neglected. The use of lighting and sound may be enhancements to these effects as will an
appreciation of the effect of make-up and costume for the actor.

The excellent candidate will demonstrate an individual “style of writing”, sentences will vary in
length, and the structure of the response will support the argument and ensure that its presentation
is clear and convincing. There will be a precise naming of stylistic elements in the text and staging
elements in the concept for performance. The candidate will present work that, while concise,
nevertheless evokes the quality and dramatic potential of the chosen passage.
                                                   –6–                 M15/1/TEXTP/SP1/ENG/TZ0/XX/M



2.   Credible to good responses to this question will identify a passage from the text that is appropriate
     to the question. They will indicate its relevance to the question by placing it into the context of the
     novel; this may involve a summary of the details of the passage and their further relevance to the
     work as a whole. Attention will be paid to the choices the question asks the candidate to make.
     The candidate will select the area of focus by identifying the intention of the author which may
     condition the dramatic approach to the selected passage. The credible candidate may not
     immediately respond to this but the good candidate will already be narrowing his perspective
     around the consequences of a choice of passage that exemplifies how a dramatic staging of the
     passage and the pivotal speech within it will convey a clear authorial intention for the audience.

     Credible to good responses will attempt to focus on the question but may not always succeed in
     doing so. They are likely to introduce references from the text. These will be general in character
     and may look closely at plot and events from the novel with a tendency to narrate these; the
     candidates who achieve “good” responses will be establishing some staging foci that are explicitly
     linked to dramatic intention. There will be quotations from the passage which will support rather
     than illuminate the argument and are likely to address general rather than specific issues; again
     specificity will distinguish the good from the credible candidate. Since the question specifies
     “staging” as a focal point the chosen performance space should be stated by the candidate as part
     of the introduction of the essay. The speech selected should also be explicitly considered and
     varying levels of relevance and focus will distinguish the credible from the good candidate.

     Credible to good candidates will differ in how they demonstrate the movement between genres;
     the former may effect a literal translation from one genre to the other, while the latter will be more
     liable to explore both text and stage for how the style of the prose description of the speech might
     be transformed into a dramatic space and a series of purposeful actions. The examiner might
     reasonably expect to see lighting and staging used in conjunction to enhance these
     representations for an audience. Staging effects like design, lighting and sound are likely to be
     broadly drawn with more detail again registering a difference in the quality of the response.
     The good candidates will be able to see how use of the stage space can be manipulated to shape
     communication for an audience and will not perceive representation in an exclusively literal
     manner. Attention to the role of sound, lighting, costume and movement to convey dramatic
     intention will vary between the credible and good candidate.

     Credible to good ideas for performance will be plausible and have a justification from the text.
     The overall concept for staging may rely on a generalized grasp of the production elements; as this
     grasp becomes steadier, more assured and more nuanced, the work begins to characterize that
     expected in a good candidate. The ability to distinguish staging effects for their effectiveness in
     directing the attention of the audience to the importance of the speech and its pivotal role in the
     narrative will probably be attainable by a credible candidate who will be able to “identify” a lighting
     or sound effect in a functional manner. The good candidate will be able to fit effects into an
     aesthetic or dramatic purpose and make them work as part of subtle or forceful communication for
     the audience. The exploration of set design or make up or the focus on movement on stage in the
     exploration of character in action may all typify ways “into” the question, so how this might be
     achieved through dramatic means will also distinguish the credible from the good candidate, the
     former recognizing the importance of the production elements as aids to communication, with the
     latter being capable of building these elements as dynamic elements within the staging.

     Credible to good writing will be legible and clear with the credible candidate being able to express
     ideas reasonably well; there may be redundancy, and a lack of precision, also technical vocabulary
     will be subject to error as will the terminology particular to each genre. The register will be
     appropriate but a greater “care” and a subsequent enhancement of accuracy will be noted in the
     written work of the good candidate. Concept and execution will be clearly evident in the structure
     of the response.
                                             –7–                 M15/1/TEXTP/SP1/ENG/TZ0/XX/M



Excellent responses will choose a passage that is immediately apposite. There will be a powerful
understanding of why the selected area is crucial to the text with specific reference to the selected
speech and this will have more than one application both within the passage and to the novel as a
whole. The candidate will immediately focus on key detail and show an ability to be selective in the
analysis of the literature, focusing only on the material that is responsive to the question.
Embedded quotation will be used and this will allow both for a more concise writing style and for
illuminating reference. The tone, mood and indeed the vitality of the text will be captured by the
way the candidate addresses the task of analyzing the speech and how it is staged and
communicated. The essence of the work will capture the quality of the writing as the challenge of
staging it is taken up. Quotation may also be used structurally in the response as a device which
achieves transition between one idea and another; it will be continually relevant to the question.

Excellent ideas for performance will be conveyed in precise terminology, the candidate will make
staging and acting/action choices on the basis of conveying the intention of the author in the
chosen performance space for an audience. Therefore communication for an audience will be the
agent of staging ideas and these will reflect a sophisticated understanding of the genre and the
possibilities inherent in the application of the production and design elements to the staging
concept. The candidate will be aware of the text as a fluid entity and the performance space as a
location where action and movement will combine to register meaning and intention for the
audience. The aesthetics of performance will be keenly felt and the encouragement this question
gives to the creation of staging effects will not be neglected. The use of lighting and sound may be
enhancements to these effects as will an appreciation of the effect of make-up and costume for the
actor who is making the speech and probably the person/people to whom it is communicated.

The excellent candidate will demonstrate an individual “style of writing”, sentences will vary in
length, and the structure of the response will support the argument and ensure that its presentation
is clear and convincing. There will be a precise naming of stylistic elements in the text and staging
elements in the concept for performance. The candidate will present work that, while concise,
nevertheless evokes the quality and dramatic potential of the chosen passage.
                                                   –8–                 M15/1/TEXTP/SP1/ENG/TZ0/XX/M


3.   Credible to good responses to this question will identify a passage from the text that is appropriate
     to the question. They will indicate its relevance to the question by placing it into the context of the
     novel; this may involve a summary of the details of the passage and their further relevance to the
     work as a whole. Attention will be paid to the choice the question asks the candidate to make.
     The candidate will select the areas of focus; despair or euphoria which will condition the dramatic
     approach to the passage. The credible candidate may not immediately respond to this but the
     good candidate will already be narrowing his perspective around the consequences of the choice
     of passage most suitable for the dramatic treatment of one of the two chosen subjects.

     Credible to good responses will vary on what aspects of dramatic performance and production the
     candidate will focus on. This makes for an open-ended approach to performance. The examiner
     may expect the candidate to designate a performance space and explore how production elements
     and acting skills might best convey despair or euphoria, either as moods permeating the world of
     the characters, or as direct experiences dramatized through character for the audience.
     The credible candidate will tend to identify broader effects and possibilities while the good
     candidate will focus on specifics through analysis which explore the nature of one of the two
     conditions or moods. The credible candidate may be detained longer than necessary on
     reflections on plot, whereas the good candidate will be more selective in the approach taken,
     looking to respond more quickly to the question. There will be quotations from the passage which
     will support rather than illuminate the argument and are likely to address general rather than
     specific issues; specificity will distinguish the good from the credible candidate. There are many
     different kinds of euphoria, likewise despair, and it may be necessary to be quite specific in the
     nature of the euphoria or despair. Again accuracy in this matter will be characteristic of the good
     candidate whereas the credible candidate might understand the experience more generically.
     The credible candidate may effect a literal translation from one genre to the other, while the good
     candidate will be more liable to explore both text and stage for how the style of the prose
     description might be transformed into a stage language that reflects not only the subject but will
     also go some way to capturing its essence through the design and performance choices made by
     the candidate in the staging concept. Staging effects like design, lighting and sound and use of
     space and acting are likely to be broadly drawn with more detail again registering a difference in
     the quality of the response from the credible to good candidate. The good candidates will be able
     to see how use of the stage space can be manipulated to shape communication for an audience
     and will not perceive representation in an exclusively literal manner. They will also be able to
     move beyond simple identifications of acting style to how style may function in performance to
     communicate action effectively for an audience.

     Credible to good ideas for performance will be plausible and have a justification from the text.
     The overall concept for staging may rely on a generalized grasp of the production elements; as this
     grasp becomes steadier, more assured and more nuanced, the work begins to characterize that
     expected in a good candidate. The ability to distinguish staging effects for their value in elucidating
     or demonstrating setting or significant action for an audience, will probably be attainable by a
     credible candidate who will be able to “identify” a lighting or sound effect in a functional manner.
     Since the focus is on despair or euphoria, the average candidate will look for how acting and
     design will register either of these. The good candidate will be more incisive and will use staging,
     acting and design to explore one of these states or convey one of these moods. The ability to
     present a plan for the actor’s performance tied to action will be within the range of a credible
     candidate who will identify some of the following: general moods, gestures, movement, blocking
     and voice for the actor, a more critical understanding of how these combine to communicate the
     meaning of action in explicit and perhaps implicit terms will move the candidate into the “good
     category”. The good candidate will be able to fit effects into an aesthetic or dramatic purpose and
     make them work as part of a subtle communication for the audience. The exploration of set design
     or make up or the focus on movement on stage in the exploration of character in action may all
     typify ways “into” the question.
                                              –9–                 M15/1/TEXTP/SP1/ENG/TZ0/XX/M



How this might be achieved through dramatic means will also distinguish the credible from the
good candidate, the former recognizing the importance of the production elements as aids to
communication, with the latter being capable of building these elements as dynamic elements
within the staging.

Credible to good writing will be legible and clear with the credible candidate being able to express
ideas reasonably well. There may be redundancy, and a lack of precision, and technical
vocabulary will be subject to error as will the terminology particular to each genre. The register will
be appropriate but a greater “care” and a subsequent enhancement of accuracy will be noted in the
written work of the good candidate. Concept and execution will be clearly evident in the structure
of the response.

Excellent responses will choose a passage that is immediately apposite. There will be a powerful
understanding of why the selected area is crucial to the text and this will have more than one
application both within the passage and to the novel as a whole. The candidate will immediately
focus on key detail and show an ability to be selective in the analysis of the literature, focusing only
on the material that is responsive to the question. Embedded quotation will be used and this will
allow both for a more concise writing style and for illuminating reference. The tone, mood and
indeed the vitality of the text will be captured by the way the candidate addresses the task of
dealing with euphoria or despair and how it is communicated. The essence of the work will capture
the quality of the writing as the challenge of staging it is taken up. Quotation may also be used
structurally in the response as a device which achieves transition between one idea and another;
it will be continually relevant to the question.

Excellent ideas for performance will be conveyed in precise terminology, to evoke mood and
atmosphere underlying action. The candidate will make staging choices, beginning with the stage
design for which there will be justification. The communication for an audience will be the agent of
staging ideas and these will reflect a sophisticated understanding of the genre and the possibilities
inherent in the application of the performance and design elements to the staging concept chosen
to dramatize the chosen experiences. The candidate will be aware of the text as a fluid entity and
the stage as a location where action and movement in space will combine through the actor to
register meaning for an audience. The aesthetics of performance will be keenly felt and the
encouragement this question gives to the creation of staging effects will not be neglected.
The use of lighting and sound may be enhancements to these effects.

The excellent candidate will convey ideas and proposals in an individual “style of writing”,
sentences will vary in length, and the structure of the response will support the argument and
ensure that its presentation is clear and convincing. There will be a precise naming of stylistic
elements in the text and staging elements in the concept for performance. The candidate will
present work that, while concise, nevertheless evokes the quality and dramatic potential of the
chosen passage.
