Examiners: please note that the term “comparison”, both in the descriptors and in the marking
notes, includes the discussion of relevant “contrasts” as well.

The features of the “very good to excellent” answers assume that those for “adequate to good”
are included.

Drama

1.   An adequate to good answer will identify individuals as representatives of a group(s), identify
     conflicts within or between the groups and show how individuals embody / exemplify / develop
     those conflict(s).

     A very good to excellent answer may also discuss the above in more detail and with greater
     subtlety. The response will evaluate the effectiveness of each playwright’s use of individuals to
     represent groups.


2.   An adequate to good answer will define the nature and identify examples of arrival and/or
     departure, demonstrating how these enrich the works as a whole.

     A very good to excellent answer may also embark upon a more detailed and sophisticated
     examination of arrival/departure. It will evaluate the effectiveness of each playwright’s use of
     arrival and/or departure.


3.   An adequate to good answer will identify dialogue in which there is some form of
     miscommunication between characters, intentional or otherwise, although the audience does
     understand. It will provide some exploration of the reason for the nature of that failure and its
     effects in the plays.

     A very good to excellent answer may also explore in greater depth the communication failures and
     may consider aspects of dramatic irony. It will evaluate the effectiveness of the means by which
     each playwright presents this lack of communication and the possible consequences.

Poetry

4.   An adequate to good answer will show that the candidate has a reasonable understanding of what
     constitutes symbolism. The response will identify one or more uses of symbolism in the poems
     and compare the different approaches. It will discuss the ways in which symbolism can affect the
     meaning of the whole poem.

     A very good to excellent answer may also show a more sophisticated understanding of symbolism
     and how it can affect the meaning of each poem as a whole. It may compare the ways in which
     symbolism is supported by other conventions. It will evaluate the effect of each poet’s use of
     symbolism.


5.   An adequate to good answer will identify and discuss the contributions of techniques other than
     rhyme to meaning in each poem. Rhymed poems are acceptable, providing techniques other than
     rhyme are discussed.

     A very good to excellent answer may also show a greater understanding of how other techniques
     can be used in place of rhyme to contribute to meaning. It will evaluate the success of each poet’s
     use of alternate techniques.


6.   An adequate to good answer will show some understanding of pathetic fallacy. The response will
     give examples and show how phenomena in the external world reflect the attitudes/experience of
     the speaker.

     A very good to excellent answer may also offer a more sophisticated understanding of pathetic
     fallacy and its effects. It may comment on other techniques which may be used to support the
     central convention. It will evaluate the effectiveness of each poet’s use of pathetic fallacy.
                                                 –5–                M15/1/AXENG/HP2/ENG/TZ2/XX/M


Prose: novel and short story

7.   An adequate to good answer will identify instances when the supernatural is made credible.
     The response will identify some conventions used to achieve this effect and comment on the role
     of those instances in each work.

     A very good to excellent answer may also describe in greater detail the occasions when the
     supernatural is made credible, may present a greater variety of conventions used and may explore
     in greater depth the effects on the works as a whole. It will evaluate the effectiveness of each
     author’s treatment of the supernatural in terms of its impact on each work.


8.   An adequate to good answer will identify the nature of the narrative voices used, will posit some
     advantages and disadvantages of each voice (perhaps in conjunction with other conventions) and
     will link those advantages/disadvantages to an understanding of the text.

     A very good to excellent answer may also show more sensitivity to the various
     advantages/disadvantages, go into greater detail with respect to associated conventions and show
     deeper understanding of the voices’ influence on the works as a whole. It will evaluate the
     effectiveness of each author’s use of first or third person narrative voice.


9.   An adequate to good answer will identify some details used in the physical description of at least
     two characters, or other elements, from different works, will identify some means of description
     which is not necessarily describing appearance in terms of literary conventions, and will comment
     on the effects of the physical descriptions.

     A very good to excellent answer may also go into greater detail in terms of the physical
     descriptions and comment on the detail or the lack thereof, may explore a wider range of literary
     conventions and may comment in greater depth on the effects of these physical descriptions on the
     works as a whole. It will evaluate the effectiveness of each author’s approach to the nature and
     use of physical description.

Prose other than fiction

10.   An adequate to good answer will identify and compare challenges faced by characters and discuss
      responses to those challenges, analysing what the responses reveal of character.

      A very good to excellent answer may also be more precise in identifying challenges, discussing
      responses more thoroughly. It will evaluate each author’s effectiveness in discussing the
      challenges and responses and what they reveal of character.


11.   An adequate to good answer will identify examples of action and description and offer a judgment
      as to the balance between the two, expressing an opinion as to the degree of effectiveness of the
      balance achieved.

      A very good to excellent answer may also present in greater depth and detail well chosen
      examples of action and description to support a judgment of their relative importance. It will
      evaluate the effectiveness of the balance employed in each work.


12.   An adequate to good answer will identify the structures chosen by two or more writers, express an
      opinion as to the particular effects achieved, and show how the chosen structures contribute to
      those effects.

      A very good to excellent answer may also discuss in more depth the selected structures, argue
      with more insight an interpretation of the particular effects and the role played by structure in
      achieving them. It will evaluate the appropriateness of the structure to the effects achieved.
