These notes to examiners are intended only as guidelines to assist marking and as a supplement to the
published external assessment criteria for written paper 1. They are not offered as an exhaustive and
fixed set of responses or approaches to which all answers must rigidly adhere. Good ideas or angles not
offered here should be acknowledged and rewarded as appropriate. Similarly, answers which do not
include all the ideas or approaches suggested here may still be very good answers.

Of course, some of the points listed below will appear in weaker papers, but are unlikely to be
developed.

1.

     An adequate to good literary commentary will:

      understand that Granny is ill and thinking about her past and future
      explore the relationship between Granny and her daughter, Cornelia
      comment on the significance of the listing of things and the use of sensory imagery to describe
       Granny’s feelings
      comment on the narrative perspective and presentation of Granny’s thoughts
      consider the use of dialogue and the presence of humour in this passage about dying.

     A very good to excellent literary commentary may also:

      offer a more subtle reading of Granny’s situation and her feelings about living and dying
      comment on what is revealed and by contrast what is kept secret
      explore further the significance of the listing of things and the use of sensory imagery with
       carefully chosen examples
      comment on the possible contradictions and confusions in Granny’s perspective
      give a more subtle interpretation of the passage’s humour.


2.

     An adequate to good literary commentary will:

        discuss the connections between the man’s occupation and his preoccupation
        comment on the way this man functions as a neighbour
        notice that the subject is doing the cutting while the neighbourhood is planting
        consider the effect of the imagery and figures of speech
        comment on the persona’s conversational style / moments of humour / the use of direct speech.

     A very good to excellent literary commentary may also:

        discuss the subtle segue of references from hair cutting to trees and back again
        develop a sense of the man’s obsession and the poetic means used to convey it
        demonstrate a more sophisticated sense of what is “wrong” in the poem
        consider in greater depth the imagery, figures of speech or other formal properties of the poem
        explore the contrast between humour and darker elements of the poem.
