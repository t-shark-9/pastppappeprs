          7:07 a.m. (by my digital bedside clock)

                 I must tell you something. When I woke up just a few moments ago I had the most
          alarming sensation. It was a feeling of instant alertness. Usually my mind lags vaguely behind
          my brain when it wakes, like the cranking up of an old lethargic engine, taking several seconds
      5   to gain full speed. But this morning I know something’s up because when my eyes opened my
          mind opened too, eager as a young person’s, with the immediacy of a lightbulb once you’ve
          flicked the switch. It’s as if my body has sensed something before my brain has had a chance
          to work it out.
                 Then, with a bolt of understanding, it strikes me.
     10          My little sister, Vivien, is dead.
                 Dead right here in this house, fifteen yards away in her room in the east wing, along
          the landing and left through the glass-paned double doors. I feel a sick surge of dread rising
          from the core of my stomach, spreading menace throughout my frail body. Pricking it coldly.
          Smothering all my usual morning aches.
     15          Let me think now. I heard her during the night at five to one, when she got up to make her
          usual cup of tea, but I didn’t hear her again, as I have every other night she’s been here, going
          to the lavatory at five, and I haven’t yet heard her this morning going down to get her tea even
          though it’s now well past seven. Every other morning she’s been like clockwork, straight down
          to the kitchen at seven on the dot*.
     20          I’m still in bed with the blankets pulled up to my chin and my hands locked by my sides.
          I haven’t moved a muscle since I woke. I don’t dare, for fear that somehow it might upset the
          delicate balance of life and death that has threatened the house this morning. If I strain my
          eyes to the right, I can just about see my bedside clock. It makes me feel safer, knowing that
          it’s there, looking after the time for me.
     25          I think I should tell you there’s a much more substantial reason for my knowing that she’s
          dead than not having heard her this morning. Did I tell you last night, when I found the poisons
          upstairs in the laboratory, that I took down a tin of potassium cyanide powder from the very top
          shelf? I secreted it up the left sleeve of my dressing-gown (pinching the cuff round the bottom
          so it wouldn’t fall out) and took it downstairs to the kitchen. I put half a teaspoonful in her milk in
     30   the fridge, then hid the tin behind the bottles in the drinks cabinet in the library. And you know
          how she likes to take her tea milky.
                 But, of course, the problem is I can’t be absolutely one hundred per cent sure she’s dead
          unless I go and check her. What if she’s not dead? What if she’s just half dead? (You can
          never be sure of getting the correct concentration per pound of body mass.) I can’t have her
     35   being found half dead: she’ll be prodded and probed until they find out she’s been poisoned.
          I can’t think why it didn’t occur to me before that I’ll have to actually go and check her.
          I can’t possibly do that. It’s not within my boundary. I’ve not been in that part of the house for
          forty-seven years. I wouldn’t feel safe.

                                       Grandmother and Child

                     The waves that danced about the rock have gone,
                     The tide has stolen the rock as time has stolen
                     The quiet old lady who waited beneath the trees
                     That moved with a sad sea-sound in the summer wind.

                 5   When death was as near as the wind among the leaves,
                     Troubling the waking fear in the heart of the child
                     As the wind was troubling the shadows on the sunlit lawn
                     The grandmother seemed as frail as the frailest leaf.

                     But she sat so still in the shade of the summer trees
                10   With the wind of death on her cheeks and her folded hands,
                     Her strength seemed large and cool, as the rock in the sea
                     Seemed large and cool in the green and restless waves.

                     As the rock remains in the sea, deep down and strong,
                     The rock-like strength of the lady beneath the trees
                15   Remains in the mind of the child, more real than death,
                     To challenge the child’s strength in the hour of fear.
