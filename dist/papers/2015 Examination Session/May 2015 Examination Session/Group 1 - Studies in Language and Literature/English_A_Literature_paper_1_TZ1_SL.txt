          She flicked her wrist neatly out of Doctor Harry’s pudgy careful fingers and pulled the sheet
          up to her chin. The brat ought to be in knee breeches. Doctoring around the country with
          spectacles on his nose! “Get along now, take your schoolbooks and go. There’s nothing wrong
          with me.”
      5           Doctor Harry spread a warm paw like a cushion on her forehead where the forked green
          vein danced and made her eyelids twitch. “Now, now, be a good girl, and we’ll have you up in
          no time.”
                  “That’s no way to speak to a woman nearly eighty years old just because she’s down.
          I’d have you respect your elders, young man.”
     10           “Well, Missy, excuse me.” Doctor Harry patted her cheek. “But I’ve got to warn you,
          haven’t I? You’re a marvel, but you must be careful or you’re going to be good and sorry.”
                  “Don’t tell me what I’m going to be. I’m on my feet now, morally speaking. It’s Cornelia.
          I had to go to bed to get rid of her.”
                  Her bones felt loose, and floated around in her skin, and Doctor Harry floated like a
     15   balloon around the foot of the bed. He floated and pulled down his waistcoat and swung his
          glasses on a cord. “Well, stay where you are, it certainly can’t hurt you.”
                  “Get along and doctor your sick,” said Granny Weatherall. “Leave a well woman alone.
          I’ll call for you when I want you… Where were you forty years ago when I pulled through
          milk-leg and double pneumonia? You weren’t even born. Don’t let Cornelia lead you on,” she
     20   shouted, because Doctor Harry appeared to float up to the ceiling and out. “I pay my own bills,
          and I don’t throw my money away on nonsense!”
                  She meant to wave good-by, but it was too much trouble. Her eyes closed of themselves,
          it was like a dark curtain drawn around the bed. The pillow rose and floated under her, pleasant
          as a hammock in a light wind. She listened to the leaves rustling outside the window. No,
     25   somebody was swishing newspapers: no, Cornelia and Doctor Harry were whispering together.
          She leaped broad awake, thinking they whispered in her ear.
                  “She was never like this, never like this!” “Well, what can we expect?” “Yes, eighty years
          old…”
                  Well, and what if she was? She still had ears. It was like Cornelia to whisper around
     30   doors. She always kept things secret in such a public way. She was always being tactful
          and kind. Cornelia was dutiful; that was the trouble with her. Dutiful and good. “So good and
          dutiful,” said Granny, “that I’d like to spank her.” She saw herself spanking Cornelia and making
          a fine job of it.
                  “What’d you say, Mother?”
     35           Granny felt her face tying up in hard knots.
                  “Can’t a body think, I’d like to know?”
                  “I thought you might want something.”
                  “I do. I want a lot of things. First off, go away and don’t whisper.”
                  She lay and drowsed, hoping in her sleep that the children would keep out and let her rest
     40   a minute. It had been a long day. Not that she was tired. It was always pleasant to snatch a
          minute now and then. There was always so much to be done, let me see: tomorrow.
                                                      –3–                    M15/1/AXENG/SP1/ENG/TZ1/XX

                  Tomorrow was far away and there was nothing to trouble about. Things were finished
           somehow when the time came; thank God there was always a little margin over for peace: then
           a person could spread out the plan of life and tuck in the edges orderly. It was good to have
45         everything clean and folded away, with the hair brushes and tonic bottles sitting straight on the
           white embroidered linen: the day started without fuss and the pantry shelves laid out with rows
           of jelly glasses and brown jugs and white stone-china jars with blue whirligigs and words painted
           on them: coffee, tea, sugar, ginger, cinnamon, allspice: and the bronze clock with the lion on top
           nicely dusted off. The dust that lion could collect in twenty-four hours! The box in the attic with
50         all those letters tied up, well, she’d have to go through that tomorrow. All those
           letters—George’s letters and John’s letters and her letters to them both—lying around for the
           children to find afterwards made her uneasy. Yes, that would be tomorrow’s business. No use
           to let them know how silly she had been once.
                  While she was rummaging around she found death in her mind and it felt clammy and
55         unfamiliar. She had spent so much time preparing for death there was no need for bringing it
           up again. Let it take care of itself now. When she was sixty she had felt very old, finished, and
           went around making farewell trips to see her children and grandchildren, with a secret in her
           mind: This is the very last of your mother, children! Then she made her will and came down with
           a long fever. That was all just a notion like a lot of other things, but it was lucky too, for she had
60         once for all got over the idea of dying for a long time. Now she couldn’t be worried. She hoped
           she had better sense now.

                           The Man Who Hated Trees

            When he started blaming robberies
            on trees, you knew for sure
            something was wrong.

            This man who clipped hair,
      5     who spent years shaving the necks
            of cafeteria managers,
            sweeping lost curls down drains,
            this man who said, “It is always better
            to cut off a little too much …”

     10     You could say he transferred
            one thing to another when he came home,
            hair to leaves, only this time
            he was cutting down whole bodies,
            from the feet up, he wanted
     15     to make those customers stumps.

            “This tree drops purple balls
            on the roof of my car.
            That tree touches the rain gutter.
            I don't like blossoms, too much mess.
     20     Trees take up the sky.
            It’s my light, why share it?”
            He said thieves struck more
            on blocks where there were trees.
            “The shade, you know. They like the dark.”
     25     You lived for days with the buzz of his chain-saw
            searing off the last little branches of neighborly affection.

            It was planting-season in the rest of the town
            but your street received a crew-cut.
            Two pecan trees that had taken half-a-century to rise
     30     now stood like Mohawk Indians, shorn.
            He gloated on his porch surrounded by amputations.
            You caught him staring greedily
            at the loose branches swinging over your roof.

            Tomorrow, when everything was cut, what then?
     35     He joked about running over cats
            as the last chinaberry crashed,
            as the truck came to gather arms and legs,
            fingers waving their last farewell.

            What stories did he tell himself,
     40     this patriot of springtime,
            and how did it feel to down sprouting boulevards
            with his bald bald heart?
