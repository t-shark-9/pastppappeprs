These notes to examiners are intended only as guidelines to assist marking and as a supplement to the
published external assessment criteria for written paper 1. They are not offered as an exhaustive and
fixed set of responses or approaches to which all answers must rigidly adhere. Good ideas or angles not
offered here should be acknowledged and rewarded as appropriate. Similarly, answers which do not
include all the ideas or approaches suggested here may still be very good answers.

Of course, some of the points listed below will appear in weaker papers, but are unlikely to be
developed.

1.

     An adequate to good literary commentary will:

      show an understanding of the apparent relationship between the sisters as initially treated by
        the narrator
      recognize the surprising reality of the relationship as revealed in the final paragraphs
      discuss the significant qualities of the narrator’s language and what they reveal about her
       character
      comment on the narrative style of address to an apparently familiar listener or reader.


     A very good to excellent literary commentary may also:

      point out the ambiguities in the narrator’s character exposed by her observations about herself
        at various points
      consider in more detail the ways in which the rational precision of her language reveals her
       character
      recognize the humour in the passage.


2.

     An adequate to good literary commentary will:

      describe and comment on some of the images of the persona’s memories of her grandmother
      identify and comment on some additional poetic devices involving nature, showing an
       awareness of contrast
      discuss the shift in focus in the poem between stanzas 1–3 and stanza 4.

     A very good to excellent literary commentary may also:

      show a greater awareness of the contrasting patterns in the devices and the effect of these
       patterns on the overall impact of the poem
      address a wider range of poetic devices showing perhaps an awareness of pace, sound,
       movement, stillness and their influence on the experience of the poem
      recognize the ambiguity, especially in the final stanza.
