Write a literary commentary on one of the following:

1.

                  I stood up and began walking back to the house, but the girl grabbed my hand and pulled
           me, trying to drag me to the trees. I resisted, suspecting a CT1 ambush. I shaded my eyes and
           squinted at the slopes, but the tea-pickers had not yet reached this section of the estate and
           there was no sign of any Home Guard2. Crying more loudly, the girl yanked my arm again.
      5    I followed her, but froze when we came to the jungle fringe.
                  For the first time since the war ended, I was about to re-enter the rainforest. I feared that
           if I went in I would never come out again. Before I could turn around, the girl tightened her grip
           on my hand and pulled me into the ferns.
                  Insects ground out metallic, clicking sounds. The cicadas wove a mesh of noise over
     10    everything. Birdcalls hammered sharp, shiny nails into the air. It was like walking into a busy
           ironmonger’s workshop in the back-alleys of Georgetown. Sunlight sifted down through the
           lattices of branches and leaves overhead, unable to sink far enough to dispel the soggy gloom
           at ground level. Vines hung from the branches in broad, sagging nooses. The girl took us along
           a narrow animal track, the stones greased with moss that threatened to send me sprawling at
     15    the slightest lapse in concentration. For fifteen, twenty minutes I followed her beneath tree ferns
           that spread their fronds over us, watering the light into a translucent green.
                  We emerged into a small clearing. The girl stopped and pointed to a bamboo shack
           beneath the trees, the roof covered in a balding thatch of nipah3 fronds. The door was
           half-open, but it was dark inside. We moved closer to the hut, making as little noise as possible.
     20    In the trees behind us, branches cracked and then something heavy dropped to the ground.
           I spun around on my heel and looked back. The trees were still. Perhaps it was only a ripened
           durian4, its armour of thorns shredding the leaves as it fell. I became aware of another sound
           running beneath the noise of the jungle, a vibration pitched so low it was almost soothing.
           It was coming from inside the hut.
     25           The door refused to move when I nudged it with my foot. I tried again, pushing harder this
           time. It swung open all the way. On the beaten-earth floor, three bodies lay in a moat of blood
           so dark and thick they seemed to be glued to it. Hundreds of flies crawled over their faces,
           distended bellies and loincloths. Their throats had been slit. The girl screamed and I clamped
           my palm over her mouth. She struggled, swinging her arms madly, but I held on to her tightly.
     30    The flies rose from the bodies and swarmed to the underside of the thatch roof, blackening it
           like an infestation of mould.

                                             The Pigeon

                       Throb, throb from the mixer
                       Spewing out concrete.
                       And at the heads of the cables
                       Stand the serpent-warders,
                   5   Sweating and straining,
                       Thrusting those cruel mouths to their prey.

                       Hark how the steel tongues hiss
                       As they stab.
                       The men sway under the effort,
                  10   And their eyes are bloodshot with the din,
                       The clatter that shatters the brain.
                       Throb, throb from the mixer
                       Spewing out concrete.

                       The crowd stands by
                  15   Watching the smoothers;
                       Fascinated by the flat, wet levels
                       Of newlaid cement.

                       See how those curdled lakes
                       Glisten under the sky,
                  20   Virginal.

                       Then the dusty air suddenly divides,
                       And a pigeon from a plane-tree
                       Flutters down to bathe its wings in that mirage of water.

                       But deceived, and angry,
                  25   Bewildered by the din,
                       The throb, throb from the mixer
                       Spewing out concrete,
                       It backs upon its wing,
                       Threshes air, and is gone.

                  30   But there, in the deflowered bed,
                       Is the seal of its coral foot,
                       Set till rocks crumble.
