Text A

           30 May 1915

                  After breakfast we sat in the Buttercup1 field – my love and I – and “plucked up kisses by
           the roots that grew upon our lips”2. The sun was streaming down and the field thickly peopled
           with Buttercups. From where we sat we could see the whole of the valley below and Farmer
      5    Whaley – a speck in the distance – working a machine in a field. We watched him idly. It was
           jolly to put our heads together right down deep in the Buttercups and luxuriously follow the
           pelting3 activities of the tiny insects crawling here and there in the forest of grass. A chicken
           came our way and he seemed an enormous bird from the grass-blade’s point of view. How nice
           to be a chicken in a field of Buttercups and see them as big as Sunflowers! or to be a Gulliver4 in
     10    the Beech Woods! to be so small as to be able to climb a Buttercup, tumble into the corolla and
           be dusted yellow or to be so big as to be able to pull up a Beech-tree with finger and thumb!
           If only a man were a magician, could play fast and loose with rigid Nature! what a multitude of
           rich experiences he could discover for himself!
                  I looked long and steadily this morning at the magnificent torso of a high forest Beech
     15    and tried to project myself into its lithe tiger-like form, to feel its electric sap vitalizing all my
           frame out to the tip of every tingling leaf, to possess its splendid erectness in my own bones.
           I could have flung my arms around its fascinating body but the austerity of the great creature
           forbad it. Then a Hawk fired my ambition! – to be a Hawk, or a Falcon, to have a Falcon’s soul,
           a Falcon’s heart – that splendid music in the cage of the thorax – and the Falcon’s pride and
     20    sagacious5 eye!

                  When the sun grew too hot we went into the wood where waves of Bluebells dashed
           up around the foot of the Oak in front of us… I never knew before, the delight of offering
           oneself up; I even longed for some self-sacrifice, to have to give up something for her sake.
           It intoxicated me to think I was making another happy…

     25            After a lunch of scrambled eggs and rhubarb and cream went up into the Beech Wood
           again and sat on a rug at the foot of a tree. The sun filtered in thro’ the greenery.
           “It’s like a cathedral,” I chattered away, “stained glass windows, pillars, aisles – all complete.”
           “It would be nice to be married in a Cathedral like this,” she said.
