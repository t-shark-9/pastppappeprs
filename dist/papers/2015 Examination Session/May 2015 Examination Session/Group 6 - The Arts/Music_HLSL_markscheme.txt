Note: The following indicative content is for guidance only, and by no means meant to suggest that
candidates should be marked according to the extent that their answer resembles these suggestions. It
is quite possible for candidates to come up with good responses other than these, which should be
credited accordingly.

1.   An American in Paris by G Gershwin
     During his lifetime, some music critics opposed categorizing Gershwin as a western art
     music composer. Discuss whether you think this categorization was right or wrong.
     Justify your position with clear reference to at least three different passages in this score.

     The answers should refer to the prescribed work.

     Answers should address the question and be consistent and convincing in their display of musical
     understanding. Evidence should be located by using bar(s)/measure(s), rehearsal number(s),
     and/or instrument(s) in the works/extracts. Musical terminology should be effective in its use.

     Candidates are likely to focus on possible criticisms of Gershwin’s attempts to write “Western art
     music” on the one hand, and defences of it on the other. Some criticisms of Gershwin’s perceived
     shortcomings in An American in Paris have included:
      work is not so much an integrated composition as a “succession of tunes”, each of them
       “separate and self-contained”
      melodies are often constructed like a typical Broadway show number as a closed form based on
       4-bar phrase units
      melodies rely heavily on internal repetition
      Gershwin found it “much easier to invent ideas than develop them”, and the passages between
       these “tunes” often sound contrived or formulaic
      overall form is rhapsodic, and codas are “too abrupt”
      orchestration is “blatant, involved and ordinary”, “on the whole top-heavy, with too much
       doubling and padding”
      style is sometimes “anachronistic”, harking back to Romantic or Impressionist models rather
       than contemporary composers.

     However, such views have been contested; points made in Gershwin’s favour include:
      themes are by no means always self-contained “numbers”, nor are they always based on 4-bar
       units
      many musical ideas are obviously thematically related
      certain sections are clearly not “filler” but “true developmental passages”
      some passages reveal considerable technical skill in counterpoint and harmony
      form is not simply rhapsodic: for example, it has been argued that An American in Paris has a
       ternary form
      orchestration is actually sometimes very effective
      work employs number of subtle rhythmic devices (see below, question 3)
      Gershwin was not simply writing pastiches of Romantic or Impressionist music, but shows
       awareness of contemporary techniques developed by figures such as Stravinsky, Les Six or
       Alban Berg.

     Some students might adopt a different approach, focusing on the idea that such criticism of
     Gershwin was based on ideas of the “inferiority” of popular and jazz styles which are no longer
     generally held. In this case, simply selecting passages that demonstrate the use of such styles will
     serve to illustrate the features of the work for which Gershwin was criticized.

2.   Petite Messe Solennelle by G Rossini
     Discuss the relationship between the instrumental and vocal parts in one or more passages
     from each of the following three movements:
     • Kyrie (section 1 of the Mass)
     • Cum Sancto Spiritu (movement 6 of the Gloria section)
     • Credo in unum Deum (movement 1 of the Credo section)

     The answers should refer to the prescribed work.

     Answers should address the question and be consistent and convincing in their display of musical
     understanding. Evidence should be located by using bar(s)/measure(s), rehearsal number(s),
     and/or instrument(s) in the works/extracts. Musical terminology should be effective in its use.

     (Note: the measure numbers given below are taken from the OUP edition, and may differ from
     those found in other editions of the work. Please make allowances for this, if necessary, when
     assessing students' examples.)

     Candidates may possibly interpret the term “relationship” here in various ways, but the
     most obvious approach would be to look at the textural relationship between voices and
     instruments. Candidates may select any passage from each movement for discussion,
     since each contains a number of standard textural types. The following illustrates how
     candidates might possibly approach one such typical textural type in the Cum Sancto Spiritu:
      polyphonic/contrapuntal writing for chorus (fugue)
      harmonium partly doubles vocal lines (polyphonic), partly plays sustained chords (homophonic)
      pianos have characteristic homophonic accompaniment figure of broken chords/arpeggios in
        the left hand and rhythmically separate chords in the right hand, most frequently on beats two
        and four. Upper voice of these usually doubles one of top three vocal lines; chords are
        occasionally joined together by eight note/quaver patterns to double vocal melismas
      examples: measures 26–54; 62–76; 84–112; 120–128; 162–178; 198–201 (with alternating
        left-hand/right-hand chords in harmonium).

3.   An American in Paris by G Gershwin and Petite Messe Solennelle by G Rossini
     Compare and contrast the rhythmic character of each of the prescribed works, emphasizing
     the presence of any significant rhythmical links.

     (HL only)

     The answers should refer to both prescribed works. The comparing and contrasting of significant
     musical links must focus on rhythm.

     Answers should be consistent and convincing in their display of musical understanding, and should
     be backed up by clearly located evidence. Musical terminology should be effective in its use.

     Obviously the Gershwin work has much more obvious rhythmic interest than the Rossini, drawing
     as it does on devices from both 20th century Western art music and jazz-influenced popular music.
     Some of the (many) features to which candidates might draw attention include:

     From Western art music
      rhythmic groupings which run counter to metre – for example, groups of three in duple time,
        crossing over barline. Examples: Rehearsal 3, measures/bars 1–3; Rehearsal 4 measures/bars
        1–3; Rehearsal 28 (flutes)
      rhythmic augmentation and diminution. Examples: Rehearsal 4 measures/bars 1–3 (same
        material heard in quavers/eighth notes in upper voices, in crotchets/quarter notes in bass);
        Rehearsal 33 (theme immediately followed by rhythmic diminution, transposed); Rehearsal 21
        (opening motif in augmentation, combined with version in original note values in bass)
      polyrhythm/polymetre (eg Rehearsal 10.5–8: triplets in strings and winds against 2/4 of
        trumpets)
      hemiola (notated as triplets – Rehearsal 20ff)
      changes of metre from bar to bar (eg Rehearsals 23–4).

     From jazz-influenced popular music
      syncopation (eg Rehearsal 57ff, trumpets)
      “swing” – not notated, but expected of some orchestral players in certain places (eg
        saxophones, Rehearsal 61ff).

     By contrast, as a 19th century work Rossini’s piece generally presents a much more sedate and
     foursquare rhythmic aspect, with rhythms generally based on straightforward combinations of even
     durational values. There are nevertheless some features of interest, including:
      consistent use of ostinato rhythmic patterns as characteristic accompaniment figures (eg Kyrie,
        bar/measure 2ff; Agnus Dei, bar/measure 8ff)
      use of dotted or double-dotted rhythms to give a martial or ceremonial flavour. Examples:
        Gratias, bar 1ff; Et resurrexit, 146ff
      use of longer note values than those usually found in Gershwin – most obviously in the Christe
        Eleison movement
      use of triple and compound metres, which do not figure at all (at least notated as such) in
        Gershwin’s score. Examples: Sanctus; O Salutaris.

     Some links between the two works can nevertheless be found:
      Gershwin is not always so rhythmically complex: his straight crotchets/quarter notes at
       Rehearsal 23ff can be compared to the similar accompaniment figure at bar 8 of Laudamus te,
       and the simple left-hand accompaniment figure of Rossini’s Domine Deus bears comparison
       with the first bar of the introduction to Gershwin’s “blues” theme (Rehearsal 45.9)
      Gershwin also, like Rossini, occasionally makes use of ostinato rhythms as typical
       accompaniment figures (eg the “maxixe” rhythm at Rehearsal 29)
      Rossini is not always so rhythmically straightforward. Like Gershwin, he occasionally makes
       use of syncopation (eg Gloria, bars/measures 138–142, 357ff, 481ff and elsewhere), hemiola

(Prélude réligieux, 75–6), or metrical groupings which cross the bar line (compare eg the
opening of the Agnus Dei with the version of the same material at bar/measure 63ff).

  Allegretto con Variazioni from Quintet in A Major for Clarinet and Strings, K 581 by WA Mozart
  (Identified piece, score provided)

  Musical elements
   Cut time (equivalent to 2/2 time), A major
   Tempo Allegretto (minim/half note = ca 66 on this recording)
   Variation form
   Clarinet quintet – string quartet with clarinet
   Texture varies from the opening homophony to contrapuntal
   Clarinet in A (sounds minor third lower than written part)
   Underlying harmonic basis with strong emphasis on tonic/dominant relationship and tonal root
    movement
   Half cadence, perfect/authentic cadence
   Period phrase structure, antecedent and consequent
   Clarinet has some virtuosic features with some wide leaps and agility
   Variations are partly thematic and partly inventions over a harmonic foundation
   Part of multi-movement work

  Musical structure
  There are many possible interpretations of the structure of this excerpt. Here is one of them:

  Bars 1–8      Theme: repeated; two 4-bar phrases in which the clarinet plays on the second half of
                each phrase. In the two-part texture preceding this, the instruments play in thirds,
                apart from the final open fifth. Bar/measure 4 has an imperfect (I–V) cadence and
                bar/measure 8 a perfect cadence (V–I) to the tonic of A major.

  Bars 9–16     Not repeated (though repeat is indicated in score); cello has bass notes; second violin
                plays a broken chord figure; first violin has new melody imitated in canon by the viola
                from bar/measure 10. Opening material reintroduced in bar/measure 13 in violin I and
                viola, with violin II then imitating upper part in canon at fourth below. Clarinet enters in
                the last 2 bars and section ends with V–I cadence as before. The material has been
                presented in two 8-bar sections, which is the pattern followed throughout.

  Bars 17–24    Variation I: clarinet has decorative melody played over the initial theme of
                bars/measures 1–4 and its harmony, with wide leaps of register and octave
                displacement of notes in bars/measures 19 and 23.

  Bars 25–29    Clarinet plays variation of violin I theme from bars/measures 9–12 above new
                accompaniment figures (eg oscillating figure in violin I).

  Bars 29–32    Clarinet plays decorative melody above slightly altered repeat of bars/measures 13–16
                in strings.

  Bars 33–48    Variation II: opening of melody in violin I based on clarinet theme from bar/measure
                17, and trilled cadences reappear at the end of each section, but generally speaking
                original melody has disappeared and variation is based on its harmonic outline.
                Basic features are:
                 accompaniment figures in constant triplets (violin II and viola);
                                               – 16 –                M15/6/MUSIC/BP1/ENG/TZ0/XX/M


               bass notes in cello as before and melody in violin I, with the clarinet entering for the
                last four bars of each 8-bar section, beginning in each case with a long sustained E.
                Of interest also is chromatic scale in violin I linking to final section (bar/measure 44).

Musical terminology
Some of the words that could be relevant to criterion C include (but are not limited to): theme, tonic,
dominant, chromatic, canon/canonic, imitation/imitative, virtuosic, arpeggio, figure/figuration,
counterpoint/contrapuntal, tempo, cadence, diminished, motif/motivic, appoggiatura, syncopation, trill.

Musical context
 Clarinet part written with Anton Stadler in mind who would have used the basset clarinet (basset
  horn)
 Chamber music
 Classical period (1789)
 Some thematic links to the clarinet concerto (also in A).

  Sunday Morning from Peter Grimes – Four Sea Interludes, Op 33a by B Britten
  (Identified piece, no score provided)

  Musical elements
   Large orchestra with especially large percussion section which includes tam-tam, xylophone and
    tubular bells (though not all percussion is heard on this extract)
   Diatonic but with chromatic additions which create harmonic ambiguity
   Rhythmically varied and syncopated in places
   Allegro spiritoso – 2/2 (minim/half note = 80 in score, on this recording ca 84)
   Economic writing with distinctive and clear use of instrumental colour (timbre)
   Varied textures and instrumentation partly defining the design
   Tonal centre is ambiguous but settles towards D given the long pedal D and the sustained high D
    on bassoons at the start
   Horn motif at the start can be heard as bitonal juxtaposition of E and D major or as in D mode with
    sharpened fourth (Lydian)
   Rhythmically not complex but very unsettled using syncopations and irregular arrangements
   Use of pedal points (start and ending)
   Parallel harmonies, for example at circa 1:41–45
   Disjunct contour of the opening figure contrasts with smooth conjunct contour of the string melody

  Musical structure
  There are many possible interpretations of the structure of this excerpt. Here is one of them.
  However, candidates are not expected to give such detail.

  0:00         A: Repeated 4-bar harmonic ostinato for horns. Woodwind enter in octaves on the
               second bar of repetition, with staccato theme characterized by rising fifths and
               syncopated treatment. Horns sustain final chord and woodwind have upward run linking
               to next section.

  0:31         A2: Horn ostinato resumes, with strings taking over the material just heard and some
               phrases loosely imitated by woodwind. Culminates again in a trilled bridge descending
               chromatically into…

  0:59         B: Sumptuous string melody slowly rising into upper registers of both violas and cellos.
               Fragmented figuration in woodwind (suggesting sea birds and wind), partly based on
               diminution of ostinato motif from preceding sections. Harp and pizzicato basses feature
               a pattern of isolated notes separated by rests, with occasional off-key notes suggesting
               bitonality. Culminates again in the trilled cadence and a harp glissando…

  1:46–1:55    A3: Opening material presented by full orchestra fortissimo. Horns have harmonic
               ostinato as before, syncopated theme is presented in trumpets, strings provide ostinato
               based on same material in even quavers/eighth notes.

  Musical terminology
  Some of the words that could be relevant to criterion C include (but are not limited to):
  ostinato/harmonic ostinato, glissando, syncopation, bitonal/bitonality, pedal point, timbre,
  instrumentation, orchestration, dovetailing (eg strings entry and horn motif), imitation, trill, tremolando,
  portamento, accents, parallelism, con sordini, harmonics, bell tones.

Musical context
 Programmatic / illustrative
 From the opera Peter Grimes (first performed 1945) by English composer Benjamin Britten
  (1913–1976)
 Mid-20th century
 Twentieth century origin suggested by: colourful orchestration with use, for example, of trumpet as
  melodic instrument, or entry of bells and tam-tam at end of extract; modal and bitonal elements of
  harmony; syncopated rhythms; occasional use of dissonance

  Ven ven mulata by Manuel Lopez-Ruiz
  (Unidentified piece, no score provided)

  Musical elements
   E major mode
   2/4 (but 4/4 would be acceptable; any numbers of bars given would then be half those shown
    below)
   Very fast (crotchet/quarter note = 124)
   Spanish guitar, singer, electric bass, timbales, hand clapping, and brass section
   Verse/chorus form

  Musical structure
  There are many possible interpretations of the structure of this excerpt. Here is one of them:

   Piece consists essentially of alternation of Verse (A) and Chorus (B) sections, with overall form
    of AABB ABBBB AABBBB.
   Both sections are normally 8 (2 x 4) bars long, and each is based on an underlying harmonic
    progression: A is I–I–II–II V–V–I–I, B is II–V–I–I (x 2).

  0:00      Verse (A) x 2
            After a rasgueado of the guitar, voice enters introducing the first verse (8 bars/measures).
            Electric bass supports the basic harmony from the third bar onwards. Verse is repeated
            with second voice in harmony (third higher) with the first. All this is accompanied by guitar
            and percussion. At the very end (0:17), the ensemble comes to a halt on the downbeat and
            the voices sing the upbeat to the next section unaccompanied. This is a typical feature of
            transitions between sections: cf also 0:25, 0:35, 0:43, 0:51, 1:17, 1:33, 1:41, 1:49. 1:57.

  0:18      Chorus (B) x 2
            Both voices in harmony (thirds). Electric bass has repeated syncopated rhythm omitting
            first beat of bar and placing heavy accent on fourth quaver/eighth note, creating metrical
            ambiguity. Second “B” section presents syncopated interjections of brass.

  0:35      Verse (A)
            Similar to verse 1 (0:00) (9 measures).

  0:44      Chorus (B) x 2
            Syncopated interjections of brass begin immediately. Guitar run at 0:59 leads into:

  1:01      Chorus (B) x 2 (instrumental)
            Improvized guitar solo with the virtuosic style typical of flamenco. Harmonic progression is
            that of chorus, but repeated electric bass rhythm is that of verse sections.

  1:17      Verse (A) x 2
            Similar to the section beginning at 0:00.

  1:34      Chorus (B) x 4
            Brass enter again for last two repeats (ca 1:48 onwards).

  Musical terminology
  Some of the words that could be relevant to criterion C include (but are not limited to): chorus, verse,
  major, bridge, flamenco, rumba flamenca, strummed playing (rasgueado).

Musical context
 Rumba flamenca, one of the lighter styles of traditional flamenco. Flamenco originated in Spain,
  but then travelled to South America, returning to Spain from the 1850s onwards in a new form
  incorporating other influences.
 As such, it incorporates elements brought from the Caribbean (eg Afro-Cuban) and, more recently,
  other influences from outside flamenco.
 It could be argued that this track is a fusion between flamenco and pop elements.
 One famous group in this style was Gypsy Kings.

  Le Duo by Adzido (Ritual Songs and Dances from Africa)
  (Unidentified piece, no score provided)

  Musical elements
   Ensemble with wooden tuned idiophones: possibly one or more balans (African instrument similar
    to xylophone) tuned to pentatonic, isotonic or heptatonic African scales. Several names exist for
    this instrument – balafon, gyil, balangi – though exact naming is not expected
   Mbira/Sansa/Thumb-piano
   Various drums (djembe), solo and group voices
   Pentatonic motifs, syncopation, balanced phrases
   Accents
   Ostinato patterns
   Multi-layered texture
   1.5 octave vocal pitch range
   4/4 with fluctuating pulse
   Initial tempo ca 108; by 0:41 has increased to 120, by 1:41 to ca 160
   Variation in rhythmic, timbral and textural density by the addition, subtraction or subtle alteration of
    parts sustains interest

  Musical structure
  There are many possible interpretations of the structure of this excerpt. Here is one of them,
  consisting of three sections with clearly shaped and repetitive motifs and phrases:

  A section (can be divided into 10-second long segments)
  0:00     Tuned percussion plays essentially pentatonic melodic motif with tonal centre on B, which is
           slightly varied & repeated to form first phrase. Five bars/measures long.

  0:10     Solo (leader) sings first phrase. Two-bar ostinato patterns in tuned percussion begin,
           providing harmonic support, and will continue through the A section. Five bars/measures
           long again.

  0:21     Chorus enters repeating first phrase. Ostinato continues. Drums enter with a flourish at
           0:20, adding new layer to balan and vocal lines (increases rhythmic complexity, textural
           density and overall tension). Tempo gradually starts to accelerate. Five bars/measures
           long.

  0:32     Soloist reiterates first phrase over ostinato & drums. Five bars/measures long.

  0:42     Chorus reiterates first phrase over ostinato & drums. Five bars/measures long again, but
           extra beat added to final bar (ie = 5/4).

  B section
  0:53     Two-bar/measure, 16th-note (semiquaver) pattern in tuned percussion.

  0:57     Soloist sings above pattern with accents, over new tuned percussion patterns.

  1:01     Chorus sings in response to soloist over tuned percussion patterns. Again 2 bars/
           measures long.

  1:05     Soloist/chorus alternation at 0:57–1:05 reiterated.
                                               – 22 –               M15/6/MUSIC/BP1/ENG/TZ0/XX/M


C section
1:13    Tuned percussion begin 1-bar/measure ostinato pattern which essentially repeats from this
        point on. Trill-like vocal calls (sounding like flutes) enter 1:15. Increase in tempo and
        intensified instrumental, “jamming”-like, rhythmic activity introduce a strong forward thrust in
        this section. Sound seems spontaneous, freer from metric constraints, and trance-inducing.
        Fast, assertive playing in the drums, with clear and colourful articulation of longer rhythmic
        patterns. Latter have subtle shifts after some repetition over the continuous ostinato patterns
        in the tuned percussion, which also shift. Sporadic accented vocal cheers reveal the
        informal, participatory nature of the performance setting.

Musical terminology
Some of the words that could be relevant to criterion C include (but are not limited to): polyrhythms,
polyphony, countermelodies, polymelody, syncopation, motifs, sequences, ostinato, accelerando,
balanced phrases, antiphony, call and response singing (responsorial), pentatonic, idiophones,
membranophones.

Musical context
 African ritual dance (from Burkina Faso)
 Indigenous dance music
 Likely performed in participatory community gatherings (the piece is a rain dance)
