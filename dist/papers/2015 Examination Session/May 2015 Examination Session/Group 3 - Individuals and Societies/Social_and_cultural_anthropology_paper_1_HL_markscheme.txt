1.   Describe why female Ghanaian migrants may decide to consult an anti-witchcraft
     shrine priest.                                                                                    [6]

     This primarily descriptive question requires candidates to give an account of how female Ghanaian
     migrants come to understand and experience their illnesses, from the seemingly innocuous cough
     to the visions of evil spirits, as something socially and economically evil, namely witchcraft.

     The author presents the case of Grace, a young migrant who suffers a repeated sore throat and
     flu-like symptoms and eventually comes to believe she is a victim of witchcraft. As a consequence,
     she decides to travel to Paris and consult Abe.

     Better answers will make explicit reference to the complex relationship between the Ghanaian
     migrants’ socio-economic situation and their experience and understanding of illness. They give
     meaning to their social suffering through the interpretive frame of witchcraft. As a causation
     theory, witchcraft explains physical distress, uncertainty and moral disquiet.

2.   Using theoretical perspectives, explain why Abe’s anti-witchcraft shrine is
     successful in solving illness and misfortune.                                                      [6]

     Several points in the text can be drawn on to answer this question and answers will incorporate
     relevant concepts and knowledge from social and cultural anthropology.

     The question requires candidates to demonstrate an understanding of how Ghanaian witchcraft
     constitutes an epistemological and moral framework for making sense of reality. Witchcraft beliefs
     about good, evil, causation, divination and healing can provide coherent ideologies for making
     sense of personal and social experiences and their ties to moral systems. Successful answers
     may demonstrate an awareness of how individuals are embedded in social structures and cultural
     dynamics that shape identity, actions and meanings.

     Abe is successful in treating illness and misfortune because his practices may be understood as a
     quest for meaning in the context of migration. As the author puts it, these practices situate “social
     suffering in its widest social, economic and political context”. Abe reinvents traditional and modern
     divination techniques, incorporating non-prescription cold medicine and popular psychology. His
     healing practices revolve around the client’s personal relationships rather than abstract knowledge
     independent of the client’s social context. This is clearly illustrated in his use of the “road map”.
     As Grace’s case shows, Abe’s approach to healing is dynamic and contextual and articulates with
     its modern setting.

     For Grace, the anti-witchcraft shrines represent legitimate forms of knowledge which provide
     healing. Candidates may make reference to the author’s critique of the view that witchcraft is
     ineffective and no longer relevant to the modern world. In her view, witchcraft practices are one
     manifestation of modernity, and incorporate new objects, such as biomedical knowledge and street
     maps. Candidates may also recognize the author’s attention to local categories, as illustrated in
     her analysis of witchcraft in relation to socio-economic transformation and the actors’
     understanding of modernity. Some candidates may point out that the author approaches the issue
     from the perspective of medical anthropology, and can make reference to globalization theories,
     modernity studies and symbolic and post-colonial perspectives. They may also refer to earlier
     ethnographic work on witchcraft, such as Evans-Pritchard’s.

     Some approaches to this question may analyse witchcraft as a general discourse about morality
     and sociality, identifying these elements in how Abe considers Grace’s obligations to her social
     network as a key aspect of the treatment. Candidates can link witchcraft to concepts such as
     social control and change, referring to kinship obligations and the migrant condition.

     The question can be approached from different theoretical perspectives: structure-centred, idealist,
     or particularistic. Other perspectives may also provide appropriate ways to frame this question.
     Answers may draw on general anthropological concepts and terms related to syllabus themes
     (individuals, groups and society, systems of knowledge, belief systems and practices, and moral
     systems). Core terms and ideas such as culture, meaning and agency can be used effectively.

                1–2 The response is mainly descriptive and relies on quotations, but
                    may demonstrate limited understanding of relevant anthropological
                    issues and concepts.
                3–4 The response demonstrates some understanding of relevant
                    anthropological issues and concepts or theory, or the response
                    recognizes the viewpoint of the anthropologist, but not all of these.
                5–6 The response demonstrates a critical understanding of relevant
                    anthropological issues, concepts and theory, and recognizes the
                    viewpoint of the anthropologist.

3.   Compare Ghanaian immigrants’ approaches to suffering to those of one other
     group or society you have studied in detail.                                                    [8]

     The target societies for this comparative question are varied and many. The question requires
     candidates to demonstrate an understanding of suffering as present in any society or group.
     The experience of suffering may take many forms, allowing candidates to draw relevant
     comparisons.

     The measure of this answer depends on how candidates compare and incorporate ethnographic
     knowledge, rather than it being a test of knowledge of a similar case study.
