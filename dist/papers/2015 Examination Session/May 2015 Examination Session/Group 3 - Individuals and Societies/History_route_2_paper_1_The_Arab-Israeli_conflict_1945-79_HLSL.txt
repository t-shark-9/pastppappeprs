Source A                Dr Mike Berry and Professor Gregory Philo, lecturers in social sciences, writing
                        in an introductory book to the conflict in the Middle East, Israel and Palestine:
                        Competing Histories (2006).

During the 1960s the Middle East was the site of Cold War rivalry between America and the Soviet
Union, as both supplied the region’s states with weapons. In spring 1967 the Soviet Union informed
the Syrian government that Israel was massing troops on its northern border ready for an attack on
Syria. While this is a matter of dispute among historians, the previous years had seen a number of
border clashes between the two nations and tensions ran high. Israel threatened to overthrow the
Syrian regime unless it stopped Palestinian attacks launched from Syria. Syria … turned to Egypt with
whom it had a mutual defence pact. Egypt then sent troops into the Sinai bordering Israel and asked
the UN troops to evacuate their positions. The Egyptian troops then moved into Sharm el Sheikh and
proclaimed a blockade of the Israeli port of Eilat, which was accessible only through Egyptian waters.

                        issued following the Egyptian blockade of the Red Sea (23 May 1967).

Tension has again arisen along the armistice lines between Israel and the Arab states. The situation
there is a matter of grave concern to the international community. We support all efforts … to reduce
tensions and restore stability. The Secretary-General has gone to the Near East on his mission of peace
with the hopes and prayers of men of good will everywhere …

The US Government is deeply concerned, in particular, with three potentially explosive aspects of the
present confrontation.

First, we regret that the General Armistice Agreements have failed to prevent warlike acts …

Second, we are dismayed at the withdrawal of the United Nations Emergency Force from Gaza and
Sinai after more than 10 years of steadfast and effective service in keeping the peace …

Third, we deplore the recent build-up of military forces and believe it a matter of urgent importance
to reduce troop concentrations. The status of sensitive areas … is a particularly important aspect of
the situation.

Source D               Adeed Dawisha, a professor of Political Science, writing in the chapter “Egypt” in
                       the collection of academic essays, The Cold War and the Middle East (1997).

The superpowers had little to do with the immediate causes of the crisis that led to the Six Day War.
The origins of the crisis were regional and could probably be traced to the rise to power of a Syrian
leadership committed to the liberation of Palestine. This Syrian regime extended its support to
Palestinian guerilla groups. As a result of increasing guerilla activities the level of violence on the
Syrian–Israeli border rose through 1966 and early 1967. Israeli retaliation intensiﬁed: in April 1967
Israeli pilots shot down six Syrian MIGs [ﬁghter planes] and Israel staged a victorious air parade.
The political temperature continued to rise throughout May, as Israel and Syria ﬁred accusations and
threats against each other.

Source E                                  Eugene Rostow, a professor of Law and Public Affairs who served as Under
                                          Secretary of State for Political Affairs between 1966 and 1969, writing in an article
                                          in UN Security Council Resolution 242: the Building Block of Peacemaking,
                                          A Washington Institute Monograph (1993).

From September 1966 until the outbreak of the Six Day War the situation became progressively
threatening, as attacks on Israel, largely from Syria and Jordan, increased in number and severity and
Israeli responses against Syria increased. During the spring of 1967 the USSR began to spread false
reports that Israel was planning to attack Syria and mobilized twelve to fourteen brigades near the
Golan Heights. We knew that there was no truth in these reports … but the Soviets kept repeating them
as formal diplomatic reports to Egypt, other Arab countries and to Israel.

The Soviet program of disinformation had far-reaching effects. Arab radio and newspapers mocked
President Nasser. “You claim to be the big brother of the Arab people”, the voices said, “but Israel is
about to attack Syria and you do nothing”.



1.        (a)        What, according to Source A, were the main causes of tension in the Middle East?                                                                                        [3]

          (b)        What is the message conveyed by Source C?                                                                                                                               [2]


2.        Compare and contrast the views expressed in Sources D and E about the tension in the
          Middle East.                                                                                                                                                                       [6]


3.        With reference to their origin and purpose, assess the value and limitations of Source B and
          Source E for historians studying events in the Middle East in the lead up to the Six Day War
          of 1967.                                                                                                                                                                           [6]


4.        “The causes of the Six Day War of 1967 had little to do with Cold War tensions.” Using the
          sources and your own knowledge, to what extent do you agree with this statement?                                                                                                   [8]
