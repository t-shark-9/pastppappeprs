1.   (a)   What, according to Source A, were the aims of the Locarno Treaty?                      [3]

           • To maintain the frontiers between Germany, Belgium and France as fixed by the
             Treaty of Versailles of 1919;
           • To make Germany, Belgium and France pledge to neither attack nor invade (or resort
             to war against) one another;
           • To settle all questions between Germany, Belgium and France by peaceful means;
           • To submit questions to judicial decisions to which nations should comply.

     Award [1] for each relevant point up to a maximum of [3].

     (b)   What is the message conveyed by Source C?                                              [2]

           • The agreement brought a new dawn of peace;
           • Peace was difficult to reach as indicated by how steep the mountain is and/or the
             distance to the sun with mountains in between;
           • Belgium, France, Britain and Germany are at the peak of the mountain together
             indicating that they have solved their disputes while Czechoslovakia and Poland
             would find peace more difficult to attain.

     Award [1] for each valid point up to a maximum of [2].
                                                 –4–                  M15/3/HISTX/BP1/ENG/TZ0/S1/M


2.   Compare and contrast the views expressed in Sources D and E about the achievements
     of the Locarno Treaty.                                                                        [6]

     For “compare”
     • Both sources see the Eastern and Western frontiers of Germany as two separate issues.
       Candidates could refer to Locarno leaving Eastern Europe more vulnerable to future
       German expansion and/or Germany temporarily accepting the Western borders at
       Locarno;
     • Both sources agree that there was not an immediate threat on the Eastern frontiers of
       Germany. Source D mentions Germany having signed territorial agreements with Poland
       and Czechoslovakia; Source E states that a detente had been reached in the Eastern
       frontiers of Germany;
     • Both sources state that Stresemann/Germany wished to recover territory lost to Poland.
       In Source D, Germany promised not to change the Polish frontier by force but there was
       no renunciation of the German claims; Source E states that prospects for Poland were
       dismal;
     • Both sources agree that Germany was in no condition to act aggressively at the time of
       Locarno.

     For “contrast”
     • Source E outlines a specific agenda for Stresemann´s foreign policy after Germany's entry
       to the League of Nations, whereas Source D is not specific about Stresemann's policies
     • Source D claims that Germany's western frontiers were “accepted” whereas Source E
       states Stresemann had not made any moral renunciations at Locarno. This may lead
       some candidates to argue that the views in Source E are more critical than those
       expressed in Source D;
     • Source D suggests that France feared German intentions in the future whereas Source E
       states that Germany was in no position to make war on France;
     • In Source D, Britain claims they declined to guarantee Germany's Eastern borders
       whereas Source E states Britain declared that they had produced a detente in the East.

     Do not demand all of the above. If only one source is discussed award a maximum
     of [2]. If the two sources are discussed separately award [3] or with excellent linkage
     [4–5]. For maximum [6] expect a detailed running comparison/contrast.

3.   With reference to their origin and purpose, assess the value and limitations of Source A
     and Source B for historians studying the “Locarno Spring”.                                         [6]

     Source A
     Origin:        Articles of the Treaty of Mutual Guarantee signed in 1925 between Germany,
                    Belgium, France, Great Britain and Italy.

     Purpose:       To end hostilities between the signatories by ensuring acknowledgment of the
                    frontiers between Germany and France and Germany and Belgium;
                    to determine the duties and responsibilities of the contracting nations;
                    to establish the procedures to solve disputes among them.

     Value:         As an extract of the founding treaty of the Locarno Spring, it shows the official
                    position of the contracting nations and their readiness to solve disputes by
                    peaceful means.

     Limitations:   The source only provides information about the official intent of the signatories
                    of the Treaty. It does not (nor can it) outline the Treaty’s consequences; its
                    reception, impact and the extent to which it achieved its aims.

     Source B
     Origin:        Extract from A History of the German Republic written by historian Arthur
                    Rosenberg and published in London in 1936.

     Purpose:       To inform readers about the history of the Weimar Republic; to educate.

     Value:         Written by a historian, so informed analysis would be expected. It is focused
                    on Germany, so detail could be expected. He lived in Germany before 1933
                    so he could have had direct experience of some of the events covered in his
                    book. The date of publication allowed hindsight.

     Limitations:   As indicated by the title, the focus of the book is Germany so analysis of the
                    role of other powers may be limited. As someone who emigrated from
                    Germany after Hitler's rise, subjectivity could be expected. The date of
                    publication, 1936, did not allow for sufficient analysis of the events.

     Do not expect all of the above. Ideally there will be a balance between the two sources, and
     each one can be marked out of [3], but allow a [4/2] split. If only one source is assessed,
     mark out of [4]. For a maximum of [6] candidates must refer to both origin and purpose, and
     value and limitations.

4.   “Locarno resulted from a desire for peace on the part of the nations involved.” Using the
     sources and your own knowledge, to what extent do you agree with this statement?                   [8]

     Source material
     Source A      Germany, Belgium and France explicitly promise not to invade or attack one
                   another and to settle disputes by peaceful means.

     Source B        The source identifies events that indicate a desire for peace: the guarantee
                     of frontiers; refraining from the use of force; Germany´s renunciation of
                     Alsace-Lorraine together with France´s agreement not to extend to the
                     Rhineland; British and Italian commitment to assist an attacked power;
                     Germany´s entrance into the League of Nations in 1926 and her recognition
                     as a Great Power.

     Source C        The source shows peace among previously hostile nations symbolized by
                     the new dawn breaking after a long period of bloodshed. However, it shows
                     peace would be more difficult to attain for the weaker successor states (they
                     still have some climbing to do before peace is a prospect for them).

     Source D        The source shows British commitment to the Locarno agreement. However,
                     it reveals doubts as to the fate of future relations between Germany and
                     Poland. Britain is not willing to underwrite any agreement relating to
                     Germany’s eastern borders.

     Source E        The source claims that Stresemann did not seem to have a genuine desire
                     for peace and reconciliation but was operating with the aim of obtaining a
                     revision of the postwar agreements. The source specifically states that
                     Stresemann did not give up the right to make war but was simply admitting
                     that, at that stage, Germany was unable to confront France. Prospects for
                     Poland were dismal.

     Own knowledge
     In support of the statement candidates could argue that the Locarno Pact was signed in
     the context of Wilson's fourteenth point establishing the principle of collective security. They
     could also comment that, in contrast with Versailles, which the Germans viewed as a
     “dictated peace”, Locarno, was a negotiated treaty. France agreed to an early evacuation of
     the Rhineland and the evacuation of the Ruhr; Locarno meant the abandonment of force as
     an instrument of change and relaxed tensions for a number of years; Locarno allowed for the
     re-establishment of some kind of balance of power between France and Germany.

     On the other hand, candidates could argue that Locarno was a product of France’s
     diplomatic defeat over the Ruhr rather than a desire for peace. The German desire to revise
     Versailles had not disappeared. What motivated Locarno was the fear of Bolshevism.

     Do not expect all of the above, and accept other relevant material. If only source material or
     only own knowledge is used, the maximum mark that can be obtained is [5]. For maximum
     [8] expect argument, synthesis of source material and own knowledge, as well as references
     to the sources used.
