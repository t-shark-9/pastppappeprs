                                                Section A

1.   (a)   Using a PEST framework, describe two external factors that may affect NK.                     [4]

           PEST stands for political, economic, social, and technological. The categories
           are not perfectly distinct.

           External factors in the stimulus include:

           Political
            regional trading bloc
            inefficient national governments
            limited public sector services.

           Economic
            developing economies
            weak infrastructure.

           Social
            low quality of life
            poorly educated population.

           Technological
            weak infrastructure
            by inference, weak high technology.

           Accept any relevant external factor.


           Mark as 2+2.

           Award [1] for each relevant external PEST factor identified and [1] for an
           appropriate description, up to a maximum of [2].

     (b)   Using data from the table:

           (i)   calculate loan capital X (show all your working);                                 [2]

                 All figures in 000s

                 Total of all assets: = $176 + $674 + $320 + $2600 = $3770

                 Total of liabilities and owner’s equity, other than X:
                 = $270 + $230 + $300 + $970 = $1770

                 X = $3770  $1770 = $2000


                 Award [1] for working and [1] for the correct answer. Award up to a
                 maximum of [2].

        Award [4] if the candidate constructs an accurate balance sheet (that
        balances) according to the IB prescribed format, such as the vertical
        balance sheet above or the horizontal model typically used in the United
        States. The balance sheet must be dated.

        Award [3] for a largely accurate balance sheet that balances, according to
        a generally accepted format, such as the vertical format above or the
        horizontal model typically used in the United States.

        Award [2] if the candidate constructs a largely recognizable balance sheet
        but it does not balance, or it has two major problems of classification.

        Award [1] if the candidate conveys some idea of what a balance sheet is.

       N.B. please be especially careful when marking these responses. Candidate own
       figure rule (OFR) applies. Often, to check the candidate’s response, the examiner
       must refer to the balance sheet produced by the candidate in part (ii), identify the loan
       capital and/or total capital employed from the balance sheet and then calculate what
       the gearing ratios should be using these figures.

       Award [1] for working and [1] for the correct answer. Award up to a
       maximum of [2] for each option.

(c)   Examine the disadvantages of Option A and of Option B as sources of finance
      for the purchase of the new equipment.                                                   [5]

      The disadvantages of Option A, which will increase NK’s gearing ratio, are that:
       NK’s profitability after tax and interest will be affected because of the interest
        expense on the new loan
       NK’s cashflow will be affected by the debt service (payments), which is money
        that could have gone into other needs (increased working capital
        requirements, other capital expenditures, etc).

      The disadvantages of Option B, which will lower NK’s gearing ratio, are that:
       ownership of the business may be affected – the $800 000 may come from
        new investors, thus diluting ownership for current owners, or, if the $800 000
        comes from existing owners, it may change the percentage ownership of
        existing shareholders.
       Financing capital expenditures with capital rather than equity increases the
        total equity amount, which makes it more difficult to maintain return on equity
        ratio for investors.

      Overall, the use of equity for capital is the safest option, but has the potential for
      lower reward. The use of debt is the riskier of the two options, but the chance for
      very strong investor returns exists with the debt-financing option.

      Accept any other relevant examination.


      In the context of this response, a balanced response is when a candidate
      address the disadvantages of both types of financing. If a candidate addresses
      only one type, award a maximum of [3].

2.   (a)   Describe ET’s current distribution channel and the channel recommended by the
           marketing consultant.                                                                  [4]

           ET’s current distribution channel is B2C shipment directly from the production
           facility to the purchaser. In e-commerce terms, it is “pure play,” meaning that,
           from a consumer’s point of view, ET has only an Internet presence. It has no
           physical stores to which consumers can go to see and experience the toys.

           ET’s proposed new distribution channel is by way of the toy parties. This
           approach is somewhat unusual. A typical integration of Internet commerce with a
           physical presence, known as “brick-and-click,” involves a retail store or locations
           with fixed addresses to which consumers can go. The toy parties represent
           something different: a physical presence of representatives of the company, but
           not a permanent physical presence (locations could change and the physical
           presence exists only when there is a party).


           Mark as 2+2.

           Award [1] for identifying ET’s current distribution channel Award [1] for
           describing it. Candidates do not have to use the term “pure play” for [1] but they
           do have to convey the idea that, to consumers, ET currently only has an Internet
           presence. Award up to a maximum of [2].

           Award [1] for identifying ET’s new distribution channel (toy parties). Award [1] for
           describing it. Candidates do not have to use the term “click-and-brick”, but they
           do have to provide some additional descriptor for a second mark. That descriptor
           could emphasize that there is now an intermediary between ET and the
           customers (sales representatives), or that ET now has a one level distribution
           system (in addition to its continued B2C online sales). However, if the
           description is of the promotional and marketing technique features of “toy parties”
           (children can play with the toys, etc), do not accept this as a relevant descriptor
           (as it is not describing distribution). Award up to a maximum of [2].

        Award [1] for working and [1] for the correct answer.           Award up to a
        maximum of [2].

(iii)   Comment on the change in net profit margin from 2014 (actual) and 2015
        (forecasted).                                                                   [3]

        Net profit margin fell from a healthy 17.73 % to a negative 5.68 %. The
        biggest reason for the decrease is the increase in fixed costs, which rose
        from €121 800 to €180 000. The combination of lower prices and sales
        commission also had an impact, as variable costs as a percentage of sales
        increased from 41.67 % to 54.55 %. ET will have to increase volume if it is
        to return to profitability, or determine some ways to cut its variable costs.


        Award [1] if the candidate makes an assertion about the change using
        figures to support their response. Award [1] for each relevant commentary
        on the situation (for example, the increase in fixed costs, the increase in
        variable costs, the need for greater volume, etc). Award a maximum of [3].


        N.B. a candidate could make a relevant comment and earn a mark without
        using figures. For example, compare:

        “The forecasted net profit margin for 2015 is lower than the net profit
        margin for 2014, possibly because of the higher promotion costs and lower
        prices.” This response would receive [1].

        Versus:

        “The forecasted net profit margin of <5.68%> for 2015 is lower than the net
        profit margin of 17.73% for 2014, possibly because of the higher promotion
        costs and lower prices.” This response would receive [2].

        A comment as basic as “the net profit margin declined from 17.73% to
        <5.68%>” would receive only [1], despite having figures and a basic valid
        assertion. This is because the candidate is just putting into words the basic
        differences in the two figures.

(c)   Using relevant data from Table 2, prepare an annual cash-flow forecast for ET,
      for 2015.                                                                              [4]

      Award [1] if the candidate has some idea of an annual cash-flow forecast but
      otherwise has numerous errors. Award [2] if the cash flow has two or more
      errors or has a largely inaccurate format. Award [3] if it is largely formatted
      correctly and/or has one error. Award a maximum of [4] for a correctly formatted
      and mathematically accurate cash-flow forecast.

      N.B. an example of how a candidate can demonstrate “some idea” is if they
      produce a table with many errors (balance sheet figures, wrong order,
      mathematical errors, etc, but still conveys some sense of opening cash balance
      and a closing cash balance.

(d)   Examine two reasons why ET originally charged higher prices for its toys than
      those charged by its competitors.                                                      [5]

      Possible reasons why ET’s toys were more expensive than their competitors
      include:
       ET hoped that if it priced its toys higher, consumers would think of them as of
         higher quality or of better value (educational).
       The parents who purchase ET’s toys are loyal, believe in the product, and,
         therefore, are willing to pay premium pricing.
       ET has a small scale of operations. Compared to most toy manufacturers, ET
         is very small and may not enjoy the economies of scale that other
         manufacturers do.

      Accept any other relevant reason and examination.


      N.B. Award [1] for each reason identified, up to [2]. Award an additional [1] if the
      candidate provides a reasonable examination. Award [1] if the candidate has
      one reason that is primarily psychological (brand perception, customer loyalty,
      etc) and the second reason is “real,” based upon possible higher per-unit cost
      because of the small scale of operations.

3.   (a)   Describe one type of below the line promotion that SP may use to promote its
           “running clinics”.                                                                       [2]

           Types of below the line promotion include:
            direct marketing (catalogues, email, flyers, mail, online display ads and pop-
             ups, promotional letters, text messages, etc)
            personal selling (of which there are many varieties)
            public relations
            sponsorship (charities, sports events, etc)
            celebrity appearance at events or in the store
            accept any other relevant below the line promotion.

           As this question is about below the line promotion rather than below the line
           advertising, reward for discounts but do not reward logos or slogans.

           N.B. do not accept word of mouth as a type of below the line promotion.


           Award [1] when a candidate correctly identifies a type of below the line promotion
           and [1] for describing it. Award up to a maximum of [2].

     (b)   Explain two reasons why SP supports the local running community.                         [6]

           Reasons why SP would support the local running community include:

           USP: The main reason SP supports the local running community is to develop a
           local customer base. SP’s USP is not price. Runners in the Santa Fe area can
           purchase running shoes more cheaply online. Though the stimulus does not say
           so, they can probably also buy shoes cheaper at chain sporting goods store, like
           Foot Locker or Dick’s Sporting Goods. SP simply cannot compete on price, so its
           USP is based upon the idea that SP supports and fosters a whole community of
           people with the same interest. Buying from SP means joining a community, and
           the community is self-reinforcing because everyone has a common interest
           (running).

           Promotion/publicity: One method of supporting the running community is
           having events, like local races and, especially, its annual event “Race to the Top”.
           By hosting such events, which garner publicity, SP’s marketing reaches beyond
           the immediate community of its customers. Local events wind up being reported
           on local TV, so even non-runners come to know the store and support the event.
           Along with other sponsored events, like other races and running clinics, SP gets
           to be better known. Other businesses will want to get involved and play some
           role in the event, making it even bigger, attracting more people.

           Create sales opportunities: The events probably lead to increased sales. This
           is true of races but also of running clinics, which probably attract people who are
           not runners (they go to the clinic to learn about running). If the clinic piques their
           interest, SP has positioned itself to sell those people shoes. Clinic participants
           could, of course, buy their shoes online (and perhaps some do), but others and
           perhaps even most would feel some loyalty/obligation to SP to buy a pair of
           shoes from them. Soon, these customers are part of the running community.
                                      – 13 –              M15/3/BUSMT/SP2/ENG/TZ0/XX/M


Purpose: Another reason that SP supports the local running community is
because its owners and manager (and probably most of the staff) really do
believe that “Running sustains life, locally and globally”. One of many reasons
small businesses are opened and exist is that the founder/owners are genuinely
interested in, or have a passion for, what the store does. The owner/founders are
probably runners themselves, as are probably the salespeople. This would make
sense: because SP sponsors running events, the staff would need to be
knowledgeable about running and enjoy being at running events.

Brand Loyalty: Events, passion, social connections and community, all these
would create a branded identity for SP, even if selling products with their own
brand names (Nike, Adidas, Puma, etc), and build loyalty. This is also true of
giving special discounts to school-aged children. After buying shoes at SP when
young, possibly initially because of the discounts, these children runners would
join the SP community, be grateful for past discounts and ongoing events, and
continue to patronize SP by buying their shoes, even if more expensive.

Research: Running clinics allow SP to work with its customers actually in the
context of their use of its products. This way, SP staff can dialogue with
customers to learn about their interests and wants. In certain respects, running
clinics are like focus groups, but in some ways even better.

Accept any other relevant reasons and explanations.

Award [1] for each reason identified, award [1] for explaining the reason, and [1]
for an explanation of the reason in context of the stimulus. Award up to a
maximum of [3] per reason.

If the reason is not framed in terms of a specific business concept with
appropriate use of business vocabulary, award a maximum of [2] per reason if
the reason is relevant and well developed. For a basic “common sense” answer
with little development and virtually no use of business vocabulary, award a
maximum of [1] per reason.

       (c)    Analyse the role of SP’s vision statement.                                                                    [5]

              In general, the characteristics of a good vision statement include:
               clarity
               brevity
               abstract and challenging
               tells the organization’s purpose
               future-oriented
               provides a goal
               implies a framework for strategic planning (and, thus, a framework for
                 measurable goals, though such measurable goals would not be in the vision
                 statement)1.

              Vision statements have as their intended audience all stakeholders in the
              business, not just customers and employees. SP’s vision statement – “Running
              sustains life, locally and globally” – contains some of the qualities of an effective
              vision statement, but many are missing. It is clear, brief, abstract and, in some
              ways, challenging, and could well have some resonance with all stakeholders.
              However, it does not tell the purpose of SP, it is not future oriented, and has no
              explicit or implicit goal, and, thus, provides no direct or indirect framework for
              strategic planning. In many ways, “Running sustains life, locally and globally” is
              more like a slogan, not unlike Campbell’s Soup’s® slogan several decades ago:
              “Soup is Good Food”. That slogan was selling soup, not Campbell’s soup, and
              was eventually dropped. SP’s vision statement is similar: it is selling running, not
              entering the running community of SP, or buying shoes at SP because its
              customers get so much more than just shoes.

              The attributes of a good vision statement will vary from author to author, though
              in general most such lists share the characteristics listed above. Candidates
              should have some knowledge of precise attributes of an effective vision
              statement and refer to them, either in some form of list or embedded throughout
              their response.

              Accept any other relevant analysis.

              N.B. in the context of this question, balance means that candidates address both
              the strengths of SP’s vision statement and some of its weaknesses.

(d)   Advise the local authorities as to whether permission for SP’s “Race to the Top”
      should be refused.                                                                    [7]

      The “Race to the Top” event has both advantages and disadvantages for the
      local community, whose interests the local authorities are to serve. The main
      advantage is that it is a major local event that attracts large numbers of people,
      garners media attention, and, we can reasonably infer, promotes the local
      economy and fosters community spirit, at least among the running community.
      It is SP’s “flagship” event, thus benefitting one local business. By supporting the
      event, the local authorities would appear “business friendly,” which could attract
      other businesses to the Santa Fe area. In turn, new businesses strengthen the
      economy. A virtuous cycle of growth can be fostered.

      The negatives include the negative attention the event garners from pressure
      groups worried about the image of Native Americans and about the environment
      around Starvation Peak. Some people are more concerned about these types of
      issues than economic growth, and local authorities have a responsibility to
      everyone in the community, not just businesses. Because the event is so big,
      probably attracting local TV crews, pressure groups probably stage protests
      onsite and get media attention. Given that more and more people are focused on
      sustainability, the fact that the “Race to the Top” event does some damage to the
      local environment may cast local authorities in a bad light if they support the
      event.

      There is no “correct” answer to this question. Candidates may be for or against
      “Race to the Top”. What matters is the degree to which they support their
      position, provide a balanced argument, use business concepts and vocabulary,
      and have a conclusion with sustained judgments.

      Accept any relevant answer.


      If the response is a one-sided relevant approach with no discussion, award a
      maximum of [4]. One-sided means that the candidates only recommends that
      the “Race to the Top” event should be stopped with no discussion of what
      benefits SP derives from it OR is only in favour of the event with no discussion of
      the disadvantages and negatives of hosting the event. To earn a mark in the top
      markbands [5, 6, or 7], a candidate must have a balanced response with a
      supported conclusion.

4.   (a)   Identify one opportunity and one constraint for companies caused by
           demographic change.                                                                  [2]

           Possible opportunities include:
            To replace workers. Some companies, in countries with ageing populations
             might otherwise have great difficulty finding replacement employees, who can
             be recruited from countries with more young people.
            To lower costs of salaries or wages by replacing older workers with younger
             workers (who in many contexts will have lower salaries than retiring
             employees).
            To have “new blood,” as younger employees with new innovative ideas join
             companies.
            To diversify the workforce, which leads to greater creativity.
            Homogenous workforces experience lesser misunderstanding and conflict in the
             workplace.

           Possible constraints include:
            Cost of recruiting workers from other countries.
            The lack of experience of younger workers recruited from countries with large
             numbers of young people.
            Loss of experience, depth of knowledge, and wisdom about the company.
            Though homogenous workforces experience lesser misunderstanding and
             conflict in the workplace, such workplaces are less creative and innovative.

           N.B. though the content of the question suggests an opportunity and constraint
           with respect to human resources, candidates may approach the question
           differently. Doing so is fine as long as the response is relevant and makes
           sense. For example, because of an ageing population, an opportunity may exist
           if the company revises its marketing mix and starts to target an older population.

           Accept any other relevant opportunity or constraint.


           Mark as 1+1. Award a maximum of [2].

(b)   Comment on one potential communication problem for a company with a diverse
      international workforce.                                                            [2]

      Communication problems for a company can exist at a number of levels due to a
      diverse international workforce and include:
       Differing levels of competence in the language of the business (English in an
         English or American company, French in a French company, Japanese in a
         Japanese company, etc). A problem here is when one employee cannot
         decode a basic verbal message, whether written or spoken, or cannot
         communicate sufficiently well in the company’s language of business to
         provide precision and subtlety.
       Different cultural meanings even when the words have been properly
         decoded. In some cultures, to say “The meeting starts at 2:00pm” means it
         starts at exactly 2:00pm. In other cultures, the same message means around
         2:00pm.
       Different meanings attached to various types of non-verbal communication
         (hand gestures, bowing, hand-shaking, etc). In a diverse workforce, someone
         can make a hand signal and, without intending to, give offense at someone
         from another culture where such a gesture has negative connotations.
       Companies that engage in international recruitment are probably
         multinationals, and communication could have problems due to the mechanics
         of international communication: time zones, reliance on different telephone
         companies and internet providers, etc.

      Accept any other relevant communication problem.

      N.B. remember that the question is about communication, not agreement or
      decision-making. A response such as “a diverse workforce may have difficulty
      agreeing because of different values / backgrounds / cultures” is not addressing
      the issue of communication per se, which is what the question requires.


      Award [1] for identification of a communication problem and [1] for some relevant
      commentary thereon. Award a maximum of [2].

(c)   Explain the statement “difficulties in meeting operational objectives of recruitment
      prevent many companies from meeting their strategic objectives”.                          [4]

      Organizations have tiers of objectives: strategic objectives are long-term and the
      fate of companies usually depends on wise strategies. Below strategic objectives
      are tactical (medium-term) and operational (short-term). Even though operational
      objectives are of less gravitas than strategic – and typically are made by middle
      and lower managers of a company – failure to meet them can weaken a
      business’s performance significantly. In the case of the stimulus, “difficulties in
      meeting operational objectives of recruitment, prevent many companies from
      meeting their strategic objectives” means that some companies have a strong
      long-term vision in terms of their marketing mix and their ability to bring it properly
      to the market provided that they can recruit and retain the right quality and
      quantity of workers and employees. In some cases, companies with an
      otherwise very sound vision cannot find the right employees which compromises
      the business’s ability to meet their long-term (strategic) objectives.


      Award [1] if the candidate shows an understanding of strategic objectives and [1]
      if the candidate shows some understanding of tactical and/or operational

      precise explanation of the statement in the question. Award a maximum of [4].

(d)   Analyse one strategy that a global company could adopt for developing future
      human resources (you may refer to a global company that you have studied).            [5]

      The major options for developing a plan for future human resources include those
      listed below.
       Analysing current employees supply (skill and number).
       Analyse number and skills of locally available labour (in the different local
          contexts where the company operates).
       Forecasting demand for employees based upon:
          o estimates of mid and senior managers (the number of employees that will
             be needed)
          o estimates of labour turnover
          o past experiences
          o the skills that will be needed
          o worker productivity.
       Developing a program for internal recruitment.
       Developing training programs.
       Developing a program for external recruitment:
          o local
          o national
          o international.

      Accept other relevant options.

      Candidates should discuss at least one of the options above in some depth or
      discuss two in lesser depth. To receive more than [3], candidates must show
      balance. In this context, balance means the strengths and limitations of the
      approach adopted.

      Though, in practice, most global companies are going to rely on some
      combination of all of the approaches, some companies try very hard to be known
      in the market for certain types of human resources.
       For most of its history NationsBank (now Bank of America) was famous for
          recruiting internally for mid-level and senior positions. As a result, many
          talented people wanted to work there because they knew they would have
          opportunities to be promoted, gain more responsibility, and make more
          money. A drawback to this approach is that sometimes promoted employees
          could not perform in their new roles, whereas an externally recruited senior
          person might have fared better.
       Qatar Airways very consciously recruits externally and globally. The airline is
          trying to be a global company, and wants its employees to be from around the
          world. A drawback to this approach is that it is expensive, many problems of
          language and communication can occur, and diverse workforces sometimes
          can have conflicts based upon cultural differences.
       Very large companies with huge workforces, like ExxonMobil, Walmart, and
          large auto manufacturers often forecast demand for future employees using all
          of the techniques noted above. Because they have such huge numbers of
          employees, statistical modelling and quantitative analysis can work with a high
          degree of reliability. However, no company can know the future, and all of the
          methods used for forecasting future employees can fail because of changes in
          the company’s fortunes, unexpected political factors, and changing
          technologies.

(e)   Discuss the significance of changes in international labour mobility.              [7]

      The significance of changes in international labour mobility include:
       More workers/people are able to find work that matches their skill set and
        ability.
       More companies are able to fill positions with appropriate personnel.
       Managers and shareholders may welcome immigrant workers, who fill crucial
        voids.
       People may resent immigrants taking jobs.
       Young emigrants moving for work lose contact with their home cultures.
       Many rural areas are losing young people who move to cities in search of
        work.
       Workplaces and cities are becoming diverse, which fosters creativity.
       Diversity increases the likelihood of cultural conflict.
       Emigrant workers often find economic opportunity.
       Emigrant workers are often separated from their families and often lack
        political rights in the country to which the move.

      Accept other relevant implications of changes in labour mobility.


      A [7] response would consider at least two positive outcomes of changes in
      labour mobility and two negative or challenging outcomes of changes in labour
      mobility and have a conclusion or judgment. If less than two positives or less
      than two negatives, award a maximum of [5]. If the candidate discusses two or
      more positive outcomes of changes in labour mobility and two or more negative
      or challenging outcomes of changes in labour mobility, but does not have a
      conclusion or judgment, award a maximum of [4].

      Marks should be allocated according to the markbands on page 4.

5.   (a)   Define the term product portfolio.                                                        [2]

           Product portfolio refers to the variety or range of products/services or the
           particular mix of products/services offered by a business. Businesses usually
           have a variety of products in order to spread risks or attract more target markets.


           Candidates are not expected to word their definition exactly as above.

           Award [1] for a basic definition that conveys partial knowledge and
           understanding.

           Award [2] for a full, clear definition that conveys knowledge and understanding
           similar to the answer above.

           For only a relevant: example or application to the stimulus award [1].

     (b)   (i)   Draw and label all elements of the Ansoff matrix.                                   [2]

                 The Ansoff matrix is a tool used to identify possible growth strategies,
                 according to the product (is it existing or new?) and the market (is it existing
                 or new?). It is represented as follows:

                                                             Product
                                                 Existing                  New
                                    Existing




                                                 Market                  Product
                                               penetration             development
                           Market




                                                 Market
                                    New




                                                                       Diversification
                                               development




                 Award [1] if the candidate produces something indicating some idea of
                 what the Ansoff matrix is but with one or more error. Award a maximum of
                 [2] for a correctly drawn and labelled Ansoff matrix.
                                              – 22 –              M15/3/BUSMT/SP2/ENG/TZ0/XX/M


      (ii)   Explain one advantage and one disadvantage for Coca-Cola in India of
             using the Ansoff matrix as a decision-making tool.                               [4]

             Advantages of using the Ansoff matrix include:
              provides an analytical framework for making strategic marketing
               decisions.
              highlights the various degrees of risk associated with strategic direction
               of marketing.
              once a quadrant of the matrix is identified, it points to marketing tactics
               that can be used.

             Disadvantages of using the Ansoff matrix include:
              like all analytical tools, it is only a tool and may be misused.
              it tends to simplify a complex problem, sometimes too much.
              It cannot predict actual events and, thus, can be misleading.

             Accept any other relevant advantage/disadvantage with an explanation.

             N.B. something conceptually equivalent to the own figure rule (OFR) has to
             be used here if the candidate gets 5(b)(i) wrong by drawing the wrong
             decision-making tool but then, in 5(b)(ii) accurately or partially explains an
             advantage or disadvantage of the tool the candidate has used.


             Mark as 2+2.

             Award [1] for identification of an advantage/disadvantage and an additional
             [1] for its explanation. If no reference is made to Coca-Cola in India, award
             a maximum of [2].

(c)   With reference to Coca-Cola, analyse the role played by multinational companies
      in the global business environment.                                                     [5]

      The role of multinational companies (MNCs) in the global business environment
      is mainly seen in terms of economic activity. They contribute to economic
      development as they invest in countries around the world (eg when Coca Cola
      entered India, it brought capital (a factor of production) into the Indian economy).
      Through outsourcing, they create employment (eg Apple’s outsourcing to China
      brings employment to millions in China). However the role of MNCs is also
      criticized as they contribute to the standardization of products (eg Johnson &
      Johnson sells the same soaps and baby shampoo all around the world) and are
      sometimes accused of unethical practices (eg “sweatshops” factories in Vietnam
      manufacturing goods for companies such as Nike).

      Accept any relevant analysis.


      If the response is generic, award a maximum of [3].

      Marks should be allocated according to the markbands on page 3.

(d)   Discuss the costs and benefits to Coca-Cola India of e-commerce.                       [7]

      Some of the benefits that e-commerce may bring to Coca-Cola India include the
      following:
       A reach to a wider customer base, making more sales possible (eg party
          orders) since an online order is taken and home delivery made.
       Comfort and convenience building brand loyalty, exploring the benefits of
          shopping through mobile and internet networks is widely growing across the
          globe.
       If e-commerce is to be added to an already functioning organization of such a
          high scale, the cost of buying the technology is usually not very high.
       Transaction costs are relatively low.
       There is no issue with customers being put off by the intangibility of buying this
          product over the net, since this merchandise does not require sensory
          perceptions or experience during the purchase process, and customers
          already know what to expect.
       Accept any other relevant benefit.

      However, some of the costs to Coca-Cola India include:
       Security issues – consumers have many concerns over privacy and security
        when dealing with online businesses, credit/debit card numbers may be
        stolen; personal information may be hacked.
       Costs of setting up the technology and systems.
       Coca-Cola India will have to set up distribution channels assuring deliveries at
        all hours, often there may be lean periods where orders are less compared to
        weekends and festive periods.
       Some hostility may develop among Coca-Cola India and retailers and
        supermarkets as they may fear losing larger orders to the online store run by
        Coca-Cola India.
       Accept any other relevant cost.

      Accept any relevant discussion.


      To achieve the top markband, both the costs and benefits need to be discussed.
      If the response is one-sided, award a maximum of [4].
