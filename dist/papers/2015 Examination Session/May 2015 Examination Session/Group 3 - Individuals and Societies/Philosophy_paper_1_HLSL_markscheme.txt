How to use the Diploma Philosophy markscheme

The assessment criteria constitute the formal tool for marking examination scripts, and in these
assessment criteria examiners can see the skills being assessed in the examinations. The
markschemes are designed to assist examiners in possible routes taken by candidates in terms of the
content of their answers when demonstrating their skills of doing philosophy through their responses.
The points listed are not compulsory points, and not necessarily the best possible points. They are a
framework to help examiners contextualize the requirements of the question, and to facilitate the
application of marks according to the criteria listed on pages 5–8 for the Core Theme and pages 12–15
for the Optional Themes.

It is important that examiners understand that the main idea of the course is to promote doing
philosophy, and this involves activity and engagement throughout a two-year programme, as opposed to
emphasizing the chance to display knowledge in a terminal set of examination papers. Even in the
examinations, responses should not be assessed on how much candidates know as much as how they
are able to use their knowledge in support of an argument, using the skills listed in the assessment
criteria published in the subject guide, reflecting an engagement in philosophical activity throughout the
course. As a tool intended to help examiners in assessing scripts, the following points should be kept in
mind when using a markscheme as an examiner:

 The IB Philosophy programme is designed to encourage the skills of doing philosophy in the students.
  These skills can be accessed through reading the assessment criteria in the subject guide
 The markscheme does not intend to outline a model/correct/good answer
 The markscheme has an introductory paragraph which contextualizes the emphasis of the question
  being asked
 The bullet points below the paragraph are suggested possible points of development that should not
  be considered a prescriptive list where necessarily all (or even some) should appear in the answer
 The names of philosophers and references to their work associated with the question help to give a
  context for the examiners and do not reflect a requirement that such philosophers and references
  should appear in an answer: they are possible lines of development with the emphasis being on how
  the material is used in support of the candidate’s answer and not whether it appears in the answer
 Candidates can legitimately select from a wide range of ideas, arguments and concepts in service of
  the question they are answering, and it is possible that candidates will use material effectively that is
  not mentioned in the markscheme
 In Paper 1, examiners must be aware that a variety of types of answers and approaches, as well as a
  freedom to choose a variety of themes, is expected. Thus, examiners should not penalize different
  styles of answers or different selections of content when candidates develop their response to the
  questions. The markscheme should not imply that a uniform response is expected
 In markschemes for the Core Theme questions in Paper 1 (Section A) the bullet points suggest
  possible routes of response to the stimulus, but it is critical for examiners to understand that the
  selection of the philosophical issue raised in the stimulus, and the two contrasting philosophical
  approaches that can be explored in light of the issue identified, are entirely at the choice of the
  candidate so it is possible for material to gain credit from the examiner even if none of the material
  features in the markscheme.

A reminder of candidate requirements for Paper 1 (Core Theme and Optional Themes):

Examiners are reminded that in the examination paper it states that candidates are expected to
demonstrate the following skills. Since these skills are encouraged within the assessment criteria,
examiners should take them into account in their marking:
 argue in an organized way using clear, precise language, which is appropriate to philosophy
 demonstrate knowledge and understanding of appropriate philosophical issues
 analyse, develop and critically evaluate relevant ideas and arguments
 present appropriate examples providing support for their overall argument
 identify and analyse counter-arguments
 provide relevant supporting material, illustrations and/or examples
 offer a clear and philosophically relevant personal response to the examination question.

In the examination paper candidates are required to:

Write a response (of approximately 800 words) in which they:
 identify a central philosophical concept or philosophical issue in the passage or photograph that
  addresses the question, “what is a human being?”
 investigate two different philosophical approaches to the philosophical concept or philosophical issue
  they identified
 explain and evaluate the philosophical concept or philosophical issue they identified.

Candidates at both Higher Level and Standard Level answer one question on the Core Theme (Section
A).
Candidates at Higher Level answer two questions on the Optional Themes (Section B), each based on a
different Optional Theme.
Candidates at Standard Level answer one question on the Optional Themes (Section B).

                                              Section A

Core Theme: What is a human being?

1.   Passage from World Without Faith

     This question offers the possibility of exploring two different philosophical approaches to the
     concept or issue identified, and of explaining and evaluating those philosophical concepts or
     issues. The key issue is understanding the human condition through a consideration of human
     activity, freedom and creativity in relation to work. Responses might explain and evaluate the
     issues of work and its value; the interchange between work and leisure. There are ideas of a
     hierarchy of work, and/or a hierarchy or class division in society which might result from
     occupation. Philosophical approaches which might be developed and contrasted could focus on
     Marxist interpretation of the role of labour and class divisions in a society or the dominance of work
     at the expense of other human activities. Other approaches might develop an existentialist view of
     the need for purpose and meaning through one’s role in work. Views about the differing
     perspective and value of activity in a rural, more natural environment compared to that of urban
     industrialized environments could result in an investigation into Thoreau’s view of what could be
     worthwhile activity in life. In addressing these philosophical issues candidates might explore:

        The difference between work and labour in understanding the human condition
        Whether freedom depends on the necessity of work
        Whether there should be a balance between work and leisure
        Whether there is a difference in worth attributed to agrarian work compared to manufacturing
         work
        The notion of work as a human end or telos
        Whether humans have a right to work or even be forced by the state to work
        The condition of unemployment in relation to human identity, humanity, the sense of
         belonging, and participation in society in trying to find meaning in life
        Whether work can provide fulfillment or purpose in life
        Whether work dehumanizes or alienates.

2.   Photograph of “identical” twins

     This question offers the possibility of exploring two different philosophical approaches to the
     concept or issue identified, and of explaining and evaluating those philosophical concepts or
     issues. Responses might explain and evaluate the issues of identity, and consider what makes
     us different. The idea of uniqueness, individuality and selfhood might also arise. Issues relating
     to being the same on the surface but different, in a deeper internal sense, open possible
     discussion about the role that body and mind have in making us who and what we are. Another
     possible discussion might look at the persistence of the self over time (eg, Locke and Hume).
     Philosophical approaches which might be developed could hinge on theories of identity, theories
     of the self and more particularly with regards to the image, the role of the observer and “the other”
     in their understanding of the self and our interaction with the world. Responses could also
     investigate whether we desire to be the same, or whether we might strive to be different in an
     increasingly commercial and consumer-driven world. Some responses might move in the
     direction of research into the phenomena of twins and the balance between nature and nurture in
     formulating “us”. Non-Western perspectives on understanding the self, and sameness could also
     be developed. In addressing these philosophical issues candidates might explore:

      The concept of identity – physical, personal, character
      Whether it is possible to be different and yet look the same. What happens when other people
       behave towards you as if you were identical, even if “inside” you feel you are not the same?
      What might entail being different?
      How personal identity is established
      What is meant when people are described as “the same”?
      The interplay between genetic structures and upbringing
      The issues and associated morals of cloning
      The role of perception in interpreting our world
      The role of “the other” in forming our personality.

     How well does the candidate develop and evaluate ideas and arguments?
     To what extent does the candidate express a relevant personal response?

      Achievement Descriptor
         Level
           0      The candidate has not reached level 1.
          1–2     The candidate develops ideas and arguments in a basic way with little or no
                  evaluation of them.
          3–4     The candidate develops some ideas and arguments but the development is
                  simple, or is asserted without support or reference. There may be some basic
                  evaluation of the ideas and arguments but it is not developed.
          5–6     The candidate develops ideas and arguments in a satisfactory way and
                  evaluates them to some extent. There is some evidence of a relevant personal
                  response.
          7–8     The candidate develops ideas and arguments from a consistently held
                  perspective. Evaluation of the ideas and arguments is effective. There is good
                  evidence of a relevant personal response.
         9–10     The candidate develops ideas and arguments from a consistently held and well
                  justified perspective. Evaluation of the ideas and arguments is compelling or
                  subtle, and convincing. There is strong evidence of a relevant personal
                  response.

Optional Theme 1: Grounds of epistemology

3.   Evaluate the claim that a belief is only justified if it is part of a coherent system of beliefs.

     This question offers an opportunity to explore the issue of coherentism and the idea that one
     belief has to be part of a wider system of beliefs. It is closely related to meta-beliefs and the
     question of how a belief can fit into a wider held system through both consistency and coherency.
     It might be necessary to show the difference between the logical consistencies involved in part of
     a system of belief. “Doxastic presumption” might be explained as to how there is an assumption
     that all basic beliefs are correct. A contrast might be made between the “internalist” approach
     whereby the justification for belief is subjective and the “externalist” approach which would
     involve a reflection upon our thinking process and some dependence on method to justify the
     belief. The shortcomings of coherentism might be explored and the claim challenged by
     explanations of the isolationists’ objection, the problem of relevance to the real world and
     reliability issues of sources either empirical or otherwise. A counter-claim by reverting to a
     foundationalist approach could be made. In addressing these philosophical issues candidates
     might explore:

        Whether a “web of beliefs” is really necessary to justify a belief
        Knowledge as “justified true belief”
        Whether it is necessary or even possible to know all beliefs
        How far is internal reflection possible and productive?
        Whether there are objective measures to arrive at coherency
        Is the method of acquisition or investigation sufficient justification for belief?
        What other justifications for belief might be applied?
        Coherentism and infinite regress.

4.   Evaluate the claim that we derive all knowledge from experience.

     This question opens up a critical investigation of how knowledge is gained. A critique of empirical
     knowledge acquisition might be developed. The weaknesses of dependence on sense-data
     information might be explored and a skeptical perspective could be developed. Contrasts might
     be made with other possible sources of knowledge as seen from a rationalist perspective.
     Differences between a posteriori and a priori knowledge could be explained. The difference
     between belief, opinion and knowledge might also be explained. A discussion about certainty
     might be pursued and questioned given the possible level of subjectivity involved in interpreting
     experience. Innate ideas and their role might be explored; Platonic Forms and “deep grammar”
     constructs may be discussed. Irrational sources of knowledge might also be presented as a
     counter-position, eg, intuition, faith, mysticism. In addressing these philosophical issues
     candidates might explore:

      How might our knowledge constructs be different from actual physical objects?
      The “veil of perception”
      If knowledge is gained by experience then how do we order and categorize this knowledge? Is
       there some innate structuring? Scheme versus content
      Illusion and distortion of sense-data and the interpretation of the data
      Issues related to solipsism
      Is there a hierarchy of value attributed to knowledge based on how it is derived?
      Can there be objective knowledge or is all knowledge subjective?
      Whether knowledge of sense-data is incorrigible because it is arrived at by direct acquaintance.

Optional Theme 2: Theories and problems of ethics

5.   Explain and discuss how we might justify the criteria which ethical principles should
     satisfy.

     The question asks for an explanation and discussion on the foundational justifications of ethical
     principles. Moral principles have frequently been put in terms of what is required by duty. It is
     often argued that we need to make use of moral principles in order to satisfy the normative
     requirement of responsible moral action. This requirement implies that our decisions about how
     to live are not arbitrary, but justified or based on principles in an intuitive sense. Accordingly, an
     adequate moral theory must articulate and defend moral principles. Many of the ethical positions
     support the requirement of principles; amongst the many examples, Kant holds that the
     fundamental principle of morality is the Categorical Imperative, being one of his different
     formulations: “Act only on that maxim by which you can at the same time will that it should
     become a universal law.” In general, within traditional deontology the principles stipulate:
     constraints (not to kill innocent people), duties of special relationship (duties of friendship or
     family), and options (the good we are morally required to bring about). Criteria which serve as a
     justification of ethical principles might include explanatory power and epistemological usefulness.
     This might be analysed in an intuitive way and presented within the variety of conceptual ethical
     frames. Since ethical principles rule moral action, it is also legitimate to discuss the basis of
     moral action. In addressing these philosophical issues candidates might explore:

        Whether moral principles exist, be they universal or relative to a particular situation or culture
        Whether there are fundamental moral principles that apply in every situation
        Particularism as the denial that there are true moral principles
        The notion that some philosophers have sought to understand morality as itself constituted by
         a single principle, such as not to lie
        Situation ethicists suggest that circumstances can lead to the abandonment of all moral
         principles, except love
        Rule consequentialism, according to which an act is morally required if and only if it is required
         by the code of rules
        The Golden Rule and deontological systems
        Moral principles can be understood to rest on moral values, and debate continues about how
         to characterize these values
        Principles concerning particular ways of living or acting, eg, a good life, a virtuous life, and
         concerning a possible “telos” or end for humans.

6.   “Personal autonomy forms the basis of a general right to act on one’s own judgment.”
     Discuss and evaluate.

     The question asks for a discussion and evaluation concerning the central ethical notion of personal
     autonomy. The interest in self-governance sits alongside other issues concerning the self, its
     moral nature and its ethical relation to others. In contemporary ethical theory, autonomy plays both
     a foundational and a normative role, as illustrated by Kant’s ethical theory. The capacity for
     autonomy is so central to agency that respect for persons is plausibly construed as respect for the
     exercise of this capacity. The autonomy of a person is the basis of a general right to act on one’s
     own judgment of what one has most reason to do, from which one can derive more specific
     principles, such as duties not to impede a person’s freedom, duties to refrain from coercion,
     manipulation, or paternalistic interference, as well as positive duties to support autonomy.
     Autonomy-centred theories value the opportunity to guide one’s actions by one’s exercise of the
     capacity for critical reflection, which is significantly more complex than simply acting on one’s own
     desires. While autonomy is more major in the Kantian and social contract traditions, it does also
     play a role in utilitarian theories. From this point of view one might argue that the exercise of
     judgment, choice and responsibility, and the development of individuality are essential to individual
     fulfillment. This conception of happiness permits an argument on utilitarian grounds against state
     paternalism and for a set of civil liberties that allow individuals to exercise autonomy. In this way,
     institutionalized liberties protecting individual autonomy will promote general happiness. In
     addressing these philosophical issues candidates might explore:

      Autonomy has been centrally characterized by sovereignty over oneself, self-governance or
       self-determination: an agent is autonomous if it is self-governing or self-determining. The
       ancient Greeks applied the term to city-states. In the modern period, the concept was extended
       to persons, in particular by Kant
      According to Kant, moral principles, which limit how we may act, originate in the exercise of
       reason. They are thus laws that we give to ourselves; rational agents are bound only to self-
       given laws
      Basic senses of autonomy: a) self-governance or self-determination: it requires some control
       over the desires and values that move one to action. Thus, autonomy means the capacity to
       critically assess one’s basic desires and values, and to act on those that one endorses on
       reflection; b) as a right, for example as the right to act on one’s own judgment about matters
       affecting one’s life, without interference by others
      Preference utilitarianism
      Autonomy might be related to discussions and issues such as: determinism and indeterminism,
       free will, self-deception
      The personal ideal or virtue of autonomy would be the set of character traits associated with the
       complete development of human capacity viewed as a component of a fulfilling life
      Whether the emphasis on autonomy ignores or fails to leave room for other important values,
       such as the value of ties and attachments to others, loyalty to groups, respect for tradition, or
       the value of community
      The relation of the moral concept of autonomy with its political correspondences, eg, social
       contract theories conceived of human beings by attributing to them an original sovereignty over
       themselves. The social contract theorists regarded individuals by nature as free, equal and
       independent, with authority to regulate their own conduct.

Optional Theme 3: Philosophy of religion

7.   Evaluate the claims about experience in arguments for the existence of God, or the gods.

     This question involves an exploration of one of the most common arguments for the existence of
     God, namely the experience of the individual, even though the individual may claim that
     experiences can be shared in a public setting (eg one of worship). Some responses will reflect an
     awareness of William James’s seminal work, The Varieties of Religious Experience, but it is not
     expected that this work should be referred to – though many of the issues James raises may be
     relevant in a sustained response. Experience might provide an inductive argument for the
     existence of God or the gods, but, even if the experience occurs in a public space, the experience
     remains an essentially private thing that individuals might find hard to communicate with others.
     Even if a personal experience is accepted by those considering the claim by the individual, it may
     be contested that the individual is mistaken as to the origin or true cause of the experience, so the
     interpretation put on the significance and content of the experience is philosophically relevant. In
     addressing these philosophical issues candidates might explore:

      Experience treated as empirical evidence for the existence of God, or the gods involving
       inductive argumentation and divine existence
      The problem of verification of personal experience
      Wittgenstein’s view of language as public and fundamental in shaping what seems like
       individual, private experience
      Ineffability and mystical experience of the divine, and the noetic quality of religious experience
      Numinosity (characterization of something sacred or supernatural) and experience
      I–it; I–Thou relationships
      Prayer and miracles as conveying possible religious experience
      The general debate about faith and reason, cf, fideism, which insists that faith can have no
       appeal to a rational basis, alternative empirical explanations – psychological projection, cultural
       causation.

8.   Discuss and evaluate the anthropocentric (human-centred) basis of language used when
     talking about the concept of God, or the gods.

     This question explores the formation of conceptions people have of the divine, especially those
     where the divine being is personified and possesses or uses faculties recognizable in the human
     experience. This will involve some discussion of the basis and use of religious language, how it is
     derived, verified or applied. The meaningfulness of the ideas that are discussed may also be
     considered, with regards to how different thinkers attempt to test the meaningfulness of ideas of
     the divine. In addressing these philosophical issues candidates might explore:

        Conceptions of the divine and their possible origins and authority
        The role of scripture and its relation to reason
        The via negativa
        Aquinas and his work on religious language and the role he gives to reason; the analogies of
         proportion and attribution; God as source of all language and meaningful understanding
        Ramsey and his work on “models” and “qualifiers”
        Modern approaches to religious language; eg, Tillich and symbolic language, McQuarrie and
         existential approaches to religious language
        The “anthropic principle” as a route to proof of divine existence
        The self in different traditions and how it adapts to or rejects modern physical and psycho-
         material explanations of the self
        Counters to the personification of the divine, eg, process theodicy
        Non-personal traditions in non-Western thought.

Optional Theme 4: Philosophy of art

9.   Evaluate the role of imagination in an aesthetic understanding of an object.

     This question invites an engagement with the question of aesthetic definition and the broader
     question of the existence or “mode of being” of a work of art. One common view is that an
     aesthetic object is distinct from a physical work of art; the relationship between the physical object
     and experiences of a cognitive agent is the source for the genesis of an aesthetic object’s mode of
     being. A common argument is that, after the initial experience, a work of art persists in the active
     imagination of the viewer or the artist. This, it is argued, creates two different objects: the actual
     work of art, and the one that persists in the mind of the viewer. Some argue further that without the
     persistence of the “right” sort of attitude, then the aesthetic object ceases to be, though the
     physical object persists. This line of argument can end in a type of aesthetic idealism where the
     mental becomes “more real” than the physical. One argument against views such as these is that
     it conflates the object of the experience with the experience itself. The work of art is more than just
     “experience”; it is the artist using and interacting with materials; works of art have a provenance, a
     narrative separate from the viewer and the immediate experience of the object. It also ignores the
     public nature of the experience of art; it reduces it to a private experience. In addressing these
     philosophical issues candidates might explore:

      What authority, if any, does the artist have in defining the response and meaning of her or his
       work?
      What constitutes an experience of a work of art? Is it limited to the subjective, or is there a
       collective, and arguably, objective or universal character to the experience?
      Do different mediums of art have a different ontological status, eg, music can be played by a
       variety of musicians across different times, but a painting cannot be reproduced in this way. Is it
       wrong to place all art into the one ontological category?
      Is the expression “a work of art”, an expression on which many different concepts hang?

10.   Evaluate the claim that all judgments of beauty depend on non-aesthetic features.

      This question asks for a discussion on the topic of beauty and where the sources of making such
      judgments lie, and this could lead into a discussion about aesthetic truth and error. Non-aesthetic
      dependence is an intuitively attractive position. Our own experience suggests that beauty is not
      solitary; beauty is not just the “canvas” or musical score, nor is it just the “experience” in the mind
      of the artist or viewer, but a fine web of interrelated events and objects that are non-aesthetic. The
      relation between the aesthetic and non-aesthetic here is one of supervenience. Other views are
      often varieties of the Kantian argument that aesthetic judgments are judgments of taste that are
      subjective and universal; subjective in the sense that they are based on pleasure, and universal in
      that they ask for agreement from others in a way that is different to expressing an individual
      preference, such as a dislike of liquorice. The pleasure of beauty is unlike other pleasures rooted
      in desire; the pleasure from beauty is disinterested. One difficulty with this line of argument is in
      the insistence of some sort of universality for the assent of others in making a claim of beauty.
      Mind-independent views often use the claim that thinking something is beautiful does not
      necessarily make it so. We are able to revise some of our earlier aesthetic judgments, which
      means we can be in a state of error regarding judgments of beauty. In addressing these
      philosophical issues candidates might explore:

       If the non-aesthetic properties of a work of art change, does that mean its aesthetic quality
        changes? Is the reverse position also true?
       In what manner are aesthetic judgments dependent on non-aesthetic features?
       Is it possible to separate aesthetic and non-aesthetic features when making an aesthetic
        judgment? At a simple level, all components of an aesthetic judgment are based on non-
        aesthetic features
       The use of scientific and/or mathematical language in describing beauty, eg, the golden ratio of
        the Greeks and the symmetrical understanding of the Renaissance
       Does it make sense to speak of error and truth, even in a highly qualified sense, when
        characterizing aesthetic judgments?

Optional Theme 5: Political philosophy

11.   Explain and discuss the differences between positive and negative liberty and their impact
      on individuals and society.

      This question focuses on a traditional key point of political philosophy. It offers the possibility of
      analysing the concept of liberty and the historical models that developed different ways to conceive
      liberty. Montesquieu and Hobbes might be mentioned as references to a negative view of liberty,
      that is a liberty connected to the possibilities of individual and personal action within law (silentium
      legis), or the room given to individuals by laws (where laws end, negative liberty begins); while
      Rousseau or Kant might be analysed as closer to a positive view of liberty, that is the liberty to
      participate politically, to join the civil life as a citizen and not only as an individual: Rousseau’s
      concept of volonté générale (the general will) could be helpful (citizens are the co-authors of laws,
      so by obeying laws, they obey themselves – this is the greatest liberty in Rousseau’s view).
      Moreover, positive freedom is connected to the idea of an individual being enabled to do things, to
      flourish and develop capabilities. This has a practical side and impact in terms of social
      arrangements to enable this, like access to resources, opportunities, education, healthcare, basic
      amenities, and the right to work. Politically, positive freedom is associated with communitarian and
      socialist ideas. The historical perspective might refer to the ancient Greek democracy right up to
      the present social and political issues, such as the relation between liberty and individual rights.
      Benjamin Constant might be an important synthesis of both ways to conceive liberty, referring to
      his dichotomy liberty of Ancients compared with that of Moderns. Constant’s work offers a precise
      and interesting analysis of the two concepts of liberty: the liberty of Ancients refers to Greek
      democracy, to the participation of citizens in the political life in any manner up to the concept of
      volonté générale (the general will) defined by Rousseau; the liberty of Moderns refers to the
      expression “freedom from/freedom to”, being connected to the individual and personal liberty given
      by laws. Mill’s treatment might be used as an example of positive liberty. The presentation of
      different claims might be structured as the expression of counter-claims and critical views. The
      question also gives the opportunity to investigate the consequences that different views of liberty
      have on the relation between individuals and society, possibly focusing on the concepts of
      autonomy, will, power, law, obedience. In addressing these philosophical issues candidates might
      explore:

       Are positive and negative liberty connected to value judgments?
       What other connections to or differences between Ancients and Moderns might be found
        regarding liberty?
       Is there a possible connection to democracy?
       Is negative liberty linked to pluralism?
       Is the present struggle for individual rights involved in any manner?

12.   With reference to the social contract theories you have studied, explain and discuss the
      role played by one or more of their key element/s, for example, fear, liberty, safety, property
      and so on.

      This question calls for an investigation of the different theories of contractarianism, the analogies
      and the differences, critical views and counter-claims. Also, it calls for the analysis of the reasons
      that give origin to the different theories and mark their structures and aims. Reference to Hobbes,
      Spinoza, Locke, Rousseau, and Kant are the core of the analysis. Expression of the differences
      between the different theories should be the basic structure of the argument. The argument could
      focus on those philosophers who describe the state of nature as benign (ie, Locke or Rousseau) or
      analyse the normative theory that should produce a certain type of political and social body (ie,
      Hobbes or Kant). Recourse to Marsilius of Padua’s theory on peace might be a significant
      argument. Connection to the concepts of liberty, equality, rights, law, and to the different forms of
      government (monarchy, democracy, republic) might be an important path of analysis. In
      addressing these philosophical issues candidates might explore:

         How do fear and safety influence the perception of society?
         How is the state of nature connected to peace keeping?
         What is the role played by private property?
         Is safety connected to internal and/or external issues (foreign policy)?
         Whether there is a connection between modern democracy and contractarianism
         What is the meaning of utility with the social contract theory?

Optional Theme 6: Non-Western traditions and perspectives

13.   Evaluate the role of the self in the ethical imperatives and attitudes of one or more of the
      non-Western traditions and perspectives you have studied.

      This question can be observed both from an individual ethical perspective and from looking at the
      principles which govern the behaviour and attitudes of groups and the interactions of individuals,
      from units like families to larger social groupings. An important consideration is the view that the
      tradition under discussion has of the self in terms of life following physical death, and how this will
      influence ethical considerations. In some traditions there is of course a concept of non-self which
      is just as relevant to this title as any other perspective which understands the existence of a
      separate self. In addressing these philosophical issues candidates might explore:

         The notion of self in different traditions
         Non-self or anatta in Buddhism and consequent implications for ethical thought
         The notion of karma in Eastern traditions
         The continuity of identity after death in other traditions and the basis of the afterlife deriving from
          the life that is lived by the self on Earth
         Dualism of material and mental/soul teachings in different traditions; non-dualism
         Animist traditions and their ethical implications
         Self-extinction and ethical considerations
         The self in the context of others
         The view of the self in relation to non-human life and non-animate objects or systems
         The self in different traditions and how it adapts to or rejects modern physical and psycho-
          material explanations of the self.

14.   With reference to one or more of the non-Western traditions you have studied, evaluate the
      pressure on the traditions brought by life in “the modern age”.

      This question addresses the part of the syllabus that explores the adaptation and co-existence of
      different traditions with modern society and culture. This may involve philosophical speculation
      about preserving authority and purity of teaching in a world where communication with those of
      different perspectives is much easier, and populations are more transient. This may involve
      discussion of the kinds of pressures faced within a tradition by political, economic, social or cultural
      pressures. Thus the question may involve a discussion of pluralism in relation to different
      traditions and perspectives, or specific issues arising in the modern world for different traditions. In
      addressing these philosophical issues candidates might explore:

       The pressure of modern political movements on different traditions; in the East the
        co-existence of traditional belief with Marxist ideology or an increasing consumer materialism
        will exert pressure on traditional practice and belief
       Globalization exerts a pressure through the power and reach of modern communication
        technology both in terms of media and social network technology; widespread immigration
        causes different traditions to come into contact with each other
       To what extent is “tradition” the “Other” of modernity?
       There might be pressure to bring different perspectives under one banner (more often
        unsuccessful than not)
       Eclectic mixing of different aspects of traditions can occur where populations mix – what
        determines such mixing?
       In throwing off colonial pasts, resurgent ideologies might re-invigorate previously stagnant belief
       Growing wealth will exert an impact on the vigour and kind of belief practised in a specific
        region; inequality of wealth can also ignite belief and action
       Specific political situations might hold influence, eg, the fight for independence in Tibet, the
        relationship of the Aboriginal communities in Australia with modern politics, environmental
        activism in areas being mined for new sources of wealth
       Science and its relation to traditional belief and practice.

Optional Theme 7: Contemporary social issues

15.   Evaluate the claim that in present societies, citizenship depends on free media and open
      access to information.

      This question focuses on a central issue of modern democracies and present societies, which tend
      to merge into a global world: the meaning of citizenship, the possibilities of social and political
      participation and recruitment, and the struggle for rights are strictly connected to complete and free
      information (that is to say free communication media and wide access to them). The question
      offers the opportunity to analyse the nature of communication and information, the process of
      socialization and the models that focus on the idea that reality is a social construction. Reference
      to Chomsky, Searle, Popper, Taylor and so on might be useful to present similar views about the
      role played by media: how they affect our emotions and feelings or how they contribute to shape
      our reality or what is the connection between economic/political powers and media. Popper and
      Chomsky underline the dangerous role played by television as an educator for children. Counter-
      arguments might be based on the role played by individuals, their experience and personality, in
      contrast with neo-Marxist perspectives, such as structuralism and the Frankfurt School: that is,
      what is the role of the individual, if there is still a chance to shape different realities, to have
      personal opinions, or space for critical and public discussion? Is it still true (and if so, to what
      extent) that society determines conscience? In addressing these philosophical issues candidates
      might explore:

         Whether media is important for our value judgments
         Whether reality is a social construction
         The role of social media in information exchange
         The connection between receiving information and acting upon it
         What is the relation between free information and privacy?
         Are there not any limits to the right to inform?
         Is it still possible to describe censorship and propaganda?

16.   “Toleration is not the opposite of intolerance, but the counterfeit of it. Both are
      despotisms.” Discuss and evaluate this claim with reference to a multicultural
      environment.

      This question focuses on the relation between toleration, intolerance, and respect in modern social
      contexts. It also calls for an evaluation of the arguments connected to cultural, religious, or political
      differences. The topic faces up to the multi-cultural and pluralistic issues, through a historical view
      or an analysis of the present day. Reference to the philosophers such as Locke, Hume, Kant, etc
      might be useful, just like the recourse to religions. Locke, Hume, and Kant gave great importance
      to tolerance on the basis of a possible civil coexistence supported by peace, individual rights (to life
      and property) and safety (protection from internal or external enemies). The importance of
      education and democracy as free circulation of ideas might be underlined, with reference to Dewey
      or Chomsky. Another key point might be the ontological analysis of the difference between
      toleration and respect and its moral consequences: is Kant’s idea of non contemnere (do not harm
      or damage others, also known as the Golden Rule) enough for respect, or does respect involve a
      direct effort to listen to the others and spend our time to try to understand them? Reference might
      be made to Mill’s Harm Principle. In addressing these philosophical issues candidates might
      explore:

         Does toleration suffice for what respect is meant to be?
         How can toleration be seen as a “counterfeit” of intolerance?
         What has toleration got to do with social conventions?
         Whether democracy is the best solution to intolerance
         Whether religions are the only causes of intolerance
         How might education be connected to democracy and respect?

Optional Theme 8: People, nations and cultures

17.   “The vis inertiae (power of inertia) of habit is tremendous, and when it is reinforced by a
      philosophy which also is embodied in institutions, it is so great.” Discuss and evaluate this
      claim with reference to the role played by tradition in societies.

      This question calls for a deep analysis of tradition and its relation with societies. The concept of
      tradition refers to culture in a wide sense, so references to religions or science might be useful.
      The question also calls for a discussion about the relation between tradition and innovation, with
      reference to scientific and medical progress, facing up to bioethical or technological issues, such
      as therapeutic futility or overtreatment, pollution, responsibility for future generations, and so on.
      Another point might be the analysis of the relation between tradition and innovation with respect to
      the concepts of individual liberty, creativity, and imagination. References might be wide, going
      from Ockham to the Enlightenment, up to the most recent theories expressed by Searle, Dawkins,
      and Popper. Counter-arguments might be based on the dangers of scientism and a critical view of
      technology as independent from social utility. In addressing these philosophical issues candidates
      might explore:

         Whether tradition and innovation are necessarily opposites
         Should science and technology be limited somehow?
         What is the contribution of creativity and free and critical thought to the concept of progress?
         Does tradition concern religions only?
         Is there any relation between tradition and evolutionary processes?

18.   Evaluate the claim that all peoples have the right to self-determination and to express their
      identities in a multicultural and multi-ethnic world.

      This question arises out of several issues, which are central in modern societies. First of all, it calls
      for an analysis of the relation between majorities and minorities, with reference to languages,
      ethnic, religious, or political groups. Another key point might be the discussion about the claim that
      all peoples have the right to self-determination and the conflicts that can emerge within a nation or
      between minorities and majorities. Examples of historical claims of that right might be presented
      and discussed, with reference to autonomist political movements, such as ETA, IRA, etc, or
      nationalist upheaval such as, ex-Yugoslavia, Chechnya, Crimea etc. The legitimate or illegitimate
      use of violence and terror might be another argument. Reference to political Augustinianism (the
      idea that religious institutions, such as the Catholic Church, could operate through military power or
      be served by a foreign army in order to defend their doctrines) or Kant’s “perpetual peace” (ie, the
      “Preliminary Articles” on the independence of states, interferences of other nations, the cessation
      of standing armies, and so on) and the like might be useful. Finally, the analysis of the “tools” used
      to express an identity might be interesting, eg, specific idioms or new languages, alphabet, cultural
      heritage, and so on. In addressing these philosophical issues candidates might explore:

         Do all peoples have the right to self-determination?
         If self-determination is a right, what kind of a right is it and how is it derived and provided?
         Is language a common way for a people to express its identity?
         Are violence, terror, and insurrections acceptable?
         Are peaceful protests efficacious?
         Should a nation fight against independence movements in order to save its integrity or survival?
         Can peoples express their identities without recourse to the right to self-determination?
