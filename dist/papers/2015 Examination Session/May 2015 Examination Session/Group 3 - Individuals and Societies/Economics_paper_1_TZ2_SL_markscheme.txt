Microeconomics

1.   (a)     Explain the view that an increase in price will lead to an increase in the
             quantity supplied whilst an increase in supply will lead to a decrease in price.        [10]

             Answers may include:
              definition of supply
              diagrams to illustrate the difference between a movement along the supply
               curve and a shift in supply
              theory to explain that a movement along the supply curve is caused by
               price changes only and a shift is caused by changes in non-price
               determinants, such as a fall in wages
              examples where price and non-price determinants are, or have been,
               changed.

(b)   To what extent are subsidies the most effective way of encouraging the
      consumption of merit goods?                                                        [15]

       definition of subsidies and merit goods

       synthesis or evaluation (to what extent).

      Consideration of the merits, or otherwise, may include: the use of subsidies is

      government of merit goods.

      terms of:
       guaranteeing farmers a price above the equilibrium that raises their
         revenues
       the cost to the government of intervention buying of surpluses
       the higher prices paid by consumers for agricultural products

            explanation of how research and development in new technology will
             improve the quality of physical capital, hence increasing productive
             capacity and shifting the LRAS to the right. Explanation of how increased
             government expenditure in infrastructure will increase productive capacity
             and shift the LRAS to the right
            examples of research and development and infrastructure.

(b)   Evaluate the effectiveness of interventionist supply-side policies to achieve
      economic growth.                                                                  [15]

      Answers may include:
       definition of interventionist supply-side policies and economic growth
       diagram to show the impact of interventionist supply-side policies on
        economic growth
       explanation of the interventionist supply-side policies that could be used to
        increase the rate of economic growth through:
        - education and training
        - research and development
        - infrastructure
        - industrial policy
       examples of the application of interventionist supply-side policies
       synthesis or evaluation.

      Evaluation may include: the use of interventionist supply-side policies used to
      increase economic growth including:
       cost and effectiveness of the interventionist supply-side policies
       time it takes for the policy to increase economic growth
       implications for different stakeholders
       suggestion of alternatives to interventionist supply-side policies.

      Examiners should be aware that candidates may take a different approach
      which, if appropriate, should be rewarded.

      Opinions or conclusions should be presented clearly and should be supported
      by appropriate examples.
