     Big Data is a commonly used term with no single accepted definition. Most definitions are
     linked to the analysis of very large data sets, which do not use the traditional relational
     database model, by organizations to provide a competitive advantage.

     Overview

     In Mexico, over 300 independent family-owned supermarkets across the country have recently
 5   decided to create an association of local supermarkets called the Asociación de Supermercados
     Independientes (ASI). This was proposed so they could use economies of scale when
     purchasing goods to compete with the larger more established supermarket chains,
     who currently receive better prices from suppliers. Currently each family-owned supermarket is
     responsible for the purchasing of stock for their own store. The ASI management has chosen to
10   have its Head Office in Mexico City.

     Since they are local community stores many supermarkets in the ASI have become involved
     with community organizations such as schools and sports clubs. Based on customers’
     suggestions, the supermarkets often donate a small percentage of their sales revenue to these
     community organizations. They believe it is important to be an integral and socially responsible
15   part of the community they serve.

     The managers of the supermarkets do not feel they have a systematic way of analysing data
     from customer purchases, which may be reducing possible profits and their competitiveness
     with large supermarket chain stores in the area.




                                                                                            Turn over

     Current IT system

     Currently, each store operates its own independent information system that manages
20   the sales, finance and stock data on a local area network. Various types of EPOS
     (Electronic Point of Sale) and stock control systems are used by the different stores in these
     information systems. To order stock from the suppliers a variety of methods are used, such as
     email, online ordering, phone calls and faxes.

     The changing situation

     The ASI Loyalty Card scheme
25   The management of the ASI realized that customers like to feel that they are being rewarded
     either altruistically, by giving to good causes, or financially, through price discounts.
     The introduction of a loyalty card scheme was seen as a mechanism to facilitate the rewarding
     of customers.

     About five years ago the large supermarket chains developed loyalty card schemes that offer
30   points based on the value of the goods purchased, which are recorded at the checkout.
     The ASI Loyalty Card will reward customers with 1 point for each 10 peso purchase. The points
     can be redeemed for a variety of goods and services such as discounts, gifts, travel vouchers
     and donations to a charity, where 5 points is equivalent to 1 peso.

     Customers can register at any ASI supermarket by filling in a written form with personal details,
35   and are given a card soon after with the customer name and Loyalty ID number (also recorded
     as a barcode so it can be scanned quickly). This data in the customer database will eventually
     lead to an online profile being created which will also contain details of purchases along with
     other information such as time of purchase and store location. Customers will be able to access
     their profile and purchasing record on the ASI website.

40   Whenever a customer in a supermarket taking part in the ASI Loyalty Card scheme makes a
     purchase, their loyalty card barcode is scanned like a normal product barcode. After payment
     they receive a receipt. In some cases the receipts may not show the full name of the item,
     only the amount paid for it. However, the loyalty card ID number, the product code (the name is
     not needed) of the item, plus additional data, such as the price, store ID number, and time and
45   date of purchase, are put into the store database without the customer being aware of it.
     This data is eventually transferred to the ASI data warehouse and is included in the profile of
     the customer.

     Proposed system

     Manuel Arriagada, a member of the senior management team of ASI, realized that in
     aggregating data from many stores there was an opportunity to find out more about customers
50   and their purchasing patterns. Manuel, while working in the United States, had heard of how
     businesses had been improved by implementing “Big Data” analysis techniques on the data that
     their business was collecting from the stores and customers.

     ASI will use SUSA Analytics, a company that Manuel has worked with previously, to provide
     advice and expertise to support local stores with the analysis of the data. He will liaise with
55   Lorena Florentes from SUSA Analytics throughout the process.

     ASI will gather large amounts of data about customer behaviour and product purchases through
     the use of a loyalty card scheme. This can be used for deeper analysis of their business
     activities. ASI will use the data collected for targeted advertising, marketing to customers who
     show various behavioural traits and to identify valuable customers.

60   Stock management
     Decisions on what to stock, and when, are based on current sales patterns and the stock control
     database. As a result of discussions at their monthly meetings the managers of the individual
     stores have concluded that the current systems are inadequate for the following reasons:
     • there has been an increase in customer complaints that certain goods are not available
65   • managers have noticed that the shelves are either empty or overstocked, and in this case
        has to sell the goods at a reduced price.

     The store managers have recognized that this lack of efficiency in stock management is
     reducing their ability to make profits and compete with the large supermarket chains.

     As a result, the management of the ASI, after further discussions with store managers, is in the
70   process of setting up stock distribution centres in the various regions. The operations of the
     centres will rely on the information provided by SUSA Analytics and ASI Head Office in
     Mexico City. This means that stock can be bought in bulk from local and international suppliers
     at a competitive price to that of the larger supermarket chains. Each distribution centre will use
     a Just-in-Time (JIT) process to ensure that the volume of stock being held in storage both in the
75   distribution centre and in the individual supermarkets is as low as possible.

  The data from the individual supermarkets may be in a variety of formats.

  This data is assimilated into a relational database at the ASI head office.

  The data in the SUSA Analytics data warehouse is in a different format to that sent from
  the head office.
  Extract, Transform, Load (ETL) is taking place in the ASI head office and again at the
  SUSA Analytics data warehouse.

      Challenges faced

      Analysing Big Data
      • SUSA Analytics will provide reports based on the data provided by customers in ASI stores.
        This will allow ASI to create comprehensive customer profiles and to introduce targeted
        marketing.
 80   • Strategic data analysis using data mining techniques will be used to discover patterns
        to inform future decisions and planning. This will include: clustering/pattern analysis,
        forecasting, hypothesis testing and targeted marketing. The data collected will be used for
        analysing current customer purchasing patterns and predicting future customer purchasing
        patterns to allow the supermarkets to create medium- and long-term forecasts for staffing
 85     requirements and marketing strategies.
      • Operational reporting and analysis includes exception reporting, querying of the store
        database to produce regular and customized reports, real-time display of sales and inventory,
        and data visualization of sales and trends. Data is collected to assist managers in making
        short-term decisions about appropriate stock levels, numbers of staff for a particular time/day,
 90     number of checkout lanes required and opening times.
      • Data analysts have expressed concerns about the homogeneity of such large data sets and
        the ability of data analysis techniques to determine information that is specific to individual
        stores. For example, the findings from the analysis of the Big Data may provide suggested
        pricing levels for products for all of the stores in the ASI, but pricing of individual products
 95     may need to vary from to store to store.
      • The opening hours of the store and the shift details of staff, as well as their wages,
        will also be collected and included in the analyses. Recommendations can be made to store
        managers about managing the store and the staff.

      Communicating the data analytics approach
100   • Manuel is concerned that with such a large amount of technical language, he will not be able
        to explain the way the proposed system would function. Lorena Florentes from
        SUSA Analytics has been asked to outline how the system would work to senior managers of
        ASI and to individual store managers (see diagram on page 7). Lorena’s ability to explain the
        technical language in a form that is understandable by the audience is a major advantage.
105   • As well as the technical details Lorena will demonstrate and explain the benefits of the
        analytical techniques identified above, which the individual store managers and
        ASI managers in the Head Office will be trained to use.

      Ethical and social impacts
      • With respect to customers involved in the loyalty card scheme, ASI is unsure to what extent
110     customers should be aware of how much information is being collected about them,
        the purpose for which it will be used, and with whom it will be shared.
      • ASI is concerned that customer involvement in the loyalty card system may have implications
        for their privacy, security and anonymity.
      • ASI must develop policies for the ethical use of customer and corporate data.
115   • ASI is keen to ensure customer details held in the database can be anonymized when used.
      • The implications of using the data collected about customer behaviour for targeted
        advertising to and preferential treatment for individual customers need to be investigated.

      Implementation issues
      • ASI management are concerned and stress that according to data privacy laws there must
120     be appropriate access controls to protect customer and store data when accessed from the
        database system. This is because the data will be accessible in real-time via a
        web-browser/smartphone dashboard app by managers; and by customers through the loyalty
        card scheme website and smartphones.
      • Manuel, in consultation with Lorena, will develop a detailed timeline for implementation of the
125     new system.
