1.   (a)     Explain how changes in price work to reallocate resources in a market.               [10]

             Answers may include:
              definition of reallocation of resources
              diagrams to show how changes in price alter the equilibrium quantity and
               therefore reallocate resources
              theory to explain the signalling and incentive functions of the price
               mechanism
              examples of markets where price change has led to a reallocation of
               resources, such as through government intervention.

(b)   Oligopolists often possess too much monopoly power. Evaluate whether
      governments should intervene in oligopolistic markets.                           [15]

      Answers may include:
       definition of monopoly power, oligopoly or oligopolistic market
       diagram to show equilibrium under conditions of oligopoly, either collusive
        or non-collusive
       theory to explain higher prices, lower output, and productive and allocative
        inefficiency due to monopoly power. An explanation of the actions a
        government might engage in to control such power such as competition
        policy, price control, regulation, nationalization and trade liberalization
       example of industries that might illustrate such characteristics and of
        policies a government may have employed
       synthesis or evaluation.

      Evaluation may include: consideration of the merits of intervention such as
      difficulties of identifying where such power may be excessive and whether
      intervention is justified over free markets, etc. Examples may be given of
      industries where despite economic inefficiency the consumer benefits from
      inherent economies of scale and therefore there is no need for government
      intervention.

             economy is producing at the full employment level of output
            examples of unemployment that could be considered illustrative of the
             natural rate.

(b)   Evaluate the effectiveness of interventionist supply-side policies to achieve
      economic growth.                                                                  [15]

      Answers may include:
       definition of interventionist supply-side policies and economic growth
       diagram to show the impact of interventionist supply-side policies on
        economic growth
       explanation of the interventionist supply-side policies that could be used to
        increase the rate of economic growth through:
        - education and training
        - research and development
        - infrastructure
        - industrial policy
       examples of the application of interventionist supply-side policies
       synthesis or evaluation.

      Evaluation may include: the use of interventionist supply-side policies used to
      increase economic growth including:
       cost and effectiveness of the interventionist supply-side policies
       time it takes for the policy to increase economic growth
       implications for different stakeholders
       suggestion of alternatives to interventionist supply-side policies.

      Examiners should be aware that candidates may take a different approach
      which, if appropriate, should be rewarded.

      Opinions or conclusions should be presented clearly and should be supported
      by appropriate examples.
