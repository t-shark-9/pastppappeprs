These sources and questions relate to China under Deng Xiaoping (Teng Hsiao-p’ing): economic policies
and the Four Modernizations.

Source A                Deng Xiaoping, then vice-premier of the People’s Republic of China, in a speech
                        to Chinese Communist Party officials (30 March 1979).

What is our main task at present and for a fairly long time to come? To put it briefly, it is to carry out the
modernization programme. The destiny of our country and people depends on its success. It will be
precisely by succeeding in the Four Modernizations that we will be adhering to Marxism and holding high
the great banner of Mao Zedong (Mao Tse-tung) Thought …

At the present time, socialist modernization is of supreme political importance for us, because it
represents the most fundamental interest of our people. Today every member of the Communist
Party and the Communist Youth League and every patriotic citizen must devote all his energies to the
modernization drive. To achieve the Four Modernizations and make China a powerful socialist country
before the end of this century will be a gigantic task.


Source B                Patricia Buckley Ebrey, a professor of East Asian Studies and History, writing in
                        the academic history book The Cambridge Illustrated History of China (2010).

To fight poverty in the countryside, Deng approved the gradual removal of collective agriculture. Each
household contracted with its production team to provide specified crops in exchange for use of
particular fields; whatever the household produced, above what it owed the team, was its to keep or sell.
Agricultural production rose significantly, and with it rural incomes. Even though farmers often
complained that collective resources were not allocated fairly, overall they benefitted … Rural local
governments encouraged other enterprises as well, ranging from fish farming and equipment repair to
mini-factories producing toys for export. These absorbed 100 million rural labourers in the 1980s.
In cities, the private sector was revived, freeing people to open restaurants, beauty parlours, and other
small businesses … To speed up industrial development, Deng began to encourage foreign investors …
The course of economic progress was not always smooth. Economic crimes such as smuggling,
fraud and forgery proved difficult to suppress. Inflation was a recurrent problem.

Source C                Ezra F Vogel, a retired professor of social sciences, former director of the East
                        Asian Research Center and chairman of the Council for East Asian Studies at
                        Harvard University, writing in the academic history book Deng Xiaoping and the
                        Transformation of China (2011).

In 1978 and 1979, an estimated 6.5 million youth returned to urban areas from the countryside. So just
as Deng had used the danger of starvation to permit peasants to “find their own solution” he used the
danger of increasing crime among urban youth to convince other leaders to let them form individual
household enterprises … Household enterprises increased: stalls sprang up in towns and cities
offering haircuts; repairs of shoes, knives and bicycle tires; drinks or prepared foods; and handicrafts or
manufactured goods … The revival of urban services, like the revival of household agriculture, proved
enormously popular, both to those who now had a way to earn a living and to the consumers who now
had access to services and products.


Source D                Patrick Tyler, a journalist, writing an obituary for Deng Xiaoping in the
                        New York Times (20 February 1997).

Farmers began raising fish, shrimp and fruit for new markets that sprang up in every township.
Private and collective enterprises multiplied as former peasants began manufacturing toys, fireworks,
bricks, clothing – all manner of everyday items. The agricultural changes were easily accomplished and
the farmers, by any previous standard, were getting rich.

In industrial reforms, Deng started creating Special Economic Zones (SEZs) in China’s coastal
provinces, where tax benefits attracted foreign manufacturers … The SEZs started an export explosion
with China dominating the world market in toys, shoes and textiles. The SEZs multiplied [but they only
increased wealth on the coast and in major inland cities].

Along with the wealth came problems. Child labour and sweatshops appeared as parents sent their
children to work, not to school. Unsafe factories became firetraps where thousands died in accidents or
fires. Criminal gangs, prostitution and the sale of women into slavery spread from rural to urban areas …

When inflation got out of control in mid-1988, panic buying of food added to the unrest that sent
hundreds of thousands of workers into the streets in support of democracy, but also to protest corruption
and mismanagement.

1.       (a)       Why, according to Source A, were the Four Modernizations so important?                                                                                      [3]

         (b)       What is the message conveyed by Source E?                                                                                                                   [2]


2.       Compare and contrast the views expressed in Sources B and D about the ways in which
         Deng Xiaoping’s economic reforms had an impact on the Chinese people.                                                                                                 [6]


3.       With reference to their origin and purpose, assess the value and limitations of Source C and
         Source E for historians studying Deng Xiaoping’s modernization programme.                                                                                             [6]



4.       “Deng Xiaoping’s economic policies up to 1989 were successful, but progress was not
         always smooth.” Using the sources and your own knowledge, to what extent do you agree
         with this statement?                                                                                                                                                  [8]
