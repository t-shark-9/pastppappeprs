             Theme: Student cyber-bullying using social networking sites

IT system: using computer-based technologies and social networks

     According to a recent poll, more than 10 % of parents surveyed around the world said their child
     had been cyber-bullied and nearly 25 % knew a child who had been a victim. The most widely
     reported method of online cyber-bullying is by using social networking sites, such as Facebook.

     Results from the poll indicated that 32 % of parents in India had said that their child had
 5   experienced cyber-bullying, followed by 20 % in Brazil, 18 % in Canada and Saudi Arabia, and 15 %
     in the United States.

     Billye, in Utah, USA and Olivia, in Wales, UK are two teenagers that have been victims of
     cyber-bullying through Ask.fm. Ask.fm is a social networking site that is popular with teenagers.
     The site allows an account holder to send anonymous questions from a cell phone (mobile phone)
10   or laptop to another account holder. Once a response is received, the exchange of messages
     is posted publicly for anyone to read. Both Billye and Olivia received a constant stream of nasty
     messages through the site, and felt that they would not survive this cyber-bullying. Cyber-bullying
     victims suffer from a range of stress-related health problems, including anxiety and depression.
     In the case of Billye and Olivia, they were able to take control of the situation and overcome the
15   cyber-bullying. In instances where the cyber-bullies anonymously post in school, school security
     systems can be used to identify the cyber-bullies.

     People who cyber-bully are able to terrorize their victims 24/7 by using cell phone apps* to post
     directly to social networking sites. The postings can include a range of personal information,
     photos, or videos intended to hurt or embarrass the victim. The anonymous nature of these
20   websites may also lead bullies to behave even more aggressively than they would in real life.

     There is considerable evidence that cyber-bullying is a worldwide concern. However children
     and students often feel helpless when they are trapped in a cyber-bullying situation. Parents are
     uncertain about how to help their child if they are being bullied via their cell phone services and
     social networking sites. In some locations, parents of the children who are doing the cyber-bullying
25   may be held accountable for the actions of their children.

     Teachers and school administrators are often uncertain about what their role and responsibility is
     regarding cyber-bullying that occurs both inside and outside of the school premises. They are also
     concerned about how cyber-bullying disrupts the school’s positive learning environment and are
     uncertain about what action they should take. Often it is unclear if laws apply in some instances
30   of cyber-bullying. In other situations new laws have been passed quickly and may be difficult to
     enforce. However social networking sites do not want to lose their advertisers and customers.
     They often make claims on their websites that they are addressing issues related to cyber-bullying.
