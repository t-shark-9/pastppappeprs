Answer three questions. Each question is worth [20 marks].

1.   BodyGuardian

     The BodyGuardian is a lightweight, wearable and wireless body sensor. This technology allows
     patients to remain active and independent while their health is being monitored with a simple
     sensor that is in contact with their skin.

                                         Figure 1: The BodyGuardian device

     The BodyGuardian system consists of the BodyGuardian device and a smartphone with the
     BodyGuardian app* installed. The smartphone connects to the cloud-based service mHealth using
     a 3G cell/mobile phone network.

     Doctors are able to access their patient’s data via mHealth using a mobile device. They can also
     set different limits for each patient, allowing for personalized alerts.



* app: application software, typically a small, specialized program downloaded onto
  mobile devices; apps can also run on the internet, on a computer, on a cell/mobile
  phone or other electronic device.

(Question 1 continued)

     (a)   (i)   Identify two health indicators that could be measured by the BodyGuardian               [2]
                 device.

		(ii)           Identify four steps taken by the software to decide if a health indicator
                 measurement needs to be sent to a doctor for a decision.                                [4]

     (b)   The managers of mHealth are investigating the nature of passwords used by doctors to
           access patient information. The two options being investigated are:
           • the doctor creates a password that does not need to be changed
           • the mHealth system requires doctors to create a strong password that must be
             changed every 40 days.

           Analyse these two options.                                                                    [6]

     (c)   As part of the development of the BodyGuardian device, it is being tested in clinical
           trials by doctors and patients.

           Discuss the implications for doctors and patients of trialling the BodyGuardian device
           before it is sold publicly.                                                                   [8]

2.   3D printing

     Buttercup is a duck who hatched with a deformed left foot that had to be amputated. His owner
     took pictures of another duck’s foot from different angles and was able to use 3D printer technology
     to produce a new plastic foot for him.

     A 3D printer, like the one shown in Figure 4 creates an object by adding plastic layer by layer until
     it is complete.

     Inspired by Buttercup’s story, Alejandro Toys has created a company that uses a computer with a
     3D printer and software to produce plastic toys for children.

     Alejandro Toys has found out that some software will allow them to input 2D images into the 3D
     printer software so that they can be converted into a 3D object. They are considering either to use
     open source software or to purchase proprietary software.


     (a)   (i)   Identify two ways that a 2D image file can be input into the 3D printer software.      [2]

		(ii)           Identify four of the steps required to produce Buttercup’s replacement foot.           [4]

     (b)   Analyse Alejandro Toys’s decision to either use open source software or to purchase
           proprietary software to produce the company’s 3D toys.                                       [6]

     (c)   It is now possible to use a 3D printer to print a large range of products in addition
           to toys. These include guns, bicycles and human prosthetic limbs. However some
           governments are concerned about the software for 3D printers being freely available on
           the internet.

           To what extent should governments regulate the access to software for 3D printers?           [8]

3.       Small town book shop moves to computer-based records

         El Hoyo is a small village in the south of Argentina. The local book shop has recently received
         a number of academic books from a large university in Buenos Aires. The university also sent a
         computer which has all of the books listed in a spreadsheet.

         The table in Figure 5 shows a small part of the list of books. The complete table has 400 different
         entries (last entry is in row 401).

         Daniela, the shop manager, has been waiting for a computer for a long time. She knows that, with
         this computer, her staff will provide a faster service when they are searching for specific books.

(Question 3 continued)

     (a)   (i)   Daniela needs to see the books in alphabetical order, with the “Subject area”
                 sorted from A to Z and then the “Number of books” sorted from largest to
                 smallest.

                 State the author that would appear in the first row of the sorted spreadsheet
                 using only the books shown in Figure 5.                                               [1]

		(ii)           State the formula that would be required to add up the cost of all the books in the
                 book store.                                                                           [1]

		(iii)          Daniela now thinks that she should have installed a database for the information
                 about the books. Outline two advantages that a database would have over a
                 spreadsheet for the El Hoyo book shop.                                                [4]

     (b)   Explain three impacts that the new computer system may have for the staff at the book
           shop.                                                                                       [6]

     (c)   El Hoyo receives a large number of tourists during the summer when the fruit festival
           takes place, but suffers from periods of poor internet connectivity. Daniela has
           now created a separate area in the book shop that has several computers with free
           broadband internet access so that tourists can use them to check their emails and find
           information about the local area.

           Evaluate the impacts of this initiative for Daniela as shop manager.                        [8]

4.   Digital citizenship

     After several problematic situations with the use of technology by students and staff, a school
     decided to adopt “We are Digital Citizens” as its mission statement for the year. This goes beyond
     limiting access to some resources such as social networking sites and video streaming sites, and
     instead focuses on using technology inside and outside of school in a responsible way.

     The network administrator has also been told to allow the downloading or streaming of videos
     from the internet. However he has explained to the principal that allowing this would cause issues
     related to bandwidth, storage and appropriateness of content for high school students.

     A working party has been set up, consisting of the network administrator, teachers from different
     departments and some students. This working party will meet to plan a programme of activities for
     the next year that will be used to help teachers and students understand what digital citizenship is,
     and how to promote the responsible use of technology by everybody in the school.


     (a)   (i)   Outline one difference between streaming and downloading videos.                       [2]

		(ii)           Define the term “bandwidth”.                                                           [2]

		(iii)          The science teacher wants to show to the class a video about polar bears and
                 how they survive living near the north pole.

                 The size of this video is 3.2 gigabytes (GB) and it is available for download.
                 The teacher will download it in advance to be able to show it to the class without
                 the need for an internet connection.

                 The school has a bandwidth of 50 megabits per second (Mbps). Calculate how
                 long it will take the teacher to download the video.

                 Use 1 GB = 1000 megabyte (MB).                                                         [2]

     (b)   At the request of the principal, the network administrator has allowed teachers to
           download videos. Students are still not allowed to download videos at any time using
           the school internet.

           Analyse the impact this will have on the teachers and the students.                          [6]

     (c)   One area that the working party will focus on is the responsible use of the available
           bandwidth. Some teachers have found that the internet is too slow to allow a class to
           investigate a topic when students in different classes are using social networking sites.

           To what extent can the implementation of the digital citizenship policies ensure the

5.   Professional photography for family events

     Mrs Claudia Vega would like to become a professional photographer. She would like to focus her
     work on taking photographs at family events and is looking for a good camera to buy.

     She would like to offer three different products:
     • the printing of a selection of the photographs
     • a three-minute video posted online
     • a two-hour video, on a DVD, consisting of a sequence of photographs and videos covering the
       special moments throughout the event.

     She knows she has to have images of a high resolution to be able to offer customers good quality
     photographs as well as photograph enlargements.


     (a)   (i)   Define the term “picture resolution”.                                                  [2]

		(ii)           Identify two problems that will occur if Claudia uses photographs with a low
                 resolution.                                                                            [2]

		(iii)          Claudia stores photographs and videos on the hard disk of her computer.
                 Identify two additional locations where these files could be stored.                   [2]

     (b)   Claudia holds large amounts of personal information, photographs and videos from
           her customers. Explain three actions Claudia could take to protect the security of the
           information that she holds.                                                                  [6]

     (c)   Claudia needs to allow potential customers to see her work. She would like to be able
           to show these potential customers her best pictures and a list of former clients that they
           may contact. Some friends have suggested that she should create a website and other
           friends have suggested that she should open an account on a social networking site to
           post her work.

           Discuss these two alternatives as a way of showing her work to potential clients.            [8]
