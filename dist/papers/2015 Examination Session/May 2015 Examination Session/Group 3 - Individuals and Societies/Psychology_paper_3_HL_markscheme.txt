Marks      Level descriptor

0          The answer does not reach a standard described by the descriptors
           below.

1 to 3     There is an attempt to answer the question, but knowledge and
           understanding is limited, often inaccurate, or of marginal relevance to
           the question. The response makes no direct reference to the stimulus
           material or relies too heavily on quotations from the text.

4 to 7     The question is partially answered. Knowledge and understanding is
           accurate but limited. Either the command term is not effectively
           addressed or the response is not sufficiently explicit in answering the
           question. The response makes limited use of the stimulus material.

8 to 10    The question is answered in a focused and effective manner and meets
           the demands of the command term. The answer is supported by
           appropriate and accurate knowledge and understanding of qualitative
           research methodology. The response demonstrates a critical
           understanding of qualitative research methodology applied to the
           stimulus material.

1.   Explain two or more considerations involved before conducting the interviews in
     this study.                                                                                        [10]

     Refer to the paper 3 markbands when awarding marks.

     The command term “explain” requires candidates to give a detailed account, including
     reasons, of why the researchers did make or could have made certain considerations before
     the interviews, referring to details of the study in the stimulus material.

     Responses that use the term “experiment” as a generic term for “study” should not be
     penalized.

     Relevant considerations involved before conducting the interviews may include, but are not
     limited to:
     • Ethical considerations such as getting informed consent from participants – for example,
        before the interview, researchers must explain the aim of the research, inform participants
        about their right to withdraw, get permission to record the interview, and ensure
        participants’ anonymity (researchers must respect the rights of the participants). Since
        the topic of the interview is very personal it is also important that participants feel
        comfortable. The fact that the researcher let the participants themselves choose a place
        for the interview could contribute to this.
     • Sampling of appropriate participants. In this study a purposive sample of first-time
        expectant fathers was chosen. Since the interviews were conducted in Swedish, all first-
        time expectant fathers who could not speak Swedish were excluded from the study, and
        this was probably to make it easier for the Swedish researcher but using only Swedish
        speaking participants could limit generalization.
     • Data recording: The researcher must decide beforehand if the interview is to be recorded.
        In this study audio-recording was used (the advantages of this are that it is easier to
        conduct the interview as the researcher can concentrate on the interaction with
        participants). This is particularly important as there was only one researcher in this study.
     • Transcription: The researchers must decide how to transcribe (eg whether verbatim or
        postmodern) depending on the aim of the study (a postmodern transcript is more difficult
        to analyse so this could be a reason to choose verbatim as was done in this study).
     • The type of interview used – here a narrative interview was chosen to ensure that
        participants could tell their own story without interruption and present it as they have
        experienced it themselves.

     Candidates may explain two considerations in order to demonstrate depth of knowledge,
     or a larger number of considerations in order to demonstrate breadth of knowledge.
     Both approaches are equally acceptable.

     Candidates may explain considerations that were taken before the interviews in the actual
     study or considerations that could have been taken before the interviews. Both approaches
     are equally acceptable.

     Candidates who address considerations during and after the interview can be credited if
     these considerations are explicitly linked to considerations involved before conducting the
     interview in this study.

     Candidates who only address one consideration, or only ethical considerations, should be
     awarded up to a maximum of [5].

2.   To what extent can findings from this qualitative study be generalized?                              [10]

     Refer to the paper 3 markbands when awarding marks.

     The command term “to what extent” requires candidates to consider the merits or otherwise
     of the argument that the findings from this qualitative study can be generalized.

     Responses that use the term “experiment” as a generic term for “study” should not be
     penalized.

     Generalization is not the purpose of qualitative research as such as it rather seeks to
     describe and seek insight into specific situations like in this study but three forms of
     generalization in qualitative research that may apply under certain circumstances are:
     • Representational generalization: Findings from this study on expectant fathers could
       perhaps be applied to populations outside the study. For example, knowledge gathered in
       this study could be used to understand experiences of expectant fathers who match the
       selection criteria of this study. Since the sample is small the results cannot be statistically
       representative but if there is a clear description of the sample selection criteria (lines 5–9)
       and similar studies confirm the findings of this study (triangulation), it could be argued that
       generalization is to some extent possible. The problem is that not many studies have
       been performed so far. Another problem is that the study is conducted in Sweden where
       it is expected that parents share parenthood on equal terms – and this is not the case in
       many other countries.
     • Inferential generalization (or transferability): In principle, findings from this study could be
       transferred to similar settings (context or space), that is, to other prenatal clinics that
       include expectant fathers in the preparation for parenthood. This requires rich/thick
       descriptions. However, since this study seems to be one of the first studies to explore this
       experience from the perspective of expectant fathers, generalization could be difficult
       except in this particular context unless other research studies support the findings from
       this study (triangulation).
     • Theoretical generalization: If theoretical concepts and theory are developed based on
       rich/thick descriptions of the personal and social processes of becoming a father in this
       study, this could be used to conduct further research and by that perhaps contribute to
       further development of theory. In this study, the inductive content analysis revealed a
       number of themes (for example, all men felt that the pregnancy was “a time of transition”
       characterized by certain emotional and social changes). Such findings could contribute to
       development of theory that could be further investigated in other studies on the same
       topic.

     Candidates may discuss one form of generalization to demonstrate depth of knowledge, or
     may discuss several forms of generalization in order to demonstrate breadth of knowledge.
     Both approaches are equally acceptable as long as they are specifically linked to the study.

     Candidates may, in their discussion of generalization of findings from this qualitative study,
     briefly refer to statistical generalization (quantitative research) as part of their argument.
     This should be given credit as long as the main focus is on generalization from qualitative
     research.

     Candidates may refer to the possibility of comparing findings from one qualitative study to
     other qualitative studies without using specific terminology relating to generalization, such as
     “representational”, “inferential” and “theoretical”.

     Candidates who only discuss statistical generalization without any reference to qualitative
     research should be awarded [0].

3.   Evaluate the use of narrative interviews in this study.                                            [10]

     Refer to the paper 3 markbands when awarding marks.

     The command term “evaluate” requires candidates to make an appraisal by weighing up the
     strengths and limitations of the use of the narrative interview in this qualitative study.
     Although a discussion of both strengths and limitations is required, it does not have to be
     evenly balanced to gain high marks.

     Responses that use the term “experiment” as a generic term for “study” should not be
     penalized.

     Relevant strengths of the use of narrative interviews in the context of this study could
     include, but are not limited to:
     • The use of an opening question such as the one referred to in the stimulus material “Can
        you tell me about your own experiences of the pregnancy?” could stimulate an in-depth
        narrative about each participant’s individual experience. This approach, specific to the
        narrative interview, provides insight into how the expectant fathers construct meaning in
        their lives compared to being guided by specific questions. This means that rich data is
        collected.
     • Participants can talk freely and in their own way without being interrupted as the
        interviewer is only supposed to ask questions that actually stimulate the interviewee’s own
        narrative. This could limit the effect of participant expectations as well as researcher
        expectations.
     • The narrative interview is useful in qualitative research exploring personally sensitive
        issues like this study because it gives participants the opportunity to talk in their own
        language and develop their own story without interruption. The narrative approach thus
        enables the expectant fathers to actually reveal how and why they think and feel as they
        do, for example with reference to the stimulus material, such as “feelings of insufficiency
        and inadequacy” and "feelings of responsibility" (line 25).

     Relevant limitations of the use of narrative interviews in the context of this study could
     include, but are not limited to:
     • It is very time consuming to transcribe and analyse the huge amounts of data from
        narrative interviews. However, since there were only seven interviews the amount of
        material to transcribe and analyse may be manageable.
     • The narrative interview may go in all directions because it is mainly the participants who
        decide what to tell, so it may be that some potentially useful data is not obtained with this
        method. However, in this study the researcher was able to see a pattern in the different
        experiences (lines 23–24).
     • There may be ethical issues involved in having people talk about very personal
        experiences.

     As part of the evaluation, candidates may refer to alternative interview methods. This is
     perfectly acceptable if the main focus is on the use of the narrative interview. For example,
     candidates could argue that the researcher would probably not get a deep understanding of
     each expectant father's experience if she had used an alternative way of interviewing such
     as focus group or semi-structured interview and could give reasons for why these methods
     may not be as useful to achieve the aim of the study.

     Responses that refer to only strengths or only limitations of the narrative interview should be
     awarded up to a maximum of [5].
