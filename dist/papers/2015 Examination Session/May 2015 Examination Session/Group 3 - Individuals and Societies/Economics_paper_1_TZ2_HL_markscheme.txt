1.   (a)     Explain how changes in price work to reallocate resources in a market.               [10]

             Answers may include:
              definition of reallocation of resources
              diagrams to show how changes in price alter the equilibrium quantity and
               therefore reallocate resources
              theory to explain the signalling and incentive functions of the price
               mechanism
              examples of markets where price change has led to a reallocation of
               resources, such as through government intervention.

(b)   Evaluate the effectiveness of interventionist supply-side policies to achieve
      economic growth.                                                                  [15]

      Answers may include:
       definition of interventionist supply-side policies and economic growth
       diagram to show the impact of interventionist supply-side policies on
        economic growth
       explanation of the interventionist supply-side policies that could be used to
        increase the rate of economic growth through:
        - education and training
        - research and development
        - infrastructure
        - industrial policy
       examples of the application of interventionist supply-side policies
       synthesis or evaluation.

      Evaluation may include: the use of interventionist supply-side policies used to
      increase economic growth including:
       cost and effectiveness of the interventionist supply-side policies
       time it takes for the policy to increase economic growth
       implications for different stakeholders
       suggestion of alternatives to interventionist supply-side policies.

      Examiners should be aware that candidates may take a different approach
      which, if appropriate, should be rewarded.

      Opinions or conclusions should be presented clearly and should be supported
      by appropriate examples.
