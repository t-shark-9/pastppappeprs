Extract adapted from Parish, J. (2011), “Social suffering and anxiety: deciphering coughs and colds at
Akan anti-witchcraft shrines in Paris”, Anthropology & Medicine, 18 (3): 303–313. Reproduced with

         Abe is an Akan* shrine priest and an immigrant from Ghana. His anti-witchcraft shrine
         in a poor suburb of Paris is regarded as one of the most powerful and most popular in
         Europe in solving illnesses and misfortune and creating economic opportunities for clients.
         Through divination, the shrine diagnoses common colds suffered by recently arrived, unskilled
    5    female Ghanaian migrants as something more socially and economically evil, witchcraft.

         In treating illness and suffering, the Akan anti-witchcraft shrine is often presented as a model
         of unchanging and old-fashioned ideals. This fails to acknowledge the extensive repertoire of
         Ghanaian witchcraft discourses and contemporary divinatory practices. Successful treatment
         combines and reinvents traditional divination methods, paracetamol medicines and positive
   10    thinking in order to empower clients and present them with the possibility of new social and
         gainful employment prospects.

         Witchcraft is the most commonly found explanation for misfortune at shrines. Divination
         attempts to place illness and social suffering in its widest social, economic and political context.
         Witchcraft revolves around the nature, meaning and question of suffering in the world.

   15    Grace had recently arrived in London, United Kingdom, from Ghana to attend college, and was
         staying with relatives. She went to consult Abe in Paris because she suffered from a repeated
         sore throat and flu-like symptoms. At first, she ignored her symptoms, but became worried
         when one night she “felt a spiritual presence” in her bedroom. The next day, she thought she
         saw strange female creatures, wearing red capes and floating in the air. She recognized one as
   20    her father’s youngest sister. She felt very worried that this meant her illness could be witchcraft,
         a harmful spirit sent by a relative. She thought her relatives had grown tired of her problems
         and that she had overstayed her welcome as they now had to support her.

         The witch, said Abe, is a resentful woman who “picks and feeds upon the unhappiness
         of young women” who feel that they have let family members down by becoming an
   25    economic burden. Abe reassured Grace that through continual social participation in kinship
         and social networks, she would find permanent work and feel less isolated. As her relatives in
         her new residential location got to know and like her, she would build up her own persona and
         this would temper the animosity directed towards her by the witch who Grace now believed to
         be her aunt.

   30    Akan shrine priests have traditionally asked questions about clients’ social relationships,
         requiring answers that are confirmed through the throwing of sea shells or the killing of birds.
         These divinatory practices allow them to gather information about their clients’ backgrounds.
         Abe employs novel methods within his healing repertoire, including “road maps”, divination,
         non-prescription cold medicine, popular psychology and the power of positive thinking.
                                                       –3–                   M15/3/SOCAN/SP1/ENG/TZ0/XX

     35      Abe reserves the more complicated technique of the “road map” for recently arrived migrants.
             It enables him to help clients make sense of the new world they have entered, to create a
             “social” map as quickly as possible. On each shrine visit, he plots relatives and friends, people
             the client has met and places they visit frequently. This is because a new immigrant is heavily
             dependent on a limited kinship network for survival. The less attached a client becomes to a
     40      limited social network, the weaker the grip of the witch and the more likely there will be future
             social and economic opportunities.

             Abe told Grace that her “road map” was still not extensive enough. She complained that her
             cold symptoms were making it hard for her to get out and she had even lost work opportunities.
             On her next visit to the shrine, Abe told Grace that a witch had been caught and could no longer
     45      harm her. Grace began to feel more confident, outgoing, and eventually found regular
             employment as a healthcare assistant in London.

             Unhappy young migrant women believe that witches infect them with minor illnesses.
             Their symptoms are linked to their adjustment to life in Europe, the stresses of fulfilling their
             obligations to their social network and the pressure upon them to send money home to Ghana.

     50      A person only becomes well once they begin, with the help of the shrine priest, to forget about
             self-blame and recrimination and to successfully participate in the world again.

1.        Describe why female Ghanaian migrants may decide to consult an anti-witchcraft shrine priest.      [6]



2.        Explain why Abe’s anti-witchcraft shrine is successful in solving illness and misfortune.          [6]



3.        Compare Ghanaian immigrants’ approaches to suffering to those of one other group or
          society you have studied in detail.                                                                [8]
