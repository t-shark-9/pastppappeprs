Answer one question from this section.

1.   Creative Toys (CT)

     Creative Toys (CT) manufactures toys and markets them business-to-customers (B2C) online only.
     The business operates in a leased industrial site and relies on word-of-mouth promotion only.
     To make customers believe that CT’s toys are better than its competitors, CT sets prices
     slightly higher than the competition. Production and sales are mostly between 1 October and
     24 December. Most of the employees work on temporary contracts during this busy period.
     For the remainder of the year, CT operates well below capacity utilization.

     Table 1 contains selected data for CT, for 2014:

     Table 1
      Sales revenue         €300 000
      Number of toys sold     12 500
      Fixed costs           €121 800
      Variable cost per toy      €10

     In 2014, the management of CT considered a change of the marketing mix to include
     above the line promotion, lower prices, and an additional sales method called “toy parties”.
     Toy parties would be hosted by newly recruited CT sales representatives and attended by parents
     and their children. At the parties parents could see the toys and children could play with them.
     Sales would be made at the parties by the new sales representatives, who would be paid on a
     commission-only basis.

     Toy parties could be held throughout the year and make CT’s total sales less seasonal. Based
     on market research, management has estimated that the parents’ demand for toys is price elastic
     and is planning to set lower prices for all toys sold online and at toy parties. The management
     has prepared forecasted financial data for CT, for 2015, based upon the proposed change to the
     marketing mix, shown in Table 2 below.

     Table 2
      Cash sales revenue      €352 000
      Closing cash balance at
      year-end 2014            €37 000
      Fixed assets             €40 000
      Fixed costs             €180 000
      Raw materials           €128 000
      Sales commissions        €32 000
      Other variable costs     €32 000

     The Finance Manager will carry out a variance analysis in order to determine whether the
     proposed change to the marketing mix has been successful.

(Question 1 continued)

     (a)   Identify two possible types of above the line promotion that CT could use.              [2]

     (b)   Define the term variance analysis.                                                      [2]

     (c)   Explain two possible human resource implications for CT’s management given
           the proposed change to introduce “toy parties” as an additional sales method.           [4]

     (d)   Using information from Table 1:

           (i)    calculate the break-even level of output for CT, for 2014 (show all your
                  working);                                                                        [2]

           (ii)   construct to scale a fully labelled break-even chart for CT, for 2014.           [5]

     (e)   Using information from Table 2, prepare an annual cash-flow forecast for CT,
           for 2015.                                                                               [4]

     (f)   Analyse CT’s management plan to reduce the price of CT’s toys.                          [6]




                                                                                             Turn over

2.   Sleep Well Limited

     Sleep Well Limited is a family-run private limited company. They own a luxurious and prestigious
     hotel, Sleep Well (SW), which is located in an expensive city-centre location in New York,
     United States (US). Its customers are international travellers who expect comfort and excellent
     service and are willing to pay a high price. Capacity utilization of the hotel rooms is 95% on
     most days. However, loyal customers are frustrated that sometimes they cannot reserve a room
     because the hotel is full.

     The hotel management is considering extending the hotel with a new building with larger rooms
     and the most luxurious facilities. The prices of the larger rooms in the new building will be 50%
     higher than the rooms in the current building.

     Market research commissioned by SW highlighted the following:
     • In the short term, the economic environment in many of the home countries of SW’s customers
       will deteriorate. However, the economic environment should improve after two years.
     • The US dollar is likely to increase in value in relation to other currencies.
     • SW customers’ demand is price inelastic and is income elastic.
     • Severe shortage of qualified labour is forecasted in the service industry.

     The table below shows the Operation Manager’s planned activities for legal procedures and the
     construction of the new building.

       Activity     Order/Dependency            Duration
          A                                    4 months
          B                                    5 months
         C            Must follow A            3 months
         D            Must follow B            4 months
          E         Must follow C and D        6 months
          F           Must follow E            11 months
         G            Must follow E             3 months
          H           Must follow G             4 months
          I         Must follow F and H         2 months

     However, the Finance Manager is concerned that strict planning regulations imposed on
     construction in the city centre could create extra costs and cause delays in the completion of the
     new building. Selling shares is considered as one option for financing the project. The Marketing
     Manager is worried about the impact on the customer experience during the construction process.

(Question 2 continued)

     (a)   Identify two advantages of Sleep Well Limited being a private limited
           company.                                                                                   [2]

     (b)   Define the term capacity utilization.                                                      [2]

     (c)   Explain one advantage and one disadvantage of using the critical path
           analysis model as a project management tool, for the construction of SW’s
           new building.                                                                              [4]

     (d)   Construct a fully labelled network diagram to represent the sequence of
           activities in the table. Show the earliest starting time (EST) and the latest
           finishing time (LFT) for each activity and identify the critical path.                     [6]

     (e)   (i)     Identify any total float from the diagram constructed in part (d)
                   (no working required).                                                             [1]

		         (ii)    Using the total float you identified in part (i), calculate any free float
                   (show all your working).                                                           [2]

           (iii)   Comment on how SW could use any free float as calculated in part (ii).             [2]

     (f)   Examine the option of the construction of the new building for SW.                         [6]

                                               Section B

Answer two questions from this section.

3.   Fujifilm

     Throughout its history, Fujifilm has innovated. It invented many products such as the first
     high-speed colour photographic film and the first disposable camera. Fujifilm was one of the most
     trusted brand names in the photographic industry.

     Fujifilm adapted to changes in the external environment. Digital photography and smartphones
     were causing a significant reduction in sales of photographic film. Researchers at Fujifilm
     discovered that patented chemicals used in Fujifilm’s photographic film products are antioxidants*
     that could be used in cosmetic products. In 2007, Fujifilm invented a skincare product line and
     branded it Astalift. Fujifilm spent a large amount of money developing the new brand name and
     building awareness and loyalty. Astalift quickly became one of the best-selling brands in Japan’s
     skincare product market.

     In response to the success of Astalift, Fujifilm:
     • acquired complementary pharmaceutical companies and built research and development (R&D)
         facilities to develop additional cosmetic products under the Astalift brand
     • set up a new division that develops medical equipment based on photographic film and imaging
         technologies (such as digital X-rays) marketed under the Fujifilm brand name.

     Fujifilm understood changes in societal norms, such as lifestyle and income of women in many
     Asian and European countries. At present 20% of sales are generated outside of Japan.
     In Europe, Fujifilm adapts its marketing mix for consumer preferences in each country. Ultimately,
     Fujifilm wants to transform Astalift into a global brand.

     Today, only 1% of Fujifilm’s revenue comes from photographic film, while 99% of revenue comes
     from the sales of cosmetics and medical equipment. Now, Fujifilm has been so successful that
     other companies are trying to imitate its success on a global scale. Japan’s beverage company
     Suntory has developed its own range of natural skincare products to be marketed under its
     well-known brand name Suntory.

* antioxidants: molecules that prevent the oxidation of other molecules, which can maintain
                the health of cells; they are often used as preservatives in cosmetics

(Question 3 continued)

     (a)   Describe one internal factor and one external factor possibly affecting
           innovation at Fujifilm.                                                               [4]

     (b)   Explain one benefit of a patent for Fujifilm.                                         [2]

     (c)   Explain one benefit and one cost of research and development (R&D) for
           Fujifilm.                                                                             [4]

4.   BDM

     BDM manufactures motors used in small kitchen appliances. It operates in its original factory built
     in 1977, which is located near the centre of a large and growing city. Since 1977, property values
     have risen significantly and are forecasted to increase further. Most of BDM’s workers purchased
     their homes decades ago and live near the factory. Younger workers, however, complain that
     accommodation near the city centre costs too much for them to live nearby. Older workers are
     loyal to the company and in many cases have specialized skills.

     Recently, BDM’s sales have rapidly increased through internal growth, and the factory should
     reach full capacity within several years. BDM’s loyal customers value its unique selling proposition
     (USP): lower prices than competitors of comparable quality. Customers are small businesses
     located in the city which use BDM’s motors to help with the manufacture of inexpensive appliances
     for local markets. 5% of BDM’s sales are made through business-to-business (B2B) e-commerce.
     Sales are increasing.

     BDM is profitable. Stock turns over in 35 days and creditor accounts are settled in 30 days.
     Last year, BDM’s sales revenue was $24 000 000 and its debtor’s accounts balance was
     $2 176 000 at the end of its financial year. The industry standard of credit terms is for customers
     (debtors) to pay in 30 to 35 days. Because of the poor management of sales growth and use of
     just-in-case stock control, BDM has a liquidity problem.

     To resolve its liquidity problem, BDM is considering two options:
     • (Option 1) sell the factory and relocate to a much larger one located 27 kilometres from the city
           centre. The new factory (for BDM) would cost significantly less.
     • (Option 2) sell the factory and lease it back from the purchaser. Change to just-in-time stock
           control management and shorten the credit terms given to customers from 30 to 15 days.


     (a)     Define the term internal growth.                                                              [2]

     (b)     Identify two features of e-commerce.                                                          [2]

     (c)     Calculate the debtor days ratio (show all your working).                                      [2]

     (d)     Explain two problems, other than liquidity, for BDM, of rapid sales growth.                   [4]

     (e)     Analyse the possible impact on pricing and place in the marketing mix, if BDM
             moves from its current location (Option 1).                                                   [6]

     (f)     Discuss BDM’s Option 2 to resolve its liquidity problem.                                      [9]

5.   Chips to Go (C2G)

     Chips to Go (C2G) produce potato chips for the British market. C2G’s Chief Executive Officer
     (CEO) is Charles Chip who is a dynamic entrepreneur famous for taking risks with chip flavours
     such as “banana and sour cream” and “chocolate fudge” and promoting them with humour
     especially appealing to British culture. C2G has created a number of successful snack products
     under the C2G family brand. Charles uses intuitive rather than scientific decision-making.
     He rarely consults with senior managers or considers financial data.

     C2G’s value as a company in terms of goodwill, brand value and other intangible assets is tied very
     closely to the personality and lifestyle of Charles. He is the company’s most valuable intangible
     asset and is very popular among the younger generation. He is constantly in the news trying to
     travel around the world in a canoe, or taking risks by parachuting off high buildings to gain free
     publicity and word-of-mouth promotion. Current and potential investors have contacted the finance
     department as to what may happen to the value of these intangible assets if Charles were to have
     a serious accident.

     C2G is looking for ways to increase market share in an increasingly competitive domestic snack
     market. One long-time aim for Charles has been the creation of a potato chip with all the taste of
     regular chips but without any fat. The marketing department of C2G is very excited with this idea
     but the Production Manager has indicated to Charles that it cannot be produced. Charles has
     been told and was furious.

     A second strategic option could be to launch the potato chips into a new international market.
     One of Charles’s closest advisers has argued that C2G would need to be careful with its product
     and promotion, as overseas customers may not share British tastes in potato chips, or British
     humour in promotion. He urges Charles to take time to carry out extensive market research of the
     new international market.


     (a)   Describe two stakeholder conflicts at C2G.                                                 [4]

     (b)   Explain two reasons why it may be difficult to value C2G’s intangible assets.              [6]

     (c)   With reference to C2G, compare and contrast intuitive and scientific
           decision-making.                                                                           [6]

     (d)   Evaluate the strategic decision to launch C2G’s potato chips into a new
           international market.                                                                      [9]
