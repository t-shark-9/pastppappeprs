                                          Section A
1.   (a)   Identify two possible types of above the line promotion that CT could use.          [2]

           Two possible types of above the line promotion that CT could use include:
            paid for internet promotion on toy websites
            print (newspapers, magazines, trade journals, etc linked to the toy/games
             industry)
            advertisements during radio programmes aimed at children
            advertisements during television programmes aimed at children.

           Accept any other relevant type of above the line promotion.

           Accept the use of Facebook / Twitter as forms of mass media.

           N.B. specific application is not expected.


           Award [1] for each correct and relevant form of above the line promotion
           identified that CT could use. Award a maximum of [2].

     (b)   Define the term variance analysis.                                                  [2]

           Variance analysis refers to an analysis of differences between expected or
           budgeted outcome / amounts / figures (prices, costs, quantities, profit, revenue)
           and actual outcome / amounts. The analysis examines if the outcome is adverse
           (A) or favourable (F) and investigates why the differences occurred from the
           forecasted or budgeted amounts.


           Award [1] for the basic understanding that a variance analysis examines
           differences between actual and budgeted costs or any other figure.

           Award a maximum of [2] for a thorough definition that goes beyond just a
           subtraction of figures. The response may demonstrates understanding of the
           process / rationale for carrying out a variance analysis, for example to enable
           management decision-making / identify adverse (A), favourable (F) and the
           possible reasons why.

           N.B. it is not expected that the candidate uses the exact term of adverse (A)
           and/or favourable (F), but they should show understanding of the need of the
           analysis in order to make a decision / take corrective action etc.

(c)   Explain two possible human resource implications for CT’s management given
      the proposed change to introduce “toy parties” as an additional sales method.          [4]

      Possible implications for CT’s management given the proposed changes to
      introduce “toy parties” as an additional sales method include:
       CT will have to recruit, train, and induct sales representatives. These
          processes will take time. CT will have to develop procedures to find people
          willing to sell at the toy parties.
       CT will now have to reorganize/restructure its business as the number of
          employees will increase. Human resource planning
          monitoring/rosters/schedules may become more complex, possibly requiring
          additional supervisors/managers.
       Given the above point, CT’s management may have to review employee
          contracts. Full-time workers may be entitled by law to certain types of benefits
          (health, sick pay and pension for example) that they did not receive as
          temporary contract workers. Even if not required by law, full-time workers may
          want/need/demand these kinds of benefits. CT’s management will have to
          react.
       It can possibly lead to unhealthy competition / conflicts between existing
          employees / sales representatives and newer ones that are paid by
          commission. This can reduce efficiency and can result in a fall in motivation
          for the management to deal with. It takes time and resources to solve
          conflicts.

      Accept a fall or increase in motivation, only if a full and relevant explanation is
      given as to why it is a possible HR implication and its effect on management.

      Accept any other relevant human resource implication.


      Mark as 2+2.

      Award [1] for a relevant human resource implication of the proposed changes to
      introduce “toy parties” as an additional sales method identified and [1] for an
      explanation of this implication for CT up to a maximum of [2].

      N.B. if the explanation is generic and not applied to CT award [1] per implication.

(f)   Analyse CT’s management plan to reduce the price of CT’s toys.                            [6]

      The management of CT “has estimated that the parent’s demand for toys is price
      elastic”, which means that for every percentage change in price the quantity
      demanded for toys will increase by a larger percentage. If this assessment of
      demand is accurate, CT’s plan to lower prices will increase sales volume and
      total revenue (TR) quite significantly to make up for the fall in price per toy / unit.
      Presumably management believes that the increase in volume will make up for
      the lower gross margin.

      Profit should increase as TR will be higher and the sales representatives in the
      toy parties are to be paid on a commission-only basis anyway.

      The discovery of the market research that the customers are price elastic
      indicates that CT’s current pricing decision is inappropriate as customers do not
      really see the toys as highly differentiated / better than the competitors.
      Otherwise, one would expect the price elasticity of demand to be lower.
      Therefore, the decision to reduce the price from a marketing point of view is also
      correct.

      However, one negative impact of lowering prices is that it could change market
      perception about CT. Right now, CT charges more than its competitors with the
      intention of creating the perception that CT’s toys are better. Lowering prices
      could alter that quality perception of some of the customers who might see the
      toys as differentiated with a USP of being creative and CT could lose some of its
      existing customers.

      A lower price might mitigate the brand name of CT.

      By increasing volume, CT will have to find a new location / extra storage space,
      the former requiring more finance and the latter requiring extra costs. For much
      of the year, capacity utilization at CT is low.

      CT may have the capacity to produce and hold enough toys for the new,
      higher-sales-volume holiday months, but CT will either have to make the toys
      earlier in the year and/or have to increase capacity – requiring more space and
      possibly more manufacturing equipment, which will increase costs.

      Of course, with an increase in the scale of production, CT may be able to gain
      economies of scale, increase profit and this could possibly allow prices of its toys
      to fall further.

      Accept any other relevant analysis.


      It is not expected that the candidates covers all of the above issues.

      For one relevant issue that is one-sided, award up to [3]. For more than one
      relevant issue that is one-sided, award up to a maximum of [4].

For [5] it is expected that the analysis is relevant and detailed, but it may lack
some balance. For example, it includes only two detailed arguments for and
one detailed argument against.

For [6] it is expected that the analysis will contain at least two detailed arguments

2.   (a)   Identify two advantages of Sleep Well Limited being a private limited company.     [2]

           Two possible advantages of Sleep Well Limited being a private limited company
           could include:
            The owners, the family members, have limited liability.
            Selling shares to friends and family can raise funds for the expansion. This
             may be less costly and quicker to organize with a higher chance of being
             successful than fully subscribed share issue.
            The family members will not lose control of the business as shares are sold
             among friends and family members only, ensuring continuity of ownership.


           Award [1] for each relevant advantage correctly identified, up to a maximum
           of [2].

           N.B. it is not expected that the candidate applies to Sleep Well Limited.

     (b)   Define the term capacity utilization.                                              [2]

           Capacity utilization is the extent to which the maximum capacity of the firm is
           being used. It measure that actual output as a percentage of potential output.


           Candidates are not expected to word their definition exactly as above.

           Award [1] for a basic definition that conveys partial knowledge and
           understanding. Award [1] if only the formula is stated with no definition.

           Award [2] for a full, clear definition that conveys knowledge and understanding
           similar to the answer above. An understanding of a percentage should be
           demonstrated for full marks.

           For only a relevant example to the stimulus award [1]. However, do not award
           [1] if the candidate has only copied a sentence from the stimulus “95%” without
           showing understanding.

(c)   Explain one advantage and one disadvantage of using the critical path analysis
      model as a project management tool, for the construction of SW’s new building.          [4]

      The possible advantages of using the model for SW:
       It enables the managers of SW better planning and coordination of the
        building project, which is a relatively large project for the hotel. The model will
        enable the Operation and possibly the Finance Manger to identify linkage,
        sequential and dependent relationships between activities. Resources can be
        allocated in a better way. Costs can be saved by better resources and more
        timely allocation.
       The critical activities can be identified and resources can be prioritized and
        allocated accordingly to ensure a timely completion – an important factor in
        the whole decision-making process for the managers as severe shortage of
        qualified labour is anticipated.
       Moreover, identifying the critical activities and finding ways of cutting its
        duration can minimize the disturbances to current guests. Something that the
        Marketing Manager is worried about.
       The floats can be calculated to anticipate delays if any of the activities are
        likely to overrun given the strict planning regulations.
       Accept any other relevant advantage.

      The possible disadvantages of using the model for SW:
       The reliability of the data – especially task duration – given by the Operation
        Manager can affect the accuracy of the time taken to complete the project.
        Given the disruptions indicated in the stimulus it is important that the new
        building is completed on time. The model may not be useful if the data used is
        inaccurate.
       The managers of the new building construction might not have identified some
        activities in the construction process. This could lead to unanticipated delays
        and/or mistakes when completing the new building.
       Many unexpected internal and perhaps more relevant external
        variables/factors such as weather may affect the duration of individual tasks
        and of course the duration of the project. The new building could open much
        later than expected and this would put pressure on SW’s cash flow.
       The model ignores many qualitative issues/factors like the effect on customer
        experience and the quality of service during the construction time despite
        reassurances from the management.
       Accept any other relevant disadvantage.


      Mark as 2+2.

      Award [1] for each relevant and correct advantage / disadvantage identified.
      Award [1] for explaining the advantage / disadvantage with reference to SW up to
      a maximum of [2].

      For [1] there is some little evidence of understanding of the model and some
      attempt at construction with some ESTs and LFTs shown.

      Allow candidate own figure rule (OFR).

      For [6] the network is accurately constructed and well presented. The critical
      path is identified. A key is provided. The ESTs and LFTs are accurate.
      Deduct [1] if the key is missing.
      Deduct [1] if the critical path is not identified by either crossing the activities or
      writing the letters separately.
      Deduct [1] for each error in either construction or calculation. Allow OFR.

      N.B. any unnecessary dummy used for the construction of the network is to be
      judged as one error each.

(e)   (i)                Identify any total float from the diagram constructed in part (d) (no working
                         required).                                                                                             [1]

                         LFT of the activity – Duration – EST of the activity
                         For example: C= 9 – 3 – 4 = 2
                                       A=6–4–0=2

                         Any activity that is not on the critical path will have a float. For example,
                         activities A, C, G and H have a float.

                         N.B. working are not expected.


                         Award [1] for a correct answer (no working required).

(ii)    Using the total float you identified in part (i), calculate any free float
        (show all your working).                                                           [2]

        Free float for an activity is calculated by:

        The EST (next activity) – Duration – EST (of that activity)

        Activity H has a free float of 26  4  18  4 months

        Activity C has a free float of 9  3  4  2 months

        Activity A has a free float of 4 – 4 – 0 = 0 months

        Activity G has a float of 18  3  15  0 months

        Award a maximum of [2] for a correct answer with working shown for any
        of the activities above.

        Award only [1] if a free float is indicated at any activity that is not on the
        critical path (A, C, G and H), but no working is given.

        N.B. only apply candidate own figure rule (OFR) if calculations are
        consistent with the diagram they constructed in part (d).

(iii)   Comment on how SW could use any free float as calculated in part (ii).             [2]

        When calculating the free float SW can see how long the activity can be
        delayed before affecting the next activity. If an activity like H has a free
        float of 4 months, it means that it can be delayed by such a duration without
        affecting the start of activity I. Otherwise, a larger delay than the free float
        will affect the duration of the project as I is on the critical path.

        SW can therefore allow a slack of up to the duration of the free float and
        possible move some resources towards the critical activities if the aim is to
        reduce duration to minimize disturbances and reduce costs.

        Similarly activity C can be delayed by up to 2 months without affecting the
        start of activity E which is on the critical path and therefore the overall
        duration of the project.

        Award [1] for a brief comment, such as a response that just describes what
        a free float is and its possible effect on the next activity.

        Award [1] for application either in terms of figures / relationship between
        particular activities or to SW’s particular issues / needs.

        N.B. candidates must specifically refer to free float and not simply generic
        “float” for full marks.

        It is not expected that the candidate provides such a detailed response.

(f)   Examine the option of the construction of the new building for SW.                     [6]

      Arguments for the construction of the new building:
       An economic recovery predicted after two years also supports the proposed
        strategy as the project is estimated to be completed in 28 months. As
        consumers’ income grows with an income elasticity of demand over 1 for
        services / luxury products, SW is likely to see a significant increase in
        demand. SW will be ready with extra capacity and the most luxurious
        amenities and services to satisfy their customers’ needs. Profits are likely to
        grow and the costs of the new building can be quickly recouped.
       Moreover, the need to increase the price for the new rooms is likely to be
        tolerated by customers given their price inelastic demand. Total revenue is
        likely to increase even if SW loses some customers to cover some of the
        investment costs and the running costs.

      Arguments against the construction of the new building:
       The construction time as currently planned will last for over two years if
        everything goes to plan. SW’s managers may put up with some noise and
        difficulties for such a time period, but will existing customers?
       The strong $ might make the price of the new hotel even higher and possibly
        unaffordable for its international travellers. SW might not be able to fill the
        extra capacity built.
       The current lack of capacity during busy periods, combined with an increase in
        demand is likely to harm the reputable brand image with more customers
        turned away.
       Before the recovery a recession (deterioration in the economic environment) is
        forecasted. Although demand is price inelastic. A significant fall in customers’
        demand is likely for a luxury product given the income elasticity. Can SW
        sustain these potential losses and be able to finance the new building?
       The Finance Manager is concerned that time and money will be spent on legal
        processes to ensure building permission and or in the worst-case scenario,
        the actual building will not take place.

      N.B. it is not expected that the candidate develops a full examination of the
      issues regarding the legal status and the source of funds used.

       The severe shortage of skilled labour is likely to reduce the profitability of the
        new building, as more staff will be needed to operate the extra capacity. Staff
        training may be required for the new level of service and wages will have to
        increase given the staff shortages.

      Accept any other relevant arguments for and against.


      It is not expected that the candidate covers all of the above issues.

      For one relevant issue that is one-sided, award up to [3]. For more than one
      relevant issue that is one-sided, award up to a maximum of [4].

      For one relevant argument for and one relevant argument against award up to
      [4].

For [5] it is expected that the analysis is relevant and detailed, but it may lack
some balance. For example, it includes only two detailed arguments for and one
detailed argument against.

For [6] it is expected that the analysis will contain at least two detailed arguments
for and at least two detailed arguments against.

3.   (a)   Describe one internal factor and one external factor possibly affecting innovation
           at Fujifilm.                                                                            [4]

           Possible internal factors affecting innovation at Fujifilm:
            Availability of finance needed to spend on the process of innovation, which is
             the successful commercial use of an invention. It is said that a large amount of
             money was spent on developing new product(s).
            Technological know-how and clearly an innovative culture, which allowed this
             to be applied to the creation of new products such as high-speed, colour
             photographic film.
            Fujifilm’s management might have been encouraged by past success. Fujifilm
             pioneered many products.
            Attitude to risk, clearly Fujifilm was historically a risk taker. A company who
             spent money on inventions to bring these products to the market.

           Possible external factors affecting innovation at Fujifilm:
            The technological changes in the external environment have created new
             competitive forces/pressures. Digital photography and smart phones were
             causing a significant drop in sales of film, which was one of Fujifilm’s core
             competencies. Fujifilm had to react and innovate.
            Fujifilm understood changes in societal norms outside of its control like
             lifestyle and change in income, which allowed it to create new needs/products
             to meet changes in social trends.

           Accept any other relevant issue.


           Mark as 2+2.

           Award [1] for each relevant and correct internal / external factor identified and [1]
           for describing the factor in relation to Fujifilm, up to a maximum of [2].

           Do not credit candidates twice for describing either two possible internal or two
           external factors affecting innovation at Fujifilm.

(b)   Explain one benefit of a patent for Fujifilm.                                           [2]

      A patent is a legal right granted to an organization / a person to be the exclusive
      user of an invention for a specified period of time. Fujifilm was granted patents
      on the chemicals used in its traditional photographic film products. These are
      antioxidants that were used in the creation of new cosmetic/skincare products.

      The possible benefits of patents for Fujifilm:
       For the duration of the patent given, Fujifilm can create a USP / competitive
        advantage that can also act as a barrier to entry for other competitors.
        In this case the use of the patented antioxidants enables Fujifilm to develop
        new, and be rewarded for, an innovative cosmetic/skincare product that
        competitors legally cannot copy.
       Given the high costs and the long duration of research and development
        (R&D) when no income was generated for Fujifilm, a patent can encourage
        Fujifilm to create future products.
       The patent may allow Fujifilm to charge a premium price to recover the R&D
        costs and to have funds available for further future research.

      Accept any other relevant benefit for Fujifilm with an explanation.

      N.B. a definition of patent is not required for full marks.


      Award [1] for a relevant benefit, with an additional [1] for application to Fujifilm.
      Award a maximum of [2].

(c)   Explain one benefit and one cost of using research and development (R&D) for
      Fujifilm.                                                                               [4]

      Given the changes in the external environment mentioned in the stimulus,
      research and development (R&D) enabled Fujifilm to develop highly innovative
      and differentiated products and to have a first mover advantage in many
      segments and markets. There is evidence that Astalift, as an example became
      one of the best selling brands in Japan.

      R&D allowed Fujifilm to explore these options before bringing them to the market
      place as new innovations. Hence the risk of failure was much reduced.

      R&D would also be helpful with the appropriate decision on the marketing mix of
      the new innovations.

      Moreover, the process of granting a patent after R&D has been carried out also
      involves costs for the organization. The granting of a patent can possibly enable
      Fujifilm to charge a premium price that is likely to satisfy the shareholders if they
      are concerned about increasing costs of R&D.

      However, the process of R&D, as well as ensuring a patent for Fujifilm and other
      pharmaceutical or high technology industries is particularly expensive and time
      consuming. Without granting a patent, these costs may not be recouped.

      Apart from the direct costs of R&D we must also note the opportunity costs to
      Fujifilm. Research in itself is no guarantee of commercial success. Would these
      funds for R&D be better spent on supporting other products in the Fujifilm
      portfolio? We must also note the time costs / delays involved in researching and
      developing a new product and bringing this to market. Working capital could be
      tied up in a product’s R&D idea, which might only remain an invention and
      therefore not generate any future sales or profits.

      Fujifilm’s success can be short lived as competitors can eventually imitate its
      innovation.

      Accept any other relevant issue.


      Mark as 2+2.

      Award [1] for a relevant and correct benefit / cost and [1] for an explanation of
      this benefit / cost in relation to Fujifilm, up to a maximum of [2].

      N.B. if the explanation is generic and not applied to Fujifilm award [1] per benefit
      / cost, up to a maximum of [2]. Despite the fact that the examples of costs are
      rather generic, some attempt at application must be evident.

                                                                        Diversification
                                                development




      One may argue that diversification, as one of the four strategic growth options
      suggested by Ansoff is the most risky one. Fujifilm ventured into unknown new
      markets – cosmetics and new targeted customers/segments, which they had no
      experience of targeting before. Fujifilm had no security of knowing the industry as
      well as knowing customers, hence a very risky strategy, the most risky one
      among the four. Similarly, the diversification into medical equipment can also be
      seen as diversification albeit perhaps a more related one.

      However, by pursuing unrelated diversification (or diversification) into the
      cosmetic industry and the creation of the brand Astalift, one may argue that
      Fujifilm actually reduces the risk of relying on their film / core product that
      gradually became obsolete. The researchers at Fujifilm were competent enough
      to see the possible synergy, the common “know how” and were able to build on
      its existing knowledge in the film industry and transfer patents to a new industry -
      the skincare industry. Hence the risk of using diversification as a growth strategy
      has been much reduced. An appropriate strategy especially in the short run until
      the patent expires.

      Moreover, Fujifilm acquired pharmaceutical companies and developed R&D
      facilities to support this high risk strategy with successful results.

      Diversification can also be seen as the most expensive option as new markets
      have to be researched, product to be created and marketed. Nevertheless, it
      looks as if Astalift was successful as a diversification strategy.

      Accept any other relevant examination.

                                             – 23 –               M15/3/BUSMT/HP2/ENG/TZ0/XX/M


(e)   Discuss the decision of Fujifilm to create the new brand, Astalift.                     [9]

      It is expected that candidates will discuss the decision of Fujifilm to create the
      new brand as opposed to just discussing the creation of a new product.

      Consumers view a brand as an important part of the product and branding can
      add value to the product and can help with the positioning of the product.

      The company brand name Fujifilm was not used for the cosmetic/skincare
      product. One may argue that Fujifilm management took a chance, as the Fujifilm
      brand has been very reputable, highly recognizable and successful. Throughout
      its history, Fujifilm kept on enhancing the company brand.

      We assume that the management at Fujifilm were aware of the possibility that if
      Fujifilm operates under the same brand name and used a family branding
      strategy for the new cosmetic/skincare products, current customers and the
      targeted potential customers may be confused.

      Despite creating a strong technical synergy between the new cosmetic line and
      the current product – by using its patented antioxidants chemicals from Fujifilm’s
      traditional film products – the management understood that the targeted
      customers might be reluctant to buy a new cosmetic/skincare line branded by the
      same name as other unrelated products. Hence a new brand name and a new
      and separate identity was created.

      Product / individual branding was used. Fujifilm’s management invested heavily
      in creating the new, separated and distinctive brand name Astalift. Clearly this
      choice is much more expensive for an organization rather than just extending a
      successful brand name. Hence, it can be argued that Fujifilm took unnecessary
      risk given the reputation of their brand. It definitely spent a considerable amount
      of money on creating and developing the brand. However, given the success of
      the new skincare/cosmetic product, this argument cannot be judged as a
      significant one. The risk paid off. Astalift became one of the bestselling in Japan’s
      skincare product market.

      Figures suggest that the strategy of entering the Japanese market first to
      establish brand awareness and test the new brand was a successful strategy.
      The positioning, market share in Japan and the increase in revenue as stated in
      the stimulus, provides the evidence.

      The above are very significant arguments with strong evidence of a great
      strategic response and success of creating a separate brand.

      Moreover, brand erosion of Fujifilm might have occurred if the cosmetic / skincare
      line was not successful and branded under Fujifilm. (The medical equipment is
      traded under the original brand name).

      However, the medical equipment created by Fujifilm was successful. Perhaps
      there was no need to invest heavily on creating a new brand and identity and
      save on marketing costs. However, these products were closer to Fujifilm’s past
      core products.

      Still Fujifilm evidently made a commercial success of the new product line given
      their global ambition and the current market development strategy used.
      Perhaps the challenge of using the Astalift brand name will be more of a
      challenge in Europe.
                                       – 24 –              M15/3/BUSMT/HP2/ENG/TZ0/XX/M



One has to remember that while diversifying into the skincare/cosmetics market,
Fujifilm competes in Asia and in Europe with many well-established companies.
Perhaps in Europe a strong and well-established brand name of Fujifilm and not
Astalift might be more appropriate? Perhaps, regardless of the chosen name,
Fujifilm’s success is going to be reduced given the intensive competition in the
European markets.

Moreover, it looks like other companies such as Suntory are also diversifying into
cosmetic/skincare products. Hence the competitive advantage and the USP
created by Fujifilm may be short lived. Fujifilm has been very successful in the
short run but its long-term success might be less certain with the new brand.

Possible judgment/substantiated conclusion:
As well as understanding the needs and aspiration of women, Fujifilm after
undisputed success in Japan, is well on its way to creating a global cosmetic
brand, that supports well the strategic option of diversification. 20% of its sales
come from abroad. However, some of the patents are likely to expire and other
companies can copy some of the ingredients and the technology used when
producing the cosmetic/skincare products. Perhaps it can be an advantage if
customers associate the product line with Fujifilm – sort of family branding.

However, financially, the new brand was a commercial success and Fujifilm has
the infrastructure, the financial ability and the impetuous to continue to develop
innovative products.

4.   (a)   Define the term internal growth.                                                      [2]

           Internal growth occurs when a business expands without merging, acquiring,
           partnering or otherwise being involved with other businesses. Sometimes
           referred to as organic growth, internal growth involves increasing sales or
           investment in capacity. It is a growth from within.

           Two features of e-commerce are that it allows for:
            the business, goods and services it sells are available electronically eg via the
             internet, 24 hours per day
            national or global reach of customers beyond local borders
            instant / quick / cheap two-way communication between businesses and
             customers without the need for face-to-face meetings
            targeting of marketing messages to personal customer requirements

(d)   Explain two problems, other than liquidity, for BDM, of rapid sales growth.         [4]

      When sales grow rapidly; the demand on a firm’s stock inventory increases.
      There are risks of “overtrading” (although this term is not expected).

      The demand on firms stock (inventory) increases and unless BDM is able to
      re-stock quickly, it may find that it does not have enough goods to sell to meet
      demand and customers may become dissatisfied and may choose competitors if
      deliveries fail to keep up. Customers’ patience will be tested and even though
      BDM’s USP keeps customers loyal, this “lack of stock” aspect may make
      customers move to competitors.

      BDM is to reach full capacity within a few years. Working at full or near full
      capacity can exert extra pressure on employees and managers, higher costs for
      the maintenance as well as depreciation of the machines. Moreover, extra
      pressure can result in a fall in quality. Its USP may be eroded.

      Rapid sales growth must also be accompanied with increased managerial
      efficiency and improved customer service to maintain their loyalty in the latter.

      There will also be pressure on their supply chains and distribution channels to
      ensure that deliveries are on time. BDM may have to find new channels
      especially as B2B e-commerce grows further.


      Mark as 2+2.

      Award [1] for an appropriate identification of a problem from rapid sales growth
      and an additional [1] for explanation and application to BDM. Award a maximum
      of [2]. If there is no application, award a maximum of [1].
                                              – 27 –              M15/3/BUSMT/HP2/ENG/TZ0/XX/M


(e)   Analyse the possible impact on pricing and place in the marketing mix, if BDM
      moves from its current location (Option 1).                                            [6]

      Location has importance to BDM’s pricing element in the marketing mix. At
      present BDM’s unique selling point (USP) is lower price than producers of similar
      products of comparable quality. Thus, at present, many of BDM’s customers get
      the product they want at a better price than other similar manufacturers’ offerings
      and at a convenient location.

      Some possible issues regarding place:
      Currently, the location is very convenient to most of its customers who are
      located nearby in the city centre location. If BDM moves 27 kilometres away as
      Option 1 suggests, its location will be less convenient for its customers who may
      move to competitors.

      5% of BDM’s sales are online – a place and that percentage is growing. To
      these customers, where BDM is located is less important. At present, the
      percentage of customers who purchase online is low enough not to be a
      significant factor in the analysis of place in BDM’s marketing mix. Over time,
      however, that will change.

      Some possible issues regarding pricing:
      Additional costs might occur that might be passed on to its customers for more
      expensive product delivery. BDM may have to find new supply chain partners.
      The prices for delivered products may rise which conflicts with BDM’s USP.
      Especially if one of BDM’s competitors is located in the city centre.

      However, the new factory will result in significantly lower costs. Hence BDM will
      be able to maintain the price / its competitiveness or even enhance its
      competitiveness by reducing the price.

      If Option 1 leads to an increase in growth, further economies of scale are likely
      and price reductions could be possible. However, if the additional delivery costs
      increase prices and outweigh these economies of scale, the price differential that
      BDM currently enjoys over competitors, would be reduced. The move could hurt
      BDM’s USP and lead to a reduction in sales volume and revenue.

      Also older skilled workers may rather retire than commute. New workers could
      be hired which may affect motivation, productivity and staff turnover resulting in
      increased costs which consequently might increase the price or reduce profit.

      It is not expected that the candidate covers all of the above issues.

      It is not expected that the candidate divides the answer into the two separate
      issues as above.

      N.B. HR issues are not part of the marketing mix. Award only if there is a direct
      link made to the effect on price, or the methods of distribution (less people are
      needed when using e-commerce).

      A reference to costs or profit, without a link to the effect on the price should not
      be regarded as complete coverage and application.

      For one relevant issue that refers to either price or place but is one-sided, award
      up to [3].
                                     – 28 –              M15/3/BUSMT/HP2/ENG/TZ0/XX/M


For one relevant argument for and one relevant argument against either price or
place award up to [4].

If the response is a one-sided relevant approach with no analysis / balance but
refers to both price and place award a maximum of [4].

To achieve [6] candidates must give a balanced examination of both price and
place with one argument for and one argument against each.

(f)   Discuss BDM’s Option 2 to solve its liquidity problem.                                  [9]

      Option 2 includes three strategies / actions. Sell the factory and lease it back
      from the purchaser, change to a just-in-time stock control management and
      shorten the credit terms given to customers from 30 to 15 days.

      Option 2, especially selling the factory provides a one-off short-term windfall /
      cash injection to the company, but leasing costs will need to be considered over
      the longer term and there is no information in the stimulus to say how significant
      this could be.

      The liquidity problem may be solved when the first aspect of Option 2 is
      completed, but BDM loses its most valuable asset in a prime city centre location.
      One may judge this point as a very significant argument as BDM will have an
      uncertain expense in the future when and if the lease costs increases.

      Other aspects / strategies of Option 2 could help BDM solve its liquidity problem
      as both just in time and shorter credit terms for customers would reduce cash
      outflow and increase cash inflow. However, just-in-time stock control can be
      difficult and expensive to set up and manage. It makes BDM more dependent on
      reliable and timely delivery of raw materials. Cash may be needed to implement
      the new system including training.

      If suppliers are not timely and reliable, BDM could end up not meeting its
      schedules and irritating customers – reducing cash inflows and making the
      liquidity problem worse.

      However, with reduced funds tied-up in stock, compared to the current just-in-
      case method, cash outflows would be better managed and BDM will not have
      unproductive assets / money tied up in stock. The cash outflow could be smaller,
      although more frequent, depending on the nature of the new supplier
      relationships to create just-in-time. Still, BDM can negotiate better credit with its
      suppliers instead of changing the stock management system.

      As for shorter credit terms, BDM’s customers may object to the shorter credit
      terms, which would not align with industry standards. Changing credit terms at
      short notice may not be possible given that BDM’s customers may also have to
      renegotiate with their own customers. (Goodwill in the whole industry may be
      reduced given the interdependence of cash flow.)

      With a considerably shorter credit terms of 15 days only which is below the
      industry average, BDM’s customers’ may not have the finance to pay.
      Customers might go to BDM’s competitors just for the more favourable credit
      terms despite BDM’s USP. Again customer loyalty for BDM will be tested given
      rise to future liquidity issues. However, if customers are willing and able to pay,
      especially if the quality is perceived higher than the competitors, a reduction from
      30 days to 15 days is a significant one and would enable BDM to have the cash
      quicker, hence the liquidity problem might be reduced.

      In conclusion, it is expected that the candidate will come up with a substantiated
      conclusion. The candidate may suggest that further negotiation and discussion
      of credit terms will be needed as well as investigating and forming new supply
      chain relationships for just-in-time to operate. This will take time for BDM to
      achieve.

      Accept any other relevant discussion and arguments.

5.   (a)   Describe two stakeholder conflicts at C2G.                                            [4]

            One conflict is between the current and potential investors and Charles due to
             his risky outside activities that he presumably believes attracts positive
             attention / publicity. Investors welcome Charles’s attempts at free publicity
             through his adventures, but are concerned about the impact on the company if
             he was to have a serious accident. Shareholder value would be affected with
             no natural leader in waiting and minimal consultation from Charles.
            The second conflict exists between the marketing department (and/or
             Marketing Manager) and the Production Manager over the creation of a zero-
             fat chip. From a marketing point of view, they are very excited about the idea
             of creating a new zero-fat chip as being further evidence of C2G’s innovation.
             Clearly, though the practical applications of creating this chip have been
             overlooked as the Production Manager has indicated that this cannot be
             achieved.
            There is a further implied conflict between Charles’s intuitive decisions and his
             senior managers given that Charles rarely consults. The senior managers
             also seem very wary of bringing Charles difficult news such as the technology
             does not exist to create the zero-fat chip.

           Accept any other relevant description.


           Mark as 2+2.

           Award [1] for an appropriate identification of two stakeholders, award an
           additional [1] for a description of the conflict with reference to C2G up to a
           maximum of [2].
                                             – 32 –               M15/3/BUSMT/HP2/ENG/TZ0/XX/M


(b)   Explain two reasons why it may be difficult to value C2G’s intangible assets.          [6]

      From the stimulus, it appears that the intangible value of C2G as a company in
      the form of goodwill, brand value, reputation and so on is tied to the personality
      and lifestyle of Charles, as he is very popular with the younger generation. It
      appears that Charles is responsible for creating some of the innovative flavours,
      which have made the company so successful.

      The difficulties of this for C2G’s intangible assets is that it can be hard to
      objectively value the contribution of Charles’s personality and lifestyle as well as
      his innovative attitude while the company is still operating. This can have a true
      positive impact on the brand value and effectively brand loyalty of customers, but
      the value can either be estimated or proven when the company is sold for a price
      above its tangible assets. Until then, the intangible assets can only be estimated
      if at all. Perhaps C2G can research the value of family branding more easily
      measured in terms of research on brand recognition, but the effects on
      personality factors can be very difficult to accurately measure.

      Moreover, the success of the brand (and hence intangible asset) could also be
      down to very good promotion or targeting. Other companies without personality
      cults also have successful brands.

      Innovation as a contributor to C2G’s tangible assets can also be very difficult to
      measure due to the fact that one factor can be difficult to isolate in terms of its
      contribution to the intangibles.

      Moreover inconsistencies of reporting systems between companies exist.
      Current financial statements provide very little information about these assets
      and there is not a standardized / unified method of valuation of the intangible
      assets. Therefore, the Financial Manager is unlikely to insert a figure that is no
      more than estimated.

      Accept any other relevant explanation.


      Mark as a 3+3.

      N.B. the question is about the difficulties of the measurement – the difficulties of
      the process and methods of measuring. The question is not about if and how
      Charles is an intangible asset.

      Award [1] for identifying a relevant difficulty in valuing intangible assets. Award
      an additional [1] for development of this point. Award an additional [1] for the
      application of the difficulty directly to C2G. Award up to a maximum of [3].

      For [6] two difficulties of valuing intangible assets must be linked and explained
      with reference to C2G.

      N.B. it is expected that apart from the personality / lifestyle of the CEO, one more
      issue is identified, explained and applied.
                                              – 33 –               M15/3/BUSMT/HP2/ENG/TZ0/XX/M


(c)   With reference to C2G, compare and contrast intuitive and scientific
      decision-making.                                                                          [6]

      Features of intuitive decision-making include:
       the use of “gut feeling”/emotion based on life, or work experiences to make a
        decision for a business
       a reluctance to use market research or financial data, (which would be used
        by a more scientific style of management). For example, to decide whether to
        launch a new product or service into a new market.

      There is evidence from the stimulus that Charles relies on his own “natural
      abilities” to make decisions and he rarely consults. This has led to a number of
      very successful and innovative snack products appealing to British culture.

      Given his success, it is fair to argue that intuitive decision-making has been
      instrumental in C2G’s financial performance and given that Charles is very much
      in control of the organization, scientific methods may be inappropriate as it will
      hinder its creativity / innovation and free spirit. His intuitive decision-making
      enables C2G to create a competitive advantage in the British market in an
      industry that is probably saturated. There are many potato chip producers.
      However, his lack of consultation with senior managers (such as the Finance,
      Marketing and Production Managers) may result in less than effective decisions
      in the future.

      Scientific management however, requires a much more analytical and
      considered approach to decision-making based not only on financial and market
      research data, but also the application of tools and techniques such as decision-
      trees, networks or force-field analysis. The stimulus indicates that for C2G to
      successfully penetrate a new international market with a different cultural makeup
      considered market research (or sometimes referred to as cultural intelligence
      [CQ]) is required. The contrast with Charles’s own thinking could not be more
      marked. However, for the successful entry into this new unknown market he will
      have to consider adopting more scientific methods as his closest adviser admits
      given the fact that his strengths are in and for the British market.

      It appears that Charles’s intuitive decision-making might frustrate the Marketing
      department / Manager as well as the Production Manager. Conflicts between
      internal stakeholders can reduce the efficiency of the organization as well as its
      reputation.

      Both are relevant approaches to decision-making, but in this example it would be
      foolish of Charles to ignore scientific and rely just on his intuition given that he is
      thinking of taking C2G into a completely new untried market.

      The similarities between the methods can be explained as both methods result
      in a decision and both methods can be effective or otherwise. One may also
      argue that for each decision making, especially the scientific one, some degree of
      intuition and especially experience is being used as the decision is made by
      humans. It might be unrealistic to assume that senior managers such as the
      Finance or the Marketing Manager do not rely on their interpretation, experience,
      background and so on when using a more scientific decision-making method.

      Accept any other relevant analysis.


      It is not expected that the candidates covers all of the above issues

      It is expected that the candidate provides, even briefly, the main characteristics /
      features of the different decision making methods with reference to some
      advantages and disadvantages of each with application.

      Candidates may refer to the similarities, however do not penalize if they do not do
      this in their response.

      For one relevant issue that is one-sided, award up to [3]. For more than one
      relevant issue that is one-sided, award up to a maximum of [4].

      For one relevant argument for and one relevant argument against one decision-
      making method award up to [4].

      For [5] it is expected that the analysis is relevant and detailed, but it may lack
      some balance. For example, one argument is missing.

      For [6] it is expected that the analysis will contain at least one detailed argument
      for and at least one detailed argument against each decision-making method with
      application to C2G.

      Accept mirror image arguments.

(d)   Evaluate the strategic decision to launch C2G’s potato chips into a new
      international market.                                                                  [9]

      The decision to launch C2G’s potato chips into a new international market would
      seem suitable given the increasingly competitive snack market at home. The
      Production Manager rejected the first and possibly the more favourable decision
      to launch a new type of potato chip, Charles would appear confident that his
      current products, yet unique chip flavours would provide C2G with a market gap
      to be exploited.

      Assuming that suitable resources would be made available to finance the
      strategic move, the decision could be viewed as a market development
      opportunity in the Ansoff matrix as a growth strategy and as an internal growth
      strategy. Using well received concept products and taking it to a new market is a
      medium risk strategy which the candidate may judge as an advantage or a
      disadvantage.

      However, internal growth is a slower method of growth, but in this case may be
      more suitable than any other form of external growth like takeover / mergers
      where Charles might have to modify his leadership style.

      Both current and potential investors should be content with this decision.

      N.B. an application of Ansoff matrix is not required and is given as an illustration
      of a strategic tool a candidate may wish to use in their response.

      To ensure the success of the decision, additional finance will be required to adapt
      some if not all of C2G’s marketing mix as suggested by Charles’s closest
      advisers. Especially the promotion and the product to ensure that there are no
      misunderstandings about their products or Charles’s personality and lifestyle
      choices.
                                      – 35 –               M15/3/BUSMT/HP2/ENG/TZ0/XX/M



A carefully considered public relations campaign will need to be created so that
the brand value of C2G is not diluted. Translators / marketing consultants at the
new overseas market will need to be employed so that potential consumers are
not confused by “banana and sour cream” and other flavours which may not
translate well into local media or other above-the-line promotional methods.
Finance will also need to be found to fund further “cultural intelligence”
information and of course further market research to see if the growth strategy is
on track, once C2G enters the market. Clearly, given that knowledge of this new
market may be developing, on top of the extra costs of the suggested need for
marketing mix adaptation, Charles will need to review his intuitive decision-
making style in a market in which he is unfamiliar.

Moving into a new international market will take time. Initial sales may be small
and with further promotional support, it is hoped that the product life cycle will
enter the growth phase. Given that C2G’s success is linked to the personality of
Charles, patience will be critical and it is indicated in the stimulus that Charles
may lack this.

The decision to move into a new international market is justified from the stimulus
given competitive pressures in domestic markets. The creation of a zero-fat chip
(although currently not possible) given increasing concerns about obesity could
prove to be a potential “cash cow” for C2G.

However, given the conflicts outlined in the stimulus and the associated
challenges of entry into a new international market, the decision to move into a
new market will still be risky unless Charles is willing to modify his leadership
style and communication between departments within C2G improves.

It is expected that the candidate will provide some conclusions and judgment.
It appears that the arguments for, based on some of the above arguments /
reasons, especially C2G’s past success and the current market conditions are
stronger than the arguments against. Provided some attention is paid to the
market research and product adaptation, C2G should launch the chips into a new
international market.

Accept any other relevant evaluation with substantiated judgment.

It is not expected that the candidate incorporates all of the above arguments.


For one relevant issue that is one-sided, award up to [3]. For more than one
relevant issue that is one-sided, award up to a maximum of [4].

Award a maximum of [5] if the answer is of a standard that shows balanced
analysis and understanding throughout the response with reference to the
stimulus material but there is no judgment/conclusion.

Candidates cannot reach the [5–7] markband if they give judgment/conclusions
that are not based on analysis/explanation already given in their answer.
