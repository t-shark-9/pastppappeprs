Answer one question from this section.

Microeconomics

1.   (a)   Explain how changes in price work to reallocate resources in a market.              [10]

     (b)   Discuss the view that the overuse of common access resources is best addressed by
           government.                                                                         [15]


2.   (a)   Explain why prices tend to be stable in oligopolistic markets.                      [10]

     (b)   Oligopolists often possess too much monopoly power. Evaluate whether governments
           should intervene in oligopolistic markets.                                          [15]

Macroeconomics

3.   (a)   Explain what is meant by the natural rate of unemployment.                               [10]

     (b)   Discuss the view that there is no trade-off between inflation and unemployment.          [15]


4.   (a)   Explain how business spending on research and development and government
           expenditure on infrastructure might shift the long-run aggregate supply curve.           [10]

     (b)   Evaluate the effectiveness of interventionist supply-side policies to achieve economic
           growth.                                                                                  [15]
