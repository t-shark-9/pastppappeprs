Notes for examiners:

1. Whenever relevant, carry over marks must be awarded. If a candidate makes an error in
   calculation, but then uses the incorrect figure appropriately and accurately in later question
   parts, then the candidate may be fully rewarded. This is the “own-figure rule” and you should
   put OFR on the script where you are rewarding this. To do this you will need to use the
   on-page comment annotation tool (       ).

2. Alternative approaches may be taken in responses to the [4] questions that use A02 command
   terms. If this is the case and the alternative approaches are valid, then full credit should be
   given.


1.   (a)   (i)   On the diagram, draw and label the average revenue curve for Firm A.          [2]




                 For an accurate average revenue curve.                                        [1]
                 For an accurate, labelled average revenue curve.                              [1]
                                                 –4–               M15/3/ECONO/HP3/ENG/TZ0/XX/M


      (ii)    Calculate Firm A’s total revenue if it produces 180 000 units per month.        [2]

              Total revenue = 180000 × 18                                                             [1]
              Any valid working is sufficient for [1].

               = $3 240 000                                                                           [1]
              An answer of $3 240 000 or 3 240 000 without any valid working is sufficient
              for [1] only.

              Since both AR and quantity are given, OFR does not apply.

      (iii)   Identify Firm A’s short-run profit maximizing level of output.                          [1]

              Profit-maximizing level of output = 140000 (the term “units” is not
              necessary)
              OR
              120 000 units (the term “units” is not necessary) to allow for maximum profit
              if measured using the diagram provided                                                  [1]
              OFR applies if AR (=MR) curve has been drawn in the wrong position.

      (iv)    Calculate Firm A’s short-run abnormal profit/loss at the level of output
              identified in part (iii).                                                               [2]

              At output 140 000
              Total revenue = AR × Q = 18 × 140 000 = 2520 000
              Total cost = AC × Q = 14 × 140 000 = 1960 000                                           [1]

              Any valid working is sufficient for [1].

              Profit = 2 520 000 − 1960 000 = $560 000                                                [1]

              OFR from part (iii) applies; no OFR applies within part (iv).

(b)   With reference to the diagram, identify the long-run equilibrium price and level of
      output for Firm A.                                                                              [2]

      P = $12                                                                                         [1]
      Q = 120 000 (the term “units” is not necessary)                                                 [1]

(c)   Explain, using the diagram, how Firm A will move from short-run equilibrium to
      long-run equilibrium.                                                                           [4]

              For an explanation that the existence of abnormal profits (of $560 000) in
              the short run will attract new firms into the industry.

       2      The written response is accurate.                                                      3–4
              For an explanation that the existence of abnormal profits (of $560 000) in
              the short run will attract new firms into the industry and that this will
              increase market supply and consequently cause price to decrease until
              abnormal profits are competed away (at a price of $12).

              A response which makes no direct reference to the diagram may be
              awarded a maximum of [3].

     (g)   Using the diagram and your answers to part (f), explain why price rigidities exist

                 For an explanation that the firms may be unwilling to increase or reduce
                 price because they will be worse off in either case.

            2    The written response is accurate.                                                      3–4
                 For an explanation that if they increase price they may expect rivals not to
                 follow so that demand is elastic and revenue would decrease. On the other
                 hand, if they cut price they may expect rivals to follow so that demand is
                 relatively inelastic and the firm will be again worse off. Therefore it is not in
                 the firm’s interest to change price.

                 OR

                 An explanation that, for the profit-maximizing oligopolist who predicts that
                 rival(s) will not follow a price increase but will follow a price cut so there is a
                 range of cost conditions (possible positions of the MC curve) which would
                 intersect the MR curve within the resulting discontinuity at the current level
                 of output. It is therefore relatively likely that the oligopolist will choose to
                 leave price/output unchanged.


2.   (a)   (i)   Identify two possible reasons for a decrease in consumer expenditure.                   [2]

                 Possible responses include:
                  a decrease in consumer confidence / low consumer confidence
                  an increase in the rate of interest / high interest rates
                  an increase in household indebtedness / high indebtedness
                  an increase in direct taxation / high taxation
                  a decrease in wealth.

                 Any other reasonable response should be rewarded.

                 N.B. A decrease in income or a causal factor such as a decrease in wages
                 can be rewarded as the question does not ask for a reason for a shift in AD.

                 Award [1] for each appropriate response, up to a maximum of [2].

(ii)    On the diagram, draw and label the new aggregate demand curve following
        the decrease in consumer expenditure.                                          [1]




        Award [1] for an accurate, labelled AD curve.

(iii)   State the amount (in $ billion) by which the full employment level of output
        exceeds the short-run equilibrium level of output.                             [1]

        For drawing a vertical, labelled LRAS at $18 billion.

(v)     Identify the average price level and level of real output when Country A has
        returned to long-run equilibrium as a result of the interaction of market
        forces.                                                                        [1]

      Reasons may include:
       if the average price level increases, then real wealth decreases, so people will
        spend less (N.B. real income is not acceptable)
       if the average price level increases, interest rates are likely to rise,
        discouraging investment and consumer spending
       if the average price level increases, the economy’s exports become less
        competitive, reducing demand for exports (or (but not in addition to the
        “export” argument) imports become relatively cheaper, so imports increase).

(iii)   Explain why a decrease in the rate of direct tax would affect the value of the
        multiplier in Country A.                                                          [2]

        OR the idea that consumption will increase

        If the rate of direct tax decreases, then, in the equation, t decreases and so
        the value of the multiplier increases.                                            [1]

        N.B. A response which explains that, if the rate of direct taxation falls, then
        the marginal rate of withdrawal decreases / marginal propensity to
        consume increases and so the multiplier increases should be fully
        rewarded.

             For an explanation that reducing the rates of income tax according to the
             data given will make the tax system less progressive, as those on higher
             incomes will benefit proportionately more.

             For an explanation that reducing the rates of income tax according to the
             data given will make the tax system less progressive, as those on higher
             incomes will benefit proportionately more and that reducing the rates of
             income tax may be seen as inequitable, as the tax burden is reduced
             relatively more for those who can afford to pay more tax.

             An appropriate alternative view should, if explained clearly, be fully
             rewarded. Eg less revenue is available to the government to assist those
             on lower incomes.

            increased Thai demand for Australia’s exports as the demand for AU$

            lower Australian demand for Thai imports as the supply of AU$ would
             decrease
            an increase in Australia’s interest rate compared to Thai interest rates as
             this would create an inflow of investment funds shifting the demand for
             AU$ to the right
            relatively higher Thai inflation which will make Thai products less
             competitive and Australian goods more attractive, thus increasing the
             demand for AU$
            increased foreign direct and portfolio investment into Australia causing
             the demand for AU$ to increase

             will increase.

       1    Vague response.                                                                   1
            For the idea that the average price of exports has decreased relative to the
            average price of imports (or, that the terms of trade have deteriorated)

      2     Accurate response.                                                                2
            For providing a description that a greater quantity of exports is required to
            purchase a unit of imports.

(j)   State two possible reasons for a change in the terms of trade of a country such
      as Sweden.                                                                           [2]

      For stating any two of the following:
       changes in demand conditions for exports and imports
       changes in global supply of key inputs (such as oil)
       changes in / high relative inflation rates
       changes in relative exchange rates
       changes in world income levels
       changes in productivity within the country
       technological developments.

      Any other reasonable response

      Award [1] for each valid response.

(k)   Explain how the change in Sweden’s terms of trade, described in part (i), might
      improve its current account balance.                                                 [4]

      Level                                                                              Marks
       0 The work does not reach a standard described by the descriptors below.            0

       1   The explanation provided is limited.                                           1–2
           The idea that a deterioration in a country’s terms of trade makes its
           products more competitive thus improving its current account balance.

      2    The explanation provided is accurate.                                          3–4
           For an explanation that a deterioration in a country’s terms of trade makes
           its products more competitive causing exports to increase and/ or imports
           to decrease and that given appropriate price elasticities of demand for
           imports and exports the current balance will improve

           Other valid explanations may be fully rewarded.
