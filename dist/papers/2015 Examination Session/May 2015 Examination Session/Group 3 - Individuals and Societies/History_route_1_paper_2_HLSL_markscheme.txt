The following bands provide a précis of the full markbands for Paper 2 published in the History guide on
pages 71–74. They are intended to assist marking but must be used in conjunction with the full
markbands found in the guide. For the attention of all examiners: if you are uncertain about the
content/accuracy of a candidate’s work please contact your team leader.


  16–20: Answers are clearly structured and focused, have full awareness of the demands of the
         question, and, if appropriate, may challenge it. Detailed specific knowledge is used as
         evidence to support assertions and arguments. Historical processes such as comparison
         and contrast, placing events in context and evaluating different interpretations are used
         appropriately and effectively.
  13–15: Answers are clearly focused on the demands of the question. Specific knowledge is applied
         as evidence, and analysis or critical commentary are used appropriately to produce a specific
         argument. Events are placed in context and there is sound understanding of historical
         processes and comparison and contrast. Evaluation of different approaches may be used to
         substantiate arguments presented.
  10–12: Answers indicate that the question is understood but not all implications considered.
         Knowledge is largely accurate. Critical commentary may be present. Events are generally
         placed in context and understanding of historical processes, such as comparison and
         contrast are present. There may be awareness of different approaches and interpretations
         but they are not based on relevant historical knowledge. There is a clear attempt at a
         structured approach.
  8–9:   The demands of the question are generally understood. Historical knowledge is present but
         is not fully or accurately detailed. Knowledge is narrative or descriptive in nature. There may
         be limited argument that requires further substantiation. Critical commentary may be
         present. There is an attempt to place events in historical context and show an understanding
         of historical processes. An attempt at a structured approach, either chronological or thematic
         has been made.
  6–7:   Answers indicate some understanding of the question but historical knowledge is limited in
         quality and quantity. Historical context may be present as will understanding of historical
         processes but underdeveloped. The question is only partially addressed.
  4–5:     There is little understanding of the question. Historical details are present but are mainly
           inaccurate and/or of marginal relevance. Historical context or processes are barely
           understood and there is minimal focus on the task.
  1–3:     Answers do not meet the demands of the question and show little or no evidence of
           appropriate structure. There are no more than vague, unsupported assertions.
  0:       Answers not meeting the requirements of descriptors should be awarded no marks.

  Examiners and moderators are reminded of the need to apply the markbands that provide the “best
  fit” to the responses given by candidates and to award credit wherever it is possible to do so. If
  an answer indicates that the demands of the question are understood and addressed but that not all
  implications are considered (eg, compare or contrast; reasons or significance; methods or
  success), then examiners should not be afraid of using the full range of marks allowed for by the
  markscheme: ie, responses that offer good coverage of some of the criteria should be rewarded
  accordingly.

Topic 1   Dynasties and rulers

1.   Examine the reasons for the emergence of one of the following empires: Umayyad; Abbasid;
     Carolingian; Angevin.

     Candidates should choose one empire and provide a clear analysis of the reasons for its
     emergence.

     The factors leading to the emergence of the chosen empire may include: the influence of a
     powerful military leader who was successful in seizing power through conquest, victory in civil wars
     or the overthrow of the previously existing government; an alliance of several groups based on
     ethnicity, religion or political interests who wished to establish a new regime; the support of
     influential groups such as religious leaders; territory and power acquired through marriage and/or
     diplomacy; the weakness and/or unpopularity of opponents; the skill of the ruler as an administrator
     and political leader. In addition the desire of the population for a strong government to provide
     protection and a stable environment for economic development could also be considered.

     The above material is an indication of what candidates may elect to write about in their responses.
     However, the list is not exhaustive and no set answer is required.

     Examiners and moderators are reminded of the need to apply the markbands that provide the
     “best fit” to the responses given by candidates and to award credit wherever it is possible to
     do so.


2.   Evaluate the success of one female ruler of a medieval European state.

     Candidates must choose one female ruler only. Popular choices will be Matilda (1102–1167),
     Eleanor of Aquitaine (1137–1204), Blanche of Castile (Regent of France 1226–1234).

     Candidates should assess the success of the ruler by determining how successful she was at
     developing and implementing policies, maintaining her authority, continuing the power of her family
     and/or dynasty and overcoming the challenges (internal and external) that she faced.

     The above material is an indication of what candidates may elect to write about in their responses.
     However, the list is not exhaustive and no set answer is required.

3.   Examine the factors that led to the formation of Christian or Islamic states prior to 1000.

     The factors that led to the creation of Christian or Islamic states in either medieval Europe or the
     Islamic world may include: the ambitions and talents of individual rulers to control larger territories
     to increase their power and wealth; the conquest of territories that made the creation of
     administration essential in order to retain and exploit the territories; the need to develop stronger
     military institutions to defend against invasion; the need to collect taxes and other funds to support
     the government led to bureaucratisation in order to keep records of taxation and spending; better
     communication made larger political units possible; the growth of literacy increased the number of
     individuals who could act as bureaucrats and/or judges. The model of previous large states such
     as the Roman Empire and the example of the Byzantines encouraged some rulers to try to control
     large areas.

     However, the list is not exhaustive and no set answer is required.

     Examiners and moderators are reminded of the need to apply the markbands that provide the
     “best fit” to the responses given by candidates and to award credit wherever it is possible to

4.   With reference to one medieval European or Muslim ruler, discuss the importance of law and
     administration to the maintenance and expansion of their authority.

     Candidates must choose one ruler and analyse both the legal and administrative methods they
     used to maintain and expand their authority.

     There are many rulers from whom to choose and popular choices are likely to be Henry II,
     Charlemagne, Louis VI, Phillip II and William I as well as 'Abd al-Malik, Harun al-Rashid and
     Mu’awiya.

     The methods by which laws were used to maintain and increase the authority of rulers may
     include: establishing royal law codes to replace all previous codes especially local and traditional
     laws; establishing a system of royal courts and judges to replace all local or traditional authorities;
     adopting and supporting law codes based on religion, which supported the power of the ruler.
     These methods increased central authority by making the ruler the source of all laws in the minds
     of the population and eliminated the use and credibility of local and traditional laws. Royal courts
     and judges replaced local officials and power holders as the source of legal judgement thus
     increasing royal authority; courts were also a source of revenue to rulers through the collection of
     fines and this revenue served to increase royal power. All inhabitants of the state were expected
     to obey the laws and failure to do so allowed the ruler to punish them regardless of social class.

     The methods by which administration was used to maintain and increase royal authority may
     include: establishment of royal bureaucracies of trained officials loyal to the monarch;
     establishment of written records of land holdings and tax obligations. The ways in which these
     methods maintained and increased royal power included: more efficient tax collection, which raised
     royal revenues and allowed the creation of military power and more government offices; records of
     landholdings and wealth that ensured that the monarch could collect the full amount of taxes
     owing; government officials travelled throughout the state and reported to the monarch about how
     well laws and regulations were being followed; bureaucrats were loyal to the monarch and would
     report any individual or group who sought to defy regulations or the monarch’s authority.

     The above material is an indication of what candidates may elect to write about in their responses.
     However, the list is not exhaustive and no set answer is required.

     Examiners and moderators are reminded of the need to apply the markbands that provide the
     “best fit” to the responses given by candidates and to award credit wherever it is possible to do
     so.

5.   “William I (1066–1087) was more successful in establishing his power than Louis VI (1108–1137).”
     To what extent do you agree with this statement?

     Candidates will have to state clearly their position and support it with relevant content, and the
     topics that they can examine in order to reach a judgment may include: each ruler's ability to
     suppress and eliminate powerful rivals; their ability to suppress any internal uprisings; their ability
     to control and limit the power of the nobility; their ability to enforce law and other administrative
     policies throughout the territory; their ability to exercise control over the entire country with respect
     to domestic or foreign powers; their ability to maintain a relationship with and control the activities
     of the Church; their financial position with respect to their ability to collect taxes throughout the
     country.

6.   To what extent was either Mu'awiya (661–680) or al-Mu'izz (953–975) a successful ruler?

     Candidates must choose only one of these individuals and assess their success as rulers.

     Mu‘awiya (661–680)
     The reasons for which Mu'awiya may be considered a success include: he ended the first fitna and
     restored stability and unity to the Islamic world; he established the Umayyad Caliphate, which
     established a new form of government that was based on a non-tribal bureaucracy; government
     was modernized and adopted a conventional form similar to the Byzantine and Persian
     administrations; he introduced a way to end struggles over the succession by creating a dynastic
     principle of succession to his eldest son. Mu‘awiya also moved the capital to Damascus, which
     was a better location from which to administer the Islamic world. Under his leadership the Islamic
     world expanded across North Africa to Morocco.

     The less successful aspects of his reign include: his discrimination against non-Arabs was
     unpopular with many groups in the Caliphate and was a source of opposition and resistance;
     his replacement of tribal leaders with bureaucrats was a source of opposition from those displaced;
     his adoption of a dynastic succession alienated those who felt that the leader should be the most
     worthy individual; his new government was secular and alienated the religious leaders who felt that
     he was straying from Islam. Mu‘awiya failed to reconcile the Shi’ites and another civil war broke
     out immediately after his death.

     Al-Mu‘izz (953–975)
     Al-Mu‘izz is regarded as one of the most successful of Fatimid leaders. He oversaw the move of
     the Fatimid capital to Egypt and founded the city of Cairo in 969. Under him the Fatimids became
     a large Mediterranean empire reaching across North Africa and Sicily. Their trade and commerce
     in the Mediterranean expanded substantially during his reign. Al Mu‘izz continued the practice of
     toleration of other faiths that was the norm in the Fatimid Empire. He employed many Coptic
     Christians in his administration at very high levels. In addition he was celebrated for his military,
     governmental and financial reforms, which were designed to ensure peace and prosperity. He
     supported commercial interests by expanding the Fatimid fleets that carried goods across the
     Mediterranean and Red Seas and the Indian Ocean.

     The above material is an indication of what candidates may elect to write about in their responses.
     However, the list is not exhaustive and no set answer is required.

Topic 2    Society and economy

7.   Examine the importance of the development of money and exchange systems in medieval Europe.

     An examination of the importance of the development of money and exchange systems may
     include reference to: the added ease that those systems brought to both local and long-distance
     trade, which encouraged its growth; coinage, which made the collection of taxes easier and in turn
     increased the power of central governments; money and exchange systems, which aided the
     development of banking and facilitated the provision of loans to governments, businessmen and
     merchants and enabled them to expand their operations. Money systems ended payment in kind
     and encouraged the development of commercial agriculture, thus ending feudalism. The merchant
     and banking class was strengthened as were the towns where they had their operations. Many
     early bankers and currency exchangers were Jewish and resentment against them increased as a
     result. This led to a number of persecutions and expulsions by governments often because they
     were in debt to them. The development of money and currency exchange systems modernized the
     feudal economy, ended feudalism and expanded trade and industry.

     fit” to the responses given by candidates and to award credit wherever it is possible to do so.


8.   Evaluate the non-economic contributions to society of religious communities in either medieval
     Europe or the Islamic world.

     An evaluation of the non-economic contributions of religious communities may include reference
     to: their position as centres of education that had schools and libraries that were available to the
     public; their considerable charitable work in providing for the sick, orphans, the destitute and others
     who needed physical or spiritual support; their being sources of spiritual teaching and guidance
     that conducted religious services for the community; their being gathering places for the community
     and that organized festivals and celebrations were often religious in nature but also provided
     recreation and enjoyment to members of the community; that they were important sources of
     communication for news and events from both the community and the wider world. Their interest in
     art, architecture and other cultural matters aided in the development of the arts and provided
     places for the public to experience, for example, high quality examples of art. Their devotion and
     self-sacrifice were designed to be an inspiration to the wider community and set an example of
     piety and behaviour that society should try to emulate.

9.    Evaluate the effect of the rise of towns on the social status of the nobility in medieval Europe.

      The impact of the creation of towns on the social status of the nobility was varied and responses
      may include reference to: towns produced new social classes that were not part of the feudal
      structure; wealthy townspeople became rivals for land and wealth with the nobles, their control of
      trade and finance gave them an advantage over the nobles in economic matters and this
      weakened the social standing of many nobles who found themselves in debt to merchants; towns
      provided employment and security for runaway serfs, which undermined the nobles’ control of their
      estates. The nobles' need to raise money to pay debts and to meet growing consumption caused
      them to end the feudal system and replace it with commercial agriculture. Their social status
      suffered as a result. The nobles were replaced by the townspeople in royal bureaucracies and
      courts as rulers found them more loyal and efficient. This seriously damaged the influence of the
      nobility. Towns were dynamic and progressive organizations that challenged the traditional social
      and political structure that the nobles had originally dominated, thus weakening their prestige and
      influence.

10.   Examine the reasons for the success of trade in the Islamic world.

      The reasons for the success of trade in the Islamic world were varied and responses may include
      reference to: a tradition of trading over great distances that pre-dated Islam and was maintained
      after its arrival; the respect given to merchants in the Islamic world; the expansion of the Islamic
      world expanded the opportunities for trade; good transportation and communication systems were
      maintained by the Abbasid Caliphate and even its rivals such as the Fatimids; the expansion of
      sea-borne trade in the Mediterranean Sea and the Indian Ocean facilitated trade over great
      distances; the military superiority of the Islamic world provided security for merchants; the
      important role of cities required trade and commerce over long distances to provide for their needs.

11.   Examine the significance of religious places of worship, religious festivals and shrines in either
      medieval Europe or the Islamic world.

      The significance of places of worship, religious festivals and shrines was considerable and may
      encompass a wide range of factors including, for example, their economic and social impact. As
      such, economic factors may include: the extensive employment they provided for those in the
      construction trade who built, for example, churches, mosques and shrines; their facilitation of
      numerous service industries such as catering, hostels, sellers of clothing and religious articles,
      which grew up around these places to serve the needs of pilgrims and celebrants. In addition
      these places often led to urban growth and inspired numerous merchants and manufacturers to
      settle there or to develop businesses servicing these centres. The offerings and donations of
      pilgrims and others were a major source of wealth to the individual church, shrine or holy place.

      The social role of these places may also be referenced and factors linked to this could include:
      their encouragement of travel out of one’s own territory thus increasing knowledge and
      communication for ordinary people; they brought together people from many different areas of
      countries or territories; in the case of festivals they provided recreation and enjoyment to the
      population who may not have had any other form of that. The pilgrimages inspired the spiritual
      nature of the population and increased religious devotion for many.

      However, the list is not exhaustive and no set answer is required.

      fit” to the responses given by candidates and to award credit wherever it is possible to do so.


12.   “The manorial system was created because of the economic weakness of medieval Europe.” To
      what extent do you agree with this statement?

      Candidates need to examine the reasons for the creation of the manorial system and assess the
      extent to which it was designed to meet economic needs as opposed to social, political and military
      reasons.

      The reasons that economic weakness may be seen as a cause of the manorial system may
      include: the collapse of long-distance trade and transportation systems made self-sufficiency a
      necessity for survival – this was something the manor was designed to do; the poverty and
      landlessness of many individuals caused them to surrender their freedom in exchange for
      employment and sustenance; the lack of reliable currency and banking systems made economies
      poor and forced citizens to be self-sufficient.

      Other factors that might explain the rise of the manorial system may include: it was a continuation
      of the Roman latifundia with serfs replacing slaves; it was constructed by monarchs who needed
      knights and could only pay them in land to which peasants were tied to support the military; many
      peasants who sought security surrendered their freedom to powerful lords who offered to protect
      them in exchange for labour.

Topic 3     Wars and warfare

13.   With reference to one war in medieval Europe or the Islamic world, examine its effects and results.

      Candidates must select one war and assess the effects that it had on the participants and beyond
      where relevant. Popular choices will be: the Anglo-French Wars 1154 to 1223; the Ridda Wars;
      the First and Second fitan; the Hundred Years War; the Mongol invasions; any one of the
      Crusades; the Ottoman conquest of Constantinople.

      Candidates should not limit themselves to political effects such as the conquest of territory or the
      overthrow of rulers but consider a wider range of consequences. These might include economic
      effects, demographics, religion, cultural and intellectual changes. The number and nature of the
      effects will depend on the war selected but should demonstrate an understanding that wars have
      effects in a number of areas not merely political, territorial or dynastic.

14.   “The First and Second fitnas (656–661 and 683–685) were not caused by religious factors.” To
      what extent do you agree with this statement?

      Candidates must produce an analytical essay that demonstrates how far they agree with the
      statement that the fitnas (fitan) were not caused by religious issues.

      The First fitna
      The non-religious factors for the First fitna may focus on: the assassination of the caliph Uthman
      ibn Affan, which provoked a rebellion against his successor Ali ibn Abi Talib. Uthman had been
      assassinated as the result of a dispute over government appointments and the division of the
      spoils of war amongst soldiers and leading families. The rebels opposed Ali for his failure to
      punish the murderers of Uthman who were Ali’s supporters. The war was a struggle for power
      between the supporters of Ali and the supporters of Mu‘awiya. It can also be seen as a struggle
      between two clans for control of the Islamic world and the wealth and power that it had acquired.

      There were, however, religious reasons for the First fitna, and these may include: Ali’s familial
      relationship to Muhammad caused some to believe that he was the rightful caliph and as such they
      opposed all other candidates to the point of eventually creating a major division in Islam.

      The Second fitna
      The non-religious causes of the Second fitna were a dispute over the succession to Mu‘awiya.
      He had decided that his son should succeed him but Islamic traditionalists rejected this dynastic
      model and sought to make al-Husayn, a son of Ali, the caliph. This then led to conflict between
      those who favoured the new dynastic state model and those who preferred the more traditional
      model of Islamic government and the choosing of successors.

      The religious element may be discerned from the fact that the supporters of al-Husayn had formed
      a separate religious group after the death of Ali and wished to promote their view of who should
      rule.

15.   To what extent was Muslim weakness the principal reason for the success of the First Crusade?

      Candidates must analyse the reasons for the success of the First Crusade and the extent to which
      Muslim weakness was an important factor. They may choose to see it as of little importance but
      they must address it in the response.

      The reasons that Muslim weakness may be seen as a cause of the success of the First Crusade
      may include: the Abbasid Caliphate was weakened by the Seljuk invasions; the Fatimid Empire
      divided and caused conflict in the Middle East; the Middle East had divided into many small states
      that were in conflict with each other; there was no inspirational leader to unite Muslims and create
      an effective response; some Muslim leaders allied with the Crusaders for personal advantage.
      Muslims may also not have understood the extent of the threat that the Crusaders presented to the
      Muslim world.

      The other reasons for the success of the First Crusade may include: the military skill of the
      Crusaders; the assistance of the Byzantine Empire; the religious enthusiasm that allowed them to
      endure and overcome hardship and the logistical support of the Italian cities.

16.   To what extent were booty and territory the major reasons for the Muslim wars of conquest?

      Candidates must address what they perceive to be the principal reasons for the Muslim wars of
      conquest from the seventh century onwards.

      The arguments in support of the quotation may include: the tribes of the Arabian Peninsula had
      engaged in war for many years to obtain land and wealth; the wars of conquest extended that
      tradition and attracted great support by those who saw an opportunity to achieve the riches of the
      Byzantine and Persian Empires; the weakness of their opponents encouraged their enthusiasm for
      the wars. The ambitions of individual leaders for glory and power would also be associated with
      this motivation. Rivalries between tribes encouraged them to join in the pursuit of booty as a
      means of improving their power relative to other tribes. Powerful individuals may have been
      seeking additional territory and influence and used these wars as a means to achieve that.

      The other motives for the conquests may include: genuine religious zeal and a desire to spread the
      new doctrines and convert others to it; the missionary aspect of Islam would be a powerful
      incentive. In addition, individuals may have seen war as a means to achieve personal salvation
      through faithful service and even death in the name of the faith.

17.   With reference to either the Hundred Years War in the period 1337 to 1396 or the Anglo-French
      wars in the period 1154 to 1204, examine the results for both England and France.

      Candidates must choose one war and discuss the results for both England and France.

      The results of the Anglo-French wars in the period 1154 to 1204 may include:

      England
      The wars extended English territory in France and reduced the power and influence of the French
      monarchy. The acquisition of large amounts of territory by the Angevin family led to rebellions
      within the family and civil war between Henry and his sons. Richard I, was able to maintain
      Angevin possession in France by constant warfare but this proved to be a heavy economic burden
      on England and on English territories in France. The determination of the French monarchy to
      recover territory in France created a constant state of war between the two nations. England was
      not able to defend the territory due to the poor judgment of King John and this led to a weakened
      economy as England lost territory and had to pay high taxes for war. This created a restless
      nobility who saw their possessions reduced and made the king unpopular.

      France
      The wars proved very damaging to France during the reign of Louis VII. France lost territory and
      prestige through defeats by Henry II. French resistance was inspired by the internal quarrels within
      the Angevin family and French monarchs took advantage of these to increase their influence.
      France suffered considerable destruction as all the wars were fought in France. The determination
      to eliminate the Angevin presence encouraged Phillip II to strengthen the French government and
      monarchy in order to better counter the Angevin presence. The ultimate result of the war was the
      recovery of large amounts of territory by Phillip II, the increased power and prestige of the French
      monarchy and the elimination of the Angevin family as rivals.

      The results of the Hundred Years War in the period 1337 to 1396 may include:

      England
      English victories gave England control of large areas of France. The prestige and power of English
      armies was at a peak as was the reputation of Edward III. Many English nobles were enriched by
      the acquisition of land and the ransoming of hostages. English merchants had new access to
      markets for wine and wool and prospered accordingly. English national pride reached new heights
      and recovered from the loss of prestige in the previous century. The continuation of the war
      became expensive and failed to yield results after 1370. This divided the country between peace
      and war policies and caused opposition to raised taxes to support armed expeditions.

      The increase in taxes caused by the war contributed to the Peasants’ Revolt in 1381. The disputes
      between Richard II and the nobility over the prosecution of the war raised tensions and contributed
      to his deposition.

      France
      There was enormous loss of life amongst the nobility and widespread destruction of the French
      countryside by armies and the Free Companies that operated after the war. The King of France
      was captured at Poitiers, which was an enormous blow to both French prestige and government.
      The French kingdom was reduced in size and lost valuable economic assets. The losses in battle
      allowed a weakening of central control that allowed the aristocracy and local interests to regain
      power lost under previous monarchs. Local rebellions and uprisings became common as
      government control weakened or as the population protested about the failure of government to
      protect them. France was disunited and weaker than before the war. The destruction and losses
      encouraged the French government to attempt to recover its power and they made some progress
      in this area by 1396, recovering territory and preventing further defeats.

18.   Evaluate the impact of the changes in weapons and tactics on the conduct of warfare in the
      medieval period.

      The changes in weapons that influenced warfare may include: the development of the mounted,
      armoured knight that made cavalry a determining factor; the development of missile weapons such
      as the crossbow and longbow, which increased the power of infantry. The expansion and strength
      of castles made siege warfare a key element of medieval warfare and assisted in the development
      of artillery such as cannon, which allowed castles to be destroyed more easily.

      Tactics in medieval warfare changed from offensive to defensive. Cavalry and the mounted knight
      made offensive warfare most important at the outset. The development of castles, missile
      weapons and artillery made defensive tactics more important and forced a change in tactics to
      adjust for the new weapons.

Topic 4    Intellectual, cultural and artistic developments

19.   Discuss both the reasons for, and the results of, increased literacy in medieval Europe.

      The reasons for increased literacy in Europe may include: increasing numbers of schools and
      universities resulting from increased wealth and the interest in scholarship of the 12th century
      renaissance; the spread of vernacular languages, which made learning to read and write
      somewhat simpler; the availability of a wider range of literature made reading for pleasure and
      interest more attractive; the need for increased literacy by merchants, administrators, nobles and
      craftsmen.

      The results of increased literacy was a vast increase in all aspects of the book industry from
      bookshops and copyists to producers of parchment and paper. Knowledge spread more quickly to
      the secular population as some were able to read classical texts arriving from Spain, histories and
      travel accounts in the vernacular and the new encyclopedias that contained scientific knowledge as
      well as philosophy. Increased literacy was a challenge to the Church as it lost its monopoly on
      education and the dissemination of knowledge. Readers became more aware of secular subjects
      and alternate ways of thinking. Greater literacy saw the replacement of clerics by educated lay
      people in government.

      The above material is an indication of what candidates may elect to write about in their responses.
      However, the list is not exhaustive and no set answer is required.

      Examiners and moderators are reminded of the need to apply the markbands that provide the
      “best fit” to the responses given by candidates and to award credit wherever it is possible to
      do so.


20.   Evaluate the reasons for, and the results of, the golden age in the Islamic world.

      The reasons for the golden age may include: the respect for scholarship in Islam; the creation of a
      large, unified empire that allowed information and knowledge to flow from a vast variety of cultures
      – for example India, Persia and China; the discovery and preservation by Muslim forces of large
      numbers of Greek and Roman texts that could be studied; the creation of paper made writing and
      publishing books much easier; more schools were created, which increased interest in learning;
      the support of caliphs such as Harun al-Rashid gave support and prestige to intellectual
      endeavours; the tolerant religious policies of the Islamic world allowed non-Muslim scholars to
      bring their ideas and knowledge to enrich the process.

      The results of the golden age were a vast expansion of knowledge in science, mathematics,
      astronomy and medicine. An enormous number of discoveries were made in these fields during
      the golden age; the Islamic Empire became the leading intellectual centre of the world. Famous
      scholars such as Ibn Rushd were part of this period. The Islamic golden age created the
      knowledge and the texts that were disseminated to Europe and played a valuable part in the
      emergence of the European renaissance of the 12th and 15th centuries. Knowledge was both
      preserved and created through the synthesis of material from eastern and western sources. New
      intellectual approaches such as the scientific method were developed as well as new ideas in
      philosophy, logic and literary criticism and analysis.

21.   Examine the significance of the development of vernacular writing in medieval Europe.

      The significance of the development of vernacular literature may include: vernacular literature such
      as the chanson de geste and the poems of courtly love played a considerable role in supporting
      and popularizing medieval ideals of courage and heroism that could be understood by the entire
      population; the ideals, morals and ethics of chivalric culture were supported by poems of courtly
      love and fables that gave moral instruction. The tales of heroism that were popular in vernacular
      literature may have served to inspire Crusaders and others who were engaged in difficult struggles.

      The growth of vernacular literature helped to expand literacy and communication by producing
      books in ordinary languages as spoken by the populace that could be read or listened to and the
      information absorbed. The expansion of vernacular literature raised the status of native languages
      and began to develop national consciousness as languages became more formalized and distinct
      from the universal Latin. The demand for vernacular literature produced more writers, poets and
      chroniclers and a great demand for books that helped expand the publishing industry and the
      creation of libraries.

22.   To what extent was the 12th-century renaissance caused by the influx of classical ideas from the
      Islamic world?

      Candidates must analyse the causes of the 12th-century renaissance with an emphasis on the
      significance of the influx of classical ideas and knowledge from the Islamic world. Candidates may
      choose to see classical ideas as being of little relevance but they must address them in their
      response and explain the importance they feel they may have had.

      The reasons that the influx of classical knowledge from the Islamic world may be seen as a cause
      of the 12th-century renaissance may include: large amounts of classical knowledge in science,
      mathematics, medicine, geography and astronomy entered Europe and encouraged increased
      interest in and study of these subjects; the scholars that had gone to Spain to study classical
      knowledge became an intellectual class who could spread their influence upon their return to
      Europe; the influx of classical philosophy such as Aristotle and Plato challenged medieval belief
      systems and the intellectual monopoly of the Church. The influx of, for example, books and
      pamphlets from the libraries of the Muslim world expanded the available supply of materials for
      study and debate and this led to the production of more texts and encouraged increased literacy.

      The other reasons for the 12th-century renaissance may include: the rise in wealth in medieval
      Europe led to the aforementioned increased literacy and produced a demand for more education
      that in turn led to the foundation of universities as centres of new ideas and knowledge; the Italian
      cities revived the study of Roman texts that had survived from the fall of the empire particularly in
      law and medicine and these inspired further study. Church reform and debates within the Church
      on matters of faith produced a new emphasis on logic and analysis of doctrines and scriptures that
      inspired new ideas and concepts. Many secular individuals were now educated as opposed to the
      monopoly held by the Church and they began to take an interest in the study of matters not
      religious in nature; increased curiosity had been the result of exposure to the wider world through
      the Crusades for example.

23.   “Religion was the primary influence on artistic works.” With reference to either the medieval
      European or Islamic world, to what extent do you agree with this statement?

      Religion in both the medieval European and Islamic worlds was the paramount influence on artistic
      works. Religion dictated both the subject matter and the style of artistic works in both faiths. In
      addition religious institutions were major employers of artists in the period and thus controlled the
      nature of artistic works. Places of worship were amongst the main areas where works of art were
      displayed to the public.

      Candidates should illustrate their response in light of the previous statement by using specific
      examples of how the religion that they have chosen to discuss influenced the subject matter, style,
      technique and display of artistic works.

24.   Evaluate the intellectual and cultural influences of the great mosques in the Islamic world.

      The influences of the great mosques may include:

      Intellectual
      Mosques may have been centres of study, debate and discussion amongst scholars and
      individuals. Many mosques had schools attached or associated with them and played an important
      role in the Islamic education of clerics, judges and scholars.

      Cultural
      Mosques were often the centre of a community not only for religious devotion but for
      communication and news, charity and as a place of meeting for its members who may be
      distinguished by tribe or occupation, particularly in cities. Mosques were important cultural
      beacons and the buildings themselves were influenced by a range of architectural schools. In
      addition, the decoration of those buildings, with their intricate geometric and calligraphic
      decoration, were a reflection of the artistic achievements of Islam. Large mosques, such as the
      Aqsa Mosque also demonstrated the power and influence of.

Topic 5    Religion and the state

25.   To what extent did clerics play an important role in the administration of government in medieval
      Europe or the Islamic world?

      Candidates will need to consider the role played by clerics in the administration of government in
      their chosen area. Factors that may be analysed may include the fact that they were literate, which
      enabled them to manage correspondence, keep records, and develop laws and proclamations for
      the ruler. This expanded the ability of central governments to control and monitor their subjects.
      As members of the clergy they created a link between the ruler and the religious authorities that
      could expand the prestige and authority of the ruler with the population. Their communication skills
      and the networks of which they were a part were also valuable to the ruler in promoting and
      communicating his policies to the public. Using clergy in the administration maintained the alliance
      with the Church that rulers also found useful for financial reasons. As members of the clergy they
      were given greater respect than lay persons, which was an advantage when they held positions of
      responsibility and were responsible for proclaiming and enforcing policies.

26.   To what extent was Gregory VII (1073–1085) successful in expanding the power of the Papacy?

      This question requires that candidates assess the extent to which Gregory VII was able to expand
      the power and/or influence of the Papacy. Candidates should not produce a narrative of the
      Investiture Crisis but should examine the impact of Gregory’s actions on the power and influence of
      the Papacy.

      Gregory’s expansion of papal power occurred in two areas: the administration of the Church and
      the relationship of the Papacy and lay rulers.

      In terms of Church administration he was a zealous reformer who expanded the reform programme
      begun earlier. He denounced clerical marriage, simony and other forms of corruption amongst the
      clergy. He made considerable progress and the movement of reform was continued by other
      Popes after him.

      In his Dictatus Papae he asserted the power of the Papacy over all Christians with authority to
      supervise and correct their behaviour. He was superior to all lay rulers and was entitled to remove
      them if they were disobedient, sinful or unjust. In addition he forbade lay investiture of bishops in
      an attempt to defend the independence of the Church.

      The result of Gregory’s actions can be seen as an expansion of papal authority over the Church
      where he exerted absolute control and was zealous in reform. Furthermore his conflict with Henry
      IV extended papal claims of authority and laid the basis for his successors to continue the process
      of asserting power over lay rulers and the right to depose them. Innocent III was an outstanding
      example of papal power in this fashion.

      The argument that Gregory had limited success in the expansion of papal authority may include
      the fact that, despite his authority, Henry IV attacked Rome and drove him out. Lay investiture was
      not forbidden but only modified during the Imperial Diet at Worms in 1122. Powerful rulers were
      able to ignore the Papacy if they chose to do so. The movement for Church reform faltered and fell
      back into corrupt practices within a brief period of time. Gregory’s efforts were very strong but not
      universally supported and without his force of character they faltered as they did not enjoy support
      in all parts of Europe or the Church.

27.   To what extent was the Sunni/Shia divide the result of non-religious factors?

      The Sunni/Shia divide is often seen as a doctrinal dispute with respect to who was entitled to lead
      the Islamic community. Candidates may wish to challenge the question by asserting that the divide
      was one largely of religious doctrine and there was little or no secular component. They may do so
      but must explain why they feel that the secular component was of little or no importance.

      The reasons that the Sunni/Shia divide may be seen as the result of non-religious factors may
      include: disputes over the succession to large territories meant that division and rivalry could be
      based on a desire for power and wealth rather than religion; the identification of certain tribes or
      groups with either Shia or Sunni beliefs could make the division one of ethnicity and tradition rather
      than doctrine; the rise of the Sunnis under the Seljuks and Ottomans as military and political
      leaders and their determination to eliminate rivals for territory and power such as the Fatimids and
      the Safavids may have increased the non-religious motives for the division and made it more
      extensive.

28.   Examine the reasons for the rise and fall of one opposition movement in either medieval Europe
      or the Islamic world.

      The reasons for the rise of opposition movements may include: discontent with behaviour and
      practices of religious leaders; the rise of individuals who gathered support for opposition
      movements; disputes about the leadership of the religion that led to challenges to that authority;
      economic and social change that provoked challenges to established institutions including religion;
      secular leaders may have encouraged movements of religious opposition to increase their power in
      relation to the Church hierarchy; discontent amongst the populace with the degree of Church
      control and exploitation of the economy, property or intellectual and cultural activities.

      The reasons for the fall of opposition movements may include: they failed to attract a powerful
      following and thus could have been suppressed by the Church; the Church reformed certain
      practices to recover the loyalty of dissidents; secular authorities joined the Church in suppressing
      opposition as they may have felt threatened by the discontent; the leader of the opposition
      movement was removed and the movement suffered as a result.

29.   To what extent was European anti-Semitism based on economic factors?

      Candidates may choose to challenge the question and provide alternative explanations but they
      must address the economic issue in their response.

      As the Jews had been banned from many professions they were only able to concentrate in the
      banking and money-lending areas. This was a source of tension that was exacerbated by
      Christians not being permitted to engage in usury. As bankers and money-lenders the Jews were
      resented by many individuals from kings, nobles and merchants to ordinary workers. Many of
      these people such as Phillip IV of France used prejudice against Jews to avoid paying them what
      was owed. Their international connections in banking and trade brought resentment from
      competitors who sought ways to cripple the Jewish businesses by use of discriminatory laws. The
      image of the Jew as a grasping moneylender formed the basis for stereotypes that could be used
      to increase prejudice against them. The lack of legal protection for Jews also made it easy for
      borrowers to refuse to pay debts and so borrowers were anxious that anti-Jewish laws and
      prejudices should be supported or expanded.

      The other factors that may have contributed to anti-Semitism include the Jews' condemnation by
      the Church as the killers of Jesus, their distinctive dress and customs that set them apart and
      made them objects of suspicion as well as general ignorance about their beliefs and customs.
      Stories that they kidnapped and murdered Christian children or that they were responsible for the
      spread of disease created further enmity and prejudice. They were often segregated in towns or
      forced to wear distinctive clothing that further added to their outcast status and led to fear and
      discrimination. The increase in the number of Jews in Europe after 1000 brought more people into
      contact with them and led to increased friction. The Crusading spirit that sought to eliminate
      heretics and infidels created a popular hysteria that led to much violence against the Jews.

30.   “The persecution of heretics in medieval Europe was as much to do with politics and economics as
      it was to do with religion.” Discuss.

      Candidates will have to assess a variety of reasons for the persecution of heretics in medieval
      Europe and decide to what degree they believe that the motives were religious or not. Candidates
      must demonstrate a knowledge of both religious and non-religious motives and be able to use
      them to construct an effective argument.

      The religious motives for the persecution of heretics may include: they offended clerics by
      promoting other beliefs; they were accused of spreading false doctrines that would confuse the
      populace or encourage ignorance or previous primitive practices; they would put the salvation of
      the populace at risk if they followed the heretical doctrines; their teachings were not based on any
      scripture or revealed truths but on the personal views of a few individuals; their presence in a
      Christian society was offensive to God.

      The non-religious motives may include: heretics might challenge Church authority in many areas
      including the ownership of property and the right to collect taxes; heretics would destroy the
      monopoly of the Church over the spiritual life of the population, which would limit their financial and
      political power; heretics might expose corrupt and criminal practices in the Church that might lead
      to unrest and violence against the clergy and Papacy. Secular governments might use the
      criticisms of heretics to limit the authority of the Church, seize its property or limit its privileges;
      heretics might threaten the influence of the Church in intellectual and cultural matters in schools
      and universities. In general heresy would lead to social unrest and this would be a threat to a
      wealthy, privileged institution such as the Church.
