1.   (a)   Why, according to Source A, were the Four Modernizations so important?             [3]

           • The destiny of China depended on their success;
           • They would benefit the Chinese people;
           • They adhered to the ideology of the Chinese Communist Party – Marxism and
             Mao Zedong (Mao Tse-tung) Thought;
           • They would make China a powerful socialist country by the end of the century.

     Award [1] for each relevant point up to a maximum of [3].

     (b)   What is the message conveyed by Source E?                                          [2]

           • The title of the poster and/or the smiling woman imply/implies that people in
             China in 1988 are happy and contented;
           • The woman looks well-dressed, for example she is wearing jewellery, and this
             suggests a good standard of living;
           • China is a modern country and this is represented by the new buildings in the
             background;
           • The government encouraged private or communal enterprise and/or the presence
             of consumer or western goods may be inferred from the drinks that the woman is
             selling.

     Award [1] for each valid point up to a maximum of [2].
                                                 –4–                  M15/3/HISTX/BP1/ENG/TZ0/S3/M


2.   Compare and contrast the views expressed in Sources B and D about the ways in which
     Deng Xiaoping’s economic reforms had an impact on the Chinese people.                            [6]

     For “compare”
     • Both sources mention that a diverse range of individual enterprises developed in the rural
       areas. Fish farming and toy factories are specifically mentioned in both and/or refer to the
       development of private enterprise: Source B to “the private sector” and Source D to
       “private and collective enterprises”;
     • Both sources state that farmers and people in rural areas benefitted from these and
       became wealthier;
     • Source B mentions that Deng encouraged foreign investors and Source D mentions that
       Deng set up Special Economic Zones (SEZs) where tax benefits attracted foreign
       manufacturers;
     • Both sources mention that problems such as crime and/or inflation developed.

     For “contrast”
     • Source B says that “farmers often complained” about unfair allocations whereas
       Source D states that “agricultural changes were easily accomplished”;
     • The crimes mentioned in Source B (smuggling, fraud and forgery) are of a more
       economic nature whereas the problems and crimes mentioned in Source D
       (child labour, unsafe factories, gangs, prostitution and sale of women) are more socially
       inclined;
     • Source B says that inflation was a recurring problem whereas Source D says that it
       only got out of control in mid-1988 and that created political unrest;
     • The focus of Source B is more on the impact in the countryside whereas Source D
       develops the impact of the SEZs on the coast and inland cities.

     Do not demand all of the above. If only one source is discussed award a maximum of [2].
     If the two sources are discussed separately award [3] or with excellent linkage [4–5].
     For maximum [6] expect a detailed running comparison/contrast.

3.   With reference to their origin and purpose, assess the value and limitations of Source C and
     Source E for historians studying Deng Xiaoping’s modernization programme.                          [6]

     Source C
     Origin:        This source is from Deng Xiaoping and the Transformation of China by
                    Ezra F Vogel, a retired professor of social sciences and the former director of
                    the East Asian Research Center and Chairman of the Council of East Asian
                    Studies at Harvard University. The book was published in 2011.

     Purpose:       It is a biography of Deng Xiaoping from an academic perspective and its
                    purpose is to inform fellow academics and a general readership about
                    Deng Xiaoping’s life and to explain and analyse his actions as leader of China.

     Value:         Vogel is a retired professor of social sciences, former director of the East
                    Asian Research Center and Chairman of the Council for East Asian Studies at
                    Harvard University; he is therefore a specialist in East Asian countries. The
                    book’s academic purpose means that it is likely to be more objective than a
                    piece of propaganda. The book was published in 2011 and therefore he may
                    have had access to the more recent sources. Sufficient time has passed
                    since the death of Deng Xiaoping in 1997 and this allows for the benefit of
                    hindsight and reflection. The title of the book suggests a specific focus on
                    Deng’s era and reforms.

     Limitations:   Vogel is a retired professor and academic at Harvard and therefore he may
                    have a Western perspective about Deng Xiaoping’s policies in China and/or
                    he is unlikely to have experienced Deng’s policies firsthand. Due to continued
                    censorship in the PRC access to official Chinese sources would be limited.

     Source E
     Origin:        This source is a poster designed by Peng Ming and published in China
                    in 1988.

     Purpose:       It is a propaganda poster designed to reinforce the idea that life in China is
                    good. It implies that the economic restructuring of China is working and that
                    individual enterprises are successful. As such, it may also be aimed at
                    encouraging people to embark on individual enterprises.

     Value:         It may be an example of Chinese government propaganda that was used to
                    promote its modernization programme. It would allow an historian to see how
                    propaganda was used. Since the poster is from the time in question it can
                    give an insight into the nature of Deng’s modernization programme.

     Limitations:   It was published in China in 1988 and would have been subject to censorship.
                    It presents an idealized version of the individual enterprise system. It does not
                    have the benefit of hindsight.

     Do not expect all of the above. Ideally there will be a balance between the two sources, and
     each one can be marked out of [3], but allow a [4/2] split. If only one source is assessed,
     mark out of [4]. For a maximum of [6] candidates must refer to both origin and purpose, and
     value and limitations.

4.   “Deng Xiaoping’s economic policies up to 1989 were successful, but progress was not
     always smooth.” Using the sources and your own knowledge, to what extent do you agree
     with this statement?                                                                              [8]

     Source material
     Source A      This source outlines Deng Xiaoping’s aim to use the Four Modernizations to
                   change China into a powerful socialist country by the end of the century.
                   One may infer that he anticipates that modernizing the economy may meet
                   with opposition because he emphasizes that this will benefit China and
                   says that all sections of society must be involved. He states that the Four
                   Modernizations are in keeping with the ideology of the Chinese Communist
                   Party.

     Source B       This source discusses the removal of collective agriculture and the increase
                    in production that ensued. It says that rural incomes rose and farmers
                    benefitted and were successful despite complaints about unfair allocations.
                    This source also describes the successes of the enterprises, which provided
                    employment to 100 million rural workers. It mentions the new businesses
                    and industries that developed in the cities and how Deng aimed to speed up
                    industrial development by encouraging foreign investors. Despite the
                    successes, crime and inflation developed.

     Source C       This source mentions the ways in which Deng’s economic policies reformed
                    agriculture and combatted unemployment in the cities. It describes the
                    individual household enterprises that were part of Deng’s economic policies.
                    It states that these reforms were very popular and successful. However,
                    Deng used the “threat of starvation” to effect change in the countryside and
                    he used the potential for increased crime in the cities to overcome opposition
                    from within the Party leadership to his policies.

     Source D       This source identifies the economic restructuring in agriculture and claims
                    that this was easily accomplished and that farmers were getting richer.
                    It describes the industrial reforms with the creation of the Special Economic
                    Zones (SEZs) and the manufacturing boom. There were geographical
                    limitations to the prosperity because not all of China benefitted. It also looks
                    at the negative outcomes of exploitation, crime, inflation, corruption and
                    mismanagement and the unrest that ensued.

     Source E       This source is a propaganda poster depicting the success of the individual
                    enterprise economic policies, the modernization of buildings and
                    communications, and the presence of consumer and Western goods.
                    Propaganda was used to persuade people that Deng’s policies were
                    working.

     Own knowledge
     The aims of Deng’s economic policies were: to stimulate China’s domestic economy; open
     Chinese trade to the outside world; allow the development of individual enterprises; and
     encourage joint ventures with both Chinese and foreign investment. There may be details of
     increases in agricultural output and GDP; Jobs in the Special Economic Zones (SEZs) were
     highly sought after because wages and conditions were better than elsewhere. Urban
     workers had more freedom to travel. Overall, the standard of living for the majority of
     Chinese people did improve and Western popular culture was allowed. Schools and
     universities expanded and students were sent overseas to learn about Western technology
     and gain industrial expertise.

Some of the problems that arose were the peasants’ uncertainty about property rights, which
was not resolved until 1987; the continued use of inefficient methods; loss of the iron rice
bowl; workers in state-owned enterprises resisted reform because they no longer had
guaranteed employment and initially limited social security. Other problems included the
resistance to change by some CCP members; the advent of unemployment; the rise in food
prices; hoarding; mass migration to the cities; increase in strikes; details of inflation,
development of “two” economies and wealth inequality; corruption and the role of the party
elites (and their children). The one-child policy could also be mentioned. Deng introduced
economic reform, but he did not allow political reform. Increased protests in 1988 culminated
in the Tiananmen Square demonstrations in 1989. Deng resisted demands for the “Fifth
Modernization” of political democracy and he adhered to the Four Cardinal Principles that he
stated in 1979.

The focus of the response should not be an extensive discussion about the political issues
and/or Tiananmen Square (1989).

Do not expect all of the above, and accept other relevant material. If only source material or
only own knowledge is used, the maximum mark that can be obtained is [5]. For maximum
[8] expect argument, synthesis of source material and own knowledge, as well as references
to the sources used.
