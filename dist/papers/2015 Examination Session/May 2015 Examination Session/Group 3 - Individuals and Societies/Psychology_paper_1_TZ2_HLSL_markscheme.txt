                                              Section A

Biological level of analysis

1.   Describe one evolutionary explanation of one behaviour.                                          [8]

     Refer to the paper 1 section A markbands below when awarding marks.

     The command term “describe” requires candidates to give a detailed account of one
     evolutionary explanation of one behaviour. An evolutionary explanation of behaviour should
     be based on Darwin’s theory of natural or sexual selection.

     Evolutionary explanations may include, but are not limited to:
     • mating behaviours (Wedekind, 1995; Buss, 1990)
     • emotions; for example, disgust (Fessler, 2006)
     • dysfunctional behaviour; for example, phobias (Seligman, 1971)
     • altruism (Dawkins, 1976).

     If a candidate describes more than one explanation, or more than one behaviour, credit
     should be given only to the first explanation, or the first behaviour.

     If a candidate describes a study of genetic influence rather than an evolutionary explanation,
     but attempts to link it to the evolution of behaviour, up to a maximum of [3] should be
     awarded.

     If a candidate only describes an appropriate study without clearly describing the evolutionary
     explanation, up to a maximum of [3] should be awarded.

     If a candidate only describes Darwin’s theory of natural selection or sexual selection without
     linking it to a specific behaviour, up to a maximum of [3] should be awarded.

     0           The answer does not reach a standard described by the descriptors below.

     1 to 3      There is an attempt to answer the question, but knowledge and understanding is
                 limited, often inaccurate, or of marginal relevance to the question.

     4 to 6      The question is partially answered. Knowledge and understanding is accurate
                 but limited. Either the command term is not effectively addressed or the
                 response is not sufficiently explicit in answering the question.

     7 to 8      The question is answered in a focused and effective manner and meets the
                 demands of the command term. The response is supported by appropriate and
                 accurate knowledge and understanding of research.

Cognitive level of analysis

2.   Explain why one particular research method is used at the cognitive level of analysis.           [8]

     Refer to the paper 1 section A markbands below when awarding marks.

     The command term “explain” requires candidates to give a detailed account of reasons why
     one particular research method is used at the cognitive level of analysis.

     Research methods referenced may include but are not limited to: experiments, observations,
     interviews and case studies.

     Explanation about “why” the method is used might refer to the appropriateness of the
     method, issues of validity and reliability, sample choice and size, ease and cost of the
     procedure, and the generalizability of findings. Candidates may address the strengths of the
     method as a means of explaining why it would be used, as well as how it reflects the
     principles of the cognitive level of analysis, ie candidates could make clear how the selected
     research method underpins one or more principles of the cognitive level of analysis.

     Candidates are not required to describe the method in detail nor provide a study to support
     their response; however, the use of the research must be explicitly linked to the cognitive
     level of analysis.

     If a candidate explains more than one research method, credit should be given only to the
     first method.

     If a candidate explains a method but does not explicitly link it to the cognitive level of
     analysis, a maximum of [3] should be awarded.

Sociocultural level of analysis

3.   Outline social identity theory with reference to one relevant study.                              [8]

     Refer to the paper 1 section A markbands below when awarding marks.

     The command term “outline” requires candidates to give a brief account of social identity
     theory, referring to one relevant study.

     Responses should present the key concepts of the social identity theory such as social
     categorization (ingroup/outgroup), social comparison and positive ingroup distinctiveness,
     with reference to one relevant study.

     Relevant studies may include, but are not limited to:
     • Tajfel’s studies on social groups and identities
     • Sherif et al.’s Robber’s Cave study (1961)
     • Cialdini et al.’s Basking in Reflected Glory study (1976).
     • Abrams’s study of the role of social identity theory on levels of conformity (1990)
     • Maass’s study of the role of social identity theory on violence (2003).

     If a candidate refers to more than one study, credit should be given only to the first study.

     If a candidate outlines the theory without making reference to a study, up to a maximum
     of [4] should be awarded.

     If a candidate only describes an appropriate study, without making reference to social identity
     theory, up to a maximum of [3] should be awarded.

                                              Section B
4.   Discuss the use of brain imaging technology in investigating the relationship between
     biological factors and behaviour.                                                             [22]

     Refer to the paper 1 section B assessment criteria when awarding marks.

     The command term “discuss” requires candidates to offer a considered and balanced review
     of the use of brain imaging technology in investigating the relationship between biological
     factors and behaviour. The focus of the response must be on how brain imaging technology
     is used to understand how biological factors (such as hormones, neurotransmitters, brain
     structure) interact with a specific behaviour (such as language production, memory,
     emotion).

     Brain imaging technologies could include, but are not limited to:
     • CAT/CT (computerized tomography)
     • PET (positron emission tomography)
     • MRI (magnetic resonance imaging)
     • fMRI (functional magnetic resonance imaging)
     • EEG (electroencephalography)
     • TCI (transcranial imaging).

     Discussion may include, but is not limited to:
     • how brain imaging technologies have improved our understanding of the relationship
        between biological factors and behaviour
     • differences in why and how different technologies are used
     • evaluation of the techniques (for example, cost/benefit analysis, reductionism)
     • ethical and methodological considerations in the use of the technology.

     It is important that candidates discuss the use of the technology and not simply evaluate
     studies. Although an understanding of how the technology works may be beneficial, it is not
     required for top marks to be awarded.

     Candidates may discuss one brain imaging technology in order to demonstrate depth of
     knowledge, or may discuss more than one brain imaging technology in order to demonstrate
     breadth of knowledge. Both approaches are equally acceptable.

5.   Discuss two ethical considerations related to research studies at the cognitive level
     of analysis.                                                                                    [22]

     Refer to the paper 1 section B assessment criteria when awarding marks.

     The command term “discuss” requires candidates to offer a considered and balanced review
     of ethical considerations related to research studies at the cognitive level of analysis.

     Ethical considerations may be positive (what guidelines were followed) or negative
     (what guidelines were not followed).

     Ethical considerations may include, but are not limited to:
     • deception
     • protection from physical or mental harm
     • briefing and debriefing
     • right to withdraw from a study
     • informed consent
     • anonymity/confidentiality.

     Case studies that examine both biological and cognitive factors may be used to address the
     demands of the question, but the focus must be on the cognitive factors in the study.

     Discussion of ethical considerations may include, but is not limited to:
     • why deception is used
     • a cost-benefit analysis approach with regard to ethical considerations
     • the meaning of “informed” consent and who has the right to give it
     • changes over time in adherence to ethical standards/guidelines
     • why anonymity/confidentiality of data is important.

     The focus of the response should be on ethical considerations and not on the description of
     studies.

     If a candidate discusses more than two ethical considerations, credit should be given only to
     the first two discussions.

     Candidates may discuss a small number of studies in order to demonstrate depth of
     knowledge, or may discuss a larger number of studies in order to demonstrate breadth of
     knowledge. Both approaches are equally acceptable.

     If a candidate discusses only one ethical consideration, the response should be awarded up
     to a maximum of [5] for criterion A, knowledge and comprehension, up to a maximum of [4]
     for criterion B, critical thinking, and up to a maximum of [2] for criterion C, organization.

     If a candidate discusses ethical considerations but does not relate them to research studies
     from the cognitive level of analysis, the response should be awarded up to a maximum of [3]
     for criterion A, knowledge and comprehension, up to a maximum of [3] for criterion B,
     critical thinking, and up to a maximum of [2] for criterion C, organization.

6.   Examine the use of two compliance techniques.                                                   [22]

     Refer to the paper 1 section B assessment criteria when awarding marks.

     The command term “examine” requires candidates to consider two compliance techniques in
     a way that uncovers the assumptions underlying these techniques.

     Compliance techniques that may be examined include, but are not limited to:
     • reciprocity
     • foot-in-the-door
     • door-in-the-face
     • low-balling.

     Assumptions may include, but are not limited to:
     • levels of compliance may be affected by factors such as liking, authority, etc
     • the role of cognitive dissonance
     • an individual’s need for social acceptance
     • the role of goal gradients
     • efficacy of the techniques
     • self-perception theory.

     If a candidate examines more than two compliance techniques, credit should be given only
     to the first two compliance techniques. However, candidates may address other techniques
     and should be awarded marks for these as long as they are clearly used to clarify the
     examination of one or both of the two main techniques addressed in the response.

     If a candidate examines only one compliance technique, the response should be awarded up
     to a maximum of [5] for criterion A, knowledge and comprehension, up to a maximum of [4]
     for criterion B, critical thinking, and up to a maximum of [2] for criterion C, organization.
