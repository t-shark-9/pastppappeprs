Paper 3 markbands: The following bands provide a précis of the full markbands for paper 3 published in
the History guide (2008) on pages 77–81. They are intended to assist marking, but must be used in
conjunction with the full markbands found in the guide. For the attention of all examiners: if you are
uncertain about the content/accuracy of a candidate’s work please contact your team leader.

 18–20: Answers are clearly focused, with a high degree of awareness of the question, and may
        challenge it successfully. Knowledge is extensive, accurately applied and there may be a
        high level of conceptual ability. Evaluation of different approaches may be present as may be
        understanding of historical processes as well as comparison and contrast where relevant.
        Evaluation is integrated into the answer. The answer is well-structured and well-focused.
        Synthesis is highly developed.
 15–17: Answers are clearly structured and focused, have full awareness of the demands of the
        question, and if appropriate may challenge it. Accurate and detailed historical knowledge is
        used convincingly to support critical commentary. Historical processes such as comparison
        and contrast, placing events in context and evaluating different interpretations are used
        appropriately and effectively. Answers are well-structured and balanced and synthesis is
        well-developed and supported with knowledge and critical commentary.
 12–14: Answers are clearly focused on the demands of the question. Relevant in-depth knowledge
        is applied as evidence, and analysis or critical commentary is used to indicate some in-depth
        understanding, but is not consistent throughout. Events are placed in context and there is
        sound understanding of historical processes and comparison and contrast. Evaluation of
        different approaches may be used to substantiate arguments presented. Synthesis is
        present, but not always consistently integrated. Focus on AO3 and AO4.
 9–11: Answers indicate that the question is understood, but not all implications considered.
        Knowledge is largely accurate. Critical commentary may be present. Events are generally
        placed in context, and historical processes, such as comparison and contrast, are
        understood. There is a clear attempt at a structured approach. Focus on AO1, AO2 and
        AO4. Responses that simply summarize the views of historians cannot reach the top of this
        markband.
 7–8:   The demands of the question are generally understood. Relevant, historical knowledge is
        present but is unevenly applied. Knowledge is narrative or descriptive in nature. There may
        be limited argument that requires further substantiation. Critical commentary may be present.
        There is an attempt to place events in historical context and show an understanding of
        historical processes. An attempt at a structured approach, either chronological or thematic
        has been made.
 5–6:   Answers indicate some understanding of the question, but historical knowledge is limited in
        quality and quantity. Understanding of historical processes may be present but
        underdeveloped. The question is only partially addressed.
 3–4:    There is little understanding of the question. Historical knowledge is present but the detail is
         insufficient. Historical context or processes are barely understood and there are little more
         than poorly substantiated assertions.
 1–2:    Answers do not meet the demands of the question and show little or no evidence of
         appropriate structure. There is little more than unsupported generalization.
 0:      Answers not meeting the requirements of descriptors should be awarded no marks.

 Examiners and moderators are reminded of the need to apply the markbands that provide the
 “best fit” to the responses given by candidates and to award credit wherever it is possible to
 do so. If an answer indicates that the demands of the question are understood and addressed but
 that not all implications are considered (eg, compare or contrast; reasons or significance;
 methods or success), then examiners should not be afraid of using the full range of marks allowed
 for by the markscheme: ie, responses that offer good coverage of some of the criteria should be
 rewarded accordingly.

Independence movements

1.   “It was the growing resentment of the Creoles toward peninsular Spaniards that encouraged wars
     of independence in Latin America.” With reference to one country in the Americas (excluding
     Cuba), to what extent do you agree with this statement?

Candidates can choose to agree or disagree with this view. “To what extent” indicates that other
reasons or causes should be considered. However, answers should not simply be a review of all
potential causes. Candidates should select one country to illustrate their response. Candidates who
refer to Spanish America as a whole only demonstrate some understanding of the question; however it is
acceptable to refer to countries in the aggregate or individually (for example Gran Colombia or Colombia,
Ecuador, Venezuela or Panama). Brazil is not a valid choice.


     Evidence of the growing resentment of the Creoles toward peninsular Spaniards may
     include: the animosities resulting from the Bourbon reforms that strengthened the control of the
     crown over the colonial governments and threatened Creole status and influence (such as the
     creation of new viceroyalties that dislocated the local colonial economies; the intendancy system;
     the impossibility of buying court appointments; the privileged position of peninsular merchants); the
     upsetting of the status quo that had allowed Creole elites to prosper under the lax administration of
     the Hapsburgs (assuming roles in key sectors of the economy, holding political posts at a local or
     regional level, participating in international trade through smuggling); the influence of the ideas of
     the Enlightenment that bred resentment against the Bourbon interventionist state; the impact of the
     expulsion of the Jesuits (most of whom were Creoles).

     Other factors encouraging independence movements could be: the inspiration from the
     French and the American Revolutions; the opposition to mercantilist policies and to growing
     restrictions and exactions on the colonies; the impact of events in Europe that demonstrated the
     crown´s inability to defend its colonies (such as the Napoleonic invasions, the restoration of
     Ferdinand VII).

     Candidates may argue that the Bourbon reforms actually made the Creoles turn to cabildos (town
     councils) as bases for Creole authority. In turn, these cabildos promoted the creation of juntas to
     rule the colonies while the king of Spain was imprisoned. Others may make reference to the fact
     that the inability of the crown to defend its colonies enabled the formation of colonial militias that
     would increase Creole confidence in their ability to defend themselves.

     The above material is an indication of what candidates may elect to write about in their responses.
     However, it is not exhaustive and no set answer is required.

     Examiners and moderators are reminded of the need to apply the markbands that provide the
     “best fit” to the responses given by candidates and to award credit wherever it is possible
     to do so.

2.   Examine the influence of political ideas on the nature of the United States Declaration of
     Independence.

     Political ideas had a most profound impact among the factors that influenced the nature of the
     Declaration of Independence. While events may be mentioned, they should be considered
     relevant in proportion to their representation of political ideology and influence on the content of the
     Declaration.

     Political ideas: political theory expressed by Enlightenment philosophers, notably John Locke’s
     contract theory of government, the natural rights of man and the “right of revolution” concept,
     influenced the thinking of the Declaration’s main author (Thomas Jefferson) and contributors (John
     Adams and Benjamin Franklin); hostilities commenced 14 months prior to the issuance of the
     Declaration, thus raising the question of whether the colonies were seeking reforms or sovereignty;
     Thomas Paine’s authorship of the pamphlet, Common Sense, helped to focus the colonists’
     attention on the goal of full independence, rather than reform (based on the colonies alleged
     superior political morality); the Declaration incorporated the ideas of many previously issued
     declarations from towns, assemblies, grand juries and political bodies (for example Sons of Liberty)
     asserting self-rule and local autonomy; as hostilities became more intense, American leaders
     realized the growing importance of galvanizing colonial public opinion and promoted these political
     ideals to help overcome the limited extent of colonial unity, substantial apathy toward the war effort
     and the existence of a significant faction of Loyalists; American leaders realized their war
     resources were quite limited and that they desperately needed foreign intervention to contest the
     power of the British military.

     Nature of the Declaration: Thomas Jefferson expressed the contract and natural rights theories in
     referencing the right to “life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness”, (similar to Locke’s “life, liberty
     and property”); the Declaration also alleged the “right of revolution” in stating, “…whenever any
     form of government becomes destructive of these ends, it is the right of people to alter or abolish
     it…”; the list of grievances against King George III alleged that he had violated the natural rights
     and contract theories and listed numerous specific examples taken predominantly from events of
     1763 to 1776; the authors hoped the accusations would provide an ideological justification against
     George III that would gain support from colonists angry over issues such as the imposition of taxes
     without consent, suspension of trial by jury or the hiring of mercenaries; the assertion of
     independence was designed also to solicit foreign intervention and substantial aid in money, arms
     and personnel (to this point, foreign assistance had been covert and limited) by appealing to liberal
     interests abroad.

     The above material is an indication of what candidates may elect to write about in their responses.
     However, it is not exhaustive and no set answer is required.

     Examiners and moderators are reminded of the need to apply the markbands that provide the
     “best fit” to the responses given by candidates and to award credit wherever it is possible
     to do so.

Nation-building and challenges

3.   “Independence delivered sovereignty without stability.” With reference to one country in Latin
     America in the first half of the 19th century, to what extent do you agree with this statement?

     Most candidates will agree with the statement and are likely to identify several factors that affected
     the stability in the newly-independent states. The best answers will address social, political, and
     economic challenges to the establishment of stable political systems after independence. Answers
     should be supported by specific evidence from one country of the region, (not Latin America as a
     whole), and should be relevant to the timeframe demanded by the question.

     Possible sources of instability could include: the complexity of the social, political and
     economic panorama after independence that made political organization difficult (for example
     physical destruction, high cost of the wars of independence, the difficulties in tax collection, the
     high public debt, the disruption of colonial trade patterns); class and racial conflict; post-
     independence fragmentation and regionalist disputes; divergent views between liberals and
     conservatives on issues such as: the form of government to be adopted, the extent of regional
     autonomy, and the role that religion and traditional values and beliefs would play. The lack of
     experience in self-government, and the difficulties in the implementation of liberal philosophies and
     ideals also played a role. Although some reference to the threats from caudillos (regional
     strongmen) is appropriate, the focus of the response should not be on caudillos.

     The above material is an indication of what candidates may elect to write about in their responses.
     However, it is not exhaustive and no set answer is required.

     Examiners and moderators are reminded of the need to apply the markbands that provide the
     “best fit” to the responses given by candidates and to award credit wherever it is possible
     to do so.

4.   “The constitution of 1787 produced a radical change in the US political system.” To what extent do
     you agree with this statement?

     Candidates will need to establish a definition or criteria by which “radical change” is defined or
     evaluated. Some narrative as to the content of the two constitutions (Articles of Confederation and
     US Constitution of 1787) is required but analysis as to “extent” of “radical change” is the necessary
     analytical emphasis and comparison of the two political systems is necessary. It is likely that most
     candidates will support the concept that the extent of change was “radical” but remain open to
     those who might challenge the statement so long as support is specific and detailed.

     Supporting points for radical change: the Articles of Confederation was, by definition, a loosely
     unified group of largely sovereign states while the Constitution created a federal system of
     government that placed specific limits on state sovereignty as well as asserting a supremacy
     clause as to the federal government’s power in relationship to the states; while the Articles had
     provided for equal political power between large and small states, the new constitution provided
     large states more authority by basing membership of the lower house of Congress on proportional
     representation; while the Articles provided for only a single branch – the legislative – the new
     constitution added a national judiciary and an executive branch; the Articles had required a
     super-majority (9 of 13) for passing major legislation and unanimity for amending the constitution
     while the Constitution of 1787 provided for most legislative decisions to be approved by a simple
     majority vote and allowed constitutional changes on the basis of a 2/3 vote of Congress with
     approval by 3/4 of the states; the new constitution provided substantial federal powers that did not
     exist under the Articles, including the power to tax and to regulate interstate commerce.

     Points that might be applied to challenge “radical change”: both constitutions were based on
     the concept of representative government, but limited political participation based on race, sex and
     property ownership; the social structure of the US was not significantly changed by the initial
     passage of the Constitution of 1787; it might be argued that under the Constitution of 1787, state
     sovereignty was the main basis for political authority and that federalism gradually evolved and
     ultimately became predominate due to Supreme Court decisions and the impact of the Civil War.

     The above material is an indication of what candidates may elect to write about in their responses.
     However, it is not exhaustive and no set answer is required.

United States Civil War: causes, course and effects 1840–1877

5.   “The problems associated with westward expansion were the most significant causes of the US
     Civil War.” To what extent do you agree with this statement?

     Candidates may choose to agree or disagree with the statement, but their response must
     thoroughly assess the factor of westward expansion as an element of Civil War causation. If
     candidates disagree with the quotation they must provide detailed evidence and analysis in support
     of the alternative theory.

     Westward expansion issues: During the 1800s, westward expansion increasingly centred on the
     need for more productive land to replace that which had experienced “soil exhaustion” due to
     continual tobacco and cotton planting. The issue of North–South political power in Congress to
     protect economic interests would eventually come to dominate the issue of expansion.
     Sectionalism associated with westward expansion emerged with the Louisiana Purchase and led to
     subsequent questions of “free state” versus “slave state” balance of power in Congress; however,
     the Missouri Compromise (1820) provided a politically acceptable agreement into the late 1840s.

     The annexation of Texas (1845) and its admission as a slave state, along with the territory
     acquired in the Mexican Cession (1848) severely threatened the stability of the North–South
     balance of power; the Wilmot Proviso, which would have banned slavery in all territory acquired in
     the Mexican-American War, showed the strong differences over westward expansion of slavery;
     the South was driven by soil exhaustion and concerns over growing Northern dominance in the
     House of Representatives; the North was affected by emerging commercial and manufacturing
     interests, the “Free Soil” movement and abolitionism; the Compromise of 1850 failed to ameliorate
     either side and the advancement of popular sovereignty doctrine (Kansas-Nebraska Act of 1854)
     raised additional uncertainties as to slavery expansion in the territories; the potential for violence
     was illustrated by the events of “bleeding Kansas”; efforts of Southern expansionists, (William
     Walker in Nicaragua and the Black Warrior incident in Cuba), indicated that expansion for the
     purpose of adding slave-holding territory was a threat to the status quo; the attempt by President
     Pierce and southern politicians to annex Cuba (Ostend Manifesto – 1854) added to the potential
     for conflict; the platform of Lincoln and the Republican Party (1860), adamantly opposed to slavery
     expansion, was seen by the South as an unacceptable threat to their interests and led to secession
     and the Civil War.

     Other factors that might be advanced include: social, economic and cultural differences
     between the North and South; emergence and growth of sectionalism; states’ rights and
     nullification theory; abolitionism; slavery; and the failure of political parties and their leaders.

     The above material is an indication of what candidates may elect to write about in their responses.
     However, it is not exhaustive and no set answer is required.

     Examiners and moderators are reminded of the need to apply the markbands that provide the
     “best fit” to the responses given by candidates and to award credit wherever it is possible

6.   Compare and contrast the effectiveness of one Union and one Confederate military leader during
     the US Civil War.

     While the focus is on leadership exercised during the war, allow some attention to their background
     and personalities as relevant to their performance as wartime leaders. Candidates may focus on
     Ulysses S Grant and Robert E Lee (as outlined below); however, they could instead elect to
     concentrate on others, such as William T Sherman and Thomas J “Stonewall” Jackson. Any two
     military leaders are acceptable if the comparison and contrast is factually and analytically
     supported. Some candidates may choose to evaluate Lincoln or Davis as “military leaders”, due to
     their roles as “Commander in Chief” of their respective governments, provided that their focus is on
     military, rather than political, leadership.

     Comparison: Neither Lee nor Grant held the full command of their respective countries’ army at
     the beginning of the war but both would receive consolidated commands as the war progressed.
     They were revered by the public, though at different times and for somewhat different reasons.
     Grant gained public reverence by the end of the war for leading the Union to victory and Lee was
     revered throughout most of the war and post-war period as the best representation of the “lost
     cause” of the Confederacy. Both faced brief demotions early in the Civil War and later there were
     calls for their removal from command by critics within their respective governments (Grant for
     heavy drinking and high casualties; Lee for his failed invasion of the North and heavy losses at
     Antietam and Gettysburg). Both men were generally well-regarded by their soldiers, Grant for his
     willingness to act aggressively in attempting to achieve victory and Lee for his tactical capacity,
     personal qualities and humane leadership style.

     Contrast: Whereas Lee has been regarded by military historians as a brilliant tactician, revisionist
     historians have questioned his strategic vision of the war especially as it relates to the battles of
     Antietam and Gettysburg. Grant was generally given little credit by his contemporaries as to
     tactical expertise and was credited mainly for perseverance and application of superior manpower
     and material. However, revisionists have acknowledged Grant as being an effective strategist.
     While Lee was given command of the Army of Northern Virginia shortly after the beginning of the
     war, Grant had difficulty gaining an officer’s appointment. However, his successful capture of Fort
     Henry and Fort Donaldson in 1862 led to his promotion to Major General. This was followed by a
     victory at Shiloh, but the severe casualties his troops suffered led to a temporary demotion. His
     successful siege of Vicksburg split the Confederacy and achieved control of the Mississippi River.
     Nonetheless, he was criticized for alleged drunkenness and labelled by some as “butcher Grant”
     for very high casualty rates and for fighting a war of attrition. In accepting the surrender of Lee at
     Appomattox, he gained considerable respect for his humane terms offered to the defeated foe. In
     contrast, Lee faced no questions as to his moral character or personal conduct, but was initially
     criticized for his lack of aggression until his success in the Peninsular Campaign and the Second
     Battle of Bull Run.

     Do not expect all of the above and accept some imbalance. Better answers will provide a running
     comparison with direct linkage.

The development of modern nations 1865–1929

7.   Examine the causes of immigration to two countries of the Americas between 1865 and 1929.

     The question allows candidates to analyse the causal factors, be they social, religious, political, or
     economic, that can be said to have motivated the decision to leave their homeland (“push” factors)
     and to feel attracted to the countries of destination (“pull” factors). While essays that emphasize
     “push factors” will make reference to countries outside the region, reward responses that apply
     in-depth knowledge relevant to the Americas. Answers will vary according to the selected
     countries. Any two countries should be accepted but popular choices will be: Argentina, Brazil,
     the US, and Canada. Focus should remain on the reasons why the immigrants came, not on
     impact of the immigrants. Reward answers with explicit analysis and clear examples. The period
     is 1865–1929 so do not accept more recent immigration patterns.

     Possible reasons why people left their homeland: demographic pressure; negative effects of
     modernization and industrialization (low wages, unemployment); racial and/or religious
     persecution; wars and political turmoil.

     Possible reasons why people elected to go to a specific country: opportunities to make
     progress (job opportunities, better wages); the possibility of social mobility; greater freedoms; the
     availability of land and resources; the glowing reports from earlier arrivals (chain migration); the
     assistance provided by those who had migrated before which made adaptation less painful;
     cheaper and faster transportation; the existence of government schemes to promote and assist
     immigration; the need for labour in the destination countries (for example, in Brazil “colonos” were
     needed to work on the plantations after slavery had been abolished, in Argentina there was a need
     to develop the agricultural sector, whilst in the US, labour was required during a period of growth of
     industrial power).

8.   Evaluate the impact of Social Darwinism on any two countries of the Americas during the period
     1865 to 1929.

     Background: The concept of Social Darwinism, developed by Herbert Spencer, sought to apply
     the “survival of the fittest” and “natural selection” theories to the relationships of social, business,
     cultural and even national groups.

     The specific impact will vary depending upon the examples selected, but candidates may address
     economic, political and social/cultural influences.

     Economic factors may include: balance of trade, development of infrastructure, job creation,
     industrial development, resource exploitation and environmental impact.

     Political factors may include: status of national sovereignty, governmental philosophy and
     systems, dominance of a political party, social class or authoritarian figure, extent of local
     autonomy and territorial gain or loss.

     Social/cultural factors may include: religion, language, arts and entertainment, class structure,
     race and ethnic relationships, cultural borrowing and ethnocentrism.

Emergence of the Americas in global affairs 1880–1929

9.   “The US fought the Spanish–American War of 1898 to obtain Cuba’s freedom from Spain.”
     To what extent do you agree with this statement?

     The focus of the question is on the causes of the Spanish–American War, namely on the motives
     that guided US declaration of war on Spain. “To what extent” indicates that other reasons or
     causes have to be taken into consideration. Candidates might agree or disagree with this view, but
     should provide specific examples to support either position. Candidates may argue convincingly
     that guaranteeing Cuba independence was only one of the several motives that drove the US to
     declare war on Spain. In support of the statement, candidates may assert that the US had a moral
     duty to assist the Cuban nationalists in their demand of independence from Spanish colonial
     domination (reference to the Monroe Doctrine can be made). Some might consider this motive
     only a pretext for intervention. Either point of view might be accepted providing that the argument
     is supported by historical evidence. Stronger answers might distinguish between those motives
     that were more “idealistic” and those dominated by US “self-interest”, and between short and
     longer-term causes.

     Possible reasons could include: the sympathy felt in the US for the plight of the Cubans
     (poverty, malnutrition, ill treatment by the Spanish colonial authorities); the outrage felt for Spanish
     actions (for example, Weyler’s concentration camps); the growing demands for an expansionist
     policy (extending Manifest Destiny to Cuba); the US aim of removing European (for example
     Spanish) influence from Latin America; US perception of Cuba as part of her sphere of influence;
     Cuba’s strategic and economic value for the US (a free Cuba would mean expanded markets for
     US business); the influence of the yellow press and of the publication of the De Lome letter on US
     public opinion, which fueled anti-Spanish and pro-Cuban hysteria; the sinking of the USS Maine
     and McKinley’s war message.

10.   “The impact of the First World War was largely positive.” With reference to one country in the
      Americas (excluding the US), to what extent do you agree with this statement?

      Candidates may choose to agree or disagree with this statement, but must address “to what
      extent” and support their position with knowledge and analysis. Both short and long-term effects of
      the war may be considered and some of the effects may properly be evaluated as having been
      either beneficial and/or harmful. The question is not restricted only to nations of the region that
      were belligerents in the First World War. Remain open to effects in addition to those mentioned
      below.

      Possible areas of discussion:

      Economic impact

      For Canada, the war produced high inflation that led to strikes, lockouts and labour unrest as
      illustrated by the six-week general strike in Winnipeg (1919); Canada contributed great quantities
      of food, raw materials and munitions to the war effort; the war effort aided Canada’s
      industrialization and mass-production techniques, led to nationalization of bankrupt railroads,
      introduction of an income tax and control of commodity prices.

      For Latin America, candidates may discuss the fluctuations in international trade which included
      the initial loss of traditional markets followed by the increase in the demands for foodstuff and
      minerals that contributed to the war effort and postwar recovery. Candidates may refer to US
      economic pressure and to the Pan American Financial Conference in 1915 which marked the
      transition of Latin America's financial and economic dependence from Europe to the United States.

      Social impact

      Canada suffered over 65 000 deaths; the gradual decline of volunteers led to the 1917 Canadian
      Military Service Act, imposing a draft which opened underlying tensions between English and
      French Canadians, and reawakened French nationalist feelings, especially in Quebec; due to
      patriotism (and the impact of a recession), Prime Minister Borden’s call for volunteers initially
      produced an overwhelming response (by war’s end over half a million had volunteered); Canada’s
      heroic efforts in battles such as Ypres, the Somme, Passchendaele and Vimy Ridge contributed to
      a growing spirit of nationalism; the labour demands of the war led to more women entering the
      work force and contributed to their gaining suffrage in national elections (1918); labour demands
      led to the doubling of union membership and post-war labour reform.

      For Latin America, candidates could include the treatment of German immigrants and citizens of
      German descent in the chosen country; social unrest leading to the attack of German properties
      and investments; the role of pacifist demonstrations against declarations of war and the response
      on the part of the State (for example the declaration of a state of emergency in Brazil); British and
      German immigrants returning to Europe to fight for their homeland; the immigration waves from
      Europe that followed the war.

Political impact

For Canada, the war established a precedent for more government regulation of the economy;
post-war economic frustrations led to a farmer-labour alliance taking control of Ontario and a
United Farmers movement; the agrarian-based Progressive party became the second-largest
party, and demanded farm price supports and the regulation of grain and transportation industries;
isolationist sentiment grew; as a result of their participation in the war, Canada demanded and
received the right to establish separate treaties with the defeated Central Powers which assisted
the move toward a foreign policy separate from Great Britain; these military contributions may have
been significant in assisting Canada’s movement toward full national sovereignty.

For Latin America, relevant material could include the pressure put on Latin American countries
to declare war on the Central Powers; German attacks on Latin American ships as a result of the
use of unrestricted submarine warfare; the political debates surrounding the decision to take part of
the war; the invitations extended to some Latin American countries to attend the Versailles
Conference in 1919 (with limited effective participation in the decision-making process) and to join
the League of Nations. In the case of Brazil, its navy expanded as it was allowed to keep ships
which had been seized from the Central Powers during the war.

The Mexican Revolution 1910–1940

11.   Compare and contrast the aims and methods of Villa and Zapata in the Mexican Revolution.

      Aims

      Comparisons could include: the overthrow of Diaz and then, of Huerta; agrarian reform (Zapata’s
      slogan: Tierra y Libertad); to change the social and economic structures of Mexico; improve the
      lives of the lower classes in Mexico.

      Contrasts could include: while Zapata sought the return of the land of the haciendas to the
      peasants, Villa wanted the confiscation of the haciendas but not their subdivision into plots (the
      state would administer the land and the crops would help sustain the revolutionary struggle); he did
      not want the destruction of the hacienda as an institution; Villa had wider goals: the redistribution of
      income; educational reform; protection of workers’ rights.

      Methods

      Comparisons could include: both supported direct action, and organized guerrilla campaigns
      against the hacendados; both supported Madero in ending the dictatorship of Diaz; both allied to
      remove Huerta from power; both supported the Convention in Aguascalientes to urge social
      reform; both opposed Carranza.

      Contrasts could include: Zapata’s army was made up of peasants, while Villa’s army had a more
      heterogeneous composition; Zapata’s peasant army was not professional, whereas Villa built a
      professional army (División del Norte) and his soldiers were paid wages; the scope of Villa’s
      campaigns was larger (outside Chihuahua) and involved cavalry charges across vast expanses of
      land, movement of troops, trains and artillery, while Zapata’s action largely concentrated in
      Morelos; while Zapata’s Plan de Ayala denounced Madero, Villa remained on good terms with
      Madero; Zapata’s army did not receive US aid, whereas Villa’s army was funded by the US for
      some time; in the fight against Huerta, Villa led the División del Norte, as part of Carranza’s
      Constitutionalist Army, while Zapata’s army was not part of the Constitutionalist Army; while Villa
      engaged in actions along the Northern border (raid on Columbus) that provoked the US, Zapata
      did not confront the US.

12.   Examine the impact of the educational reforms of Vasconcelos.

      The focus of this question is on the effects Vasconcelos’s reforms had on Mexican society.
      Candidates can discuss both the immediate impact as well as the short and longer term impact of
      the reforms. The best answers will show detailed evidence of these reforms and make an
      appraisal of their impact. However, the approach must not be merely a description of his reforms.
      Candidates may identify the aims of the educational reforms in order to evaluate their impact.

      Answers may address some of the following aspects: Vasconcelos’s role as the head of the newly
      created Ministry of Education during Obregon’s rule; the changes he introduced to the educational
      programmes through the creation of the SEP (Secretariat of Public Education); the increase of the
      educational budget to build rural schools (casas del pueblo) and libraries; the impact of
      Vasconcelos’s efforts to promote nationalism, economic progress; the measures adopted to
      incorporate the Indian and mestizo heritage in the idea of nation (indigenismo); the promotion of
      literacy among the rural masses; and the official support given to the arts (muralist movement; the
      expansion of the network of vocational schools; the “cultural missions”). Analysis may be
      demonstrated by discussing the results of his reforms; achievements and failures; the extent of
      support, and the degree of change achieved.

The Great Depression and the Americas 1929–1939

13.   To what extent did either Vargas in Brazil or the Concordancia in Argentina successfully resolve
      the problems caused by the Great Depression?

      The question demands that candidates identify the problems caused by the Great Depression,
      describe the measures the governments of Argentina or Brazil adopted in response to the crisis,
      and make an assessment about their effectiveness or limitations. Answers will vary according to
      the selected country, though in all cases social, political as well as economic solutions could be
      discussed.

      Problems common to both countries may include: their export-oriented economies; dependence
      on foreign imports; the lack of sufficient industrialization; the impact of the collapse of foreign
      markets (the decline in exports); revenue problems; the plunge in prices of raw materials and
      foodstuffs; the fall of foreign investment; demands for increasing state action and state control; the
      inability of the existing governments to manage the crisis.

      In relation to the ways in which the governments addressed the problems caused by the
      Depression candidates may discuss: protectionist policies and other forms of government
      intervention in the economy (such as juntas reguladoras – regulatory boards); centralization of
      authority; increase in government spending; the introduction of Import Substitution Industrialization,
      ISI (to reduce dependency); the development of non-traditional sectors; fiscal reform and exchange
      controls; public works’ programmes; relations with the working classes. Candidates should show
      accurate knowledge of programmes in several areas such as agriculture, job creation, social
      reform and fiscal reform.

14.   To what extent was Franklin D Roosevelt’s response to the Great Depression conservative rather
      than radical?

      The question requires candidates to establish a definition and/or criteria by which the terms
      “conservative” and “radical” will be applied and evaluated. For the purposes of the markscheme,
      “conservative” is defined as those actions which maintained the status quo and “radical” is defined
      as those actions which introduced fundamental change. Some candidates may use the term
      “liberal”, rather than “radical” in assessing Franklin D Roosevelt’s (FDR’s) policies. In these cases,
      examiners should consider the merit of the evidence and argument supporting “fundamental
      change”, rather than the terminology applied by the candidate. It is important that these terms are
      placed in context to the issues and perspectives of the 1930s.

      Conservative response: in response to the banking crisis, Roosevelt opposed nationalization of
      the banking industry, instead applying regulation and banking insurance that preserved the US
      private banking system; FDR did not support direct handouts but instead created work relief
      programmes (such as the Civilian Conservation Corp and Works Progress Administration); rather
      than distribute surplus food, his agricultural programme (Agricultural Adjustment Administration)
      raised farmers’ prices by reducing production (in spite of significant hunger and malnutrition); in
      response to criticism as to first term deficits, he cut spending going into 1936 (resulting in the
      “Roosevelt Recession” of 1937 that delayed the recovery); while social security was implemented
      in 1935, it provided very limited benefits and excluded the majority of workers; some historians
      argue that FDR’s New Deal preserved capitalism to the extent possible and avoided revolution and
      more radical extremes.

      Radical response: Roosevelt often used executive authority (idea of the “imperial presidency”),
      rather than wait for Congressional approval as illustrated by his declaration of a “banking holiday”
      and removal of the US from the gold standard; the creation of the National Recovery
      Administration was intended to reduce competition through a system of price fixing in order to both
      support the growth of unions and achieve a “living wage” for workers (declared unconstitutional by
      the Supreme Court); the Tennessee Valley Authority was perhaps the most revolutionary act of the
      New Deal and included many aspects of a planned economy as it brought the government into
      competition with private enterprise in the production of electrical power; FDR, in response to
      adverse rulings from the Supreme Court, sought to alter the separation of powers doctrine by
      “packing” the Supreme Court with judges more amenable to his programmes; some historians
      contend that Roosevelt paved the way for later expansion of social welfare and entitlement
      programmes as well as massive expansion of the federal bureaucracy and power through his New
      Deal programmes.

The Second World War and the Americas 1933–1945

15.   Examine the significance of the diplomatic or military role of two countries in the Americas during
      the Second World War.

      Discussion of either the diplomatic or military role requires that candidates consider the nature of
      both countries’ diplomatic or military participation, and make an assessment of the significance of
      their contribution. Much depends upon the particular countries chosen. Popular choices might be
      the US, Canada and Brazil; however accept any choice of countries selected by the candidates
      provided the focus remains on their role.

      Diplomatic issues may include: agreements by which the US provided economic and industrial
      assistance in exchange for naval bases and a secure flow of war materials; decisions related to
      concerns over Axis-nation residents in Latin America and their possible confinement or deportation
      to the US; agreements reached at the meetings of foreign ministers (for example Panama, 1939;
      Havana, 1940; and Rio, 1942).

      Military issues may include: the provision and the use of naval and air bases; the contribution
      regarding strategies or tactics; intelligence gathering; contribution with troops and their participation
      in the different theatres of war; the production of war supplies; the patrolling of the seas and other
      actions against German U-boats; the protection of the Panama Canal zone.

16.   To what extent was the use of the atomic bomb in the Second World War a political rather than a
      military decision?

      The decision to use the atomic bomb against Japan has been extensively researched and yet
      remains controversial. Reward responses that thoroughly evaluate the political and military
      considerations which led to the decision and assess the extent to which the decision was political.

      Military considerations: advisors to President Truman disagreed as to how close Japan was to
      ending the war, with Secretary of State Byrnes, Secretary of War Stimson and the Joint Chiefs of
      Staff advocating the necessity of the bomb to achieve Japan’s surrender; several Cabinet
      members, scientific groups and senior military advisors (including General Eisenhower) maintained
      that Japan was nearly at the point of surrender without the use of the atomic bomb; US intelligence
      sources estimated that Japan had two million soldiers ready to defend the islands and that tactics
      similar to those used at Okinawa would be employed; various estimates of US casualties (dead
      and wounded) have been made, ranging from sixty-six thousand to one million; estimates are
      speculative and depend upon various assumptions having to do with Japanese military capacity,
      time span necessary to defeat Japan, actions Japan may have taken against Allied prisoners of
      war, and numerous other factors; questions have emerged as to the changing nature of the
      estimates, which were often increased after the war, and whether this reflected an attempt to justify
      the use of the atomic bomb; projections less frequently address the estimates as to Japanese
      civilian or military casualties; also less considered is the question of how the war’s continuation
      might have impacted Allied casualties in other areas of the Pacific theatre of war.

      Political considerations: difficult to quantify, but subject to speculation, is the American desire for
      revenge against Japan over the surprise attack on Pearl Harbor in 1941; the US public might raise
      criticism of the expenditure of over two billion dollars, (Manhattan Project), to develop the bomb if
      there was no use of the device; high casualties from a conventional invasion of Japan could not be
      justified to the American public if they knew that a weapon was available to end the war (the
      political effect could cause Truman and the Democratic party to lose power); use of the bomb
      might end the war before the USSR could broaden its expansion into East Asia, particularly
      Manchuria; the Soviet Union might be intimidated by the new weapon and its implications as to US
      military superiority, thus limiting Soviet expansion in Europe; the moral issue of civilian casualties
      in Hiroshima and Nagasaki was made politically acceptable by the wartime promotion of the
      Japanese as immoral for their commission of atrocities.

Political developments in the Americas after the Second World War 1945–1979

17.   To what extent were domestic political factors in Cuba the main cause of the Cuban Revolution?

      The question demands that candidates assess the extent of the contribution of domestic political
      factors to the Cuban Revolution. Analysing the “extent” indicates that other reasons or causes
      could be considered. Most candidates will address Batista’s rule as a dictator since 1952 in their
      responses. Candidates may reasonably claim that internal Cuban politics was dominated by
      Cuba’s relationship with the US.

      Domestic political factors may include: particular features of Batista’s dictatorship such as: his
      subservience to US interests; the inefficiency and corruption of his regime (that alienated a part of
      the population that had initially supported him); Batista’s disregard of the needs and aspirations of
      the majority of Cubans; the brutality of his regime (such as the repression of political opponents),
      and its effects on the relations with the US. Candidates may also provide evidence on
      weaknesses in Batista’s leadership such as releasing revolutionaries in 1955 and the increasing
      unreliability of his low-paid army. An analysis of the weaknesses of Batista’s non-revolutionary
      opponents can also be relevant. Candidates will probably discuss the significance of the role
      Castro and the 26th of July movement played in the Cuban Revolution: Castro’s leadership skills
      and determination; his revolutionary programme and tactics.

      Other factors contributing to the cause of the Cuban Revolution may include: the growth of
      Cuban nationalism and the resentment against the US; dependency on sugar exports and the
      control of wealth in the hands of a few.

18.   Examine the extent to which Trudeau’s domestic policies as Canadian prime minister
      (1968–1979) were successful.

      Candidates will need to establish the criteria by which to evaluate Pierre Trudeau’s success and
      may choose to consider his political legacy as well as policy achievements and limitations in
      domestic affairs. As head of the Liberal Party, Trudeau held the post of prime minister from 1968
      to 1979. While Trudeau served again as prime minister from 1980 to 1984, events of this era are
      not relevant to the question.

      Domestic policies
      Trudeau achieved passage of the Official Languages Act (1969) that made Canada officially
      bilingual and also promoted multiculturalism; however, the act resulted in an anti-bilingual backlash
      that was most notable in the alienation of the Western Provinces.

      The Trudeau government put forth a “White Paper on Indians” (1969) which proposed gradual
      assimilation of First Nations and elimination of the “Indian Act” and dismantlement of the reserves.
      This resulted in mobilization of First Nation and aboriginal activists strongly opposed to the change
      and led Trudeau to withdraw the proposal in March of 1971.

      In the October Crisis of 1970 involving the kidnapping of two government officials by the Front de
      Liberation du Quebec (FLQ), Trudeau imposed the War Measures Act. The act provided the
      government extraordinary powers of arrest and detention without trial as well as censorship.
      Controversy remains as to both the effectiveness of the act in response to the crisis and the impact
      of the act on Canada’s commitment to civil rights and constitutionalism.

      Trudeau undertook measures to promote centralization and nationalization that increased the
      powers of the Office of Prime Minister, the Privy Council Office and the Treasury Board, among
      others. While Trudeau argued the measures were necessary to advance federalism and
      efficiency, critics maintained that these measures attacked Provincial authority, led to inefficiency
      and undermined the power of Parliament and the Cabinet.

      In response to growing concerns over inflation, in 1975 Trudeau instituted mandatory wage and
      price controls through the Anti-Inflation Act. The action was supported by most business leaders
      but strongly criticized by labour. Criticism of the measure was also based on the fact that inflation
      continued to harm the Canadian economy.

      However, it is not exhaustive and no set answer is required.

The Cold War and the Americas 1945–1981

19.   Examine the reasons for, and methods of, US intervention in Chile in the early 1970s.

      The question demands that candidates assess the relative significance of the reasons for Nixon’s
      intervention in Chile during the given time frame, and determine which means were more
      significant in causing Allende’s fall from power. It focuses on the efforts of the US during the Nixon
      presidency both to prevent Allende’s election as President of Chile, to destabilize Allende’s regime
      between 1970 and 1973 and to eventually secure his removal. Answers to this question should
      focus on the given dates. Discussion of events after the military coup of 1973 is outside of the
      remit of the question.

      Possible reasons could include: US fear of Allende’s victory and the possibility of having “a
      second Cuba” in Latin America; US fear of the impact that a democratically elected Marxist regime
      could have on the region; the US perceived threat to her national security and economic interests
      in Chile (such as copper mining corporations such as Kennecott and Anaconda, IT&T distrusted
      Allende’s intentions). Some candidates may address Nixon’s personal reasons for intervention
      such as his concern about losing Chile to communism.

      Possible methods could include: US funding (Central Intelligence Agency, CIA) of Allende’s
      opponents to prevent his rise to power and to unseat Allende; US diplomatic pressure on countries
      to cut all ties with Allende; US funding of media criticism; fomenting demonstrations and strikes;
      waging economic warfare to destabilize Chilean economy (for example blocking credit and loans in
      reaction to Allende’s nationalization programmes); instigating the military to stage a coup against
      Allende.

20.   Evaluate the factors that influenced US military intervention in Korea.

      This question allows for contextualization, however, the focus should be on the evaluation of the
      motives for intervention.

      Possible reasons may include:

      Truman and Containment: in 1947, George Kennan helped to formulate the containment
      doctrine, which would soon be adopted by President Truman as a means of opposing communist
      expansion and as part of his “get tough with Russia” policy; with the assumption that North Korea
      was acting as a proxy of the USSR, Truman believed support for the containment policy
      necessitated a military response to the invasion; with his administration facing heavy criticism for
      the “loss of China” in 1949, Truman and his Democratic party could not politically afford to be seen
      as weak.

      US National Security Council: in April 1950, the US NSC-68 document had been secretly issued
      (prior to the invasion of South Korea) advocating that a massive US military build-up was
      necessary to protect the US from Soviet aggression; the document asserted that the US must not
      rely on other nations to stop Soviet expansion and that the US must take the initiative to stop
      communist expansion regardless of the strategic or economic value of the lands in question; some
      historians have maintained that the US military response was regarded as an action that would
      justify the necessity of maintaining a large peace-time military establishment and would effectively
      negate those who sought to reduce the size of the military budget.

      United Nations: at the time of the invasion, the USSR was boycotting the UN Security Council
      meetings (perhaps to protest the exclusion of the People’s Republic of China from that body); the
      absence of the USSR’s veto power allowed the Security Council to authorize UN members to take
      any action “necessary to restore the peace”; thus, the US military presence in Korea was officially
      a “police action” under the authority of the UN and represented the desire of the US to support the
      UN as a credible deterrent to aggression; in support of the US as a member of the UN, President
      Truman was able to order military action without Congressional authorization.

      Remain open to factors other than those mentioned above as motives for US military action in
      Korea. Candidates should be rewarded for analysis supported by specific examples as to the
      “factors” for intervention.

      The above material is an indication of what candidates may elect to write about in their responses.
      However, it is not exhaustive and no set answer is required.

Civil rights and social movements in the Americas

21.   Evaluate the contribution of either Dr Martin Luther King or Malcolm X to the Civil Rights
      Movement.

      The question allows candidates to examine the contribution of either leader in terms of: beliefs,
      tactics, influences, achievements and limitations. However, responses should not consist of a
      narrative of the leader’s actions in the Civil Rights Movement but an evaluation of the role of the
      leader chosen within the Civil Rights Movement.

      Candidates choosing Martin Luther King could consider: inspirational leadership; the creation and
      leadership of the Southern Christian Leadership Conference (SCLC); the goal of integration; civil
      disobedience; national appeal; peaceful tactics (such as speeches, marches, “jail not bail”;
      attracting media attention to the plight of African Americans). Candidates will probably credit King
      with ending de jure segregation, but claim he failed to end de facto segregation. Some may refer
      to his lack of success in the north and his declining influence after 1965. Other candidates may
      discuss the extent of King’s contribution in relation to others’ contributions (such as governmental
      institutions, grassroots action, other civil rights activists and organizations).

      Candidates choosing Malcolm X could consider: drawing attention to the conditions of northern
      ghettos (addressing the issue of social and economic inequality); his appeal to the black youths;
      promoting racial pride and ideas of self-help; inspiring a new generation of black leaders (for
      example Stokely Carmichael and Floyd McKissick). Responses could make reference to: the
      leader’s limited effectiveness due to his tactics and the tone of his messages; the extent of his
      responsibility for the split within the Civil Rights Movement; his failure to rally government or whites’
      support.

      The above material is an indication of what candidates may elect to write about in their responses.
      However, it is not exhaustive and no set answer is required.

      Examiners and moderators are reminded of the need to apply the markbands that provide the

22.   Examine the extent to which the native peoples of one country of the Americas advanced their civil
      rights after 1945.

      Candidates may define civil rights somewhat broadly, but should not generalize to focus mainly on
      economic and social conditions. Focus may be on collective aspects of civil rights for Native
      American tribal groups, rather than solely on individual rights.

      United States: efforts to redress grievances and advance rights were inspired by African American
      success; most post-1945 government policy focused on assimilation, whether desired or not;
      “Termination” policy introduced in 1953 wherein federal government withdrew recognition of tribes
      as legally separate from state governments, thus placing them under local jurisdiction; in 1958,
      Eisenhower administration banned “Termination” policy without consulting tribes; representatives
      of 67 tribes met in Chicago and issued “Declaration of Indian Purpose” as a manifesto (1961);
      books such as Dee Brown’s Bury My Heart at Wounded Knee increased societal awareness and
      Native American nationalism including organization of National Indian Youth Council and American
      Indian Movement (AIM); Congress passed the Indian Civil Rights Act (1968) to guarantee Native
      Americans the same rights as in the Bill of Rights and recognized tribal law within reservations;
      AIM asserted direct action with confrontations over fishing rights on Columbia River, occupation of
      Alcatraz Island and seizure of Wounded Knee to protest government failure to honour treaty
      obligations, but efforts produced limited success; US v. Wheeler (1978) ruled that tribes had
      independent legal standing that Congress could not terminate; additional cases extended tribal
      autonomy over reservation policy and restored land rights based on treaties of the past; division
      continued among Native Americans as to benefits of assimilation versus advancement of tribal civil
      rights and autonomy.

      Canada: “The Indian Act” (1951) was passed as the principal federal statute dealing with status of
      indigenous people, local government and management of reserve land and funds – amended in
      1981 and 1985 to further define each issue; from 1970s to 1980s, controversy over status of “First
      Nation” members who married outside their tribe or “band” and thus lost status (women only);
      resolved by 1982 Constitutional Act that reinstated “band” status if previously lost through marriage
      – effect was to double the number of First Nation people but to also place strains on resources of
      First Nation reserves.

      Latin America: there are multiple examples but candidates will most likely address the efforts
      made by the Mapuches in Chile, the Aymara in Bolivia, the Mayas in Guatemala, the CONAIE
      (Confederation of Indigenous Nationalities of Ecuador) to advance their civil rights since the 1980s.
      Reference can be made to the limited possibility of organizing national-level movements during the
      dictatorial regimes in the 1960s and 1970s (with the exception of Bolivia) and the opportunities that
      arose with the restoration of democracy since the 1980s. The plight faced by the indigenous
      groups and their demands (for example, the recognition of land rights, right to special status,
      respect for their cultural and ethnic identity, participation in the economic, social and political life
      and resistance to processes of assimilation and integration) are good starting points for discussion.

In assessing the extent of success candidates will probably discuss: the effectiveness and
limitations of their tactics and organization (peaceful mobilizations, marches, roadblocks, joining
progressive urban groups, setting up cultural organizations, allying international NGOs addressing
human rights, cultural and environmental issues to get funding and publicize their cause); the role
played by women leaders in such movements (for example Rigoberta Menchu in Guatemala); the
contribution of the International Labour Organization (ILO), the Catholic Church, the United Nations
and the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights (IACHR); the response national
governments gave to their demands and the extent to which their situation has improved.

Into the 21st century — from the 1980s to 2000

23.   Evaluate the successes and failures of Reagan’s foreign policy in the Americas.

      Candidates will need to establish criteria for what constitutes success and failure and should
      consider the impact on both the US and the affected countries. While the focus emphasizes
      Reagan’s policies toward Argentina, Grenada, Haiti, Nicaragua and El Salvador, be open to
      policies impacting other countries of the Americas. Candidates may assess Reagan’s Latin
      American policy in terms of the “Reagan Doctrine”, which applied both overt and covert aid in an
      attempt to “rollback” the influence of Soviet-backed communist or socialist governments in Latin
      America. This is a question likely to induce strong arguments one way or another. Reward
      responses with thorough factual and analytical support.

      Argentina: while the US sought better relations with Argentina, (to assist against the Farabundo
      Marti National Liberation Front – FMLN in El Salvador), the Reagan administration shifted support
      to aid Great Britain in the Falklands/Malvinas War; the defeat of Argentina thus undermined Latin
      American trust in the US as a potential ally.

      Grenada: the October 1983 invasion to remove an allegedly Marxist, Cuban-style government was
      a military success and based on the pretext of rescuing US medical students; underlying the
      decision was opposition to the economic and social reforms in Grenada that were seen as a
      communist or socialist threat; the impact was to intimidate those who sought such reforms in other
      Latin American nations as well as indicating that the US was more concerned with the spread of
      communism than with poverty or attempts to establish social justice.

      Haiti: the US was concerned with the flood of Haitian immigrants to Florida and the possibility of a
      communist takeover in Haiti; the US initially cut off aid and helped engineer a bloodless coup to
      achieve the exile of Jean Claude Duvalier; several military “strongmen” received US support but
      failed to improve the quality of government; by the end of Reagan’s second term, conditions in
      Haiti were still in turmoil, with corruption, poverty and repression rampant.

      Nicaragua: Reagan was determined to use every means possible to remove the Sandinista
      government due to the Sandinistas social and economic agenda, which was seen as Marxist and
      anti-American; the US employed economic sanctions, misinformation campaigns, and covert
      operations (including the mining of Nicaraguan harbours); in 1979, the CIA formed the contras
      (from ex-Somocista National Guard elements) – by 1985, the US had spent over 200 million in
      funding this group; at various points, the US Congress both funded and prohibited funding (Boland
      Amendment) of the contras; during a period of prohibited funding, the Reagan administration
      illegally sold arms to Iran and used some of the proceeds to fund the contras – the resulting
      scandal occupied much of Reagan’s last two years in office; Nicaragua was largely able to defeat
      the contras within their borders and the US then created a contra base operating out of Honduras;
      while the contras had limited military success, the effect of the insurgency had a critical economic
      impact on Nicaragua.

      El Salvador: during Reagan’s terms in office, the US spent nearly US$4 billion in an attempt to
      defeat the FMLN guerrilla movement, which sought to overthrow the government of the US-backed
      centrist leader, Jose Napoleon Duarte; military equipment, the training of Salvadorian troops in the
      US and extension of military advisors to El Salvador were provided, but with little effectiveness
      against the insurgents; by the end of Reagan’s second term, peace talks were scheduled between
      the FMLN and Duarte’s successor.

24.   To what extent did one country in Latin America successfully meet the challenges it faced when
      restoring democracy during the period 1980 to 2000?

      The question requires an analysis of the economic, social and political problems that one newly-
      restored democracy faced during the given period, the programmes the government of the
      selected country adopted to meet those challenges, and an assessment about its effectiveness or
      limitations. Answers will vary according to the selected country, though in all cases social, political
      as well as economic challenges could be examined. Argentina, Brazil, Chile and Uruguay are
      likely to prove popular choices, although other valid cases should be accepted provided that they
      are well supported.

      Answers may address some of the following challenges: the country’s large foreign debt; inflation
      (adopting anti-inflationary or austerity measures); external economic and political pressures; the
      impact of neo liberalism and globalization on democracies; the challenge of developing
      mechanisms to make democracy viable (allowing for the active participation of political parties and
      citizens through consultas) and neutralize the threat of another coup or revolution; the resolution of
      crises through representative institutions; the need to revitalize industry; addressing labour and
      poverty issues; efforts to reconcile society and punish those responsible for human rights abuses.

      The above material is an indication of what candidates may elect to write about in their responses.
      However, it is not exhaustive and no set answer is required.
