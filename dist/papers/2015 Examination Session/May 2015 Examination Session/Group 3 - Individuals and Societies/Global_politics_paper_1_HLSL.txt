Read all the sources carefully and answer all the questions that follow.

Source A               Chart created by the International Monetary Fund (IMF) based on data provided
                       by the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations, in a report
                       entitled The State of Food Insecurity in the World, published online in 2009.

The chart shows the geographic distribution of the world’s undernourished persons, in millions.

Source B               Adapted from the World Economic and Social Survey 2013: Sustainable
                       Development Challenges, conducted and published by the United Nations.

Eradicating extreme poverty, promoting sustainable consumption and production, and managing the
planet’s natural resource base for the benefit of all in current and future generations are the primary
challenges of sustainable development. Unsustainable consumption and production patterns have
evolved in developed countries. For example, greenhouse gas emission levels per person in developed
countries are 20 to 40 times greater than the level needed to stabilize present greenhouse gas
concentrations world-wide. The ecological footprints per person in developed countries are four to nine
times greater than their bio-capacity*. These patterns are increasingly being repeated in developing
countries.

There is a need to promote integrated, long-term management of natural resources and ecosystems for
environmental sustainability. The high degree of inequality that accompanies and promotes the current
consumption and production patterns makes them socially unsustainable and limits achievement
of the human development goals. Without an effective global agenda, high-income households,
in developed as well as developing countries, are likely to continue to adopt unsustainable consumption
practices.

* Biocapacity: the capacity of a given biologically productive area to continue its supply of
               renewable resources and to absorb its spillover wastes.

Source C               Adapted from a report Coal & Society: Supporting global economic development
                       published by the World Coal Association, a global industry association which
                       provides a voice for coal in international energy, environment and development
                       forums.

In addition to its direct role as an energy resource, coal plays a significant global role in sustainable
development. Coal mining is a critical element in many economies. Coal mining makes a substantial
contribution to improving the livelihoods of many, including providing employment, export revenues,
and the development of local infrastructure. This is especially true in developing countries where coal
mining is a major activity in many national economies, allowing them to grow stronger and address the
challenges of poverty and development.

One of the challenges raised by poverty and development is how to widen access to affordable
energy supplies. Today there are 1.3 billion people across the globe without access to electricity.
An affordable, secure, and reliable electricity supply enables economic development which is necessary
for poverty alleviation. Coal plays a central role in supporting global economic development and in
alleviating poverty, and is an essential resource for meeting the world’s energy needs. Coal is also a key
component of important industrial processes such as steel and cement manufacturing – both of which
are central to building the essential infrastructure of growing economies.


Source D               Adapted from the article A united call for action on climate change, by Kofi Annan,
                       former Secretary General of the UN, published January 2014.

When Nelson Mandela formed The Elders, a group of former world leaders, in 2007, to promote peace
and human rights across the world, he challenged us to be bold and to give a voice to those who have
no voice. No issue demands these qualities more than our collective failure to tackle climate change.

Climate change is the biggest challenge of our time. It threatens the well-being of hundreds of millions of
people today and many billions more in the future. It undermines the human rights to food, water, health
and shelter – causes for which we, as Elders, have fought all our lives. No one and no country will
escape the impact of climate change. But those with no voice – because they are already marginalized
or are not yet born – are at greatest risk. The Elders have an urgent moral duty to speak out on their
behalf.

What is needed to prevent this catastrophe? Global temperature increases must be limited to less
than two degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels. This means turning away from fossil fuels and
accelerating the use of affordable renewable energies, for instance by setting an internationally agreed
price for carbon. The way forward must be to meet the timetable for a robust, universal, and
legally binding agreement on climate change next year, under which every country commits to phasing
down greenhouse gas emissions.

1.       Identify three significant facts about global undernourishment that can be deduced
         from the chart in Source A.                                                                                                   [3]


2.       With explicit reference to Source B, explain the factors that pose challenges to
         sustainable development.                                                                                                      [4]


3.       Contrast how Source C and Source D view present-day challenges to the well-being of
         people, and the strategies they propose for overcoming these and securing sustainable                                         [8]
         development.


4.       Using the sources and your own knowledge, evaluate the claim that the most important
         factor that will affect the success of development will be the involvement of both rich
         and poor countries.                                                                                                          [10]
