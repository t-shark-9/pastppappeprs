How to use the Diploma Philosophy markscheme

The assessment criteria constitute the formal tool for marking examination scripts, and in these
assessment criteria examiners can see the skills being assessed in the examinations. The
markschemes are designed to assist examiners in possible routes taken by candidates in terms of the
content of their answers when demonstrating their skills of doing philosophy through their responses.
The points listed are not compulsory points, and not necessarily the best possible points. They are a
framework to help examiners contextualize the requirements of the question, and to facilitate the
application of marks according to the criteria listed on pages 5–8.

It is important that examiners understand that the main idea of the course is to promote doing
philosophy, and this involves activity and engagement throughout a two-year programme, as opposed to
emphasizing the chance to display knowledge in a terminal set of examination papers. Even in the
examinations, responses should not be assessed on how much candidates know as much as how they
are able to use their knowledge in support of an argument, using the skills listed in the assessment
criteria published in the subject guide, reflecting an engagement in philosophical activity throughout the
course. As a tool intended to help examiners in assessing scripts, the following points should be kept in
mind when using a markscheme as an examiner:

 The IB Philosophy programme is designed to encourage the skills of doing philosophy in the students.
  These skills can be accessed through reading the assessment criteria in the subject guide
 The markscheme does not intend to outline a model/correct/good answer
 The markscheme has an introductory paragraph which contextualizes the emphasis of the question
  being asked
 The bullet points below the paragraph are suggested possible points of development that should not
  be considered a prescriptive list where necessarily all (or even some) should appear in the answer
 The names of philosophers and references to their work associated with the question help to give a
  context for the examiners and does not reflect a requirement that such philosophers and references
  should appear in an answer: they are possible lines of development with the emphasis being on how
  the material is used in support of the candidate’s answer and not whether it appears in the answer
 Candidates can legitimately select from a wide range of ideas, arguments and concepts in service of
  the question they are answering, and it is possible that candidates will use material effectively that is
  not mentioned in the markscheme
 In markschemes for Paper 3, there are suggested pertinent points found in the text extract relating to
  philosophical activity. The markschemes include suggested questions that might stimulate analysis of
  those points. These bullet points cannot predict how a candidate will relate his or her personal
  experience of the IB HL Philosophy course to the text extract, so the examiner must be aware that
  much of the response of the candidate will not be covered by material in the markscheme.

A reminder of candidate requirements for Paper 3 (Unseen text – exploring philosophical
activity):

Examiners are reminded that in the examination paper it states that candidates are expected to
demonstrate the following skills. Since these skills are encouraged within the assessment criteria,
examiners should take them into account in their marking:
 develop a response in an organized way using clear, precise language, which is appropriate to
  philosophy
 identify pertinent issues regarding the philosophical activity raised in the text
 take an independent position about the nature of philosophical activity in relation to the ideas
  developed in the text
 draw upon, and show a holistic appreciation of, the skills, material and ideas developed throughout
  the course.

In the examination paper candidates are required to:

Write a response (of approximately 800 words) in which they:
Candidates are also told that their responses are expected to include:
 a concise description of philosophical activity as presented in the text
 an exploration of the pertinent issues regarding philosophical activity raised in the text, relating this to
  their experience of doing philosophy throughout the whole course
 appropriate references to the text that illustrate their understanding of philosophical activity
 their personal evaluation of the issues regarding philosophical activity raised in the text.

Paper 3 assessment criteria

A    Expression

      Has the student formulated the response in an organized way?
      How clear and precise is the language used by the student?
      To what extent is the language appropriate to philosophy?

      Achievement Descriptor
         Level
           0      The student has not reached level 1.
           1      The student expresses some basic ideas but it is not always clear what the
                  response is trying to convey. The use of language is not appropriate to
                  philosophy.
           2      The student presents some ideas in an organized way. There is some clarity of
                  expression but the response cannot always be followed. The use of language is
                  not always appropriate to philosophy.
           3      The student presents ideas in an organized way and the response can be easily
                  followed. The use of language is appropriate to philosophy.
           4      The student presents ideas in an organized and coherent way and the response
                  is clearly articulated. The use of language is effective and appropriate to
                  philosophy.
           5      The student presents ideas in an organized, coherent and incisive way, insights
                  are clearly articulated and the response is focused and sustained. The use of
                  language is precise and appropriate to philosophy.

                 regarding philosophical activity raised in the text.
          3      The student demonstrates satisfactory evidence of identifying pertinent issues
                 regarding philosophical activity raised in the text. Examples or illustrations are
                 used in support of exploring the issues.
          4      The student demonstrates good evidence of identifying pertinent issues
                 regarding philosophical activity raised in the text. Appropriate examples or
                 illustrations are used in support of exploring the issues. The student draws on
                 some experience of doing philosophy throughout the course in exploring the
                 issues raised in the text.
          5      The student demonstrates precise evidence of identifying pertinent issues raised
                 regarding philosophical activity in the text. Examples or illustrations are well
                 chosen and are compelling in support of exploring the issues. The student
                 draws insightfully on the experience of doing philosophy throughout the whole
                 course in exploring the issues raised in the text.

Unseen text – exploring philosophical activity

The purpose of the exercise is to allow candidates to reflect upon the nature, function, methodology and
meaning of philosophical activity, relating this to the candidates’ experience of doing philosophy
throughout the whole course. Candidates may reflect this in very different ways in their responses,
giving examples which draw from their experience of the course or from their experience in general.
The following points—referring to the text extract—might be included in a response, but they are
neither exhaustive nor prescriptive.

Throughout the passage, philosophy is characterized as an activity with a number of features:

     As an activity which is best described by example rather than by definition
     As a bridge between science and common sense
     As a rational activity with a goal of truth
     As a rational activity with a goal of wisdom
     As an activity with a preoccupation with the “big picture”
     As an activity that shares the same concerns and preoccupations as empirical sciences
     As an activity that looks to its past for current guidance and ideas.

Candidates might consider the following given their experience of doing the course in response to this
text extract:

   Is there a necessary tension between the goals of truth and wisdom? Are the truths of philosophy
    like the truths of science, ie, are they empirically based?
   Though the claim is that philosophy deals with the big picture, is the reality that a lot of philosophy
    is thinking about the minutiae of arguments and semantics?
   Does philosophy provide any sort of truth and wisdom? Is the only legacy of philosophical activity
    a series of further questions rather than answers?
   Is philosophy not also a bridge between common sense and other disciplines, like religion?
    Moreover, is our “common sense” not a view of the world subject to analysis and evaluation in
    isolation?
   If science and philosophy are continuous to some degree because they examine and evaluate
    evidence, and look for a best explanation, then can the same not be said for police work and
    philosophy, or police work and science, or philosophy and jury duty?
   Is Philosopher 2 suggesting that we are wiser not to consult texts from the past because we are
    divorced from their context, and hence misunderstand them? Do we always have to understand
    and interpret these texts as they were originally intended?
   If the claim that rational arguments rarely change anyone’s beliefs is true, then is the aim of
    practical wisdom unattainable? Is there a practical point to philosophy?
   Does philosophy make progress? Are philosophers better organized in understanding the
    perennial problems and issues? Does philosophy have any predictive function?
   Any relevant examples from candidate experience addressing any of the points above.
