Answer two questions. Each question is worth [20 marks].

1.   BodyGuardian

     The BodyGuardian is a lightweight, wearable and wireless body sensor. This technology allows
     patients to remain active and independent while their health is being monitored with a simple
     sensor that is in contact with their skin.

                                         Figure 1: The BodyGuardian device

     The BodyGuardian system consists of the BodyGuardian device and a smartphone with the
     BodyGuardian app* installed. The smartphone connects to the cloud-based service mHealth using
     a 3G cell/mobile phone network.

     Doctors are able to access their patient’s data via mHealth using a mobile device. They can also
     set different limits for each patient, allowing for personalized alerts.



* app: application software, typically a small, specialized program downloaded onto
  mobile devices; apps can also run on the internet, on a computer, on a cell/mobile
  phone or other electronic device.

(Question 1 continued)

     (a)   (i)   Identify two health indicators that could be measured by the BodyGuardian
                 device.                                                                                 [2]

		(ii)           Identify four steps taken by the software to decide if a health indicator
                 measurement needs to be sent to a doctor for a decision.                                [4]

     (b)   The managers of mHealth are investigating the nature of passwords used by doctors to
           access patient information. The two options being investigated are:
           • the doctor creates a password that does not need to be changed
           • the mHealth system requires doctors to create a strong password that must be
             changed every 40 days.

           Analyse these two options.                                                                    [6]

     (c)   As part of the development of the BodyGuardian device, it is being tested in clinical
           trials by doctors and patients.

           Discuss the implications for doctors and patients of trialling the BodyGuardian device
           before it is sold publicly.                                                                   [8]




                                                                                                   Turn over

2.   3D printing

     Buttercup is a duck who hatched with a deformed left foot that had to be amputated. His owner
     took pictures of another duck’s foot from different angles and was able to use 3D printer technology
     to produce a new plastic foot for him.

     A 3D printer, like the one shown in Figure 4 creates an object by adding plastic layer by layer until
     it is complete.

     Inspired by Buttercup’s story, Alejandro Toys has created a company that uses a computer with a
     3D printer and software to produce plastic toys for children.

     Alejandro Toys has found out that some software will allow them to input 2D images into the 3D
     printer software so that they can be converted into a 3D object. They are considering either to use
     open source software or to purchase proprietary software.


     (a)   (i)   Identify two ways that a 2D image file can be input into the 3D printer software.      [2]

		(ii)           Identify four of the steps required to produce Buttercup’s replacement foot.           [4]

     (b)   Analyse Alejandro Toys’s decision to either use open source software or to purchase
           proprietary software to produce the company’s 3D toys.                                       [6]

     (c)   It is now possible to use a 3D printer to print a large range of products in addition
           to toys. These include guns, bicycles and human prosthetic limbs. However some
           governments are concerned about the software for 3D printers being freely available on
           the internet.

           To what extent should governments regulate the access to software for 3D printers?           [8]

3.       Small town book shop moves to computer-based records

         El Hoyo is a small village in the south of Argentina. The local book shop has recently received
         a number of academic books from a large university in Buenos Aires. The university also sent a
         computer which has all of the books listed in a spreadsheet.

         The table in Figure 5 shows a small part of the list of books. The complete table has 400 different
         entries (last entry is in row 401).

         Daniela, the shop manager, has been waiting for a computer for a long time. She knows that, with
         this computer, her staff will provide a faster service when they are searching for specific books.

(Question 3 continued)

     (a)   (i)   Daniela needs to see the books in alphabetical order, with the “Subject area”
                 sorted from A to Z and then the “Number of books” sorted from largest to
                 smallest.

                 State the author that would appear in the first row of the sorted spreadsheet
                 using only the books shown in Figure 5.                                               [1]

		(ii)           State the formula that would be required to add up the cost of all the books in the
                 book store.                                                                           [1]

		(iii)          Daniela now thinks that she should have installed a database for the information
                 about the books. Outline two advantages that a database would have over a
                 spreadsheet for the El Hoyo book shop.                                                [4]

     (b)   Explain three impacts that the new computer system may have for the staff at the book
           shop.                                                                                       [6]

     (c)   El Hoyo receives a large number of tourists during the summer when the fruit festival
           takes place, but suffers from periods of poor internet connectivity. Daniela has
           now created a separate area in the book shop that has several computers with free
           broadband internet access so that tourists can use them to check their emails and find
           information about the local area.

           Evaluate the impacts of this initiative for Daniela as shop manager.                        [8]

Answer one question. Each question is worth [20 marks].

4.   Penrose Airport (United Kingdom) automated baggage system

     The automated baggage system designed for Penrose Airport is an example of an IT project
     failure. When a prototype of the system was switched on for a demonstration, bags became
     jammed on the conveyer belt, fell off, or airport employees put them on the wrong conveyer belt.
     As a result, bags were often misrouted, lost or damaged.

     An investigation into the failure of the automated baggage system revealed several problems:
     • the managers of Penrose Airport kept changing their requirements for the system
     • the company that designed and implemented the automated baggage system had never
       created one of this size before
     • the deadline for completion was only two years from the beginning of the project
     • the airlines that use Penrose Airport were not included in the early discussions about the
       project.

     The waterfall method of development was used.

     The project management team, which was composed of the airport’s chief engineer and the
     senior management team of the firm that built the system, made the key decisions regarding the
     project. Several lower level managers, who were not directly involved in the decisions, advised
     the project management team that the project needed four years to complete, not the two years
     allocated.

(Question 4 continued)

     (a)   (i)   Identify two key stakeholders in this automated baggage system project.             [2]

		(ii)           Identify two characteristics of a “prototype”.                                      [2]

		(iii)          Identify two types of information that should have been gathered at the beginning
                 of the automated baggage system project.                                            [2]

     (b)   Explain three reasons why the use of the AGILE system of project development might

5.     Zunica Chocolates

       Zunica Chocolates sells its products from a number of stores in New Mexico, USA. Sales have
       grown rapidly in recent years.

       Zunica Chocolates has decided to create an e-commerce platform for online sales. This platform
       needs to be integrated with the company’s current website. Zunica Chocolates has decided to
       contract the work out to Karlsons, an e-commerce development company. The owner will work
       with Anna, the project manager at Karlsons, who will design and create the e-commerce platform.
       She has developed a Gantt chart to schedule and coordinate tasks.

Answer one question. Each question is worth [20 marks].

6.   Telepresence robots

     Several students of Fernwood School have to study at home because of serious health issues.
     The school is considering whether to purchase VGo robots for these students.

     The robots stand inside the classroom and have a screen that displays the student’s face in real
     time. The student is able to control the robot in order to see and hear what is happening in the
     classroom as well as participate in class discussions, group work, and even attend assemblies or
     join other students in the lunchroom.

     The student at home will need a computer with access to the internet to receive the video
     and sound from the robot. The school will need a Wi-Fi network, because the robot will travel
     throughout the school just as the student would. The student controls the movement of the robot
     from their home computer.

     At the end of the school day, the student “drives” their robot to a secure area where its battery is
     charged overnight.

(Question 6 continued)

     (a)   (i)   Identify two of the sensors that the robot must have in order to move around the
                 classroom.                                                                            [2]

		(ii)           Outline two characteristics that make the VGo different from a fixed video system
                 such as Skype.                                                                        [4]

     (b)   Analyse the impact that using a VGo robot would have on a student who cannot attend
           school in person.                                                                           [6]

     (c)   Larsson Laboratories, which makes drugs for rare diseases, is considering the use of
           VGo robots for company communications. The head office is in central Stockholm, with
           a research laboratory in a nearby town and a production facility in Germany. The VGo
           robots would be used for meetings and visits to the laboratory and production facility by
           managers, as well as by workers who are in the office for some of the time, and work
           from home (telecommute) for the rest.

           Discuss the potential effects of the use of VGo robots for Larsson Laboratories.            [8]

7.   Art and expert systems

     Harold Cohen, a noted painter, has used his knowledge of drawing and colour to create an expert
     system called AARON. AARON uses a knowledge base containing information about real-world
     objects and has a set of rules about how to create works of art. AARON has a robotic arm that it
     uses to mix colours, draw, paint and, finally, clean its paint pots and paint brushes.

                                             Figure 9: AARON




                                   Image removed for copyright reasons




     Cohen also gave AARON machine learning capabilities. All of AARON’s works are different
     from one another and, once the program is running, AARON makes all the decisions about the
     paintings; for example AARON makes decisions about the components of the paintings.

                     Figure 10: AARON follows a set of rules to create works of art




                                   Images removed for copyright reasons




     AARON’s drawings and paintings have been exhibited in a number of museums, including the
     San Francisco Museum of Modern Art, The Tate, London and the Stedelijk Museum, Amsterdam.
     According to one art critic, “AARON allows the spontaneously occurring accidents that often give a
     work of art its character to remain, rather than efficiently cleaning them up”.

(Question 7 continued)

     (a)   AARON, like all expert systems, has a knowledge base and inference engine.

		(i)            Identify two possible items that could be included in AARON’s knowledge base.    [2]

		(ii)           Programs like AARON often contain fuzzy logic. Identify two characteristics of
                 fuzzy logic.                                                                     [2]

		(iii)          Identify two characteristics of machine learning.                                [2]

     (b)   (i)   AARON needs to select colours for leaves and flowers in each drawing. Once a
                 shape is selected, it must follow these rules:
                 • AARON can colour large flowers red
                 • AARON can colour small flowers blue
                 • if the shape is a leaf, AARON can colour it green
                 • if the shape is neither a leaf nor a flower, AARON should not colour it.

                 Copy and complete the information below to construct a decision tree that
                 AARON could use to colour its drawings.                                          [4]

                                                   Figure 11:



                                           Is the colour inside the
                                             shape the same as
                                                the underlying
                                                   canvas?

                                     Yes                              No




                               Do not colour it.            Is the shape a flower?




		(ii)           Explain one weakness of using a decision tree like this one for AARON.           [2]

     (c)   Discuss the museums’ decision to list AARON as the artist when exhibiting AARON’s
           paintings and drawings.                                                                [8]
