Complete one of the following tasks. Write 250 to 400 words.

1.   Cultural diversity

     Your local newspaper has published an article proposing that students from any country should
     be allowed to attend your country’s universities free of charge. Write a letter to the editor of the
     newspaper, in which you give your opinion on the matter.


2.   Customs and traditions

     Your teacher has set as your next essay topic: “When countries observe annual celebrations,
     such as Christmas, Diwali, Halloween or Valentine’s Day, there is more emphasis on the
     commercial side of these festivities than on their origins and significance.” Write your essay.


3.   Health

     Recent research has shown that modern teenagers do less physical exercise than their parents
     did. You find this shocking! Write a leaflet to be put on the school noticeboard in which you
     suggest fun ways for young people to incorporate exercise into their daily lives.


4.   Leisure

     Your school is closed for a mid-term break and you and your friends have decided to clean up and
     develop an ugly, abandoned area of your town for the benefit of the local residents. Write a blog
     describing your goals and the progress your group is making.


5.   Science and technology

     You recently read a news report which claimed that all cars will run on electricity in 15 years’ time.
     Write an article for your school magazine in which you consider the possible advantages and
     disadvantages of such a future.
