General notes:
 The following paragraphs are to be considered suggestions, rather than prescriptions, that is,
  all points made by candidates to be marked on their merits.
 Any attempt to answer should be acknowledged as such; that should be followed especially in
  translation, when some candidates depart from literal in favour of a more poetic rendition, faithful,
  of course, to the original idea.
 The second use of the same figure of speech to answer a style question should be penalized, by not
  being taken into account: for example, double mention of alliteration.

10.   (a)   Mark only for length of syllables. Award [1] per line if all correct; no mark otherwise.

      (b)   The analysis should highlight the three elements of the argument: if one denies that the body
            has sensations (the body has sensations) [1]; and believes that it is the soul that feels (the
            soul itself has no feelings) [1]; he will fight against evidence (this is shown by evidence) [1].
            Other answers to be marked on their merits.

      (c)   Award [3] for a correct answer, or for an answer with no more than one minor error.
            Award [2] for answers with up to two or three minor errors or one major error. Award [1]
            for answers with two major errors (or four minor errors). Otherwise, no mark should be
            awarded.

      (d)   Award [1] each up to [4] for a range of answers. Points might include: the eyes are not
            simply doorways (ut foribus spectare reclusis … difficilest); their feelings suggest otherwise
            (contra cum sensus ducat eorum); harsh or bright light ruins sight, (sensus enim trahit atque
            acies detrudit ad ipsas, fulgida praesertim cum cernere saepe nequimus); loss of eyes or
            sight ought to make us “see” even better (exemptis oculis); because our mind would not be
            restricted by the size of our eyes (quod foribus non fit; neque enim, qua cernimus ipsi, ostia
            suscipiunt ullum reclusa laborem); other answers on their merits; translations/paraphrases
            are accepted: no further deduction is required. Latin quotations are included here for
            reference only.

      (e)   Award [1] each up to [3] rhetorical figures such as:
             hendiadys (dedit ac docuit)
             alliteration (dedit ac docuit)
             repetition/epistrophe (aevo)
             didactic tone (nominitaminus)
             polyptoton (lumina luminibus)
             philosophical tyone/arguing (at…)
             simile (ut foribus)
             any other rhetorical figure with its relevant example on its own merit.
                                                                                                 [15 marks]
