         Taking a break

         My exams are in 20 days. It’s time to study so I have to take a break from my blog for a while.
         I don’t even watch TV anymore. But my exams end on 28 May and then, at last, I’ll be FREE!

 5       C’ya soon,
         Narendra

10       What is this blog about?
         Yesterday I was thinking about the purpose of this blog. When I started it, I thought that I
         would post messages about everything I’m passionate about. Then two posts later,
         I wondered why I was doing this. I needed some sort of aim. Here is what I think.

         We, the younger generation, are confused about life, work and the future. Society (the older
15       generation) tells us to study hard, go to college and get an excellent mark in every subject.
         So we forget our dreams and accept a job that we will most probably hate. Then all we can
         do for the rest of our lives is say that life is bad and ask why we aren’t happy when we have
         done everything they told us to do.

         So this is the aim of the blog. I want to tell you that this is your life. Don’t follow orders.
20       Do whatever you want to do. Live your life as you want to. You should be the one who
         controls it.

25     A revolution begins
       “Please have a seat,” my class teacher said.
       I sat down with my dad. It was the day we saw the results of my class examinations.
       She brought my exam papers. I nervously opened them. 23/35 computer science. My dad
       said, “How did you score so badly?”. He continued to read the results. Maths 54/90. At this
30     point, I felt shocked. Had I worked hard for six months just to get this? My dad got angry.
       He quickly read the exam papers. His hands shook. Science 70/90. English 70/80.
       I felt sad. Then I thought of my family. Did their love for me depend on my marks?
       That day, I realized something. On this blog we can change the way we think. We can choose
       our own direction and be free to make our own choices.

         An Interview with our
         Youth Representative, Laura John


         This year’s Australian Youth Representative to the United Nations is Laura John. The 24 year old
         lives in Melbourne where she studies law, as well as having an impressive list of leadership roles
         in the community. Laura was happy to chat with us about next year, her plans for the future and
         how she stays motivated.

 5       UN Youth (UNY)*: [ – X – ]

         Laura John (LJ):     I’ve been lucky to work with several organizations at home and abroad.
                              I started volunteering with the Oaktree Foundation, a youth-run organization
                              committed to ending extreme poverty, when I finished high school.

         UNY: [ – 18 – ]

10       L J:   I have wonderful support from my family, friends and colleagues. These people encourage
                and support me when things seem too difficult. My Sri Lankan heritage is also a reminder
                of how lucky I am to live and be educated in Australia. I’ve received many amazing
                opportunities that my family in Sri Lanka can only imagine. I have to represent all other
                young people. We all deserve the same opportunities to be the best we can be: our place
15              of birth is not important.

         UNY: [ – 19 – ]

         L J:   I’m passionate about the rights of refugees. Australians are generous people; many
                have ancestors who came to this country and found a new home which accepted cultural
                diversity and encouraged tolerance. That’s the kind of Australia we should try hard to be –
20              a country where the values of compassion and generosity are important.

         UNY: [ – 20 – ]

         L J:   I want to convince young Australians that they have the ability to create change. I hope
                that young women and migrants in particular can look at me and see that none of us
                should be limited by our gender or the colour of our skin.

25       UNY [ – 21 – ]

         L J:   I have wanted to be a human rights lawyer since I was 12 years old and that remains
                my goal. Next year, I will start work as a lawyer and I hope to stay involved in human
                rights law. I will also work to encourage young people to achieve their dreams, even when
                I am not so young myself!

                                     Doctor’s advice

        Preparing for an examination can make you anxious. A little stress can help
         to motivate you but, on the other hand, too much stress can make you panic.
         The most important thing to do when faced with stress is first to take care of
         yourself. You must be in good physical and mental condition to deal with
         examination pressure.

        How can I get rid of stress?
         Learn relaxation techniques: deep breathing, yoga and meditation. Take short
         breaks during studies. Go for a short walk. Listen to relaxing music. Take a
         short nap.

        What food should I be eating?
         To stay healthy you should definitely not eat food with sugar like cakes, pies and
         chocolates. Home-cooked food and fresh fruit and vegetables are good for you.
         You should eat 5–6 smaller meals, drink 6 – 8 glasses of water and walk or jog for
         30 minutes a day.

        Does last-minute intensive work produce good results?
         Is your plan of action to sit up all night studying? You will come out of the study
         session exhausted. Ideally, your examination preparation should begin 4– 6 weeks
         in advance. The main goal is revision, practice and improving your weak areas.
         First, prepare a timetable for each subject. Revise all the important points.
         Go through past examination papers.

        Does listening to music while studying help you to learn?
         Distractions such as computer games, music and TV can take your attention
         away from studies. They should only be used during break-time. Group studies
         and group discussions with classmates are useful, but make sure not to waste
         time chatting.

        What should you do on the big day?
         Get a good night’s sleep so that you wake up refreshed. Get ready early
         and arrive at the examination room early. When the examination papers are
         distributed, write the easier and shorter questions first.  Finally, try and keep
         15 minutes at the end for a final review of your answers.
