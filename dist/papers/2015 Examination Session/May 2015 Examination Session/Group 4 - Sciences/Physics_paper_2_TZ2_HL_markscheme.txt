This markscheme is the property of the International Baccalaureate and
must not be reproduced or distributed to any other person
without the authorization of the IB Assessment Centre.

1.    Follow the markscheme provided, award only whole marks and mark only in RED.

2.    Make sure that the question you are about to mark is highlighted in the mark panel on the
      right-hand side of the screen.

3.    Where a mark is awarded, a tick/check () must be placed in the text at the precise point where
      it becomes clear that the candidate deserves the mark. One tick to be shown for each
      mark awarded.

4.    Sometimes, careful consideration is required to decide whether or not to award a mark.
      In these cases use RM™ Assessor annotations to support your decision. You are encouraged
      to write comments where it helps clarity, especially for re-marking purposes. Use a text box for
      these additional comments. It should be remembered that the script may be returned to the
      candidate.

5.    Personal codes/notations are unacceptable.

6.    Where an answer to a part question is worth no marks but the candidate has attempted the
      part question, use the “ZERO” annotation to award zero marks. Where a candidate has
      not attempted the part question, use the “SEEN” annotation to show you have looked at
      the question. RM™ Assessor will apply “NR” once you click complete.

7.    If a candidate has attempted more than the required number of questions within Section B
      (QIG 6), mark all the answers. RM™ Assessor will only award the highest mark or marks in line
      with the rubric.

8.    Ensure that you have viewed every page including any additional sheets. Please ensure that you
      stamp “SEEN” on any additional pages that contain work not related to the QIG you are currently
      marking, or are blank or where the candidate has crossed out his/her work.

9.    There is no need to stamp an annotation when a candidate has not chosen an optional question
      in Section B (QIG 6). RM™ Assessor will apply “NR” once you click complete.

10.   Mark positively. Give candidates credit for what they have achieved and for what they have
      got correct, rather than penalizing them for what they have got wrong. However, a mark should
      not be awarded where there is contradiction within an answer. Make a comment to this effect
      using a text box or the “CON” stamp.

Subject Details: Physics HL Paper 2 Markscheme
Mark Allocation

Candidates are required to answer ALL questions in Section A [45 marks] and TWO questions in
Section B [2 x 25 marks]. Maximum total = [95 marks].

1.    A markscheme often has more marking points than the total allows. This is intentional.

2.    Each marking point has a separate line and the end is shown by means of a semicolon (;).

3.    An alternative answer or wording is indicated in the markscheme by a slash (/). Either wording
      can be accepted.

4.    Words in brackets ( ) in the markscheme are not necessary to gain the mark.

5.    Words that are underlined are essential for the mark.

6.    The order of marking points does not have to be as in the markscheme, unless stated otherwise.

7.    If the candidate’s answer has the same “meaning” or can be clearly interpreted as being of
      equivalent significance, detail and validity as that in the markscheme then award the mark.
      Where this point is considered to be particularly relevant in a question it is emphasized by
      OWTTE (or words to that effect).

8.    Remember that many candidates are writing in a second language. Effective communication is
      more important than grammatical accuracy.

9.    Occasionally, a part of a question may require an answer that is required for subsequent
      marking points. If an error is made in the first marking point then it should be penalized. However, if
      the incorrect answer is used correctly in subsequent marking points then follow through marks
      should be awarded. When marking indicate this by adding ECF (error carried forward) on the script.

10.   Do not penalize candidates for errors in units or significant figures, unless it is specifically referred
      to in the markscheme.
