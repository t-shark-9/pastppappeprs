Mark allocation

Section A: Candidates are required to answer all questions. Total 25 marks.
Section B: Candidates are required to answer all questions. Total 45 marks.
           Maximum total = 70 marks.

General

A markscheme often has more specific points worthy of a mark than the total allows. This is intentional.
Do not award more than the maximum marks allowed for that part of a question.

When deciding upon alternative answers by candidates to those given in the markscheme, consider the
following points:

          Each statement worth one point has a separate line and the end is signified by means of
           a semi-colon (;).

          An alternative answer or wording is indicated in the markscheme by a “/”; either wording can
           be accepted.

          Words in ( … ) in the markscheme are not necessary to gain the mark.

          If the candidate’s answer has the same meaning or can be clearly interpreted as being the
           same as that in the markscheme then award the mark.

          Mark positively. Give candidates credit for what they have achieved and for what they have
           got correct, rather than penalizing them for what they have not achieved or what they have
           got wrong.

          Remember that many candidates are writing in a second language; be forgiving of
           minor linguistic slips. In this subject effective communication is more important than
           grammatical accuracy.

          Occasionally, a part of a question may require a calculation whose answer is required for
           subsequent parts. If an error is made in the first part then it should be penalized. However,
           if the incorrect answer is used correctly in subsequent parts then follow through marks
           should be awarded. Indicate this with “FT”.


General guidance

  Issue            Guidance
  Answering        • In the case of an “identify” question read all answers and mark positively up to the
  more than          maximum marks. Disregard incorrect answers.
  the quantity     • In the case of a “describe” question, which asks for a certain number of facts
  of                 eg “describe two kinds”, mark the first two correct answers. This could include two
  responses          descriptions, one description and one identification, or two identifications.
  prescribed       • In the case of an “explain” question, which asks for a specified number of
  in the             explanations eg “explain two reasons …”, mark the first two correct answers.
  questions          This could include two full explanations, one explanation, one partial explanation etc.

     For example:
     A sub-procedure is a section of code in a program that does a specific job;
     It can be called by name when needed without naming the details as these are
     wrapped in the procedure;                                                             [2]

     Award [1 mark] for showing all working in a trace table with at least three columns (eg COUNT,
     SUM, OUTPUT).
     Award the first 3 marks for an evident trace but working not shown in a trace table.

     Example answer 1:

          COUNT      N mod COUNT=0           SUM               SUM=N        output

     Those with mobility or coordination issues, or simply with large hands, may need a larger and/or less
     sensitive pad to control the cursor;

     Standard accessibility for visually impaired;
     Larger text option or text to speech;                                                                [4]

     (b)    Award [1 mark] for the correct tasks and [1 mark] for outlining how they can be
            done concurrently.

            “Write report” and “prepare presentation” can be done at the same time as they
            can be performed by different students (using the same data).                 [2]

8.   (a)   Award marks as follows, up to [6 marks max].
           Award [1 mark] for looping through the database and accessing all records.
           Award [1 mark] for correct calculation of date difference (eg = today – paymentDate
                 OR paymentDate – today).
           Award [1 mark] for each list correctly compiled, x3 (correct conditional statements according
           to date difference used).
           Note: Accept date difference not calculated/stated but assumed as “today – paymentDate”
                 OR “paymentDate – today”.

           loop through all CUSTREC in DATABASE
                DUEPERIOD = CURRDATE - CUSTREC.PAYMENTDATE
                if DUEPERIOD > 30 then
                     add CUSTREC to LIST3
                     flag CUSTREC to delete
                else if DUEPERIOD > 14 then
                     add CUSTREC to LIST2
                else if DUEPERIOD > - 30 then

                end if
           end loop                                                                                   [6]


           Note: If candidates give their answer in flowchart form then credit them using the same
           marking points.

     (c)   Award [1 mark] for a consequence of data loss to customers and [1 mark] for a
           consequence of data loss to the insurance company.

           Example answer:
           Customers would not be reminded when they needed to pay and some may
           overlook payment, hence not be insured;
           The company could lose customers/ruin reputation;                               [2]

(d)   Award marks as follows up to [3 marks max].
      Award [1 mark] for a suitable measure and [2 marks] for a description related to
      the insurance company.
      Example answers:

      All changes to the records made on two systems;
      If one fails then the other holds all current data;

      Off site backup;
      Snapshots/backups made on a regular basis;

9.   (a)   Award up to [3 marks max].
           The OSI is a standardized system/model for network connection;
           Consists of (7) layers;
           Each dealing with specific parts of network communication;
           For example the physical layer which defines the physical connection;              [3]

           Note: Award [1 mark] for the purpose of any of the 7 layers.
           If candidate lists all 7 layers with no specific example award [2 marks] and a
           further [1 mark] if the purpose of at least one layer is given.

     (b)   Award up to [3 marks max].
           Protocols are a set of rules;
           To facilitate a process being carried out correctly;
           (Used in each layer to ensure communication;)
           For example (in the physical layer) the protocols could define the methods for
           opening and closing communication;                                             [3]
           Note: Do not accept examples which are not related to networks.

     (c)   Award [2 marks] for an advantage with an elaboration and [2 marks] for a
           disadvantage with an elaboration, up to [4 marks max].
           For example:
           An advantage is that lawyers can access quickly with mobile devices;
           Anywhere in the building and do not need to be at the workstation;

           Users can logon with their own devices (if properly configured);
           More familiar with interface/functions;

           One disadvantage is security as it could be possible to get to the server from a
           nearby neighbourhood if not very secure;
           Less secure than the cabled system in the building;

           Wireless signal could be weak in some parts of the building;
           Leading to frustrated/ineffective employees;                                       [4]

     (d)   Award marks as follows up to [5 marks max].
           Award [1 mark] for looping through the collection.
           Award [1 mark] for returning a job first if time>10 min.
           Award [1 mark] for searching the loop again for each priority level.
           Award [1 mark] for searching from 1 – 4 in order.
           Award [1 mark] for ending when the highest priority level job is found.

           Note: Accept algorithms, bullet points and text answers which are clear and in correct logical
                 order. Accept the list being sorted before searching.

           For example:
                loop through all the jobs
                   If job.time > 10 min return job
                   else set priority = 1
                     while priority< 5
                        loop through all jobs
                          if job.priority = priority return job
                        endloop
                        increment priority
                     end while
                   endif
                endloop                                                                       [5]

10.   (a)   Award [2 marks max] for the similarities and [2 marks max] for the differences.
            Both use nested loops;
            Each time reducing the inner loop;

            Bubble sort swaps adjacent items each time it goes through the list;
            Selection sort finds the next smallest each time it goes through the list;
            Bubble sort can exit early if already sorted;                                      [4]

      (b)   Award [1 mark] for reference to the size of the list and [1 mark] for stating why
            the selection sort is faster.
            It is possible that selection sort will only need 10 passes of the outer loop to find
            10 fastest times;
            But bubble sort will need to complete the procedure for the entire list every time;

            OR

            List is long;
            Swapping takes longer than selecting;                                              [2]

      (c)   Award marks as follows up to [6 marks max].
            Award [1 mark] for setting all variables at start.
            Award [1 mark] for correct double looping through TIMES.
            Award [1 mark] for correct selection of MIN.
            Award [1 mark] for transfer to FASTEST.
            Award [1 mark] for successful swapping selected value.
            Award [1 mark] for resetting MIN to value transferred.
            Award [1 mark] for incrementing array index in FASTEST.
            Award [1 mark] for transfer of exactly 10 elements.

            For example:

            Note: Accept any reasonable value set as MIN – including TIMES[0] provided that this is not
            replaced by MIN after the first loop.

      Alternatively the array can be sorted and then transferred in which case award
      marks as follows:

      Award [1 mark] for creating the array FASTEST.
      Award [1 mark] for correct double looping through TIMES.
      Award [1 mark] for comparing adjacent values.
      Award [1 mark] for correct swap if second value is lower.
      Award [1 mark] for looping through FASTEST.
      Award [1 mark] for transferring first TIMES to FASTEST.                                  [6]

(d)   The problem with parallel arrays is the sorting/indexing/maintaining relationship;
      An object would contain at least a name and a time (accept other descriptions of
      object);
      Would only need to sort the array of objects / only one list to be sorted;         [3]
