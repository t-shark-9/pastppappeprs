1.    Follow the markscheme provided, award only whole marks and mark only in RED.

2.    Make sure that the question you are about to mark is highlighted in the mark panel on the
      right-hand side of the screen.

3.    Where a mark is awarded, a tick/check () must be placed in the text at the precise point where
      it becomes clear that the candidate deserves the mark. One tick to be shown for each mark
      awarded.

4.    Sometimes, careful consideration is required to decide whether or not to award a mark. In these
      cases use RM™ Assessor annotations to support your decision. You are encouraged to write
      comments where it helps clarity, especially for re-marking purposes. Use a text box for these
      additional comments. It should be remembered that the script may be returned to the candidate.

5.    Personal codes/notations are unacceptable.

6.    Where an answer to a part question is worth no marks but the candidate has attempted the part
      question, use the “ZERO” annotation to award zero marks. Where a candidate has not attempted
      the part question, use the “SEEN” annotation to show you have looked at the question. RM™
      Assessor will apply “NR” once you click complete.

7.    If a candidate has attempted more than the required number of questions within a paper or
      section of a paper, mark all the answers. RM™ Assessor will only award the highest mark or
      marks in line with the rubric.

8.    Ensure that you have viewed every page including any additional sheets. Please ensure that you
      stamp “SEEN” on any additional pages that are blank or where the candidate has crossed out
      his/her work.

9.    There is no need to stamp an annotation when a candidate has not chosen an option. RM™
      Assessor will apply “NR” once you click complete.

10.   Mark positively. Give candidates credit for what they have achieved and for what they have got
      correct, rather than penalizing them for what they have got wrong. However, a mark should not be
      awarded where there is contradiction within an answer. Make a comment to this effect using a text
      box or the “CON” stamp.

Subject Details:        Design Technology HL Paper 3 Markscheme

Mark Allocation

Candidates are required to answer questions from ONE of the Options [1 × 40 marks].
Maximum total = [40 marks]

1.    A markscheme often has more marking points than the total allows. This is intentional.

2.    Each marking point has a separate line and the end is shown by means of a semicolon (;).

3.    An alternative answer or wording is indicated in the markscheme by a slash (/). Either wording can
      be accepted.

4.    Words in brackets ( ) in the markscheme are not necessary to gain the mark.

5.    Words that are underlined are essential for the mark.

6.    The order of marking points does not have to be as in the markscheme, unless stated otherwise.

7.    If the candidate’s answer has the same “meaning” or can be clearly interpreted as being of
      equivalent significance, detail and validity as that in the markscheme then award the mark.
      Where this point is considered to be particularly relevant in a question it is emphasized by
      WTTE (or words to that effect).

8.    Remember that many candidates are writing in a second language. Effective communication is
      more important than grammatical accuracy.

9.    Occasionally, a part of a question may require an answer that is required for subsequent
      marking points. If an error is made in the first marking point then it should be penalized. However, if
      the incorrect answer is used correctly in subsequent marking points then follow through marks
      should be awarded. When marking indicate this by adding ECF (error carried forward) on the script.

10.   Do not penalize candidates for errors in units or significant figures, unless it is specifically referred
      to in the markscheme.

Option A — Food science and technology

1.   (a)   Award [1] for stating one reason for the selection of a head of wheat for both the
           gluten-free symbols shown in Figures A1 and A2.

           cereals, eg wheat, are a major dietary source of gluten and thus a major problem
           in relation to gluten intolerance;
           the seed head of the plant is an easily recognizable shape and thus a good visual
           symbol;                                                                                [1 max]

     (b)   Award [1] for identifying how gluten intolerance impacts on diet and [1] for a brief
           explanation [2 max].

           people who suffer gluten intolerance should avoid foods that contain cereals;
           this can be difficult as a lot of processed foods contain wheat flour;

           because wheat flour is used widely in processed foods and recipes;
           it can be difficult to achieve a varied, interesting and balanced diet;

           products containing wheat / gluten in diet need to be replaced;
           by gluten free foods;                                                                  [2 max]

     (c)   Award [1] for each of three distinct correct points in an explanation of why many
           food retailers have produced ranges of gluten-free foods [3 max].

           gluten intolerance is increasingly common;
           food retailers are responding to a distinct market segment;
           the size of the market segment makes gluten-free ranges financially viable;                [3]


2.   (a)   Award [1] for a definition of genetically modified organism to the effect of:

           a plant or animal in which the DNA has been altered through the insertion of genetic
           material from another source;                                                              [1]

     (b)   Award [1] for each of two distinct correct points in a description of the
           significance of the FlavrSavr™ tomato [2 max].

           it was the first commercially-grown genetically modified food to be licensed for
           human consumption;
           it became the focus for the anti-GMO lobby;                                                [2]
                                                   –6–                    M15/4/DESTE/HP3/ENG/TZ0/XX/M


3.   (a)   Award [1] for each of two distinct correct points in a description of one way in
           which the packaging of Coca-Cola® has contributed to the development of the
           Coca-Cola® brand [2 max].

           the red colour/the shape of the bottle/can/the font used;
           highly recognizable/distinctive;
           are all strongly associated/synonymous with the brand;

           the structural design of the packaging is good;
           easy to hold/easy to open/recyclable;

           aesthetically sound – timeless design;
           has provided a consistent image for the product;                                       [2 max]

     (b)   Award [1] for one purpose of food labelling and [1] for a brief explanation [2 max].

           to provide nutritional information;
           nutritional information is designed to help consumers make informed food
           choices (eg to achieve a balanced diet);

           to indicate storage information;
           correct storage will maximize the shelf life of the product;

           to provide serving ideas;
           consumers may not be sure how the product should be used;

           to indicate the ingredients used;
           especially those that may cause allergies;                                             [2 max]


4.   Award [1] for each distinct point in an explanation of two principal causes of chemical
     spoilage of food [3 max per cause, 6 max].

     enzymic spoilage (or autolysis);
     living organisms use enzymes to catalyse chemical reactions in its cells;
     after harvesting these enzymes can cause the decomposition of the tissue so the food
     decays;

     rancidity;
     relates to the fat/oil content of a food;
     chemical breakdown of the fat or oil leads to off-flavours in the food;                          [6]
                                                    –7–                      M15/4/DESTE/HP3/ENG/TZ0/XX/M

           product and [1] for a brief explanation [2 max].

           to see if the food is attractive to consumers in terms of its texture, smell, colour
           and form;
           to get feedback from consumers to make any final changes to the product before
           going to full/industrial-scale production;

           marketing;
           promoting food products to consumers;

     (b)   Award [1] for a factor that determines the need for primary processing and [1] for
           a brief explanation [2 max].

           storage properties;
           to extend the shelf life of the product and prevent spoilage/make food safe;

           to reduce volume/weight;
           to facilitate distribution/reduce energy costs of distribution;                        [2 max]

     (c)   Award [1] for the role of food manufacturers in the food chain between the farmer
           and the consumer and [1] for a brief explanation [2 max].

           develop safe products for consumers;                                                       [2]


6.   (a)   Award [1] for each of three distinct correct points in an explanation of how the
           design of food preparation areas can help prevent food poisoning [3 max].

           proper design of food preparation areas will ensure they are easy to keep clean;
           so will reduce the likelihood of contamination of food by food poisoning bacteria;
           uncracked worksurfaces reduces ingrained dirt and the potential
           for contamination;

           workflow design ensures the separation of raw and cooked foods;
           raw food carries food poisoning bacteria;
           if not separated can get cross-contamination;

      (c)   Award [1] for each of three distinct correct points in an explanation of how the
            circuit works so that the buzzer sounds if the freezer malfunctions [3 max].

            if the freezer malfunctions the temperature in the freezer will rise and the
            resistance of thermistor Y will decrease;
            if the voltage at the inverting input (-) is lower than that that of the non-inverting
            (+) input;
            the output of the op-amp will be high (or vice versa);                                      [3]

            round nose;                                                                                 [1]

      (b)   Award [1] for a reason why the feed rate of a CNC lathe would be changed
            according to the material being processed and [1] for a brief explanation [2 max].

            harder materials / metals require a lower feed rate than softer materials;
            if you have it too high the tool will not cut properly / will become damaged;               [2]

      (c)   Award [1] for each of three distinct correct points in a comparison of the effects of
            using large or small diameter tools for CNC machining [3 max].

            large diameter tools will carry out the process more quickly than small diameter
            tools as they cut out a larger area;
            but they cannot cut intricate shapes precisely;
            especially where curved surfaces are required;                                              [3]


16.   (a)   Award [1] for stating a physical property of modelling wax which makes it
            appropriate for use in a CNC machining process.

            (low) hardness;
            easy to machine;                                                                        [1 max]

      (b)   Award [1] for each valid reason listed of why modelling wax is cost effective to
            use as a modelling material in a CNC process.

            it is easy to cut/does not wear (machine) tools;
            the waste can be recycled;
            it is readily available;
            it can be precision engineered;                                                         [2 max]

17.   (a)   Award [1] for each of two distinct correct points in a description of the relationship
            of the dark and light colours in the FEA image shown in Figure C1 [2 max].

            the darker colours represent parts of the car unaffected by the crash/not
            damaged;
            the lighter the colour the greater the effect of the impact on the car;

            the darker colours show parts of the car unaffected by the impact;
            the lighter colours show where the greatest stress concentrations have occurred;         [2 max]

      (b)   Award [1] for a reason why the designer would carry out a series of tests to
            obtain reliable data from FEA CAD images similar to that in Figure 2 and [1] for a
            brief explanation [2 max].

            test the vehicle at different speeds;
            based on typical speed limits for different roads;

            test at different impact angles;
            drivers will take different forms of evasive action in a crash;

            test for impact with different objects;
            to see how their properties may affect the amount of damage / stress loading;

            to design better vehicles;
            which are safer in a range of different scenarios;                                       [2 max]


18.   Award [1] for each distinct point in an explanation of two ways in which the use of rapid
      prototyping influences the design development cycle for a new product [3 max per
      way, 6 max].

      speed;
      rapid prototyping means that sophisticated models can be produced very quickly;
      so decisions can be taken about the final design more quickly than with the use of
      traditional modelling techniques;

      cost;
      although rapid prototyping can be expensive to produce;
      it often eliminates the need for other types of modelling;
      which reduces the overall cost of the cycle;

      user trial/expert appraisal;
      rapid prototype models allow potential users/experts to evaluate/test the design
      concept;
      resulting in feedback which can be used to improve the final design;                           [6 max]

19.   (a)   Award [1] for each of two distinct correct points in a description of one task which
            could be done by a robot to aid the manufacture of the spindle in Figure 3
            [2 max].

            sand/abrade the wood;
            while it is still rotating in the lathe;

            fit the wooden blank to the lathe for turning;
            take the turned spindle out of the lathe;

            apply a finish to the spindle;
            once it has been taken out of the lathe;

            provide quality control;
            sensors can measure sizes/identify flaws;

            prepare the blank;
            depending on spindle design size;

            turn the actual form of the spindle;
            so increase the rate of production;                                                    [2 max]

      (b)   Award [1] for each of two characteristics of the hardwood timber which are
            important for accurate turning of the spindles on the CNC lathe [2 max].

            close grain;
            no defects;
            straight grain;                                                                        [2 max]

      (c)   Award [1] for one health and safety consideration if the spindle was
            manufactured from medium density fibreboard (MDF) rather than hardwood and
            [1] for a brief explanation [2 max].

            fine particles of dust containing potentially harmful deposits of resin would be
            created from turning MDF;
            the dust would need to be extracted from the atmosphere quickly;                           [2]


20.   (a)   Award [1] for each of three distinct correct points in an explanation of how rapid
            prototyping can reduce the use of natural resources [3 max].

            rapid prototyping methods are often additive rather than subtractive techniques;
            so less material is wasted;
            subtractive techniques cut the product out of a larger block of material;

            there are fewer potential errors in moving from design (CAD) to manufacture
            (CAM) using rapid prototyping;
            fewer errors result in less wasted material;                                           [3 max]

      (b)   Award [1] for each of three distinct correct points in an explanation of why
            multi-national corporations (MNCs) need to take out patents in different countries
            for a new invention [3 max].

            patent laws vary from country to country;
            a multi-national company will sell products in different global markets;
            in order to fully protect their intellectual rights they need to register the invention with the
            appropriate authorities in each market if they are to successfully claim against imitators in
            that market;                                                                                     [3]


21.   Award [1] for each distinct correct point in a discussion of three reasons why car manufacturers
      often use animation to promote new vehicles on their website [3 max per reason, 9 max total].

      animation allows the consumer to view all angles of the vehicle as it rotates;
      so it gives a good overall impression of what the car looks like in reality;
      and its features;

      the consumer can control the speed of the animation;
      so they can study a particular angle/feature;
      and zoom in/out to see some features more closely;

      the animation can be linked to other aspects of the website;
      so the consumer can gain more detailed information from links/pull-down menus etc;
      in order to fully evaluate the vehicle’s suitability for them;

      animation is more interesting for consumers than static images;
      it can be used by sales people interacting with consumers in a car showroom to
      demonstrate features of the car;
      a skilled salesperson will concentrate on the features which the consumer is
      particularly interested in;

      raise the “sophistication” of the website;
      client has a better “opinion” of the company;
      increase customer satisfaction and potential sales;                                              [9 max]

      Do not award marks for television advertisement and/or design developments.

22.   (a)   Award [1] for stating one property of Spandex which makes it suitable for use in
            the Cedar jacket.

            Elasticity;                                                                                 [1]

      (b)   Award [1] for one material characteristic of polyester that makes it suitable for the
            fleece jacket and [1] for a brief explanation [2 max].

            good thermal conductivity;
            a fleece jacket is usually worn outdoors in cold weather;

            washability;
            the jacket is likely to get dirty from use with outdoor activities and so needs to be
            easy to maintain;                                                                       [2 max]

      (c)   Award [1] for each of three distinct correct points in an explanation of one
            disadvantage of nylon for the lining of the jacket [3 max].

            nylon is not breathable;
            jacket will be worn outdoors and likely to be used when undertaking vigorous
            exercise;
            moisture / sweat will be trapped making the jacket uncomfortable / creating an unpleasant
            odour;                                                                                    [3]


23.   (a)   Award [1] for stating which country originally benefited from trading silk with
            China via the silk route.

            Italy;                                                                                      [1]

      (b)   Award [1] for one limitation of the commercial production of spider silk
            (“bio steel”) and [1] for a brief explanation [2 max].

            the spiders cannot be farmed easily/cost-effectively;
            they are aggressive creatures which cannot be kept together;

            silk spiders are cannibalistic/they eat each other;
            it is costly to provide cages for each individual spider;
            a lot of spiders are needed to produce a small area of cloth (400 spiders per square yard)
            so bearing in mind the need to separate the spiders – too expensive to produce
            commercially;                                                                         [2 max]

24.   (a)   Award [1] for one reason why weaving is an appropriate technique to
            manufacture the prosthesis shown in Figure 2 and [1] for a brief explanation
            [2 max].

            woven products have good dimensional stability;
            so the product will not deform;                                                            [2]

      (b)   Award [1] for one reason why the design of textile vascular prostheses requires a
            large and diverse design team and [1] for a brief explanation [2 max].

            the technology involved is complex;
            specialists from the medical profession and the textile industry are required;             [2]


25.   Award [1] for each distinct point in a comparison of mass customization with craft
      production in relation to value-for-money for a consumer wishing to purchase a one-off
      item of clothing [3 max per issue, 6 max].

      both processes allow for the individual requirements of the consumer in relation to
      fit/design;
      mass customization is usually cheaper as the system provides economies of scale;
      even for one-off production;

      craft production will be carried out by skilled craftsmen;
      who will have a wide range of skills;
      such craftsmen will be able to exploit the characteristics of a specific material in order
      to make the most of pattern/drape;

      CNC machines/CAM will carry out pre-programmed manufacturing techniques with
      mass customization;
      craftsmen will be able to employ a variety of manufacturing techniques to create a
      higher-quality item;
      craft production has higher labour costs compared to mass customization;
      consumers who can afford to pay the high price for craft production will appreciate the
      quality and consider it better value-for-money;                                              [6 max]

26.   (a)   Award [1] for each of two distinct correct points in a description of how the haptic
            output device technology will help the gymnast to perfect her routines [2 max].

            sensors measure the movement of parts of the body during the routine;
            data is stored in a computer in both numerical and visual form so the gymnast has
            access to it when required / the textile haptic suit will be programmed to provide
            feedback when gymnast’s routine is not perfect;                                            [2]

      (b)   Award [1] for one advantage of using laser welding in the manufacture of
            wearable computing garments such as the gymnasts haptic textile suit and [1] for
            a brief explanation [2 max].

            neat appearance/finish to seams;
            very effective / accurate joining method for seams;

            as the haptic suit is skin tight, bulky sewn seams would be inappropriate and
            laser-welded seams would be much less bulky and more comfortable when the
            wearer of the garment is moving;                                                       [2 max]

      (c)   Award [1] for one disadvantage of the use of laser welding for the manufacture of
            wearable computing garments in relation to sustainability and [1] for a brief
            explanation [2 max].

            it is a permanent joining technique so garments are not as easy to repair as with
            stitching;
            it makes garments more difficult to recycle;                                               [2]

27.   (a)   Award [1] for each of three distinct correct points in an explanation of the impact
            of the introduction of automation on the health of the textile industry employees
            [3 max].

            machines are usually boxed in which contains the noise and makes it quieter
            for operatives;
            so there is less impact on the hearing of workers than with mechanization;
            and workers do not need to shout to communicate with each other;

            boxing in the machines makes them safer to use;
            there are likely to be fewer injuries relating to operatives coming in contact with
            moving parts;
            extraction of dust and fibres is likely to be more effective in terms of extraction of
            fibre particles and reduction in atmospheric pollution;

            good build quality of automated machines;
            more reliability so workers do not need to constantly mend broken threads;
            and better regulations mean that machines are safer to use;                              [3 max]

      (b)   Award [1] for each of three distinct correct points in an explanation of the impact
            on the wider community of the introduction of mechanization in the textile industry
            rather than just the textile industry employees [3 max].

            change from working at home in villages to working in factories in towns;
            destroyed village life/communities;
            and depleted craft skills;

            created overcrowding in new towns;
            little/poor sanitation;
            disease spread quickly throughout communities;

            reduced reliance on manual labour;
            resulted in cheaper products;
            made textile products more affordable;                                                   [3 max]

      formation of large companies for manufacture/retailing;
      economies of scale could be achieved;
      creation of shops/stores in urban areas;

      expansion of advertising and other media;
      allowed for advertising campaigns to reach many people;
      and people were influenced by fashion shown in films;

      working women;
      in industrialized countries many women worked in factories;
      so had their own money to spend on products other than for the family;

      changing social attitudes;
      spending money to buy clothes to create more choice for consumers of what to wear

            quantitatively [3 max].

            purely qualitative data can be difficult to analyse effectively;
            it may need to be converted to a form that can be more easily analysed;
            quantitative data is universally understood;
            allows for patterns and trends to be determined;
            data can be easily compared for different chair designs;                               [3 max]


30.   (a)   Award [1] for stating one type of feedback used in the design of a microwave
            oven to alert the user that the cooking cycle is complete.

            audio/beep tone;
            visual/flashing timer display;                                                         [1 max]

      (b)   Award [1] for each distinct point in a description of why affordance is an important
            consideration in relation to the design of a product [2 max].

            affordance is the property of an object which indicates how it should be used;
            it lowers the memory burden / makes the user interface more intuitive;                     [2]

31.   (a)   Award [1] for which percentiles the designer would use for the three height
            positions of the ironing board and [1] for a brief explanation [2 max].

            5th, 50th and 95th adult percentiles;
            to cover the majority of the users/population WTTE;                                        [2]

            Do not accept 5th–95th percentile or if 50th percentile is not explicitly mentioned.

      (b)   Award [1] for one reason for providing the ironing board in three different board
            widths and [1] for a brief explanation [2 max].

            types of clothes to be ironed;
            some clothes will fit the board better depending on the width;

            efficiency;
            more fabric can be ironed on a wider board/small board will take more time to
            iron wide fabrics;

            consumer choice;
            depending on ironing techniques/styles consumers can choose the board which
            best suits them;

            cost;
            the manufacturer can differentiate the cost of the boards based on size;

            reduced living/storage space;
            smaller boards required;                                                               [2 max]

            Do not accept any references to arm length.


32.   Award [1] for each distinct point in suggestion of each of two ways in which human
      factors specialists determine adequate product safety [3 max per suggestion, 6 max].

      behavioural testing;
      perform some activity with the product/system;
      to understand the risks involved for users;

      conceptual testing;
      evaluate safety instructions/warning messages;
      without having to expose users to potentially hazardous conditions;

      fault analysis;
      examination of failures;
      leading to their elimination through re-design;                                              [6 max]

33.   (a)   Award [1] for which aspect of the “four pleasure framework” relates to the
            success of a new type of perfume and [1] for a brief explanation [2 max].

            physio-pleasure;
            the smell of the perfume stimulates demand/appeal;                                        [2]

      (b)   Award [1] for each of two distinct correct points in a description of why the
            purchase of a fashionable (trendy) item of clothing may promote a combination of
            socio-pleasure and psycho-pleasure [2 max].

            Socio:
            fits in with peers wearing the same type of garment;

            Psycho:
            promotes self-esteem/status;                                                              [2]

      (c)   Award [1] for one way in which ideo-pleasure may contribute to a company’s
            corporate social responsibility for promoting green design and [1] for a brief
            explanation [2 max].

            the company will design/manufacture products which satisfy green design
            objectives / emphasize the green credentials when marketing the product;
            to appeal to consumers who value these type of products/seek out such products to
            purchase;                                                                         [2 max]


34.   (a)   Award [1] for each of three distinct correct points in an explanation of how motion
            capture is used to digitally represent motion [3 max].

            a person wears a set of acoustic/inertial/LED/magnetic/reflective markers at each
            joint;
            sensors track the position of the markers as the person moves;
            a digital representation of the motions is developed;                                     [3]

      (b)   data collected is only quantitative;
            does not include factors such as comfort;
            does not give a complete “picture” for designers;
            does not take account of “past experiences”;
            no feedback;                                                                          [3 max]

35.   Award [1] for each distinct correct point in each of three design constraints which might
      compromise the user interface for a new product [3 max per constraint, 9 max total].

      cost;
      a designer may not have the scope to include controls/features which would make the
      product easier to use;
      because the goal of the design brief is to design a cost-effective product which
      competes well in the market;

      aesthetics;
      the style of the product may dictate where controls/features are placed;
      in order for the product to stand out/appeal in the marketplace;

      inadequate user research to underpin the design;
      the designer may have overlooked important aspects of the user-interface;
      causing memory burden/lack of intuitiveness;

      spatial considerations;
      the space within which the interface must fit into the product;
      this may be too small to be easy to use;                                                    [9 max]
