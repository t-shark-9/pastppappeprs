1.   Follow the markscheme provided, award only whole marks and mark only in RED.

2.   Make sure that the question you are about to mark is highlighted in the mark panel on the
     right-hand side of the screen.

3.   Where a mark is awarded, a tick/check () must be placed in the text at the precise point where
     it becomes clear that the candidate deserves the mark. One tick to be shown for each
     mark awarded.

4.   Sometimes, careful consideration is required to decide whether or not to award a mark. In these
     cases use RM™ Assessor annotations to support your decision. You are encouraged to write
     comments where it helps clarity, especially for re-marking purposes. Use a text box for these
     additional comments. It should be remembered that the script may be returned to the candidate.

5.   Personal codes/notations are unacceptable.

6.   Where an answer to a part question is worth no marks but the candidate has attempted
     the part question, use the “ZERO” annotation to award zero marks. Where a candidate has
     not attempted the part question, use the “SEEN” annotation to show you have looked at
     the question. RM™ Assessor will apply “NR” once you click complete.

7.   If a candidate has attempted more than the required number of questions within a paper or
     section of a paper, mark all the answers. RM™ Assessor will only award the highest mark or
     marks in line with the rubric.

8.   Ensure that you have viewed every page including any additional sheets. Please ensure that
     you stamp “SEEN” on any additional pages that are blank or where the candidate has crossed out
     his/her work.

9.   Mark positively. Give candidates credit for what they have achieved and for what they have
     got correct, rather than penalizing them for what they have got wrong. However, a mark
     should not be awarded where there is contradiction within an answer. Make a comment to this
     effect using a text box or the “CON” stamp.

Mark Allocation

Candidates are required to answer ALL questions in Section A (total 20 marks) ONE question in
Section B [20 marks]. Maximum total = 40 marks.

1.    A markscheme often has more marking points than the total allows. This is intentional.

2.    Each marking point has a separate line and the end is shown by means of a semicolon (;).

3.    An alternative answer or wording is indicated in the markscheme by a slash (/). Either wording can
      be accepted.

4.    Words in brackets ( ) in the markscheme are not necessary to gain the mark.

5.    Words that are underlined are essential for the mark.

6.    The order of marking points does not have to be as in the markscheme, unless stated otherwise.

7.    If the candidate’s answer has the same “meaning” or can be clearly interpreted as being of
      equivalent significance, detail and validity as that in the markscheme then award the mark.
      Where this point is considered to be particularly relevant in a question it is emphasized by
      OWTTE (or words to that effect).

8.    Remember that many candidates are writing in a second language. Effective communication is
      more important than grammatical accuracy.

9.    Occasionally, a part of a question may require an answer that is required for subsequent
      marking points. If an error is made in the first marking point then it should be penalized. However, if
      the incorrect answer is used correctly in subsequent marking points then follow through marks
      should be awarded. When marking indicate this by adding ECF (error carried forward) on the script.

10.   Do not penalize candidates for errors in units or significant figures, unless it is specifically referred
      to in the markscheme.

                                                 Section A

1.   (a)   (i)     Award Award [1] for stating the annual amount of carbon emissions
                   produced by Windsor Castle prior to the installation of the hydroelectric
                   scheme.
                   1580 tonnes;                                                                        [1]

           (ii)    Award [1] for stating one reason why fish may be injured by the scheme
                   even though a fish run is installed.
                   fish may not be able to navigate past the strong current so get sucked into
                   the turbine;

                   the protective rubber for the blades of the turbine may rot/become
                   damaged;

                   size of the fish run is too small/inadequate;                                   [1 max]

           (iii)   Award [1] for listing two reasons why the hydroelectric scheme is unlikely to
                   maintain maximum output throughout the year. [2 max].
                   periods of drought/low river level;

                   essential maintenance required;

                   malfunction;                                                                    [2 max]

     (b)   (i)     Award [1] for one reason why the spin rate data for the screws may vary
                   and [1] for a brief explanation.
                   different water flow/currents;
                   varies with the amount of rainfall;

                   mechanism could become damaged;
                   or blocked by debris;                                                               [2]

           (ii)    Award [1] for one reason why the data relating to 95 % of the power needs
                   of Windsor Castle may reduce even if the hydroelectric scheme maintains
                   maximum output and [1] for a brief explanation.
                   power needs of the castle/consumption of energy increases
                   (dependent on the number of users/types or number of appliances used/seasonal
                   conditions; summer cooling or winter heating);
                   but the power output of the scheme stays the same;                                  [2]

     (c)   (i)     Award [1] for stating the ideas generating technique which stimulated the
                   idea for this type of hydroelectric scheme.
                   adaptation;                                                                         [1]

           (ii)    Award [1] for suggesting why the data relating to 400 homes may not be
                   accurate.
                   homes vary in size/amount of people housed;
                   so they will have different energy needs;
                   the data probably based on a typical home’s average energy requirements
                   but no reference is made to this requirement;                                       [3]

2.   (a)   Award [1] for stating the manufacturing technique used to secure the handle to
           the satchel bag.
           fasteners/rivets/ring;                                                                        [1]

     (b)   Award [1] for each distinct correct point in an explanation of the influence of
           fashion and planned obsolescence on the design of the satchel in Figure 4.
           it can be viewed as a retro design as it is very similar to the original design of the
           1950s/60s and nostalgia for this period is part of the fashionable appeal but the
           use of bright colours is contemporary;
           the satchel is produced from traditional, durable materials/leather and so little materials
           obsolescence in normal use;                                                                   [3]


3.   (a)   Award [1] for stating the percentile which would be used to decide an appropriate
           height for the tallest shelf in a supermarket.
           5th (adult);
           50th percentile (adult);                                                                  [1max]

     (b)   Award [1] for each distinct correct point in an explanation of why there is no
           specific anthropometric data available for the “average” person.
           designing for the average person is a misnomer/misleading/there is no such thing
           as designing for the average person;
           someone may be average for one body dimension but not average for
           other dimensions;
           if a designer wants to use a specific average dimension for a body part they need to use
           median/mode/choice of percentile is dependent on design context;                              [3]

4.   (a)   (i)     Award [1] for stating why the manufacturer emphasizes the packed size of
                   the Biolite stove.
                   the target market is hikers/expedition participants so knowing it will pack into a
                   bag/backpack is important to them/for carrying purposes;
                   portable design/easily fits into a bag;                                            [1 max]

           (ii)    Award [1] for one limitation of the Biolite stove for users who undertake
                   expeditions to locations all over the world and [1] for a brief explanation.
                   they need a supply of biomass material in the vicinity of the camp location;
                   so the stove is not suitable for expeditions to desert/arid areas/arctic regions/wet
                   conditions/protected areas etc;                                                        [2]

           (iii)   Award [1] for one reason why users may decide to carry wood pellets for
                   the stove even though they will be camping in wooded areas and [1] for a
                   brief explanation. [2 max].
                   convenience/flexibility;
                   faster/easier to set up/use;

                   they may make camp at night;
                   and do not want to hunt around in the dark for fuel;

                   they may need to make an emergency camp;
                   where suitable vegetation for the stove is limited/unavailable;

                   wet weather conditions;
                   wood needs to be dry to burn effectively;                                          [2 max]

     (b)   (i)     Award [1] for stating one disadvantage of the Biolite stove in relation to
                   green design. [1 max].
                   burning wood/vegetation causes chemical pollution;

                   users may damage plants/vegetation when collecting fuel;
                   mixed materials/not easy to disassemble/does not facilitate repair;
                   potentially unsafe product;                                                        [1 max]

           (ii)    Award [1] for each distinct correct point in an evaluation of the Biolite stove
                   in relation to ease-of-maintenance.
                   burning wood will produce ash;
                   and carbon deposits inside the stove unit;
                   the stove will need to be cleaned regularly to maintain efficiency/operation;

                   designed with components that can be disassembled;
                   as charging unit/burner needs to be detachable;
                   to facilitate maintenance/cleaning/repair;                                         [3 max]

(c)   (i)    Award [1] for one potential safety issue when using the Biolite stove for
             cooking and charging an electronic device at the same time and [1] for a
             brief explanation. [2 max].
             plugging in a device while food/water is being heated could cause a
             spillage;
             and the user get burnt/scalded;

             when plugging in the device the user may be tempted to hold the stove with
             one hand while plugging in with the other;
             and burn the hand on the stove;

             Item being charged may become damaged if left too close to the stove;
             or the charging lead could be damaged by heat/be a trip hazard;

             accidental spillage due to unstable surface/tripping;
             could burn/injure the user;                                                     [2 max]

      (ii)   Award [1] for each distinct point in a discussion of how the strategies of
             user trial, performance test and field trial could have contributed to the
             development of the Biolite stove. Award [3 max] per strategy.
             user trial:
             ease-of-use/method(s) of use/ergonomics;
             identify any perceived safety issues for different users;
             assess ease-of-maintenance;
             assess the effect of the weight of the product when carried in a rucksack with other
             typical expedition gear;
             feedback informs designers on improvements needed; [3 max]

             performance testing:
             test a prototype to evaluate the effectiveness of the stove with different
             types of biomass materials;
             test for efficiency levels relating to heat/electricity;
             test for reliability;
             test for safety;
             testing durability of materials/components used to manufacture the stove;
             [3 max]

             field trial:
             evaluate performance in real environmental/climatic conditions;
             combine with user trial/user research to evaluate performance during an
             actual expedition/over a typical expedition timescale;
             evaluate data gathered from lab tests/performance tests in different expedition
             conditions;                                                                     [9 max]

5.   (a)   (i)     Award [1] for stating the most likely manufacturing technique used to
                   assemble the Bagalight.
                   adhesives;                                                                               [1]

           (ii)    Award [1] for stating why the Bagalight is only produced in one colour and
                   [1] for a brief explanation.
                   brown paper bags are a traditional form of packaging and have been used
                   for many years;
                   the novel use of brown paper bag reinforces the design concept along with
                   green design/recycling;

                   using a standard colour only makes it more cost effective to produce;
                   and potentially cheaper for consumers;                                             [2 max]

           (iii)   Award [1] for stating how the designer will have considered stability in the
                   design of the Bagalight and [1] for a brief explanation.
                   as it is mainly made from paper it is a very light structure which could easily
                   topple over/be blown over;
                   but the bulb holder in the base will add weight to increase stability of the lightweight
                   structure/stop it from toppling over;                                                    [2]

     (b)   (i)     Award [1] for stating one limitation of the Bagalight in relation to
                   ease-of-maintenance.
                   dust/insects will collect inside the bag;

                   paper is difficult to keep clean/cannot be cleaned with water;

                   if the paper bag/handle is squashed/torn it cannot be smoothed out/repaired again;
                                                                                                 [1 max]

           (ii)    Award [1] for each distinct correct point in a suggestion of one reason for
                   using the shape of a traditional lamp as a surface pattern for the Bagalight.
                   using a well-known lamp shape on one side of the bag reinforces the
                   function of the bag;
                   especially when the lamp is not switched on and its function is not obvious;
                   and it enhances the aesthetic appeal when it is switched on providing a contrast of
                   tones/the lamp shape is lit up;                                                          [3]

     (c)   (i)     Award [1] for one limitation of using the Bagalight as a main source of light
                   and [1] for a brief explanation.
                   the maximum wattage of the bulb which can be used is 15 W so the lamp
                   will only produce a low level of light;
                   meaning that it is not useful as a main source of light/is only suitable for ambient

                   in Australia.
                   field trial;                                                                          [1]

           (ii)    Award [1] for one physiological ergonomic consideration which contributed
                   to the idea for the Water Craft and [1] for a brief explanation.
                   fatigue/body tolerance/lifting strength;
                   difficult to rescue people from the water single-handed;                              [2]

           (iii)   Award [1] for each distinct correct point in a description of the structure and
                   bonding of a thermoplastic.
                   long/linear chain molecules;
                   with weak secondary bonds between the chains;                                         [2]

     (b)   (i)     Award [1] for stating the ideas generation technique which was the impetus
                   for the design of the Water Craft and [1] for a brief explanation.
                   constructive discontent;
                   Kemp was dissatisfied with the performance of existing rescue craft;              [1 max]

           (ii)    Award [1] for each distinct correct point in an explanation of the reason for
                   using scale models as part of the design development process for the
                   Water Craft.
                   a scale model explores the proposed design in relation to shape/form/proportions;
                   the model can easily be manipulated at the early stage of design development to refine
                   ideas;
                   it also allows others to contribute to the process even if they do not have technical
                   expertise/enhance communication;

                   performance testing;
                   can be used to determine effective movement through water;
                   to develop optimal shape;                                                         [3 max]

             development and [1] for a brief explanation.
             there is an existing market for life-saving aids in open water/there are
             existing products which can be used;
             the Water Craft is aimed at development of this market/the Water Craft is aimed at
             developing the market for life-savers working on their own;                          [2]

             worked as a lone inventor to prototype stage;
             used design/creative ability to persevere/persist with production of models/prototypes;
             [3 max]

             innovator:
             wants to create an innovation by making it successful in the marketplace;
