Mark allocation

Candidates are required to answer all questions in one Option. Total 65 marks.

General

A markscheme often has more specific points worthy of a mark than the total allows. This is intentional.
Do not award more than the maximum marks allowed for that part of a question.

When deciding upon alternative answers by candidates to those given in the markscheme, consider the
following points:

     •     Each statement worth one point has a separate line and the end is signified by means of
           a semi-colon (;).

     •     An alternative answer or wording is indicated in the markscheme by a “/”; either wording can
           be accepted.

     •     Words in ( … ) in the markscheme are not necessary to gain the mark.

     •     If the candidate’s answer has the same meaning or can be clearly interpreted as being the
           same as that in the markscheme then award the mark.

     •     Mark positively. Give candidates credit for what they have achieved and for what they have
           got correct, rather than penalizing them for what they have not achieved or what they have
           got wrong.

     •     Remember that many candidates are writing in a second language; be forgiving of
           minor linguistic slips. In this subject effective communication is more important than
           grammatical accuracy.

     •     Occasionally, a part of a question may require a calculation whose answer is required for
           subsequent parts. If an error is made in the first part then it should be penalized. However,
           if the incorrect answer is used correctly in subsequent parts then follow through marks
           should be awarded. Indicate this with “FT”.



General guidance

  Issue            Guidance
  Answering        • In the case of an “identify” question read all answers and mark positively up to the
  more than          maximum marks. Disregard incorrect answers.
  the quantity     • In the case of a “describe” question, which asks for a certain number of facts
  of                 eg “describe two kinds”, mark the first two correct answers. This could include two
  responses          descriptions, one description and one identification, or two identifications.
  prescribed       • In the case of an “explain” question, which asks for a specified number of
  in the             explanations eg “explain two reasons …”, mark the first two correct answers.
  questions          This could include two full explanations, one explanation, one partial explanation etc.

Option A — Databases

1.   (a)   Award up to [2 max].

           Data (the booking code) are unorganized/unstructured/unprocessed terms;
           Whereas information (hotel’s email) is organized/structured/processed data;

           OR

           Data lacks meaning e.g. on their own data elements, Code, name, room;
           Whereas information is interpreted data (the code interpreted by the system) and
           has meaning (eg email provides meaningful information to the tourist about the
           use of the Code);                                                              [2]

     (b)   Award up to [2 max].
           Accept answers that relate to the scenario but address the following points.

            The minimal step of operation/update to be performed on a database;
            That guarantees consistency/integrity of the database;
            And recovery upon failure;

           For example:
           Minimal set of actions that complete/make the booking;
           So that database is accurate/consistent/has integrity;
           So that database is updated to prevent others booking room;
           So that recovery can be run on failure;                                          [2]

     (c)   Award up to [3 max].
           Accept answers that relate to the scenario but address the following points.

            Modifications on data are made persistent in the database only if the transaction
             terminates;
            A roll-back operation is performed if a failure occurs prior to termination of the
             transaction;
            And this keeps the database in the original consistent status;

           For example:
           Transactions conform to rules before update to database;
           Transactions must complete fully to make the changes permanent/persistent;
           Allows roll-back operation in case of failure;
           To ensure database is consistent while performing transactions;            [3]

     (d)   Award up to [2 max].
           An example must be seen for the second mark to be awarded.
           (It means concurrent control;)
           It says/defines/specifies how and when the changes of a process are visible to
           concurrent operations;
           For example, using locks on data to prevent concurrent writing that would lead to
           inconsistency as in the case of two people booking the same room;             [2]

(e)   Award up to [6 max].
      Award [2] for general technical explanation of benefits of data sharing and [2] for
      each of at least two plausible examples in the given setting (user, hotel, service
      provider). The general explanation points may come within the examples.

      General explanation (“What it is”)
      Data sharing/replication: all/part of one/several source databases are
      shared/replicated according to the needs of different user groups;
      The information needed by the group is made ‘closer’ to the user;
      Hence, less focus on transmission/traffic (expensive or slow or not available or
      not convenient), but requires more storage space (but storage is cheap);

      Tourist
      Can quickly/efficiently access;
      A wide choice of hotels/offers/prices;

      Best Fare
      Can efficiently display offers on a wide selection of hotels;
      Can develop/extend existing software when new hotels are created;
      Can develop/re-use the same application without major modifications;

      Hotel
      The hotel needs to rely on new applications and increasing speed is an issue
      (cost/maintenance);
      Allowing the sharing of information in the source database gives more visibility to
      the hotel, making it more competitive;
      The hotel can continue to locally operate only on part of the data in the source
      database, using less advanced software;
      Allows hotel to change prices and offers in real-time;                           [6]

     (b)   Award up to [2 max].
           It is a data structure that stores metadata;
           eg meaning of data/relations among data/labelling and tags such as
           origin/use/format;

           OR

           Data Dictionary states the meaning of fields in a data table;
           Data Dictionary states why the relationships between tables exists;
           Data Dictionary stores information about the meaning of data;                      [2]

           External hospital staff
           Have read-only access to medicine data;
           To compare with their own stock (in case of emergencies);

           Useful for different users that may retain more or less valuable the information
           depending on their use/need;
           Examples may include:
           needs from the surgeons on site / needs from the administration / needs for
           emergencies / needs for lending to nearby hospitals.                             [6]

4.   (a)   Award [3 max] as follows.
           Award [2] for explanation and [1] for an example.

           Dimensions specify the features according to which the data shall be stored;
           One of the dimensions is time;
           Another dimension is identified eg Type (commercial, individual, trust…),
           Location (Region1, Region2,…);
           The basic unit of organization is a 3-dimensional cube, that can be linked
           together to add more dimensions;                                               [3]

     (b)   Award up to [3 max].
           The tax data warehouse has comprehensive taxpayer information;
           eg business type, business nature, income, geographic location, associations
           with other taxpayers, property details;
           And taxpayers may be profiled to detect cases of tax fraud or tax non-
           compliance;

           The data in a data warehouse may be enriched with data from external sources
           (census, credit bureau);
           And data mining techniques/specific queries may assist in analysing past
           behaviours and future trends/expectations;
           Possibly the analysis may be drilled down along some dimensions, eg the
           region/location helping the decision-making process;                        [3]

     (c)   Award up to [3 max] as follows.
           Award [2] for a general description and [1] for an example.
           Statistical techniques are used to detect outlying data;
           That does not fit the assumed model;

           Example:
           Can be used to predict future trends;
           Can be used to infer the parameters where the gap with the model is wider;
           And identify/detect events or subset of data;                                  [3]

     (d)   Award up to [3 max].
           No, because;
           A database management system (in the majority of their models) is oriented to
           support transactions;
           Whereas a data warehouse is oriented to support analysis of subject-oriented
           historical collections of data;
           The temporal dimension is absent in data in a database management system; [3]

(e)   (i)    Award up to [2 max].
             Data originate from different external sources and have different formats;
             And need to be transformed/standardized into a common format;
             eg a field “Gender” may have a different number of possible values in
             different sources or different range.                                      [2]

      (ii)   Award up to [6 max].
             Award [3] for each of the two required applications.

             For data migration (from one database to another):
                  Data are extracted from different sources/locations;
                  Transformed to make it conform with the target destination;
                  And loaded in the new system;
                  The script that implements the ELT process can introduce links
                  among data, and this is what makes them useful;
                  eg migration of mail applications (managing attachments, problem of
                  formats, links to attached files, tags, filters, date);
                  eg conversion of one database to another one of different type;

             To consolidate historical data (in a data warehouse):
                  A data warehouse can be set to collect historical data from several
                  diverse smaller databases with ETL;
                  Not all data extracted are necessary for the archive;
                  Data can be manipulated/filtered/interpreted thinking of their long-
                  term uses in the data warehouse;
                  The archive can be cleaned up to remove duplicates/corrupt
                  information after Transformation;
                  Eventually the archive is separated from the transactional component
                  of the system;
                  This architecture is simpler to maintain eg archiving old dispatched
                  orders for which the return by date has passed by more than one
                  year;

             To create data marts:
                  A data mart can be defined by means of ETL;
                  A data mart is a “slice” of a data warehouse (with a role comparable
                  to a view in database);
                  It can be created at lower costs for the needs of a specific group of
                  users in a big organization;
                  eg the marketing department for its business intelligence activities; [6]

Option B — Modelling and simulation

5.   (a)   Award up to [4 max].
           Group the five samples into “number in sample” and “lengths in sample”;
           Record the total number divided by the number of samples as the representative
           total for that year;
           Lengths added and divided by total number as the average length;
           Store as data for that year;                                                 [4]

     (b)   Award up to [2 max].
           Date;
           The number of fish in the lake (accept “Amount of Fish”);
           (Average) length of fish in the lake;                                            [2]

     (c)   Award [1] for using sample data, [1] for correct calculation and [1] for correct
           decision up to [3 max].
           For example:
           In a spreadsheet, date, estimated number of fish, estimated average length
           would be in columns A – C, one row per year;
           Column D could hold % decrease since 5 years (D6 = 100*(B6 – B1)/B1);
           No license if D6<–5;
           No license if C6<=20;                                                            [3]

     (d)   Award up to [6 max].
           Award [2] for testing the effectiveness of the rules, [2] for how changes could be
           made if needed.
                By looking at the trend in number of fish;
                Change % up or down if needed;
                And size should increase or decrease;
                Making tolerance bigger or smaller if need be;
           Award [2] for testing the effectiveness of data collection.
                By sampling more often and comparing for similar yearly results;
                By sampling in different places and comparing;
                If results are not very different, improve sampling method;                [6]
                                                 – 12 –             M15/4/COMSC/HP2/ENG/TZ0/XX/M


6.   (a)   Award [1] for two reasonable factors, up to [2 max].
           For example:
           Temperature, precipitation, hours of sunshine, wind speed, wind direction,
           humidity.                                                                            [2]

     (b)   Award up to [3 max].
           For example:
           Each factor plotted separately;
           For one year;
           In a bar chart or line graph;
           Which would show the time trend;
           Accept answers that work on analysing differences.                             [3]

     (c)   Award up to [4 max]. Accept any reasonable method of analysing the model
           over time.
           For example:
           Displacement measurement would mean keeping measurements over more
           years;
           Fitting a mathematical model to the shape;
           And comparing for change in model;
           Could be done by “sliding” (translating) the shape or calculating differences
           between months;                                                               [4]

     (d)   Award [2] for advantages, [2] for disadvantages and [2] for consistent
           conclusion, up to [6 marks max].

           For example:
           The advantages are that some external factors (such as carbon emissions) could
           be examined and possibly rectified;

           Knowing in advance that a climate is changing makes it possible to plan for
           agricultural changes such as crop replacements etc;

           Can repeat the simulation many times/with altered variables;
           Can simulate with historic data to validate model;

           A disadvantage is that the predictions may not be correct as other unknown
           factors are not included;
           Cyclic pattern is difficult to include;
           Problem is too complex to simulate;

           Overall, if it is possible to know about impending changes, as long as these are
           constantly monitored and updated;
           The advantages outweigh the disadvantages since disasters may be
prevented; [6]

7.   (a)   Award [1] for the fact that the source comes from (binary) data, [1] for changing
           the format to image.
           For example:
           Visualization is the transfer of (binary) data in memory;
           To an image (visual representation of pixels);                                  [2]
           Note: Do not award marks for answers that are not relevant to Computer Science.

     (b)   Award [1] for representation of image in colour, [2] for explaining the effect of
           light on an object, [2] for transformation by rendering.

           All images are represented in memory pixel by pixel or via vector methods;
           With associated colour;
           A 3D object has varying shades of colour according to the source of light;
           Direction of view, reflection;
           (Mathematical equations based on angle of view etc;)
           Transform each pixel into the appropriate shade of colour;
           Hence the object (image) is rendered to give impression of 3D;                      [5]

     (c)   Since the game is online there is no need for the program to be on the computer.
           Award up to [2] for hardware and [2] for software, limited to a total of [3 max].

           Software:
           Operating system needs to be able to handle fast input/output;
           Suitable application programs (Direct X) to handle multimedia;

           Hardware:
           Fast video card;
           Enough hard disk to hold data;
           Large RAM;
           Efficient sound card;
           GPU;                                                                         [3]
           Note: Answers addressing joysticks/special goggles for augmented reality etc.
           should not get marks as they play no role here.

     (d)   Award [2] for advantages, [2] for disadvantages and [1] for a conclusion, up to
           [5 marks max].
           For example:
                Fun / Break from routine activity / Relax;
                Possible to meet new friends online;
                In some cases develops strategy skills;

                 Addictive, things that need to be done can get ignored;
                 Isolation from human contact into an unreal world;
                 Start confusing reality with virtual world;

                 As long as addiction is avoided/time spent restricted, participating is
                 harmless and enjoyable/a part of modern life which will not change;           [5]

           These are multiplied by weights – predetermined values;
           And sent to each of the output nodes;
           (Combining to form a solution;)
           More nodes allows a greater number of possibilities;                           [3]

     (b)   Award marks [2] for similarities, and [2] for differences up to [4 max].
           Both are created using a training set;
           And adjusted to meet a predetermined fitness function;

           In OCR, most input will resemble the characters defined in the fitness function;
           Handwriting excepted;
           In speech recognition it is important that the input resembles what was input
           during the training;
           Which may not be the case as voices have more variation than text;               [4]

     (c)   Award up to [2 max].
           Speech synthesis is ‘only’ text-to-speech;
           Natural language generation involves semantics;
           (eg generating answers from databases in response to queries.)                      [2]

     (d)   Award up to [4 max].
           Heuristics uses probabilities and supervised learning sets;
           Limits the learning to the breadth of the learning sets;

           Cognitive approach uses unsupervised learning;
           With an attempt to create the appropriate syntax and semantics;
           In the way a child learns language;                                                 [4]

     (e)   Award [2] for inputs, [1] for setting an acceptable value, [1] for setting priorities,
           [2] for evolving new solutions from old, [1] for finishing when an acceptable level
           reached, up to [7 max].

           The inputs would need to be a set of constraints;
           For example, number of hours for each teacher;
           Number of classes – students in class etc;
           Put priority on those that must be met;
           To create a % corresponding to success;
           Create random solutions;
           Evolve new solutions from first set, involving methods such as mutation or

      (c)   Award up to [2 max].
            The keyword in a meta-tag might have different meanings;
            eg “star”;
            So a webpage about astronomy might be listed by a search engine when the
            search query/user was searching for a famous actor;
            Even though the page was indexed correctly;                              [2]

            Operations are hidden from the company which could lead to doubts
            No company loyalty so not the same level of dedication and care
            The cloud operators are professionals in this area – this is what they do
            The cloud operators are likely to have the most up-to-date systems

            Company storage:
            Operations are not hidden from the company
            Due to company loyalty a (potential) better level of dedication and care
            It is a small company so IT department will be small / not of the highest expertise
            No need to continue updating security systems

            Example conclusion: Cloud storage has been around long enough to have
            demonstrated that it is a very secure method of storing your data, so the security
            concerns are unfounded and the cost savings make it a sensible decision.

            OR

            The company has data that is extremely sensitive, eg a bank, therefore all
            security must be kept in house.                                                  [6]

                   The arrows show the direction of the linkage;                              [2]

            (ii)   Award up to [2 max].
                   Because by following the links;
                   It is not possible to go to Page A (or Page F) from any of the others;     [2]

            This contains pages which only have inlinks;
            Such as reference pages;                                                          [4]

      (c)   Award marks as follows, up to [4 max].
            Award [1] for the idea of working through a page looking for page links.
            Award [1] for jumping to that page if found.
            Award [1] for the idea of returning to the previous page (recursively) if it comes to
            a dead end.
            Award [1] for repeating this process for an extended period of time.

            Example:
            1: return the (current) web page;
            2: the algorithm works its way down the page looking for a URL (link to another
            page);
            3: if it finds it, it jumps to that page and repeats steps 1 and 2;
            4: if it does not, it returns the previous URL and continues (recursively) from
            where it left off;                                                              [4]

13.   Award up to [2 max].
      Award [1] for showing that they understand what an ontology is.
      Award [1] for giving an example showing the conflict.
      Award [1] for showing how the conflict is resolved by the ontology.
      Award [1] for indicating that the use of standard tags will enable data to be more easily
      processed.

      An ontology is a standardized form of tagging;
      If two different tags for the same file name are used (eg Publisher, Publishing House);
      The alternatives will be mapped onto one standard tag (eg Publisher);
      If all book publishers used the same tags, the book seller would be able to import data
      without problems;                                                                     [2]


14.   Award up to [6 max].
      Award [3 max] for references to technology, and [2] for each ethical issue, up to a
      maximum of two issues.

      Each employee would have a badge (or similar) that would contain a sensor or
      RFID tag;
        That would identify them;
        And register their position;
        These would wirelessly connect to a central server that tracks their movements;

         Examples of ethical issues include:
         Employers could argue that as employees are being paid for all of the time that they
         are at work;
         Then they (the employers) have the right to establish exactly where they are in
         relation to where they should be;
         Employees could point to privacy issues;
         And that any relationships formed at work with colleagues should not be recorded;
         Note: To gain [2] for an ethical issue, the issue must be both specifically identified
         and relevant.                                                                         [6]

            Static means that the variable is declared once only;
            Static variable is a class variable not re-declared in each object;
            And not each time an object is created;
            The variable represents the number of times a Loan object is created;

            The books are stored in separate arrays;
            In separate objects;
            These can only be searched using a linear search;
            As no index is available;
            Also, parts of each array will be empty;
            So this would be slow/inefficient;                                            [4]

                   The student ID stored also;
                   To locate the student ID the binary tree would be searched;
                   Using the bookID;

            Award [1] for an advantage and [1] for an elaboration, [1] for a disadvantage and
            [1] for an elaboration.

            Advantage:
            There will be less wasted memory;
            As only the required number of locations will be used;

            Disadvantage:
            It will be slower to locate a specific student;
            As a linear search will be needed compared to direct access with the array;   [4]
