Mark allocation

Section A: Candidates are required to answer all questions. Total 25 marks.
Section B: Candidates are required to answer all questions. Total 75 marks.
           Maximum total = 100 marks.

General

A markscheme often has more specific points worthy of a mark than the total allows. This is intentional.
Do not award more than the maximum marks allowed for that part of a question.

When deciding upon alternative answers by candidates to those given in the markscheme, consider the
following points:

          Each statement worth one point has a separate line and the end is signified by means of
           a semi-colon (;).

          An alternative answer or wording is indicated in the markscheme by a “/”; either wording can
           be accepted.

          Words in ( … ) in the markscheme are not necessary to gain the mark.

          If the candidate’s answer has the same meaning or can be clearly interpreted as being the
           same as that in the markscheme then award the mark.

          Mark positively. Give candidates credit for what they have achieved and for what they have
           got correct, rather than penalizing them for what they have not achieved or what they have
           got wrong.

          Remember that many candidates are writing in a second language; be forgiving of
           minor linguistic slips. In this subject effective communication is more important than
           grammatical accuracy.

          Occasionally, a part of a question may require a calculation whose answer is required for
           subsequent parts. If an error is made in the first part then it should be penalized. However,
           if the incorrect answer is used correctly in subsequent parts then follow through marks
           should be awarded. Indicate this with “FT”.


General guidance

  Issue            Guidance
  Answering        • In the case of an “identify” question read all answers and mark positively up to the
  more than          maximum marks. Disregard incorrect answers.
  the quantity     • In the case of a “describe” question, which asks for a certain number of facts
  of                 eg “describe two kinds”, mark the first two correct answers. This could include two
  responses          descriptions, one description and one identification, or two identifications.
  prescribed       • In the case of an “explain” question, which asks for a specified number of
  in the             explanations eg “explain two reasons …”, mark the first two correct answers.
  questions          This could include two full explanations, one explanation, one partial explanation etc.

            landed);
            Head pointer points to the first in the list;

            HOURS = 0
            MINUTES = CTIME
            WHILE MINUTES>59

                 HOURS = CTIME div 60

(c)   Award marks as follows, up to [4 marks max].
      Award [1 mark] for a diagram and explanation showing access to each plane via
      pointers;
      Award [1 mark] for comparison of current time with time arrived;
      Award [1 mark] for correct change of pointer from plane deleted;
      Award [1 mark] for correct change of pointer to next plane;

      Note: The plane to be deleted could be at the beginning of the list OR at the end
      of the list OR in the middle of the list; award third and fourth mark (change of
      pointers) depending on the position of the node shown in the candidates’
      diagram/explanation.

      For example:
      PLANES accessed sequentially via pointers;
      PLANE.ARRIVED checked against current time;
        if > 30 minutes;
            if pointer is head pointer;
                move head pointer to point to next PLANE;
            else if plane is last in list previous pointer points to NULL;

            pointer of deleted plane null;

(d)   Award up to [5 marks max].
      A queue would hold the elements in order of arrival;
      And enqueue correctly to the end as required;

      Dequeue would take planes from the top of the screen;
      Which is not wanted as they arrive at different times;

      Elements in a linked list could be removed from any position in the list;
      Hence a linked list is better;

      Searching for ID to amend will be equivalent;                                         [5]

12.   (a)   Sensors will be used to detect the approach of a vehicle from the minor road;
            Likely to be touch/weight sensor embedded in the road;
            Sensor input is converted from analog to digital;
            To be processed and;
            Signal sent to switch traffic lights;                                                   [4]

      (b)   Award up to [3 marks max].
            Continual feedback from sensor to processor;
            A calculation based on number of vehicles/speed/etc or time taken for a vehicle
            to pass;
            (Timer) resets if another vehicle is detected;
            Once no input for a certain time traffic lights changed back;                           [3]

      (c)   Award [2 marks] for advantages, [2 marks] for disadvantages and [1 mark] for
            weighing up.

            Disadvantages:
            Central computer would have to cope with inputs from many places;
            With differing priorities which could take time;
            Connection failure possible from a particular point;
            Computer failure puts all lights in the area out;
            Cost of communication system/central control system;

            Advantages:
            More control over traffic flow at these points;
            Lights can be adapted from distance to avoid traffic blocks;
            Any problem appearing at one point is known immediately and can be dealt with;
            Cheaper as no need for communication software/hardware/control centre;
            Can react/change rules to changing levels of traffic flow;

            Overall, it would be better to ... (appropriate conclusion);                            [5]

      (d)   Award [1 mark] for an advantage outlined, [1 mark] for a disadvantage outlined
            and [1 mark] for discussing.

            For example:
            Controlling the movement of vehicles and identifying people who speed should
            help to reduce accidents (as motorists know that they will be caught if driving
            dangerously);
            This could also save lives;

            Individual displacement is tracked;
            Which can be seen as an infringement on personal liberty/a breach of privacy;
            In some cases the information could be used unjustly against the individual (eg in
            times of political unrest);

            It comes down to physical safety on the road against privacy/personal liberty;          [3]

13.   (a)   Because items/moves are needed in reverse order;
            To the order input;

            OR

            Because it is a LIFO (Last In First Out) data structure;
            The items/moves pushed/placed onto the stack;
            Will be popped off/taken from it in reverse order (to the order input);                   [2]

      (b)   Award marks as follows, up to [5 marks max].
            Award [1 mark] for checking for empty.
            Award [1 mark] for popping STEP and TURN from stack.
            Award [1 mark] for an output (STEP).
            Award [1 mark] for correct if statement (checking popped TURN).
            Award [1 mark] for an output (TURN).

            For example:
            (let STK be the stack)
              while NOT STK.isEmpty() do
                 STEP = STK.pop()
                 output "Take " + STEP + " steps"
                 TURN = STK.pop()
                 if TURN = 0 then
                    output "Turn left"
                 else
                    output "Turn right"
                 end if
              end while                                                                               [5]
