•   Many endemic species (found only in this location) eg snails and fish.
•   70 000 people living around and on the lake.
•   The predominant native people are the Intha with minority groups (eg Pa-O, Shan, Bamar) within the
    local population.

•   Most people living here are self-sufficient farmers and fishermen.
•   Houses are built of wood and bamboo on stilts in the lake.
•   Inle carp (a species of fish) caught in the lake are a staple food.
•   Rice is also grown on the surrounding hillsides.
•   Lotus plants, growing in the lake provide fibres for weaving a unique fabric used in the clothing of
    Buddhist monks.
•   Using weed taken from the lake bottom, floating gardens are made and anchored with bamboo poles.
•   Fruits and vegetables eg tomatoes and cauliflowers are grown on these floating gardens.
•   Since the gardens rise and fall they are not affected by flooding.
•   The gardens are rich in nutrients from the lake.
•   Over time, sediment from the gardens builds up and fills the lake, creating land.

                             Figure 5: Environmental pressures at Inle Lake

•   Floating gardens started in the 1960s.
•   Since then, the lake area has decreased by one third.
•   Deforestation of the surrounding hills leads to increased levels of sediment and nutrients in the lake.
•   Nutrients from the gardens lead to increased nitrogen and phosphate levels in the lake system.
•   Increased nutrients in the lake lead to the impacts of eutrophication.
•   These impacts include hypoxic water (ie reduced oxygen levels in the water).
•   Water hyacinth, a non-native floating plant, has been introduced and grows very fast.
•   Grass carp, a non-native species of fish, has been found in the lake and has been known to feed on
    water hyacinth.
•   A coal mine and power plant nearby discharge toxic waste into the lake.
•   In drought years, drinking water has to be brought in from elsewhere as the lake is too polluted.
•   Floating garden farmers use fertiliser and pesticides that enter the lake waters.
•   The WWF lists the biodiversity of Inle Lake as vulnerable.

                                       Figure 6: Tourism at Inle Lake

In recent years, political changes have led to more tourists visiting Myanmar (Burma).

                                                         2011   2012
                                  Tourists at Inle Lake 60 000 120 000


• Local young people who work in the tourism industry have the opportunity to learn new skills eg other
  languages, catering and construction.
• Average wage in Myanmar (Burma) is US$2 a day. A worker on construction sites of new hotels can
  earn US$4 a day so doubling the family income and paying for schooling for children.
• Tourism leads to new markets eg selling artefacts to tourists.

But…

•   The growth of tourism has meant that local farmers have lost their land to new hotel developments.
•   There are fewer fish to catch and less rain for crops than in previous years.
•   Diesel engines of boats taking tourists and locals around the lake lead to noise and oil pollution.
•   A lot of the money does not benefit the local people but leaves the region.
•   The growth of tourism is in danger of destroying the beauty of the area that tourists come to see.
