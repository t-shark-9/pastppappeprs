Subject Details: Biology SL Paper 2 Markscheme
Mark Allocation

Candidates are required to answer ALL questions in Section A [30 marks] and ONE question in
Section B [20 marks]. Maximum total = [50 marks].

1.   A markscheme often has more marking points than the total allows. This is intentional.

2.   Each marking point has a separate line and the end is shown by means of a semicolon (;).

3.   An alternative answer or wording is indicated in the markscheme by a slash (/). Either wording can
     be accepted.

4.   Words in brackets ( ) in the markscheme are not necessary to gain the mark.

5.   Words that are underlined are essential for the mark.

6.   The order of marking points does not have to be as in the markscheme, unless stated otherwise.

Extended response questions - quality of construction

        Extended response questions for SL P2 carry a mark total of [20]. Of these marks, [18] are
         awarded for content and [2] for the quality of construction of the answer.

      Two aspects are considered:
           expression of relevant ideas with clarity
           structure of the answers.

      [1] quality mark is to be awarded when the candidate satisfies EACH of the following criteria.
         Thus [2] quality marks are awarded when a candidate satisfies BOTH criteria.

     Clarity of expression:
        The candidate has made a serious and full attempt to answer all parts of the question and the
        answers are expressed clearly enough to be understood with little or no re-reading.

     Structure of answer:
        The candidate has linked relevant ideas to form a logical sequence within at least two parts
        of the same question (eg within part a and within part b, or within part a and within part c
        etc. but not between part a and part b or between part a and part c etc.).

      It is important to judge this on the overall answer, taking into account the answers to all parts
         of the question. Although, the part with the largest number of marks is likely to provide the
         most evidence.

        Candidates that score very highly on the content marks need not necessarily automatically
         gain [2] marks for the quality of construction (and vice versa).

     (b)   a. in Cayo and/or Toledo the high incidence seems to be associated with rivers;
           b. however, along one river in Toledo there is no high incidence;
           c. in Belize District there is low incidence along the river / high incidence away
              from the river;
           d. Orange Walk/ Stan Creek there is no clear association;
           e. (consequently) association of rivers with high incidence of malaria is
              inconclusive OWTTE;                                                                  [2 max]

     (c)   a. both are stable from 1989 to 1992;
           b. both see upward spike in 1992
           c. Corozal reaches its peak (one year) earlier / vice versa;
           d. Toledo rises after 1998 but Corozal continues to decline / Corozal at the end
              decreases almost to 0, while Toledo still have incidence at the end of the
              decade;
           e. Toledo has a higher incidence (throughout the decade) / vice versa;
           f. Toledo changes more rapidly than Corozal / vice versa;                               [3 max]

     (d)   (i)    insecticides used to kill mosquitoes / more anti malarial drugs / drought/less
                  water for mosquito breeding / increased drainage / improved education /
                  more mosquito nets / other reasonable change in conditions                           [1]
                  Do not accept vaccines as they do not exist.

           (ii)   drier climate/less rainfall / more predators / vegetation/ecology not
                  favourable to mosquitoes / higher rainfall so faster flowing rivers/more
                  educated inhabitants so more aware of dangers                                        [1]

     (e)   lowland broadleaf forest and broadleaf hill forests (both required)                         [1]

     (f)   Toledo because it has the highest incidence of malaria in map/graph (and
           farmland has highest correlation to incidence of malaria in the table)                      [1]

     (g)   a. if farming provides habitat for mosquitoes, then reducing it could reduce
              malaria / OWTTE;
           b. natural habitats provide predators, but farmland does not;
           c. changing native vegetation is not practical since plants are adapted to their
              environment/organisms have specific adaptations to their environments;
           d. might work to change broadleaf forest into mixed hill forest as much of
              broadleaf forest has high incidence of malaria and no part of mixed hill forest
              has high incidence of malaria / OWTTE;
           e. loss of habitat/loss of biodiversity results in less stable environment;
           f. the value of maintaining natural habitat must be balanced with the value of
              reduced malaria;
           g. farmland feeds the population, so cannot be replaced / OWTTE                         [4 max]

           Do not accept the description of blood flow without a clear action.
           Do not accept general statements such as systole=heart contraction and
           diastole = heart relaxation.
           [4 max] if suggests that left and right sides are contracting at different times or
           simultaneous contraction not indicated.

     (c)   a. nerve impulse reaches the end of the presynaptic neuron;
           b. (depolarization causes) calcium channels in membrane (to) open;
           c. calcium diffuses into the presynaptic neuron;
           d. vesicles of/containing neurotransmitter move to and fuse with presynaptic
              membrane;
           e. (neurotransmitter) released (by exocytosis) into synaptic space/cleft;
           f. (neurotransmitter) diffuses across the space/synapse;
           g. (neurotransmitter) attaches to receptors on postsynaptic neuron;
           h. receptors cause ion channels to open and sodium diffuses into the
              postsynaptic neuron;
           i. the postsynaptic neuron membrane is depolarized;
           j. (depolarization) causes a new action potential;
           k. (neurotransmitter) on postsynaptic membrane is broken down;
           l. (neurotransmitter) is reabsorbed into the presynaptic neuron;                          [7 max]
