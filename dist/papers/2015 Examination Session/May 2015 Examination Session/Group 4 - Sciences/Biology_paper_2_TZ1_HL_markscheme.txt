Subject Details: Biology HL Paper 2 Markscheme

Mark Allocation

Candidates are required to answer ALL questions in Section A [32 marks] and TWO questions in
Section B [2  20 marks]. Maximum total = [72 marks]

1.   A markscheme often has more marking points than the total allows. This is intentional.

2.   Each marking point has a separate line and the end is shown by means of a semicolon (;).

3.   An alternative answer or wording is indicated in the markscheme by a slash (/). Either wording can
     be accepted.

4.   Words in brackets ( ) in the markscheme are not necessary to gain the mark.

5.   Words that are underlined are essential for the mark.

6.   The order of marking points does not have to be as in the markscheme, unless stated otherwise.

Extended response questions - quality of construction

 Extended response questions for HL P2 carry a mark total of [20]. Of these marks, [18] are
   awarded for content and [2] for the quality of construction of the answer.

 Two aspects are considered:
      expression of relevant ideas with clarity
      structure of the answers.

 [1] quality mark is to be awarded when the candidate satisfies EACH of the following criteria.
   Thus [2] quality marks are awarded when a candidate satisfies BOTH criteria.

Clarity of expression:
   The candidate has made a serious and full attempt to answer all parts of the question and the
   answers are expressed clearly enough to be understood with little or no re-reading.

Structure of answer:
   The candidate has linked relevant ideas to form a logical sequence within at least two parts
   of the same question (eg within part a and within part b, or within part a and within part c
   etc. but not between part a and part b or between part a and part c etc.).

 It is important to judge this on the overall answer, taking into account the answers to all parts
   of the question. Although, the part with the largest number of marks is likely to provide the
   most evidence.

 Candidates that score very highly on the content marks need not necessarily automatically
   gain [2] marks for the quality of construction (and vice versa).

     (g)   All marking points are deductions based on comparing older females with
           3 month females and on the assumption that any changes in % are due to aging.
           newly formed β cells fewer/reduced/smaller % (in control/IKO mice);
