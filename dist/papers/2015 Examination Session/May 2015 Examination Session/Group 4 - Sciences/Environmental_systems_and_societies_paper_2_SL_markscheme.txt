General marking Instructions


   Assistant Examiners (AEs) will be contacted by their team leader (TL) through RM™ Assessor, by
   e-mail or telephone – if through RM™ Assessor or by e-mail, please reply to confirm that you
   have downloaded the markscheme from IBIS. The purpose of this initial contact is to allow AEs to
   raise any queries they have regarding the markscheme and its interpretation. AEs should contact
   their team leader through RM™ Assessor or by e-mail at any time if they have any
   problems/queries regarding marking. For any queries regarding the use of RM™ Assessor,
   please contact emarking@ibo.org.

1.   Follow the markscheme provided, award only whole marks and mark only in RED.

2.   Make sure that the question you are about to mark is highlighted in the mark panel on the
     right-hand side of the screen.

3.   Where a mark is awarded, a tick/check () must be placed in the text at the precise point where it
     becomes clear that the candidate deserves the mark. One tick to be shown for each mark
     awarded.

4.   Sometimes, careful consideration is required to decide whether or not to award a mark. In these
     cases use RM™ Assessor annotations to support your decision. You are encouraged to write
     comments where it helps clarity, especially for re-marking purposes. Use a text box for these
     additional comments. It should be remembered that the script may be returned to the candidate.

5.   Personal codes/notations are unacceptable.

6.   Where an answer to a part question is worth no marks but the candidate has attempted the part
     question, enter a zero in the mark panel on the right-hand side of the screen. Where an answer to
     a part question is worth no marks because the candidate has not attempted the part question,
     enter an “NR” in the mark panel on the right-hand side of the screen.

7.   If a candidate has attempted more than the required number of questions within a paper or section
     of a paper, mark all the answers. RM™ Assessor will only award the highest mark or marks in line
     with the rubric.

8.   Ensure that you have viewed every page including any additional sheets. Please ensure that you
     stamp “seen” on any page that contains no other annotation.

9.   Mark positively. Give candidates credit for what they have achieved and for what they have got
     correct, rather than penalizing them for what they have got wrong. However, a mark should not be
     awarded where there is contradiction within an answer. Make a comment to this effect using a text
     box or the “CON” stamp.

Markscheme
Mark allocation

Candidates are required to answer ALL questions in Section A [25] and TWO questions in Section B
[40]. Maximum total = [65].


1.    A markscheme often has more marking points than the total allows. This is intentional.

2.    Each marking point has a separate line and the end is shown by means of a semicolon (;).

3.    An alternative answer or wording is indicated in the markscheme by a slash (/). Either wording can
      be accepted.

4.    Words in brackets ( ) in the markscheme are not necessary to gain the mark.

5.    Words that are underlined are essential for the mark.

6.    The order of marking points does not have to be as in the markscheme, unless stated otherwise.

7.    If the candidate’s answer has the same “meaning” or can be clearly interpreted as being of
      equivalent significance, detail and validity as that in the markscheme then award the mark.
      Where this point is considered to be particularly relevant in a question it is emphasized by
      WTTE (or words to that effect).

8.    Remember that many candidates are writing in a second language. Effective communication is
      more important than grammatical accuracy.

9.    Occasionally, a part of a question may require an answer that is required for subsequent
      marking points. If an error is made in the first marking point then it should be penalized. However,
      if the incorrect answer is used correctly in subsequent marking points then follow through marks
      should be awarded. When marking, indicate this by adding ECF (error carried forward) on the
      script.

10.   Do not penalize candidates for errors in units or significant figures, unless it is specifically referred
      to in the markscheme.

(c)   (i)    Award [1] for each type.

              Types of       Example from Inle Lake
              pollution
              Point          (waste from) local industry/coal mine/power plant/
              Source         domestic wastewater (from houses via pipes)*
                              [1]
              Non-point      fertilizers / pesticides / nutrients/nitrate/ phosphate /
              Source         domestic wastewater* / sediment into lake [1]
                                                                                               [2 max]

             *could be considered as point source if house can be identified or
             non-point source if all houses are being considered. Do not credit the same
             point twice unless specific distinctions are made.
             Simple statements of one word are acceptable; many students will write
             more detail.

      (ii)                       Example in Inle Lake
              Altering the       stop creating/maintaining floating gardens;
              human activity     stop/reduce use of fertilizer;
                                 use only organic fertilisers;
                                 stop residents of houses tipping their waste
                                 water/sewage into the lake;
                                 stop/reduce discharge from power station/coal
                                 mine/industry;
                                 Introduce legislation to prevent discharge of pollutants;
                                 education about the harmful effects of pollution on the
                                 lake (any eg of pollution acceptable);
                                 stop deforestation (to reduce sediment runoff into lake);
                                 [1 max]
              Clean-up and       dredge the bottom of the lake/remove sediment/pump
              restoration        up the mud from lake bottom;

                                 replant trees at lake sides to reduce run-off;
                                 remove non-native species;
                                 allow lake to regenerate naturally once pollution
                                 stopped;
                                 pump in oxygen; [1 max]                                       [2 max]
             All answers should link to pollution in the lake, not, for example overfishing.

      (iii)   fertilizers used on land/floating gardens runs off into the sea/seas around
              coasts;
              excess nutrients lead to rapid algal growth/blooms/eutrophication;
              this limits light/photosynthesis of other plants thus reducing O2 levels;
              low O2 causes plants/animals/fish/algae die;
              increased deaths & decomposition leads to further decrease in O2;
              low O2/increased deaths increasing decomposition/O2 reduction is positive
              feedback;
              most areas affected are in MEDCs which can afford to use fertilizers;
              hypoxic waters may run off into sea from lakes which have excess
              nutrients/algal growth/eutrophication;
                                                                                            [4 max]
              Note to examiners: NO marks awarded for references to eutrophication
              caused by urban or industrial waste

(d)   Strengths:
      grass carp is good for control because it naturally feeds on hyacinth;
      grass carp and hyacinth may become a self-regulating/negative feedback
      system / increased grass carp leads to decreased hyacinth (or vice versa);
      better than chemicals/herbicides as no pollution of the water;
      better than mechanical removal of hyacinth which is very labour-intensive;
      population once introduced will reproduce so only need to do it once;
      inexpensive;
      the grass carp may become a food source for the local populations;
      grass carp may become a part of the natural food web; [3 max]

      Limitations:
      is a non-native species so may eat other/desired plants/organisms too;
      may out-compete the local carp/other fish species;
      grass carp may overpopulate the lake and become a problem themselves;
      may bring diseases to the endemic fish species;
      risky thing to do as cannot foresee the effect of the grass carp on the ecosystem;
      the local population may use the water hyacinth as a resource, which may now
      become limited; [3 max]                                                               [4 max]

(e)   Accept valid points up to [4]. Must be a discussion to include at least one benefit
      and one drawback for full marks. Award up to [2] for a list of impacts only.

      Benefits:
      tourists bring different perspectives so open up the society to different ideas;
      sale of local artefacts/souvenirs will increase local income;
      ...which may encourage traditional skills to survive eg weaving;
      ...which may also lead to increased awareness/appreciation of their own culture;
      tourists are usually more wealthy than the Inle people so may bring other goods
      (eg cameras, electronic goods, foreign currency) to the Inle people so make the
      society richer;
      more opportunities to trade/learn skills (changing the society);
      money from jobs (changes society by) allows access to education/healthcare;
      incentive to improve education/go to school to learn a foreign language or a skill
      required by hotels;
      locals become more optimistic as there is a way of improving their life/gaining
      more money;
      tourism opens jobs better paid than farming;
      tourism opens new markets / trading opportunities / industries; [3 max]

      Drawbacks:
      petty theft/envy may increase though with so many more consumer goods
      around;
      values may clash with tourists of different religions/dress codes which could
      cause conflict;
      traditional roles may diminish as other work in catering for tourists is done;
      growth development of tourism may lead to displacement/takeover of farmland;
      ….generating a more commercialised food culture;
      …negatively affecting self-sufficiency/sustainability/cultural values/inheritance of
      local population;
      …and may lead to increased immigration/emigration/urbanisation;
      influx of new ideas/perspectives / requirement of novel job skills may raise
      conflicts among locals / create a gap between younger and older people;
      tourism may raise demand for illegal activities eg prostitution, drugs, wildlife
      trophies;
      government might prioritize funding of projects that please tourists rather than
      meeting actual needs of locals (or even against their needs);
      tourism might destroy the beauty of the area causing psychological stress to
      people/ altering the way they see life/ feeling they are losing their traditions/ethos;
      [3 max]

      Accept any other reasonable answer
                                                                                                [4 max]

      Note to examiners: Do not award marks for environmental/ecological impacts.

     General Essay Markscheme

     Each essay is marked out of [20] of which [2] are for clarity of expression, structure and development
     of ideas.

             [0] Quality of expression, structure and development is poor.
             [1] Quality of expression, structure and development is limited.
             [2] Quality of expression is clear, structure is good and ideas are well developed.

     Do not penalize candidates for writing in bullet pointed lists – if this technique is used appropriately
     ie to summarize or outline a list of points within an essay at an appropriate point. However, a
     candidate who has not shown any evidence of being able to write a paragraph with a developed,

2.     (a)     Similarities:
               both can be population/species interactions (interspecific);
               in both two individuals are involved (includes both inter- and intra-specific);
               both can lead to a stable equilibrium in populations;
               both can lead to extinction of a species;
               both limit population size;
               at least one species is negatively affected in both;
                   both are density dependent;

               Differences:
               predation negatively affects one species / competition (usually) negatively
               affects both competitors;
               predation involves animal species / competition may involve animal or plant
               species;
               in predation, one species (predators) depends on the other / competition neither
               are dependent on the other;
               (only) predation involves direct killing/eating of species;
               (only) competition reduces available resources for both species;
               competition can involve competing for habitat not just food;
               the species involved in predation represent two different trophic levels, whereas
               competition may represent the same trophic level;                                        [4 max]

               Award [3 max] if only similarities or only differences are stated.

(b)   (i)    as population of prey increases, more food is available for predators;
             this leads to increase of predator population;
              …so there is more predation / so prey population decreases;
              …leading to cyclical changes around a stable equilibrium;
              this is negative feedback / density dependent mechanism;                      [3 max]

             These marks can be awarded for appropriately annotated diagram, clearly
             demonstrating the marking points.

             marks for EoI.
             Do not award marks for just giving examples in this question.

      (ii)   there may be excessive/unusually high growth/predation by predator
             population so the prey species declines;
              …eg if predator is a non-native/invasive/introduced species;
             …or if predator’s limiting factors (eg disease/predation/climate) become
             more favourable;
             predator populations may continue to grow unregulated by a given prey
             species if they feed on other prey species as well leading to the long-term
             decline of the given prey species;
             If an environmental change causes decline of other prey species,
             predators with a choice of prey may focus predation more heavily on
             remaining species leading to their long-term decline;
             if prey populations fall for some other reason (human hunting), the
             population may become too small to recover from predation;
             If the prey species does not have time to reproduce then prey numbers
             will decline / if predation exceeds the natural rate of replenishment of the
             prey;                                                                          [3 max]

(c)   For each of two strategies (do not credit more than two strategies) award
      [4 max], but only [3 max] for an imbalanced discussion.
       If more than two strategies are mentioned please credit the two highest scoring
      strategies.
      If no named countries [6 max] but award no specific marks for the countries.

      The sub-headings below are for guidance only. Credit should be given for the
      Marking points whether the student identifies them under these titles or not. E.g.
      One Child Policy may be identified as a strategy or an example etc

      anti-natal policies:
      Strategy: tax/welfare disincentives;
      Effect:
      too expensive to have many kids thus causing a reduction in birth rate;
      limits costs to the state of providing facilities for kids;
      the population is law abiding and so will have fewer children so abide by the
      law;
      Impact:
      gender preference leads to increased selective abortions/abandonment of
      babies;
      For example, one child policy of China and the "little emperors";
      the country has an aging population that requires healthcare;

      Strategy: Education/promotion/provision of free/cheap contraception;
      Effect:
      population growth is slowed;
      Impact:
      individuals control their fertility;
      conflicts with cultural/religious beliefs/norms;
      For example, Philippines is a strongly Catholic country where the Church
      supports the ban on contraception;

      Strategy: Emancipation/higher status/education of women;
      Effect:
      reduces the fertility rate of women in the country;
      fewer children as women have more decision making/career opportunities
      available;
      Impact:
      this can enable families to increase economic productivity;
      but this can upset male dominated societies/cultures/religions;
      For example, in Uganda the more male children gives greater social status to
      men;

Pro-Natal policies
Strategy: Tax incentives;
Effect:
may prevent population decline;
…may have political benefits in maintaining economic productivity;
Impact:
population may already be unsustainable/beyond carrying capacity;
Is costly to the government;
increase proportion of young people to stabilise population distribution;
For example, France pays a bonus for each extra child born in a family;
free public transport etc to support the overall strategy of increasing family size;

Strategy: Welfare incentives/Extended maternity/paternity leave/subsidized
childcare;
Effect:
increase number of children a family is willing to have, as little cost/allows the
parents to be economically independent;
Impact:
high cost to businesses/industry as workers unavailable;
can lead to a rapidly growing population of young people;
For example, Singapore in the 1980s covered the cost of maternity leave for the
first 4 babies;

Strategy: Laws against birth control/family planning;
Effect:
population will rise to the required number for the country;
Impact:
can be too authoritative with bans on contraception/no control over fertility;
cultural and religious requirements are met;
For example, Romania did ban abortions and strongly discouraged the use of
contraception;

Strategy: Immigration laws;
Effect:
partly effective but illegal immigration still happens;
Impacts:
political divisions about what to do to stop illegal entry;
human rights might be breached with deportation of migrants;

Allow other reasonable answers like healthcare that specify how the population
will be stabilised.

Award [7 max] for marking points above, and [1 max] for a clear conclusion
that is justified by points raised.

Note to examiners: An isolated statement/opinion e.g. “tax incentives are the
most effective strategy” should not be considered as a valid conclusion. A
valid conclusion may, however, be stated within the body of the response
rather than at the end, and may involve some balanced decision:

e.g. Emancipation/higher status/education of women is the most
effective strategy because it simultaneously addresses many other social
issues/human rights;                                                            [1 max]

3.   (a)   “Renewable” resources can be naturally replenished;
           “Sustainable” is the use of resources at a rate less than or equal to their
           replenishment / that allows similar use for future generations;

           “Renewable” refers to the resources themselves;
           “Sustainable” refers to the activities affecting resources (eg extraction/
           exploitation/use);

           resources may be “renewable” but their current extraction/exploitation/use may,
           or may not be “sustainable”;

           [1 max] may be awarded for an appropriate example of BOTH a renewable
           resource (a good or service e.g timber) AND a sustainable practice (e.g.
           harvesting only natural income);

(c)   Use of agrochemicals (technique):
      manure or organic fertilisers may help with increasing the fertility of the soil /
      water retention of the soil (increase sustainability);
      use biological control may reduce soil contamination by pesticides(increase
      sustainability);
      artificial fertilisers may toxify the soil if overused (decrease sustainability);
      use of pesticides might contaminate /poison soil(decrease sustainability);

      Tillage/ploughing method (technique):
      contour ploughing may reduce erosion runoff (increase sustainability);
      conservation tillage” (chisel / moldboard plough) is a sustainable technique
      because techniques that do not destroy the soil structure are applied(increase
      sustainability);
      tillage is timed to the season with less rain/wind to reduce erosion(increase
      sustainability);
      gradient ploughing/parallel with slope may increase soil loss through
      erosion(decrease sustainability);

      Reduction of erosion(technique):
      undivided/large areas may lead to greater wind erosion of soils(decrease
      sustainability);
      bare land/soil during rains/winter may lead to increased erosion(decrease
      sustainability);
      wind-breaks/hedges may reduce wind erosion(increase sustainability);
      growing cover crops or mulching after harvest can reduce soil erosion(increase
      sustainability);

      Cropping technique(technique):
      multiple/mixed cropping may help maintain mineral/nutrient
      composition(increase sustainability);
      leaving soil fallow / crop rotation with N-fixing plants may help maintain
      nutrients(increase sustainability);

4.   (a)   natural selection is survival of the fittest/best adapted;
           survivors will pass on favourable, inheritable traits to their offspring;
           populations of a species may become isolated from one another;
           ….this may lead to speciation/greater species diversity;
           with natural selection populations will change/adapt over time to their different
           environments;
           …up to a point where they can no longer interbreed (ie new species
           formed/speciation);
           natural selection may also favour new mutations/genes adding to the genetic
           diversity;
           adaptive radiation through natural selection in newly formed/diverse habitats
           can increase species/genetic diversity in a population;
           natural selection may favour species that modify habitats generating habitat
           diversity;

(b)   (i)    Role of atmosphere:
             atmosphere contributes to patterns of climate/heat/temperature/ precipitation;
             rising hot, damp air at equator condenses as it meets colder air;
             …causing high rainfall and ideal conditions for rainforests in that region;
             descending dry air at slightly higher latitudes/30 degrees N/S;
             …gives rise to desert systems;
             atmospheric circulation transfers heat from equator to higher latitudes;
             …allowing for life-supporting temperatures in temperate grasslands/ forests/tundra
             biomes;

             Note to examiners: Credit must be given for answers that address biomes
             not species.
             Full credit can be given for a well drawn annotated tri-cellular model with
             biomes and atmospheric flows shown.                                            [3 max]

      (ii)   Role of plate activity:
             volcanic activity/plate movement forms mountains;
             …that show a gradient/zonation of ecosystems changing with altitude;
             volcanic activity may also give rise to oceanic islands/land bridges;
             …often, due to their isolation, carrying unique ecosystems/communities;
             plate activity also gives rise to deep oceanic trenches;
             …with unique ecosystems often based on chemosynthetic production;

             plate movement may cause separation of previously contiguous
             ecosystems;
             ...bringing ecosystems into new climatic regions;
             Volcanic eruptions can wipe out entire ecosystems;
             .... and may lead to succession/development of new ecosystems;

             Note to examiners: Credit must be given for answers that address diversity
             of ecosystems not species.                                                     [3 max]

(c)   The sub-headings below are for guidance only. Credit should be given for
      the Marking points whether the student identifies them under these titles
      or not.

      Global Warming element:
      climate change/biomes shift;
      Distribution:
      biomes move towards higher latitudes / altitudes;
      Credit a detailed example
      Diversity:
      if the shift is too rapid some species will not be able to survive, decreasing
      diversity;
      if the species are on islands or mountains they may run out of space to
      migrate to;
      keystone species/critical to ecosystem, whole ecosystems may be
      lost/damaged;
      changes to the precipitation/temperature/humidity may make an area more
      or less conducive to the existing ecosystems;
      For example, desert areas may receive more rainfall so allowing a more
      diverse ecosystem;
      For example, Sub-Saharan areas receive less rainfall leading to
      desertification / (southward) expansion of Sahara desert
      increased fires in tropical rain forests (due to higher temperatures or
      increased aridity) would lead to loss of species / reduce niches;
      altered rainfall patterns might reduce habitat diversity;

      Global Warming element:
      melting ice caps/permafrost;
      Distribution:
      exposed areas after melting in high latitudes and/or altitudes;
      Diversity:
      the newly exposed areas might support new tundra ecosystems, potentially
      increasing diversity;
      if ecosystems space in the tundra is reduced then diversity decreases;
      flooding of coastal area ecosystems will reduce ecosystem diversity;
      positive feedback loops might occur with the release of methane/clathrates
      accelerating further global warming/ climate change, stressing ecosystems
      even more;
                                 – 23 –               M15/4/ENVSO/SP2/ENG/TZ0/XX/M


Global Warming element:
Changes to the oceans/aquatic areas (higher water temperatures/change in
El Nino frequency and intensity);
Distribution:
areas closer to the surface/shallow depth ecosystems are more exposed to
the changes;
Diversity:
higher temperatures are likely to bleach/destroy some coral ecosystems;
…and accelerate ocean acidification, damaging plankton/base of marine
ecosystems;
ocean circulation may alter allowing some areas to become more diverse;
a possible change of deep sea currents may benefit some areas that would
receive more nutrients, thus increase species diversity;
a possible northward movement of Gulf Stream may benefit Iceland and
Greenland (ameliorate temperature);

Global Warming element:
thermal expansion of sea/ sea level rise;
Distribution of biomes:
increased erosion of coast/ alteration of continental shelf landscape may
alter the extent of littoral/shallow coastal zone;
flooding of coastal ecosystem may destroy them, e.g., mangroves;
...but at the same time create new littoral/tidal ecosystems;
Diversity:
reduce intertidal habitat diversity as some species won't tolerate the shift of
tide lines (low & high);
creation of new tidal fronts may bring more nutrients thus increase aquatic
species diversity;

Award [7 max] for marking points above, and [1 max] for a clear
conclusion that is justified by points raised.

Note to examiners: An isolated statement/opinion e.g. “global warming will
alter distribution / diversity of ecosystems” should not be considered as a
valid conclusion. A valid conclusion may, however, be stated within the
body of the response rather than at the end, and may involve some
balanced decision:

e.g. effect of global warming would be higher in Polar ecosystems as
temperature increase is higher there, so low latitude ecosystems may be
only partly affected; [1 max]

 Award [2max] for part (c) if response just identifies global warming
elements with no reference to effect of global warming on either distribution
or diversity.
Award [5 Max] if the answer addresses only negatives or only positives of
distribution and diversity changes

           identify the species (usually macroinvertebrates) using keys/photo charts;
           and measure their abundance;
           classify species into (pollution) tolerant, (moderately tolerant) and (pollution)
           sensitive;
           count how many taxa/species fall into each class/category;[3 Max]

           measure biological oxygen demand/BOD/Dissolved Oxygen;
           sample the water using an appropriate kit/device/probe;
           take initial and a final dissolved oxygen reading / take (at least) 2 recordings
           (initial & after 5, 7 or 10 days);
           the difference between the initial and final reading is the BOD / calculate by
           appropriately graphing the data (DO values);
           The higher the BOD the more organic matter/Dead Organic Matter is in the

(b)   The sub-headings below are for guidance only. Credit should be given for the
      Marking points whether the student identifies them under these titles or not.

      Baseline study:
      provides an inventory of social/cultural aspects / keystone/red-listed
      species/unique habitats that are of particular value;
      this can help focus/organise/prioritise protective strategies;
      but …it is time-consuming/expensive exercise;
      may be biased if carried out by surveyors under employment of developer;
      however the inventory may miss some species due to lack of funding/expertise /
      done fast as project deadlines are pressing;

      Assessment of potential social and ecological impacts/benefits:
      provides a holistic evaluation;
      allows input from all stakeholders;
      comparing to similar projects (already executed) would increase the validity of
      the EIA;
      but …may be dominated by majority/commercial interests;
      political interference may occur;
      ecosystems are complex/newly formed and thus it is difficult to predict the
      potential impacts of a development on the ecosystem

      Recommendations/Mitigations:
      these are designed to limit impact/protect the environment;
      the EIA report is a public document and allows public to disagree;
      ...may result in changed/modified construction techniques;
      in some countries the EIA is advisory while in others it is compulsory and so
      may determine the implementation of mitigation strategies;
      flooded area/lake/water reservoir should be designed to allow recreation
      activities / provide shelter for migratory birds / form a new ecologically sound
      habitat;
      but …they depend on effective enforcement;
      overall project may be so large that some/a lot of ecological destruction will be
      done (even if the EIA is “ perfect”);
                                        – 26 –               M15/4/ENVSO/SP2/ENG/TZ0/XX/M



Monitoring of impacts during development:
help to ensure developers were keeping to recommended procedures/
development before damage is irreversible;
alert authorities to any unforeseen damage to environment;
but …this again is time-consuming/expensive;
despite raising concerns nothing may be done to stop the impact;
evaluation of social/ecological impacts after the development:
would inform plans for any necessary restoration;
enables responsibility/costs for this restoration to be passed on to developers;
but …not all damages are restorable/reversible;
any penalties may simply be absorbed by developers as part of cost;
developers may press the government to avoid paying for restoration / pass the
cost to the taxpayers;

Otherwise, award [6 max] for marking points above, and [1 max] for a clear
conclusion that is justified by points raised.

Note to examiners: An isolated statement/opinion e.g. “EIAs are very helpful”
should not be considered as a valid conclusion. A valid conclusion may, however,
be stated within the body of the response rather than at the end, and may involve
some balanced decision:

e.g. An EIA would be effective only if there is political will / enough funding /
local pressure for its implementation ; [1 max]

 Award [2max] for whole question if response just describes what an EIA is with
no reference its effectiveness.
                                                                                    [7 max]

(c)   Deep Ecologists believe in innate rights/biorights of living organisms;
      …and that humans should have minimal impact on other species/ecosystems;
      Natural processes are more important than human societies / humans should
      observe natural laws;
      Cornucopians believe humans have an unqualified/unlimited right to exploit the
      environment;
      …and technology will be sufficient to overcome any issues arising;
      will prioritise pro-growth/development goals in the justification of a project;

      Award up to [2 max] for general description of value systems ([1] for each).


      Deep Ecologists’ approach to HEP project [3 max]:
      Deep Ecologists would oppose the project because…
      …building an HEP would be an example of materialism/unrestrained resource
      use that is against their beliefs;
      …a large dam will disturb natural processes/ecosystems which is unethical;
      …biorights of native species will be infringed through flooding
      upstream/changing flow downstream;
      …local cultural values (e.g. river sanctity/”river festivals”) might be offended by
      interfering with the river;
      …animal/human rights of free access to water would probably be infringed by
      administration of HEP/reservoir;
      they would be against large-scale production plant/would propose smaller
      unobtrusive renewable energy sources;
      they would be against centralized energy sources/ would propose community
      based, smaller scale, energy sources;

      Cornucopians’ approach to HEP project [3 max]:
      Cornucopians would be in support of project because…
      the lake/reservoir would “improve” environment for human use e.g.
      recreation/more reliable water supply;
      HEP would be an efficient power supply to increase standard of living/further
      technological growth/development;
      it would provide a technological solution to problems of fossil fuel use;
      any ecological issues/disturbances from HEP could be resolved through human
      ingenuity/further technology;
      possible ecological/cultural losses would be outweighed by potential benefits to
      the community/society;
      with appropriate scientific design/development, lake/reservoir could increase
      biodiversity (e.g. aquatic species/migratory birds/new habitats);
      centralised management/regulation is more efficient/reliable at regulating
      resource use/maintaining sustainability;

Note to examiners: If candidates have understood the value systems (Deep
Ecologists and Cornucopians) the wrong way round, but their responses are
consistent with the two opposing views, award [3 max].

While some of the above reasons attributable to Deep Ecologists/Cornucopians
may be common to other EVS, no credit should be given to responses that
explicitly address other EVS instead, or to reasons that are exclusively
attributable to other EVS
Otherwise, award [6 max] for marking points above, and [1 max] for a clear
conclusion that is justified by points raised.

Conclusion mark:
An isolated statement/opinion e.g. “a deep Ecologist would object the project
whereas a Cornucopian would support it” should not be considered as a valid
conclusion. A valid conclusion may, however, be stated within the body of the
response rather than at the end, and may involve some balanced decision:

e.g. From these arguments we can see that the approaches of deep ecologists
and cornucopians are at opposite ends of a spectrum, which is why a more
central position, such as environmental managers/soft ecologists, is likely to
achieve more success; [1 max]
