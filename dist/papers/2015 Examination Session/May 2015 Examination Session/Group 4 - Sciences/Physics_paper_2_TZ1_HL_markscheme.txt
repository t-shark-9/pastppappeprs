Subject Details: Physics HL Paper 2 Markscheme
Mark Allocation

Candidates are required to answer ALL questions in Section A [45 marks] and TWO questions in
Section B [2 x 25 marks]. Maximum total = [95 marks].

1.   A markscheme often has more marking points than the total allows. This is intentional.

2.   Each marking point has a separate line and the end is shown by means of a semicolon (;).

3.   An alternative answer or wording is indicated in the markscheme by a slash (/). Either wording can
     be accepted.

4.   Words in brackets ( ) in the markscheme are not necessary to gain the mark.

5.   Words that are underlined are essential for the mark.

6.   The order of marking points does not have to be as in the markscheme, unless stated otherwise.
