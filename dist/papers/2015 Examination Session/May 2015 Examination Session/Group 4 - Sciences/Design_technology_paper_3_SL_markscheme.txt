This markscheme is the property of the International Baccalaureate and
must not be reproduced or distributed to any other person
without the authorization of the IB Assessment Centre.
                                                   –3–                M15/4/DESTE/SP3/ENG/TZ0/XX/M


1.    Follow the markscheme provided, award only whole marks and mark only in RED.

2.    Make sure that the question you are about to mark is highlighted in the mark panel on the
      right-hand side of the screen.

3.    Where a mark is awarded, a tick/check () must be placed in the text at the precise point where
      it becomes clear that the candidate deserves the mark. One tick to be shown for each
      mark awarded.

4.    Sometimes, careful consideration is required to decide whether or not to award a mark. In these
      cases use RM™ Assessor annotations to support your decision. You are encouraged to write
      comments where it helps clarity, especially for re-marking purposes. Use a text box for these
      additional comments. It should be remembered that the script may be returned to the candidate.

5.    Personal codes/notations are unacceptable.

6.    Where an answer to a part question is worth no marks but the candidate has attempted the
      part question, use the “ZERO” annotation to award zero marks. Where a candidate has not
      attempted the part question, use the “SEEN” annotation to show you have looked at the question.
      RM™ Assessor will apply “NR” once you click complete.

7.    If a candidate has attempted more than the required number of questions within a paper or
      section of a paper, mark all the answers. RM™ Assessor will only award the highest mark or
      marks in line with the rubric.

8.    Ensure that you have viewed every page including any additional sheets. Please ensure that
      you stamp “SEEN” on any additional pages that are blank or where the candidate has crossed out
      his/her work.

9.    There is no need to stamp an annotation when a candidate has not chosen an option. RM™
      Assessor will apply “NR” once you click complete.

10.   Mark positively. Give candidates credit for what they have achieved and for what they have
      got correct, rather than penalizing them for what they have got wrong. However, a mark should
      not be awarded where there is contradiction within an answer. Make a comment to this effect
      using a text box or the “CON” stamp.

Subject Details:        Design Technology SL Paper 3 Markscheme
Mark Allocation

Candidates are required to answer questions from ONE of the Options [1 × 30 marks].
Maximum total = [30 marks]

1.    A markscheme often has more marking points than the total allows. This is intentional.

2.    Each marking point has a separate line and the end is shown by means of a semicolon (;).

3.    An alternative answer or wording is indicated in the markscheme by a slash (/). Either wording can
      be accepted.

4.    Words in brackets ( ) in the markscheme are not necessary to gain the mark.

5.    Words that are underlined are essential for the mark.

6.    The order of marking points does not have to be as in the markscheme, unless stated otherwise.

7.    If the candidate’s answer has the same “meaning” or can be clearly interpreted as being of
      equivalent significance, detail and validity as that in the markscheme then award the mark.
      Where this point is considered to be particularly relevant in a question it is emphasized by WTTE
      (or words to that effect).

8.    Remember that many candidates are writing in a second language. Effective communication is
      more important than grammatical accuracy.

9.    Occasionally, a part of a question may require an answer that is required for subsequent
      marking points. If an error is made in the first marking point then it should be penalized. However, if
      the incorrect answer is used correctly in subsequent marking points then follow through marks
      should be awarded. When marking indicate this by adding ECF (error carried forward) on the script.

10.   Do not penalize candidates for errors in units or significant figures, unless it is specifically referred
      to in the markscheme.

Option A — Food science and technology

1.   (a)   Award [1] for stating one reason for the selection of a head of wheat for both the
           gluten-free symbols shown in Figures A1 and A2.

           cereals, eg wheat, are a major dietary source of gluten and thus a major problem
           in relation to gluten intolerance;
           the seed head of the plant is an easily recognizable shape and thus a good visual
           symbol;                                                                                [1 max]

     (b)   Award [1] for identifying how gluten intolerance impacts on diet and [1] for a brief
           explanation [2 max].

           people who suffer gluten intolerance should avoid foods that contain cereals;
           this can be difficult as a lot of processed foods contain wheat flour;

           because wheat flour is used widely in processed foods and recipes;
           it can be difficult to achieve a varied, interesting and balanced diet;

           products containing wheat / gluten in diet need to be replaced;
           by gluten free foods;                                                                      [2]

     (c)   Award [1] for each of three distinct correct points in an explanation of why many
           food retailers have produced ranges of gluten-free foods [3 max].

           gluten intolerance is increasingly common;
           food retailers are responding to a distinct market segment;
           the size of the market segment makes gluten-free ranges financially viable;                [3]


2.   (a)   Award [1] for a definition of lifestyle to the effect of:

           the way a person or group lives, including patterns of social relations,
           consumption, entertainment and dress;                                                      [1]

     (b)   Award [1] for identifying a lifestyle factor which impacts on health and [1] for a
           brief explanation [2 max].

           working women with less time to cook food for their families;
           increasingly rely on fast/convenience/processed foods which are often high in fat
           and sugar and low in fibre;

           working men living on their own and not interested in cooking;
           increasingly rely on fast/convenience/processed foods which are often high in fat
           and sugar and low in fibre;

           young people, eg students (males and females);
           increasingly rely on fast/convenience/processed foods which are often high in fat
           and sugar and low in fibre;

           shift work/changing shift patterns;
           families do not eat together and may be increasingly reliant on
           fast/convenience/processed foods which are often high in fat and sugar and low
           in fibre
                                                   –6–                    M15/4/DESTE/SP3/ENG/TZ0/XX/M


           sportspersons/people with active lifestyles;
           may choose to eat more healthily avoiding junk food and reducing intake of
           saturated fats and increasing intake of vitamins and proteins;                             [2]


3.   (a)   Award [1] for each of two distinct correct points in a description of one way in
           which the packaging of Coca-Cola® has contributed to the development of the
           Coca-Cola® brand [2 max].

           the red colour/the shape of the bottle/can/the font used/logo;
           highly recognizable/distinctive;
           are all strongly associated/synonymous with the brand;

           The structural design of the packaging is good;
           easy to hold/easy to open/recyclable;

           aesthetically sound – timeless design;
           has provided a consistent image for the product;                                       [2 max]

     (b)   Award [1] for one purpose of food labelling and [1] for a brief explanation [2 max].

           to provide nutritional information;
           nutritional information is designed to help consumers make informed food
           choices (eg to achieve a balanced diet);

           to indicate storage information;
           correct storage will maximize the shelf life of the product;

           to provide serving ideas;
           consumers may not be sure how the product should be used

           to indicate the ingredients used;
           especially those that may cause allergies;                                             [2 max]


4.   Award [1] for each of two distinct correct points in a description of the role of primary
     processing in the production of food products [2 max].

     storage properties;
     to extend the shelf life of the product and prevent food spoilage;

     concentrating the product removes water and reduces volume/weight;
     to facilitate distribution/reduce energy costs of distribution;
     water can be added back during secondary processing;                                         [2 max]

5.   Award [1] for each distinct point in an explanation of two principal causes of chemical
     spoilage of food [3 max per cause, 6 max].

     enzymic spoilage (or autolysis);
     living organisms use enzymes to catalyse chemical reactions in its cells;
     after harvesting these enzymes can cause the decomposition of the tissue so the food
     decays;

     rancidity;
     relates to the fat/oil content of a food;
     chemical breakdown of the fat or oil leads to off-flavours in the food;                        [6]


6.   Award [1] for each distinct correct point in an explanation of the impact of low intakes
     of protein, carbohydrate and water-soluble vitamins on the body [3 max for each
     nutrient, 9 max total].

     Low protein:
     stunted growth/muscle wasting;
     decreased resistance to infection;
     in extreme conditions this can lead to kwashiorkor/marasmus;

     Low carbohydrate:
     low energy production;
     difficulty in undertaking physical activity;
     tiredness/lethargy/weight loss;

     reduced fibre intake;

Option B — Electronic product design

7.   (a)   Award [1] for stating the function of the component labelled Y in Figure B1.

           thermistor to sense change in temperature;                                                   [1]

     (b)   Award [1] for identifying the function of the arrangement of components X, Y, R1
           and R2 and [1] for a brief explanation [2 max].

           they act as a bridge circuit/potential divider/voltage divider;
           they determine the voltages of the inputs to the terminals of the operational
           amplifier and whether its output is high or low to drive the transistor and the
           alarm;                                                                                       [2]

     (c)   Award [1] for each of three distinct correct points in an explanation of how the
           circuit works so that the buzzer sounds if the freezer malfunctions [3 max].

           if the freezer malfunctions the temperature in the freezer will rise and the
           resistance of thermistor Y will decrease;
           if the voltage at the inverting input (-) is lower than that that of the non-inverting
           (+) input;
           the output of the op-amp will be high (or vice versa);
           this will turn the transistor on and the buzzer will sound;                                  [3]


8.   (a)   set user temperature;                                                                        [1]

     (b)   Award [1] for each of two distinct correct points in a description of how feedback is
           used in a closed loop control system [2 max].

           the user sets the variable under control, eg temperature;
           a sensor monitors the output and senses the actual size of the variable and
           compares it with the required size;
           the output is changed to reduce the difference between the variable set and the
           actual variable;                                                                         [2 max]

9.    (a)   Award [1] for each of two distinct correct points in a description of an optical fibre
            [2 max].

            a cable made of coated glass or plastic;
            covered with a strengthening layer to prevent damage and then a thermoplastic;               [2]

      (b)   Award [1] for each of two distinct correct points in a description of the role of
            synchronization in time division multiplexing [2 max].

            TDM splits a signal into distinct time slots;
            synchronization ensures the correct recombination of the time slots so the signal
            can be read correctly;                                                                       [2]


10.   Award [1] for each of two distinct correct points in a description of Ohm’s law [2 max].

      Ohm’s law is the mathematical relationship linking electric current, resistance and
      voltage;
      V=IR;                                                                                              [2]


11.   Award [1] for each distinct point in an explanation of two benefits for the consumer of a
      manufacturer adopting a generic standard for a particular function of an electronic
      product [3 max per explanation, 6 max].

      cost;
      to develop the functionality requires R&D;
      the cost of the R&D is a fixed cost which would be passed on to the consumer;

      interoperability;
      the product is likely to be able to integrate with other products using the generic
      standard;
      this makes the product more competitive and gives it an advantage in the marketplace;              [6]


12.   Award [1] for each distinct correct point in a discussion of three strategies that can be
      used to minimize the environmental impact of electronic products on disposal [3 max
      for each strategy, 9 max total].

      use of temporary fittings/take back legislation;
      facilitate ease-of-disassembly and promote reuse and recycling;
      reduce waste to landfill;

      shredding;
      used for small products;
      does not promote reuse of components or recycling of materials;

      avoiding the use of toxic substances in components/sub-assemblies;
      lead, cadmium and other metals are poisonous to living organisms;
      if disposed to landfill can poison soil and pollute water courses;

      use of shape memory alloys for screws;
      change shape on heating to critical temperature;
      screws lose threads and fall out;                                                              [9 max]

Option C — CAD/CAM

13.   (a)   Award [1] for stating the correct name of cutting tool A.

            round nose;                                                                             [1]

      (b)   Award [1] for a reason why the feed rate changes according to the material being
            processed and [1] for a brief explanation [2 max].

            harder materials / metals require a lower feed rate than softer materials;
            if you have it too high the tool will not cut properly / will become damaged;           [2]

      (c)   Award [1] for each of three distinct correct points in a comparison of the effects of
            using large or small diameter tools for CNC machining [3 max].

            large diameter tools will carry out the process more quickly than small diameter
            tools as they cut out a larger area;
            but they cannot cut intricate shapes precisely;
            especially where curved surfaces are required;                                          [3]


14.   (a)   Award [1] for a definition of numerical control to the effect of:

            automated machines that require data to be (inputted manually by a trained
            operator);                                                                              [1]

      (b)   Award [1] for identifying a reason why numerical control machines are preferred
            by some manufacturers to CNC machines and [1] for a brief explanation [2 max].

            numerical control machines are suitable for producing designs which are
            repetitive in nature, eg carpets;
            they lack the flexibility of CNC machines but are cheaper;                              [2]

15.   (a)   Award [1] for each of two distinct correct points in a description of the relationship
            of the dark and light colours in the FEA image shown in Figure C1 [2 max].

            the darker colours represent parts of the car unaffected by the crash/not
            damaged;
            the lighter the colour the greater the effect of the impact on the car;

            the darker colours show parts of the car unaffected by the impact;
            the lighter colours show where the greatest stress concentrations have occurred;         [2 max]


      (b)   Award [1] for a reason why the designer would carry out a series of tests to
            obtain reliable data from FEA CAD images similar to that in Figure 2 and [1] for a
            brief explanation [2 max].

            test the vehicle at different speeds;
            based on typical speed limits for different roads;

            test at different impact angles;
            drivers will take different forms of evasive action in a crash;

            test for impact with different objects;
            to see how their properties may affect the amount of damage / stress loading;

            to design better vehicles;
            which are safer in a range of different scenarios;                                       [2 max]


16.   Award [1] for a reason why stereo lithography (SLA) is classified as a 3D printing
      process and [1] for a brief explanation [2 max].

      a laser is used to print the pattern of the model by sintering a thin layer of heat-fusible
      powder;
      which gradually builds up the form of the model;                                                   [2]


17.   Award [1] for each distinct point in an explanation of two ways in which the use of rapid
      prototyping influences the design development cycle for a new product [3 max per
      way, 6 max].

      speed;
      rapid prototyping means that sophisticated models can be produced very quickly;
      so decisions can be taken about the final design more quickly than with the use of
      traditional modelling techniques;

      cost;
      although rapid prototyping can be expensive to produce;
      it often eliminates the need for other types of modelling;
      which reduces the overall cost of the cycle;

      user trial/expert appraisal;
      rapid prototype models allow potential users/experts to evaluate/test the design
      concept;
      resulting in feedback which can be used to improve the final design;                           [6 max]

18.   Award [1] for each distinct correct point in a discussion of three reasons why car
      manufacturers often use animation to promote new vehicles on their websites
      [3 max per reason, 9 max total].

      animation allows the consumer to view all angles of the vehicle as it rotates;
      so it gives a good overall impression of what the car looks like in reality;
      and its features;

      the consumer can control the speed of the animation;
      so they can study a particular angle/feature;
      and zoom in/out to see some features more closely;

      the animation can be linked to other aspects of the website;
      so the consumer can gain more detailed information from links/pull-down menus etc;
      in order to fully evaluate the vehicle’s suitability for them;

      animation is more interesting for consumers than static images;
      it can be used by sales people interacting with consumers in a car showroom to
      demonstrate features of the car;
      a skilled salesperson will concentrate on the features which the consumer is
      particularly interested in;

      raise the “sophistication” of the website;
      client has a better “opinion” of the company;
      increase customer satisfaction and potential sales;                                   [9 max]

      Do not award marks for television advertisement and/or design developments.

      (b)   Award [1] for one material characteristic of polyester that makes it suitable for the
            fleece jacket and [1] for a brief explanation [2 max].

            good thermal conductivity;
            a fleece jacket is usually worn outdoors in cold weather;

            washability;
            the jacket is likely to get dirty from use with outdoor activities and so needs to be
            easy to maintain;                                                                        [2 max]

      (c)   Award [1] for each of three distinct correct points in an explanation of one
            disadvantage of nylon for the lining of the jacket [3 max].

            nylon is not breathable;
            jacket will be worn outdoors and likely to be used when undertaking vigorous
            exercise;
            moisture / sweat will be trapped making the jacket uncomfortable / creating an
            unpleasant odour;                                                                            [3]

      (b)   Award [1] for stating why many felt military hats (berets) are made in one size
            only and [1] for a brief explanation [2 max].

            the material stretches;
            to enable the hat to accommodative some variation in head size/shape;                        [2]


21.   (a)   Award [1] for one reason why weaving is an appropriate technique to
            manufacture the prosthesis shown in Figure 2 and [1] for a brief explanation
            [2 max].

            woven products have good dimensional stability;
            so the product will not deform;                                                              [2]

      (b)   Award [1] for one reason why the design of textile vascular prostheses requires a
            large and diverse design team and [1] for a brief explanation [2 max].

22.   Award [1] for one reason why feedback is important when producing an intricate lace
      pattern in a CAD/CAM system and [1] for a brief explanation [2 max].

      quality control;
      threads in lace are very delicate and may break;

      if the design is too intricate for the CAM facility;
      feedback is required from the CAD part to prevent major errors in CAM manufacture
      from setting up;                                                                             [2 max]


23.   Award [1] for each distinct point in a comparison of mass customization with craft
      production in relation to value-for-money for a consumer wishing to purchase a one-off
      item of clothing [3 max per issue, 6 max].

      both processes allow for the individual requirements of the consumer in relation to
      fit/design;
      mass customization is usually cheaper as the system provides economies of scale;
      even for one-off production;

      craft production will be carried out by skilled craftsmen;
      who will have a wide range of skills;
      such craftsmen will be able to exploit the characteristics of a specific material in order
      to make the most of pattern/drape;

      CNC machines/CAM will carry out pre-programmed manufacturing techniques with
      mass customization;
      craftsmen will be able to employ a variety of manufacturing techniques to create a
      high-quality item;
      craft production has higher labour costs compared to mass customization;
      consumers who can afford to pay the high price for craft production will appreciate the
      quality and consider it better value-for-money;                                              [6 max]

24.   Award [1] for each distinct correct point in each of three reasons why the fashion
      industry for clothing developed rapidly in the 20th century [3 max per reason, 9 max
      total].

      technological improvements in manufacture;
      mass production of clothing was possible which made clothing items much less
      expensive;
      and so more affordable for ordinary people;

      technological improvements in transport;
      raw materials could be imported cheaply;
      and finished products exported cheaply;

      formation of large companies for manufacture/retailing;
      economies of scale could be achieved;
      creation of shops/stores in urban areas;

      expansion of advertising and other media;
      allowed for advertising campaigns to reach many people;
      and people were influenced by fashion shown in films;

      working women;
      in industrialized countries many women worked in factories;
      so had their own money to spend on products other than for the family;

      changing social attitudes;
      spending money to buy clothes to create more choice for consumers of what to wear
      for an occasion;
      became more acceptable/desirable;

      increasing relocation of factories to developing country locations;
      cheaper labour/costs;
      resulted in cheaper products;                                                            [9 max]

Option E — Human factors design

25.   (a)   Award [1] for stating the type of data scale represented by the comfort rating
            scale in Figure E1.

            ordinal;                                                                                   [1]

      (b)   Award [1] for why the responses from the user trial are qualitative and [1] for a
            brief explanation [2 max].

            responses are subjective / open to interpretation / based on users’ opinions;
            comfort relates to a number of different factors;                                          [2]

            N.B. comfort may be affected by factors such as body size, posture, size of chair
            etc.

      (c)   Award [1] for each of three distinct correct points in an explanation of why a
            designer might choose to represent qualitative information from the trial
            quantitatively [3 max].

            purely qualitative data can be difficult to analyse effectively;
            it may need to be converted to a form that can be more easily analysed;
            quantitative data is universally understood;
            allows for patterns and trends to be determined;
            data can be easily compared for different chair designs;                               [3 max]


26.   (a)   Award [1] for a definition of paper prototype in the context of developing the
            human/computer interface for a mobile phone to the effect of:

            paper version of the mobile phone interface that is manipulated by a person who
            does not explain how the interface works;                                                  [1]

      (b)   Award [1] for stating the role of the facilitator in a paper prototyping session and
            [1] for a brief explanation [2 max].

            Do not accept 5th–95th percentile or if 50th percentile is not explicitly mentioned.

      (b)   Award [1] for one reason for providing the ironing board in three different board
            widths and [1] for a brief explanation [2 max].

            types of clothes to be ironed;
            some clothes will fit the board better depending on the width;

            efficiency;
            more fabric can be ironed on a wider board/small board will take more time to
            iron wide fabrics;

            consumer choice;
            depending on ironing techniques/styles consumers can choose the board which
            best suits them;

            cost;
            the manufacturer can differentiate the cost of the boards based on size;

            reduced living/storage space;
            smaller boards required;                                                               [2 max]

            Do not accept any references to arm length.


28.   Award [1] for why accurate dynamic anthropometric data is difficult to obtain and [1] for
      a brief explanation [2 max].

      dynamic data relates to how people use products;
      people use products in different ways and the sample size in the test may not represent
      all aspects of the user population;                                                              [2]


29.   Award [1] for each distinct point in a suggestion of each of two ways in which human
      factors specialists determine adequate product safety [3 max per suggestion, 6 max].

      behavioural testing;
      perform some activity with the product/system;
      to understand the risks involved for users;

      conceptual testing;
      evaluate safety instructions/warning messages;
      without having to expose users to potentially hazardous conditions;

      fault analysis;
      examination of failures;
      leading to their elimination through re-design;                                              [6 max]

30.   Award [1] for each distinct correct point in each of three design constraints which might
      compromise the user interface for a new product [3 max per constraint, 9 max total].

      cost;
      a designer may not have the scope to include controls/features which would make the
      product easier to use;
      because the goal of the design brief is to design a cost-effective product which
      competes well in the market;

      aesthetics;
      the style of the product may dictate where controls/features are placed;
      in order for the product to stand out/appeal in the marketplace;

      inadequate user research to underpin the design;
      the designer may have overlooked important aspects of the user-interface;
      causing memory burden/lack of intuitiveness;

      spatial considerations;
      the space within which the interface must fit into the product;
      this may be too small to be easy to use;                                                    [9 max]
