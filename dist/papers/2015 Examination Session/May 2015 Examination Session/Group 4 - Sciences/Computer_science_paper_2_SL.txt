Option A — Databases

1.   A tourist has booked a double room, non-smoking, at the Overlook Hotel. The tourist used
     an online booking service called Best Fare that compares offers from different hotels.

     Best Fare confirms the transaction by communicating only the booking code 3EP9RE to
     the tourist. The tourist later receives an email from the hotel, with further details.

     (a)   Outline the difference between data and information, in relation to the booking code.     [2]

     (b)   Define the term database transaction.                                                     [2]

     (c)   Describe the use of transactions to maintain data consistency.                            [3]

     (d)   Explain what is meant by isolation in the transaction described above.                    [2]

     (e)   Explain the benefits offered by data sharing in databases, for two of the stakeholders
           in this scenario.                                                                         [6]


2.   An information system is used to manage the pharmacy of a hospital.  It includes the
     database that contains the availability of different types of medicine.  Data on patients who
     are taking specific medicines are also stored in the database.

     The database can be used by the database administrator, internal hospital staff and also the
     staff of nearby hospitals.

     (a)   Outline the role of a database administrator, in the hospital.                            [2]

     (b)   Outline what is meant by a data dictionary.                                               [2]

     (c)   Discuss why the view of the database is different for different users in this scenario.   [6]

Option B — Modelling and simulation

4.   A specific type of fish lives and breeds in a lake.  It is important that the fish population in the
     lake has stability and does not decrease too much.

     Each year people who want to fish from the lake are issued licences under the following
     conditions.

     • The estimated number of fish in the lake has not fallen by more than 5 % over the last
       five years.
     • The estimated average length of fish is greater than 20 cm.

     These estimates are based on samples taken throughout the year from random sections of
     the lake.

     (a)   Outline the steps involved in combining and recording the results from five separate
           samples taken from the lake in one year.                                                         [4]

     (b)   Identify the variables needed to create a model that can be used to decide whether or
           not licences should be issued.                                                                   [2]

     (c)   Explain how the model from part (b) could be constructed and used.  You should make
           reference to specific software with which you are familiar.                                      [3]

     People who want to fish have complained that the model is not working and that often they
     are denied licences unnecessarily.  At the same time, a protest group is complaining that too
     many fish are being taken out of the lake.

     (d)   Discuss how the model may be tested and corrected if necessary.                                  [6]


5.   Climate is cyclical as well as being affected by other factors.

     (a)   Identify four factors that could be used to define the current weather in a particular
           area on a particular day.                                                                        [2]

     (b)   Suggest how values for these factors could be presented to show weather patterns
           over one year.                                                                                   [3]

     One aspect of climate change is displacement; for example, summer weather beginning later
     than in previous years.

     (c)   Outline how a computer system could be used to detect displacement trends in climate
           change.		                                                                                        [4]

     (d)   Discuss the advantages and disadvantages of using the results from a computer
           simulation to predict long term climate change.                                                  [6]

6.   Computer gaming, whether alone or as part of an online group, is increasingly popular.  
     With realistic graphics, players become involved in simulated virtual worlds.

     (a)   Define the term visualization.                                                             [2]

     (b)   With reference to lighting and rendering, outline how an image held in memory can be
           shown on screen as a realistic 3D image.                                                   [5]

     (c)   Outline the specifications of the software and hardware required to run a successful
           online game simulation on a home computer.                                                 [3]

     (d)   Discuss the advantages and disadvantages of participating in a simulated world of
           online gaming.                                                                             [5]

Option C — Web science

7.   (a)   Outline the principal difference between HTML and HTTP.                                   [2]

     Consider the section of XML code shown below:

  <bird>
		 <name>Eagle Owl</name>
		 <species>Bubo bubo</species>
		 <description>An owl the size of an eagle</description>
		<habitat>Forests</habitat>
  </bird>

     (b)   Identify one similarity between HTML and XML.                                             [1]

     One of the characteristics of XML code is its ability to describe data.

     (c)   By making direct reference to the XML code above, outline one way in which this
           characteristic is shown.                                                                  [2]

     The XML code, above, is sent via the HTTP protocol from a client to a server where it is used
     to update a database.

     (d)   Describe how the structure of XML code allows data to be used to update a database.       [2]

     When a user enters a URL into the search bar of the browser the URL will normally be sent
     to a domain name server.

     (e)   Identify the two possible actions that this domain name server will then take.            [2]

     Protocols and standards are essential features of the successful operation and development
     of the web.

     (f)   (i)    Distinguish between the terms protocol and standard.                               [2]

           (ii)   With specific references to one protocol and one standard, discuss the
                  consequences if they did not exist.                                                [6]

8.   The PageRank algorithm is used by Google’s search engine.

     (a)   Identify the specific purpose of the PageRank algorithm.                                     [2]

     A page has more chance of being listed on the first page of a Google search if it has many
     links coming into it from other websites.

     Page A links to Page B as shown in the diagram below.  The arrows represent some of the
     links from the two pages.

     (b)   Identify two factors that will determine the effect that the link from Page A will have on
           the PageRank of Page B.                                                                      [2]

     (c)   Describe why the use of meta-tags might not always return the results expected by a
           search query.                                                                                [2]

     (d)   Explain, with the use of three examples, how black hat search engine optimization tries

Option D — Object-oriented programming

A library in a college loans books to students.

The current book borrowing system, which was developed years ago, is prone to error.  You are a
member of the new program development team which has decided to develop a system using an
object-oriented programming (OOP) approach.  The team will be divided into small sub-groups.

The program development team is aware of the following user requirements.

• Certain books are classified as short term and can only be borrowed for 5 days.  Other books
  are classified as long term and can be borrowed for 30 days.
• Fines are charged at a rate of $1.50 for each day that a short term book is overdue.
• Fines are charged at a rate of 10 cents for each day that a long term book is overdue.
• If the overdue period exceeds 4 days for any short term loan book students are not allowed to
  borrow any more books and their borrowing rights are suspended; this does not apply for long
  term book loans.
• Students can borrow a total of 10 books.

10.   (a)   Outline two advantages that the programming team should expect from using an OOP
            approach.		                                                                           [4]

      (b)   Explain two ethical issues which should be taken into account when working on
            the project.		                                                                        [4]

(Option D, question 10 continued)

     Following some analysis, the team determined that the Loan and Student classes will be
     used.  Part of the Student class is shown below.

      import java.util.*;
      public class Student
      {
     		private int studentID;
     		private String studentName;
     		private Loan[] booksBorrowed = new Loan[10];
     		private int numBooks = 0;
     		public Student(int studentID, String studentName)
     		{
     			this.studentID=studentID;
     			this.studentName=studentName;
     		}
     		public Loan getLoan (int x)
     		{
     			return this.booksBorrowed[x];
     		}
     		public void addLoan(Loan book)
     		{
     			this.booksBorrowed[numBooks] = book;
     			numBooks++;
     		}
     		public int getStudentID()
     		{
     			return this.studentID;
     		}
     		public String getStudentName()
     		{
     			return this.studentName;
     		}
      }

     When creating objects, encapsulation is an important design consideration.

     (c)   Outline, with direct reference to the Student class, how security can be enhanced by
           using encapsulation.                                                                     [3]

     To use the Student class in a program an object has to be created or instantiated.

     (d)   Construct a statement to create a Student object for a student with an ID of 93003
           and a name of “Smith”.                                                                   [2]

     The basic Loan class is shown below.  Every time a book is borrowed, an instance of the
     Loan class is created.  In the Student class, the books borrowed by a single student are
     stored in an array called booksBorrowed.

  import java.util.*;
  public class Loan
  {
		  private int bookID;
		  private String bookTitle;
		  private Date d;
		  static int numBooksLoaned = 0;
		  public Loan(int bookID, String bookTitle)
		{
			 this.bookID = bookID;
			 this.bookTitle = bookTitle;
			 this.d = new Date(); //set date borrowed
			 numBooksLoaned = numBooksLoaned +1;
		}
		  public int getBookID()
		{
			return this.bookID;
		}
		  public String getBookTitle()
		{
			return this.bookTitle;
		}
		  public Date getDate()
		{
			return this.d;
		}
		  public void setBookID(int id)
		{
			 this.bookID = id;
		}
		  public void setBookTitle(String title)
		{
			 this.bookTitle = title;
		}
		  public void setDate(Date d)
		{
			 this.d = d;
		}
  }

     Note the use of the keyword static in the statement static int numBooksLoaned = 0
     and that this term is not used in the other variable declarations.

     (e)   Explain the use of the term static for the variable numBooksLoaned in the Loan class.   [3]

     (f)   Construct the code needed to add a loan with a book ID of 212000 and a book title of
           “The Stars” to a Student object, ST.                                                    [3]

11.   In order to store each Student object the team has decided to use the borrowers array of
      type Student.  The team has also decided to use the student’s ID as the index into the array.  
      For example, a Student object with a student ID of 1111 would have its reference stored in
      position 1111 of the array.

      Consider the code fragment below which would appear in a suitably constructed main class.

      public static void main(String[] args)
      {
           Student temp;
           Student[] borrowers = new Student[100000];

            temp = new Student(93001, "Jones");
            temp.addLoan(new Loan(210001,"The Sky"));
            borrowers[93001] = temp;

            temp = new Student(3012, "Zang");
            temp.addLoan(new Loan(210121, "The Animals"));
            borrowers[3012] = temp;

            borrowers[93001].addLoan(new Loan(210002, "The Spooks"));

            temp = new Student(93002, "Nguyen");
            temp.addLoan(new Loan(210011, "The Ocean"));
            borrowers[93002] = temp;

            System.out.println(borrowers[93001].getStudentName());
            System.out.println(borrowers[93001].getLoan(1).getBookTitle());
            System.out.println(borrowers[3012].getLoan(0).getBookTitle());
      }

      (a)   Determine the output from the following statements.

		(i)             System.out.println(borrowers[93001].getStudentName());                                 [1]

		(ii)            System.out.println(borrowers[93001].getLoan(1).getBookTitle());                        [1]

		(iii)           System.out.println(borrowers[3012].getLoan(0).getBookTitle());                         [1]

      The librarian requires a display of the student name, the titles of the books and the dates that
      they were borrowed, corresponding to a specific student ID.

      (b)   Construct the method showDetails() that could be used in the main class,
            which accepts a student ID as a parameter, and then uses this to access the
            appropriate Student object producing the desired output as indicated above.                  [7]

      (c)   State three aspects of the user requirements that are not addressed by the current
            design.                                                                                      [3]

      (d)   Describe a modification to the Student class that would address one of the missing
            requirements.                                                                                [2]

12.   The team has decided to use inheritance in its design.

      (a)   Describe one benefit that inheritance brings to OOP.                                    [2]

      Two sub-classes will be created: shortTerm and longTerm.

      (b)   State two additional attributes that each shortTerm object should have.                 [2]

      (c)   Construct a suitable UML diagram showing the relationships between the Student
            class, the Loan superclass and the two sub-classes. Note: there is no need to include
            the attributes or methods of each class.                                                [4]

      (d)   Outline, using an OOP technique, how the total number of books on loan could be
            displayed without processing the borrowers array.                                       [3]
