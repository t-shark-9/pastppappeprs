Critical Thinking – explanation, analysis and evaluation

These trigger words often signal critical thinking. The bold words are the key terms in the various
criteria.
Explanation – Because, as a result of, due to, therefore, consequently, for example
Analysis – Furthermore, additionally, however, but, conversely, likewise, in addition, on the other hand,
whereas
Evaluation ‫ –ؘ‬My opinion, overall, although, despite, on balance, weighing up

Examiners should be aware that in some cases, candidates may take a different approach, which if
appropriate should be rewarded. If in doubt, check with your Team Leader.

If candidates answer more than the prescribed number of questions:

• In the case of an “identify” question read all answers and mark positively up to the maximum marks.
  Disregard incorrect answers.

• In the case of a “describe” question, which asks for a certain number of facts eg “describe two kinds”,
  mark the first two correct answers. This could include two descriptions, one description and
  one identification, or two identifications.

• In the case of an “explain” question, which asks for a specified number of explanations eg “explain
  two reasons”, mark the first two correct answers. This could include two full explanations,
  one explanation, one partial explanation etc.

1.   (a)   Identify two characteristics of software as a service (SaaS).                        [2]

           Answers may include:
            • Network-based access to, and management of, commercially available
               software.
            • Activities managed from central locations, e.g. in the cloud, rather than at
               each customer’s site.
            • Enabling customers to access applications remotely via the web.
            • Customers usually pay by subscription (on demand), e.g., monthly
               payments.
            • Is easy for scalability.
            • No additional hardware required by customer to install.
            • Updates are applied automatically without customer intervention.
            • External provider hosts the application/software.

           Award [1] for identifying each characteristic of SaaS, up to a maximum of [2].

     (b)   Outline one reason why facial recognition applications are preferred to other
           types of biometric software.                                                         [2]

           Answers may include:
            • Uses a camera, and many devices already have one embedded, no
               specialist equipment needed.
            • Less intrusive, as you don’t have to physically touch any hardware to detect
               your face.
            • More convenient as you don’t need to remove items e.g. gloves for
               fingerprints, but just face the camera.
            • Capture of the face is quicker, as the camera just needs to take a photo
               which is then matched against the database.
            • More Universal as everyone has facial print, but not everyone has a
               fingerprint.
            • Face print is less prone to damage as it uses nodes of the face as opposed
               to fingerprints or iris, which damage can prevent reading.

           Award [1] for identifying a reason why the facial recognition is preferred and [1]
           for a development of that reason, up to maximum of [2].
                                                  –5–                  N20/3/ITGSX/HP3/ENG/TZ0/XX/M


2.   FaceToFace has been informed by their clients that their facial recognition application
     does not always correctly them.

     Explain two reasons why this might be the case.                                              [6]

     Answers may include (Note: the two clusters are from different perspectives – each
     cluster needs three ideas, ie, one initial statement and two developments):

     Factors relating to the capture –
       • Size and quality of image captured.
       • Camera angle in capturing the image to be processed.
       • Might not capture all of the required features / lighting conditions.
       • Poor maintenance of the camera may lower the quality of the image captured.

     Factors relating to the person being captured –
       • e.g., Wearing scarf/glasses.
       • Recent facial changes, eg, tattoo.
       • Deliberate attempts to conceal the face.
       • e.g., looking down wearing a cap, masks, make up.
          (Will impact on the ability for the algorithms to identify the key facial features to
          be matched, therefore, it may not be possible to make a match.)
      • People with similar facial features and metrics e.g. twins.
      • Natural changes in the face, due to ageing and losing weight.
      • Changes in facial hair – AI in modern FR systems can recognise someone with or
          without a beard, but older systems may not.

     Issues with the programme:
       • Bias introduced by the programmer.
       • Algorithms – the programming of the algorithm and how it is written.
       • Training data used – the size and quality of the database that stores the training
          data impacts the ability to compare the new image.
       • False positives – an image is matched up to an image in the database, but it is
          incorrect.
       • False negatives – an image is not matched up but should be.

     Award [1] for identifying a reason why the facial recognition application does not
     correctly identify a person and [1] for each development of that reason, up to a
     maximum of [3].
     Mark as [3] + [3].

3.   Sandra wants to create an ethical framework for FaceToFace. Based on her research,
     she is considering using the ACM Code of Ethics and the ACTIVE ethics framework as
     a starting point.

     Discuss whether Sandra should use ethical frameworks like the ACM Code of Ethics or
     ACTIVE ethics to help her create an ethical framework for FaceToFace.                       [8]

     The student may approach this in two ways. They may look at the appropriateness of
     applying a specific framework or they may compare the two frameworks.
     The ACM Code of Ethics or ACTIVE ethics is appropriate:
       • It is a general, standard approach that can be applied to any organisation.
       • It is easier to train staff on a standard approach, as they may have had to follow it
           in a previous job.
       • Employees who come from similar organisations will already be familiar with
           these codes and/or frameworks, adapting easily to the ethical position of
           FaceToFace.
       • Will reassure customers that the company is following a recognised framework.
       • Provides transparency to stakeholders of ethical use.

     Reasons why The ACM Code of Ethics or ACTIVE ethics is not appropriate:
      • People may not agree on which approach to base their ethical standard. Each
         approach has a different emphasis.
      • Decision makers may not agree on the interpretation of the ethics. They may not
         all agree to the same set of human and civil rights.
      • Decision makers may not agree on what constitutes the common good. They
         may not even agree on what is a good and what is a harm.
      • The different approaches may give different outcomes, so how would they
         choose which one to use?
      • How would a system be put in place to evaluate and reflect on the actions taken
         and learn from them?
      • The student may apply a number of these ethics and how they would or would
         not be appropriate.
      • The statements are very general, e.g., “avoid harm” in the ACM documentation.

4.   Discuss whether the benefits to South-East Asia Coffee Shops (SEACS) of introducing
     the facial recognition application outweigh the potential privacy, anonymity, consent
     and surveillance concerns.                                                               [12]

     Opportunities for SEACS may include:
      • Accuracy of customer recognition can give the benefits of a more customized
         service by the staff.
      • Staff turnover or part-time staff will no longer impact on the ability to provide a
         customized service.
      • Recognizing and identifying existing customers can speed up the time to take
         orders and reduce waiting time in the queue.
      • Reduces loyalty card fraud, users can not borrow friends’ cards to gain discounts
      • The ease of use and seamless integration with the POS could encourage
         customer loyalty.
      • The customer loyalty scheme will be easily administered/automated bringing
         benefits to the coffee shop which include:
      • administration of promotions and perks for customers
      • analysis of orders – can help with menu options, stock decisions.
      • Improvement of security – facial recognition could be extended to be used as a
         security feature for the coffee shop, by linking with a security system and using
         the same cameras.
      • Facial recognition could be extended to be used by the owners to monitor staff
         attendance, which could be taken on entering and leaving the premises.

     Issues caused by privacy, anonymity, consent and surveillance may include:
       • SEACS will need to develop (write, implement and share) policies to protect
          customers’ privacy.
       • SEACS may be taken to court for breach of privacy if policies do not meet
          government requirements.
       • SEACS may be liable for breach of privacy if staff do not follow the guidelines
          when operating the POS.
       • SEACS will need to develop the facial recognition system so that privacy is not
          breached. This may include:
       • clear signage and information about the FR system, before entering the coffee
          shop/while in the coffee shop
       • the ability to opt out at any time and for staff to be able to update the database
          accordingly
       • an opportunity for customers to not have their images stored
       • an ability for customers to authenticate the consent, eg, a signature.
       • Customers may choose not to use the coffee shop for fear of surveillance.
       • Customers may choose not to use the coffee shop if they do not trust SEACS to
          keep the data secure and used only for the original purpose.
       • SEACS will need to make sure that the security of their system does not get
          breached and unauthorized users do not have access to the customer database
          including their personal details.
       • Hackers could potentially use the FR data to replicate people’s faces and use this
          to access other systems (privacy linked with identify theft).
       • If customers request anonymity but still wish to be a member of the loyalty
          scheme, they may have to run both the original card-based system as well as the
          FR one.
