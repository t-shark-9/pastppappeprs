1.   (a)   Analyse reasons for the recent and widespread rise of anti-immigration                      [12]
           movements.

           Marks should be allocated according to the markbands on pages 3 to 4.

           Anti-immigration movements take many forms in different countries and contexts.
           Recently, many different local movements have developed globally (eg, from
           Australia to South Africa). In Europe there is a loose international alliance of localist
           movements. Reasons differ from context to context and encompass economic
           (work), social (housing) and cultural (religious) issues, amongst many others.

           Possible reasons for the recent and widespread rise of anti-immigration
           movements:
           • Recent cultural and religious changes that are linked with increased cultural diversity.
           • Economic issues, including the availability of work.
           • Increasing numbers of people on the move for various physical, economic, demographic
             and political reasons.
           • Widespread pressures on governments around the world in relation to the refugee crisis.
           • Recent political concerns linked with terrorism and radicalization, and the actions of
             powerful governments/personalities that may fuel anti-immigration sentiments.
           • The use of social media to promote anti-immigration messages.
           • The recent tension between nationalism/localism and increased globalization.

           Good answers may apply (AO2) a wider range of knowledge and understanding
           (AO1) in a well-structured way (AO4). One approach might be to provide a
           structured systematic analysis of the different possible reasons that explain the
           recent rise in migration and resistance to it, drawing on contemporary evidence.
           Another approach might be to analyse the widespread / global nature of these
           movements, and the common themes that help explain their existence (weaker
           responses will focus on case studies in an ‘episodic’ way and will neglect to
           address the ‘widespread’ spatial manifestation of the issues they describe).

           For 4–6 marks, expect some weakly evidenced outlining of one or two reasons
           why anti-immigration movements exist.

           For 7–9 marks, expect a structured, evidenced analysis of:
           • either a range of reasons (two or more) why anti-immigration movements have
             arisen recently
           • or reasons for the widespread occurrence of anti-immigration movements in
             many different contexts.

           For 10–12 marks, expect both of these traits.

(b)   Discuss ways in which global financial flows can be affected by the actions of governments.
                                                                                              [16]

      Credit all content in line with the markbands. Marks should be allocated according
      to the markbands on pages 5 to 6. Credit unexpected approaches wherever
      relevant.

      Financial flows include trade, capital movements, aid and debt payments and
      remittances. These flows can be increased or decreased according to the political
      frameworks they must operate in at varying scales. Governments may be
      national but there are also local governments and multi-governmental
      organizations to consider too. Actions include incentives but also penalties and
      sanctions.

      Possible applied themes (AO2) include knowledge and understanding (AO1) of:
      • The political opening-up of emerging economies (India, China) with new markets for
        exploitation.
      • National investment rules and laws that allow TNCs to deploy (or not) financial strategies
        such as mergers and acquisitions and joint ventures.
      • Political actions to establish lower production costs for TNCs in export processing zones.
      • MGOs creating the opportunity to operate within trading blocs with low tariff barriers.
      • Political decisions by governments to opt out of globalization / global data flows (eg, US
        technology companies cannot invest or sell their services easily in China).
      • Political decisions by governments to provide aid and loans.
      • Political decisions by governments affecting migration, which in turn fosters
        remittances.

      Good answers may synthesize (AO3a) three or more of the above (or other)
      themes in a well-structured way (AO4).

      Good answers may additionally offer a critical evaluation (AO3b) of the
      statement, which discusses how government actions connect and interact with
      the financial decisions of other stakeholder eg TNCs. Another approach might be
      to critically discuss how financial flows linking particular places might be either
      increased or decreased. Another approach might be to discuss the relative
      importance of government actions at different scales. A good discussion may
      conclude with a substantiated final judgement on the relative importance or
      significance of different kinds of action.

      Do not over-credit a detailed discussion of the actions of non-governmental stakeholders
      (TNCs, NGOs, etc.) unless the account is logically linked with government actions and
      attitudes (e.g. discussion of how governments allow or disallow FDI, free trade etc.).

      For 5–8 marks, expect weakly evidenced and/or imbalanced outlining of two or
      three relevant themes.


      For 9–12 marks, expect:
      • either a structured synthesis that links together several well-evidenced themes
        from the Guide
      • or a critical conclusion (or ongoing evaluation) informed by geographical
        concepts and/or perspectives.

      For 13–16 marks, expect both of these traits.

2.   (a)   Explain how two new technologies can be used to manage risks created by global flows of
           data and/or people.                                                                   [12]

           Marks should be allocated according to the markbands on pages 3 to 4.

           A new technology is most likely a digital technology developed in the last few
           decades, ideally in the student’s own lifetime. Steam trains should not be
           regarded as new in the context of this question. The Subject Guide requires study
           of drones, 3D printing, crowd-sourcing technology, cybersecurity measures and
           e-passports. Global flows of people and data generate risks; new technologies
           can help mitigate these risks.

           Possible uses of new technologies:
           • Cybersecurity measures are increasingly used to monitor data flows for signs of terrorist
             activity, etc.
           • E-passports help establish the identity of migrants as record numbers of people move.
           • GIS / satellite technology helps identify illegal activities (movements of people, people
             trafficking etc).
           • Drones can help find people moving away from disaster zones, etc.
           • Credit any technology that can be linked in a valid way to relevant global flows.
           • Credit any valid attempt to link a new technology with the management of a
             pandemic caused by movements of people.

           Good answers may apply (AO2) a wider range of knowledge and understanding
           (AO1) in a well-structured way (AO4). One approach might be to provide a
           structured, systematic analysis of how each technology helps mitigate/manage
           risk. Another approach might be to analyse the nature of the risks that are
           associated with these global flows in different located contexts.

           For 4–6 marks, expect some weakly evidenced outlining of the way one or two
           technologies can help manage people/data/risks.

           For 7–9 marks, expect a structured, evidenced analysis of:
           • either the way two technologies can be used to manage people and/or data
           • or the way risks are mitigated/managed by the two technologies.

           For 10–12 marks, expect both of these traits.

(b)   “Physical factors are the main reason why cultural diversity varies from place to place.”
      Discuss this statement.                                                                       [16]
      Credit all content in line with the markbands. Marks should be allocated
      according to the markbands on pages 5 to 6. Credit unexpected approaches
      wherever relevant.
      Possible applied themes (AO2) include knowledge and understanding (AO1) of:
      • what is meant by cultural diversity and cultural traits
      • the role of migration and diasporas in giving rise to diversity
      • the geography of physically isolated areas (island states, remote and hard-to-reach rural
         areas)
      • political factors affecting cultural diversity and cultural isolation (eg, migration rules)
      • historical factors responsible for cultural diversity/homogeneity eg, colonialism
      • shrinking world / spread of global culture and the lessening of diversity in
         some places eg, loss of languages.

      Good answers may synthesize (AO3a) three of more of the above (or other)
      themes in a well-structured (AO4) way.

      Good answers may additionally offer a critical evaluation (AO3b) of the
      statement, which discusses its veracity at different scales or for different contexts
      (local, rural, urban, national). Another approach might be to critically discuss
      different perspectives on what cultural diversity means, eg dimensions of
      language/religion/ethnicity, and the extent to which physical factors/isolation
      could affect each of these dimensions. A good discussion may conclude with a
      substantiated final judgement on the relative importance or significance of
      physical factors.

      For 5–8 marks, expect weakly evidenced and/or imbalanced outlining of two or
      three relevant themes.

      For 9–12 marks, expect:
      • either a structured synthesis that links together several well-evidenced themes
        from the Guide, including one physical factor.
      • or a critical conclusion (or ongoing evaluation) informed by geographical
        concepts and/or perspectives.

      For 13–16 marks, expect both of these traits.

3.   (a)   Analyse the scale and severity of the challenges created by transboundary pollution (TBP).
                                                                                                   [12]

           Marks should be allocated according to the markbands on pages 3 to 4.

           Transboundary pollution may be a short-lived event or more pervasive problem
           involving movements of polluted bodies of air or water across national
           boundaries.

           Possible themes include:
           • The scale may vary from relatively localized issues affecting border areas, eg
             transboundary aquifers, to problems affecting entire world regions, eg smoke from forest
             fires in Indonesia affecting southeast Asia.
           • Some pollution events have global-scale impacts, eg Fukuyama isotopes crossing the
             Pacific.
           • Acid rain is a commonly occurring issue.
           • Carbon emissions and climate change are valid themes in this context.
           • The severity of any challenges is determined by the type of pollution and the scale/nature
             of the area affected and the vulnerability of people/places.
           • Political challenges include arriving at stakeholder agreement on any action.

           Good answers may apply (AO2) a wider range of knowledge and understanding
           (AO1) in a well-structured way (AO4). One approach might be to provide a
           structured systematic analysis of the severity of different types of challenges
           (environmental to political). Another approach might be to analyse the varying
           scale of each challenge (mortality may be relatively localized, with weaker
           dispersed effects evident on a larger scale).

           Full marks may be obtained through use of a single case study provided there is
           sufficient analysis of the varying scale and severity of the associated challenges.

           For 4–6 marks, expect some weakly evidenced outlining of one or two problems
           / challenges / impacts.

           For 7–9 marks, expect a structured, well-evidenced analysis of:
           • either a range of challenges created by one or more types of TBP
           • or the varying severity and geographical scale of different TBP challenges.

           For 10–12 marks, expect both of these traits.
                                           – 12 –              N20/3/GEOGR/HP3/ENG/TZ0/XX/M


(b)   Discuss the economic challenges that global interactions have created for different countries
      and communities.                                                                          [16]

      Credit all content in line with the markbands. Marks should be allocated according to
      the markbands on pages 5 to 6. Credit unexpected approaches wherever relevant.

      Possible applied themes (AO2) include knowledge and understanding (AO1) of:
      • economic migration and its impacts on job availability
      • global shift and deindustrialization in high-income countries
      • negative economic consequences of outsourcing/offshoring for industrializing countries
        and communities, eg low rates of pay
      • tax avoidance by large corporations and offshoring of profits
      • the management of social and spatial inequalities which have grown in part
        because of global interactions / global shift.

      Good answers may synthesize (AO3a) three ofrmore of the above (or other)
      themes in a well-structured (AO4) way.

      Good answers may additionally offer a critical evaluation (AO3b) of the statement,
      which discusses how the challenges are most severe in particular places and at certain
      scales (eg, US Rust Belt state populations have suffered more than other areas of the
      US). Another approach might be to discuss how challenges lessen or become more
      severe over a longer timescale (eg, post-industrial cities in high-income countries have
      been redeveloped and regenerated on account of global shift). A good discussion might
      conclude with a substantiated final judgement on the relative severity of different
      economic challenges.

      For 5–8 marks, expect weakly evidenced outlining of two or three relevant themes.

      For 9–12 marks, expect:
      • either a structured synthesis that links together several well-evidenced themes
        from the Guide
      • or a critical conclusion (or on going evaluation) informed by geographical
        concepts and/or perspectives.

      For 13–16 marks, expect both of these traits.
