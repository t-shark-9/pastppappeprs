Apply the markbands that provide the “best fit” to the responses given and award credit wherever it is
possible to do so. If an answer indicates that the demands of the question are understood and
addressed but that not all implications are considered (for example, compare or contrast; reasons
or significance; methods or success), then examiners should not be afraid of using the full range of
marks allowed for by the markscheme. Responses that offer good coverage of some of the criteria
should be rewarded accordingly.

Section 1: Trade and exchange: The Silk Road in the medieval world (750–1500)

1.   “The Silk Road developed because the Tang emperors wanted increased foreign trade.” Discuss.

     The question requires that candidates offer a considered and balanced review of the statement
     that the Silk Road developed because the Tang emperors wanted increased foreign trade.
     Candidates may discuss the nature of the Tang Dynasty and, in particular, that it was strong and
     open to foreign trade and ideas. This openness had led to a greater understanding of the outside
     world and more confidence in developing foreign relations with other countries. Candidates may
     also argue that it was the success of the military campaigns that led to far-reaching trade routes.
     Candidates may challenge the assumption in the question and suggest that the Tang wanted
     political and military control of these areas and trade was a means to achieve this. They could
     also argue that the stability of neighbouring states was an important factor in the Silk Road’s
     development. Candidates’ opinions or conclusions will be presented clearly and supported by
     appropriate evidence.


2.   “Political integration was the most significant result of the Silk Road.” To what extent do you agree
     with this statement?

     The question requires that candidates consider the merits or otherwise of the statement that political
     integration was the most significant result of the Silk Road. Candidates may refer to the ways in
     which Mongol expansion brought political stability to the region. The revival of Samarkand as the
     trade, cultural and political centre of the Islamic world was key to this integration. Political unity was
     developed through tolerance towards different religious groups and the Mongols were prepared to
     use force to maintain peace in the longer term. Candidates may challenge the assumption in the
     question and argue that there were other more significant results of the Silk Road. These could
     include cultural interaction and the transmission of new ideas. Candidates’ opinions or conclusions
     will be presented clearly and supported by appropriate evidence.
                                                 –5–                 N20/3/HISTX/HP3/ENG/TZ0/OC/M


Section 2: Japan in the Age of the Samurai (1180–1333)

3.   Evaluate the impact of the samurai on Japanese society and culture.

     The question requires that candidates make an appraisal of the impact of the samurai on Japanese
     society and culture. Candidates may argue that the samurai were held in high regard in Japanese
     society because they were seen as honourable. The ideas of the Bushido Code, particularly those
     of honesty and respect, became highly influential and valued in Japanese society. The Emperor’s
     power declined in this period and essentially the samurai dominated the government, which in turn
     gave them increased status and power in society. Candidates may challenge the assumption in the
     question and argue that other factors, such as Confucianism, had a greater impact on Japanese
     society and culture. Candidates’ opinions or conclusions will be presented clearly and supported by
     appropriate evidence.


4.   “The failure of the Mongol invasions demonstrated the military strength of Japan.” To what extent
     do you agree with this statement?

     The question requires that candidates consider the merits or otherwise of the statement that the
     failure of the Mongol invasions demonstrated the military strength of Japan. Candidates may
     challenge the assumption in the question and argue that the first invasion actually showed
     Japanese weaknesses, but may then go on to argue that by the second invasion the Japanese
     military had successfully adapted to effectively fight the Mongol invaders. The Japanese were
     outnumbered in the first invasion and inexperienced in methods of warfare different to their own.
     By the second invasion, they had constructed large forts and developed new effective tactics.
     Candidates may also challenge the question by arguing that it was only the typhoon winds that
     saved the Japanese in both invasions. Candidates’ opinions or conclusions will be presented
     clearly and supported by appropriate evidence.
                                                 –6–                  N20/3/HISTX/HP3/ENG/TZ0/OC/M


Section 3: Exploration, trade and interaction in East Asia and South-East Asia (1405–1700)

5.   “The impact of European settlements on the indigenous people was entirely negative.” Discuss.

     The question requires that candidates offer a considered and balanced review of the statement
     that the impact of European settlements on the indigenous people was entirely negative.
     Candidates may refer to the ways the missionaries often undermined local beliefs and traditions.
     They may discuss the ways European culture and language was forced onto local populations.
     Negative economic impacts such as the exploitation of local resources and high taxation may be
     addressed. Candidates may give examples of localized resistance as evidence of the anger felt
     amongst indigenous people of their exploitation. There should be some attempt to present balance
     in the response and candidates may argue that developments in transportation, communications,
     trade and medicine could be seen as positive. Candidates’ opinions or conclusions will be
     presented clearly and supported by appropriate evidence.


6.   Evaluate the social and economic impact of Japan “turning in”.

     The question requires that candidates make an appraisal of the impact of the social and economic
     impact of Japan “turning in”. Candidates may refer to how this led to long periods of peace and
     stability with few internal divisions; however, this peace actually served to undermine the social
     status of the samurai. Candidates may also argue that, by “turning in”, Japanese culture and ideas
     were protected and not affected by outside influences aside from Dutch Learning, which only had
     limited impact on Japanese society. However, it may be argued that “turning in” also limited
     Japanese developments in trade, warfare and technology and that this made Japan more
     vulnerable to foreign invaders in the long term as it fell behind the development of western powers.
     Candidates’ opinions or conclusions will be presented clearly and supported by appropriate
     evidence.

Section 4: The rise and fall of the Mughal Empire (1526–1712)

7.   Discuss the reasons for, and effects of, domestic opposition to Mughal rule in India.

     The question requires that candidates offer a considered and balanced review of the reasons for,
     and effects of, domestic opposition to the Mughal rule. Candidates may offer equal coverage of
     reasons and effects, or they may prioritize their discussion of one of these aspects. However,
     both aspects will be a feature of the response. The reasons given for opposition may include the
     imposition of taxes on non-Muslims, the often autocratic and authoritarian rule by Mughals and
     their inability to placate the Marathas, leading to excessive warfare. Candidates may refer to the
     fact that initially the Rajputs and other Hindus opposed the Mughals, as they were perceived as
     foreigners. The effects may include a discussion of political and financial instability as well as
     religious tensions. Court in-fighting also led to the creation of successor states. Candidates’
     opinions or conclusions will be presented clearly and supported by appropriate evidence.


8.   Evaluate the economic and cultural achievements of the Mughal Empire during the reign of
     Shah Jahan I (1628–1658).

     The question requires that candidates make an appraisal of the reign of Shah Jahan I (1628–1658)
     and his economic and cultural achievements. Candidates may offer equal coverage of economic and
     cultural achievements, or they may prioritize their examination of one of these aspects. However,
     both aspects will be a feature of the response. Candidates may refer to architectural wonders, such
     as the Taj Mahal, Red Fort and Jama Masjid, and developments in miniature painting, textiles and
     Islamic calligraphy. Candidates may also discuss religious toleration during his reign. In terms of
     economic achievements, candidates may discuss how the Gross Domestic Product was high during
     his rule and coinage advanced to new levels. Other relevant interrelationships may be considered,
     for example the conditions of workers and peasants, but with a focus on the issue in the question.
     Candidates’ opinions or conclusions will be presented clearly and supported by appropriate
     evidence.

Section 5: Colonialism and the development of nationalism in South-East Asia (c1750–1914)

9.    Compare and contrast the colonial systems in the Dutch East Indies and French Indo-China.

      The question requires that candidates give an account of the similarities and differences between
      colonial systems in the Dutch East Indies and French Indo-China, referring to both throughout.
      There does not need to be an equal number of each. Candidates may refer to the assimilation, or
      not, of local culture by the colonists, changes in governance, political practices as well as
      economic, social and religious policies of the colonists. Rigid social hierarchy existed between the
      colonists and the locals. Both colonial governments implemented forced cultivation and
      economically exploited their colonies, leading to a drain of wealth and in some cases famine.
      However, the Dutch introduced the Ethical Policy in 1901 which, to an extent, did consider the
      welfare of the locals. The French in the same year introduced corvée or unpaid labour. Candidates’
      opinions or conclusions will be presented clearly and supported by appropriate evidence.


10.   Examine the effects of the Spanish-American War (1898) in the Philippines.

      The question requires that candidates consider the interrelationship between the Spanish-American
      War and its effects on the Philippines. Effects may extend beyond the timeframe, but they must be
      clearly linked to the issue raised in the question. Candidates may refer to the removal of Spanish rule
      from the islands, and the political, social and economic impact of this may be considered. The war
      also marked the emergence of the US as a power in the region, as the Philippines became a part of
      the United States. Military force was used by the US to put down rebellions by the Filipinos who had
      hoped to achieve independence after the end of Spanish rule. The Spanish-American War and its
      aftermath delayed Philippine independence until after the Second World War. Candidates’ opinions
      or conclusions will be presented clearly and supported by appropriate evidence.

Section 6: India, Afghanistan and Burma (1750–1919)

11.   “British economic policy was the main cause of the Great Revolt (Indian Mutiny) of 1857.” To what
      extent do you agree with this statement?

      The question requires that candidates consider the merits or otherwise of the statement that British
      economic policy was the main cause of the Great Revolt. Causes may predate the timeframe, but
      they must be clearly linked to the issue raised in the question. Candidates may refer to the British
      commercial policies and unfair trading practices, including levying high import duties on finished
      goods and low export duties on raw materials. Candidates may also refer to the drain of wealth,
      unfair land revenue policies and disruption of traditional economic structures leading to poverty
      and famines. Other relevant factors may be addressed, for example political policies such as the
      Doctrine of Lapse, widespread discontent amongst sepoys, unfair annexations, interference in
      local customs and racial discrimination, but with a focus on the issue in the question. Candidates’
      opinions or conclusions will be presented clearly and supported by appropriate evidence.


12.   “British actions in Afghanistan were due to the fear of Russian invasion.” Discuss.

      The question requires that candidates offer a considered and balanced review of the statement
      that British actions in Afghanistan were due to fear of Russian invasion. Candidates may refer to
      the advancement of Tsarist Russia into Central Asia as being extremely detrimental to British
      political and economic interests in India. The British would be able to use Afghanistan as a buffer
      state against Russia. Control of Afghanistan, particularly the mountain passes, would make halting
      further Russian expansion in Central Asia, particularly in the direction of British India, much easier.
      The Khyber Pass was the land route to the east and the spice trade. Other relevant factors may be
      addressed, for example the control of trade routes and commerce and the fact that India and
      Central Asia had close ties for over 2000 years. Candidates’ opinions or conclusions will be
      presented clearly and supported by appropriate evidence.
                                                   – 10 –                N20/3/HISTX/HP3/ENG/TZ0/OC/M


Section 7: Challenges to traditional East Asian societies (1700–1868)

13.   Evaluate the consequences of the Taiping Rebellion for Chinese society.

      The question requires that candidates make an appraisal of the consequences of the Taiping
      Rebellion, weighing up the strengths and limitations of the results for Chinese society.
      Consequences may extend beyond the timeframe, but they must be clearly linked to the issue
      raised in the question. Candidates may offer equal coverage of strengths and limitations, or they
      may prioritize their evaluation of one of these aspects. However, both aspects will be a feature of
      the response. Candidates may refer to the growth of ideas of equality, changes in social and
      economic structure, the Hundred Days’ Reform movement and the weakening of the Qing dynasty.
      Limitations may include loss of lives, destruction of fertile lands, the drain of resources and the fact
      that China was becoming an easy target for colonization. Candidates’ opinions or conclusions will
      be presented clearly and supported by appropriate evidence.


14.   “Political rather than economic factors led to the crisis of the Bakumatsu period (1853–1868).”
      Discuss.

      The question requires that candidates offer a considered and balanced review of the statement that
      political factors rather than economic factors led to the crisis of the Bakumatsu period. Causes may
      predate the timeframe, but they must be clearly linked to the issue raised in the question. Candidates
      may discuss the impact of Perry’s arrival on Japan and the political crisis that followed. This could
      include a discussion of the perceived failure of the shogun to protect Japan from foreigners, which
      led to the rise of factions jostling for power and eventually resulted in a coup. By 1868, the Tokugawa
      shogunate had collapsed and Emperor Meiji took control of the country. Economic factors discussed
      could include the effects of monetary upheaval produced by the opening up of Japan to foreign trade,
      unemployment, inflation and the breakdown of the coinage system. Candidates’ opinions or
      conclusions will be presented clearly and supported by appropriate evidence.
                                                    – 11 –                 N20/3/HISTX/HP3/ENG/TZ0/OC/M


Section 8: British colonialism and emerging national identities in Oceania (1788–1919)

15.   Discuss the reasons for, and impact of, the growth of cities in Australia.

      The question requires that candidates offer a considered and balanced review of the reasons for,
      and effects of, the growth of cities in Australia. Candidates may argue that the main reason for the
      growth of cities were the gold rushes, which led to an influx of people from other parts of the
      country and overseas. Candidates may consider a wide range of social, economic and political
      impacts. Examples may include the creation of communities with a shared identity, an increased
      standard of living, developments in transportation and communications, expansion of businesses
      and services to meet the needs of these new communities. Candidates may also argue that there
      were negative impacts, such as increasing crime rates and increased racial tensions. Both parts of
      the question should be addressed, but there does not need to be equal coverage. Candidates’
      opinions or conclusions will be presented clearly and supported by appropriate evidence.


16.   “The growth of national identity was the main factor in the development of the federation movement
      in Australia.” Discuss.

      The question requires that candidates offer a considered and balanced review of the statement
      that the growth of national identity was the main factor in the development of the federation
      movement in Australia. Candidates may refer to the ways in which a national identity had been
      developing as a result of the younger generation being native-born and therefore the concept of
      being Australian emerged. The growth of a national identity could also be seen in the arts and
      literature. All of this led to a desire for political representation of the whole country rather than just
      individual states. However, candidates may also argue that the federation movement was
      influenced by economic factors. Cities were better connected and there was a need to standardize
      tariffs to improve trade. A federal government would also be better able to respond to the
      increased social problems, such as the rise in crime, immigration and disease. Candidates’
      opinions or conclusions will be presented clearly and supported by appropriate evidence.

Section 9: Early modernization and imperial decline in East Asia (1860–1912)

17.   To what extent was conservative opposition the main reason for the failure of the Hundred Days’
      Reform (1898)?

      The question requires that candidates consider the merits or otherwise of the suggestion that
      conservative opposition was the main reason for the failure of the Hundred Days’ Reform. The
      conservative ruling elite condemned the reform as too radical and proposed a more moderate and
      gradualist course of change. Candidates may refer to the rallying of conservative forces behind the
      Empress Dowager, Cixi. With the army on her side, Cixi carried out a coup and imprisoned the
      emperor in his palace. Traditionalist Confucian scholars also considered the reforms impetuous
      and believed they tried to do too much too soon. The reforms also threatened the position of
      powerful ministers and bureaucrats. Other relevant factors may be addressed, for example the
      reformers’ inexperience resulting in unplanned and ambitious reforms, but with a focus on the
      issue in the question. Candidates’ opinions or conclusions will be presented clearly and supported
      by appropriate evidence.


18.   “Economic gain was the main reason for the Japanese annexation of Korea (1910).” Discuss.

      The question requires that candidates offer a considered and balanced review of the statement that
      economic gain was the main reason for the Japanese annexation of Korea in 1910. Reasons may
      predate the timeframe, but they must be clearly linked to the issue raised in the question. Candidates
      may refer to the Japanese need for cheap raw materials, human resources and the desire to open up
      Korea for trade with Japan. Having access to Korea’s coal and iron ore deposits would significantly
      benefit Japan's growing industrial base. Other relevant factors may be addressed, for example Japan’s
      desire for political dominance in the region, Japanese fear of Russian expansionism and control over
      Korea which would limit their influence in the region. China’s control over Korea was also perceived to
      be detrimental to Japanese national security. Candidates’ opinions or conclusions will be presented
      clearly and supported by appropriate evidence.

Section 10: Nationalism and independence in India (1919–1964)

19.   Examine the role of the Indian National Congress in the achievement of independence in India.

      The question requires that candidates consider the interrelationship between the Indian National
      Congress and the achievement of independence in India. Candidates may refer to the speeches,
      resolutions and movements introduced by the Congress, such as passive resistance and
      Satyagraha, non-cooperation, Purna Swaraj, Civil Disobedience and the Quit India movements.
      The role and work of Congress in contesting elections and forming ministries pre-independence
      may be addressed. The importance of Congress leaders such as Gandhi, Nehru and Patel and
      their actions could be looked at. Other relevant interrelationships may be considered, for example
      decolonization, the Atlantic Charter supporting independence of colonies and the money Britain
      owed to India, playing a role in the achievement of independence, but with a focus on the issue
      in the question. Candidates’ opinions or conclusions will be presented clearly and supported by
      appropriate evidence.


20.   “Separatist policies of the Muslim League led to the partition of India in 1947.” To what extent do
      you agree with this statement?

      The question requires that candidates consider the merits or otherwise of the statement that
      separatist policies of the Muslim League led to the partition of India. Causes may predate the
      timeframe, but they must be clearly linked to the issue raised in the question. Candidates may
      refer to the Lahore Resolution of the Muslim League outlining the Two-Nation Theory, the Day of
      Deliverance announced by the League when the Congress ministries resigned, Direct Action Day
      and the role of Jinnah and other Muslim leaders such as Iqbal and Rahmat Ali. Other relevant
      factors may be addressed, for example the failure of the Indian National Congress to placate the
      Muslims, the British policies of divide and rule and the rise of Hindu communalism, but with a focus
      on the issue in the question. Candidates’ opinions or conclusions will be presented clearly and
      supported by appropriate evidence.

Section 11: Japan (1912–1990)

21.   Evaluate the impact of the First World War and the post-war conferences on Japan.

      The question requires that candidates make an appraisal of the impact of the First World War and
      the post-war conferences on Japan. Candidates may argue that Japan’s involvement in the
      Versailles Treaty and the Washington Conferences demonstrated their growing international
      status. At Versailles, Japan gained the Shandong province in China despite the objections from
      China. At the Washington Conferences, it was clear that the US and UK regarded Japan as a
      significant military power by imposing a 5:5:3 ratio on ship building. However, candidates may
      argue that both of these events triggered anger within Japan that they were not treated as an equal
      nation. The refusal to ratify the Racial Equality Clause at Versailles further strengthened this belief.
      At the Washington Conference, Shandong was also returned to China with Japan only maintaining
      control of the railways. Candidates may argue that this was the beginning of militarism and
      nationalism in Japan. Candidates’ opinions or conclusions will be presented clearly and supported
      by appropriate evidence.


22.   “Political and economic changes that occurred in Japan during US occupation were undermined by
      the reverse course (1950).” Discuss.

      The question requires that candidates consider the merits or otherwise of the statement that the
      political and economic changes that occurred in Japan during the US occupation were undermined
      by the reverse course. Candidates may start their response by considering the changes that were
      implemented during the early years of US occupation. Political changes may include a discussion
      of the democratization and demilitarization of Japan, including its new constitution. Economic
      changes may include a discussion of land reform and attempts to weaken the power of the
      zaibatsu. As communism spread throughout Asia the US came to regard Japan as a strong ally in
      Asia. Candidates may discuss the impact of the Reverse Course which led to the US relaxing
      many of their policies towards Japan, including its previous restrictions on the zaibatsu. The US
      also now supported the rise of conservative politicians and allowed Japan to establish defence
      forces. Candidates’ opinions or conclusions will be presented clearly and supported by appropriate
      evidence.

Section 12: China and Korea (1910–1950)

23.   Evaluate the importance of the Jiangxi Soviet (1931–1934) to the rise of communism in China.

      The question requires that candidates consider the interrelationship between the Jiangxi Soviet
      and the rise of the Communist Party (CCP). Following Jiang Jieshi’s purge of the CCP, they fled to
      Jiangxi and established a community there. Candidates may examine the ways in which the
      Jiangxi Soviet enabled the party to formulate and implement key policies such as land reform. It
      was also during the Jiangxi Soviet that the Red Army developed guerrilla tactics to respond to
      Jiang’s Encirclement Campaigns. These tactics would prove essential to their survival in the Sino-
      Japanese War and the second Chinese Civil War. Candidates may also consider the significance
      of the Jiangxi Soviet in the rise of Mao’s leadership of the party and in determining future relations
      with the USSR. Candidates may argue that the party’s inability to defend Jiangxi in the 5th
      Encirclement Campaign nearly decimated the party. Candidates’ opinions or conclusions will be
      presented clearly and supported by appropriate evidence.


24.   “The Nanjing decade (1927–1937) was a complete failure.” To what extent do you agree with
      this statement?

      The question requires that candidates consider the merits or otherwise of the statement that the
      Nanjing decade (1927–1937) was a complete failure. Candidates may consider a range of social,
      political, economic and military policies and should show examples of failures and successes.
      In terms of economics, candidates may refer to Jiang Jieshi’s inability to address the extreme
      poverty experienced by the peasants, but could also argue that infrastructure in the cities, such
      as transportation and communication, was developed. Candidates may address the oppressive
      nature of the regime to argue that politically it was a failure, but they may also identify Jiang’s
      renegotiations of the Unequal Treaties as a success. Candidates may argue that the New Life
      Movement was an example of a social failure as it did not address China’s problems, but Jiang’s
      banning of foot binding would be seen as a positive development. Candidates’ opinions or
      conclusions will be presented clearly and supported by appropriate evidence.

Section 13: Impact of the Second World War on South-East Asia

25.   “Japanese occupation was the main reason for the growth of nationalism in the Dutch East Indies.”
      To what extent do you agree with this statement?

      The question requires that candidates consider the merits or otherwise of the statement that
      Japanese occupation was the main reason for the growth of nationalism in the Dutch East Indies.
      Candidates may refer to how the Japanese politicized the Indonesians and allowed the nationalists
      to develop their cause further. For example, the Japanese promoted many of the nationalist
      figures, such as Sukarno, to positions of power. Sukarno was even given a military force, which
      candidates may argue placed him in a strong position to fight for independence after the war. The
      Japanese also gave the Indonesian elite experience of government as the day-to-day business of
      running the country was left to them. At the end of the war, they did not want to relinquish this
      power. Candidates may challenge the assumption in the question by arguing that nationalism had
      already developed in the Dutch East Indies as a result of the nature of Dutch occupation.
      Candidates’ opinions or conclusions will be presented clearly and supported by appropriate
      evidence.


26.   Evaluate the political and economic impact of the Second World War on one country in
      South-East Asia, excluding the Dutch East Indies, Indochina and Malaya.

      The question requires that candidates make an appraisal of the impact of the Second World War
      on one country in South-East Asia. Candidates should use a case study here of any South-East
      Asian country other than the Dutch East Indies, Indochina and Malaya and content will differ
      depending on the case study they have selected. In terms of political impact, candidates may
      consider factors such as the growth of nationalist and independence movements. They may also
      consider changes in foreign relations and alignments. In terms of economic impact, candidates
      may address the cost of the war but also changes in trade relations. There should be references to
      political and economic impact but there does not need to be equal coverage of both. Candidates’
      opinions or conclusions will be presented clearly and supported by appropriate evidence.

Section 14: The People’s Republic of China (1949–2005)

27.   “Mao Zedong’s economic policies were a failure.” To what extent do you agree with this statement?

      The question requires that candidates consider the merits or otherwise of the statement that
      Mao Zedong’s economic policies were a failure. Candidates should refer to Mao’s key economic
      policies, such as Land Reform Law, the First Five-Year Plan and the Great Leap Forward.
      Candidates are likely to argue that these policies had different levels of success and failure. Land
      Reform could be seen as a successful policy as it did give the peasants land, but they were often
      ill-equipped and lacking experience to effectively farm. The First Five-Year Plan had numerous
      successes, particularly the rise in industrial production. However, candidates may argue that the
      introduction of collective farming was a failure. Candidates may argue that the Great Leap Forward
      was a complete failure and give examples such as the Backyard Steel Campaign and the Great
      Famine. Candidates may argue that some of these policies failed from an economic perspective,
      but did have social and political successes, such as greater control over the lives of the people.
      Candidates’ opinions or conclusions will be presented clearly and supported by appropriate
      evidence.


28.   To what extent had China become a global power by 1976?

      The question requires that candidates consider the merits or otherwise of the claim that China
      had become a global power by 1976. Candidates may begin their response by considering
      China’s international position when Mao came to power in 1949. They may then address China’s
      involvement in conflicts, relations with other nations and developments in trade to measure the
      extent of its power by 1976. For example, candidates may refer to China’s involvement in the
      Korean War during which the PLA was able to successfully push back UN forces. Candidates
      may discuss China’s relations with the USSR and argue that the Sino-Soviet split is evidence of
      China standing up on its own. China’s development of its first atom bomb, despite the Soviet’s
      refusal to help, is a further example of this. Candidates may also discuss China’s involvement in
      the Non-Alignment Movement, its improved relations with the US and eventual acceptance into
      the UN, development of trade as examples of China’s increasing global influence. This is a broad
      question and whilst candidates are not expected to cover all events, there should be good coverage
      of the time period up to the 1970s. Candidates’ opinions or conclusions will be presented clearly and
      supported by appropriate evidence.

Section 15: Cold War conflicts in Asia

29.   Evaluate the role of the Malayan Communist Party during the Malayan Emergency (1948–1960).

      The question requires that candidates make an appraisal of the role of the Malayan Communist Party
      (MCP) during the Emergency, weighing up their strengths and limitations. Candidates may offer
      equal coverage of strengths and limitations, or they may prioritize their evaluation of one of these
      aspects. However, both aspects will be a feature of the response. Candidates may refer to the
      regrouping of the MCP militants as the MPABA. The militants carried out guerilla activities including
      road and rail ambushes as well as intimidation and killings of civilians. In 1949, the MPLA allied with
      trade unions, other political parties as well as the aboriginal population. Limitations of the MCP may
      include a discussion of the loss of popular support due to their violent methods. The British were also
      easily able to suppress the MCP and cut off their supplies through Operation Starvation. Candidates’
      opinions or conclusions will be presented clearly and supported by appropriate evidence.


30.   “International involvement was significant in determining the outcome of the civil war in Afghanistan
      (1989–1992).” Discuss.

      The question requires that candidates offer a considered and balanced review of the statement that
      international involvement was significant in determining the outcome of the civil war in Afghanistan.
      Candidates may refer to the role of Pakistan in supporting the Mujahideen coalition, the role of the
      US that permitted its funding and arms distribution to be administered initially through Pakistan and
      later through direct access with the Mujahideen, and the role of the Soviet Union in supporting the
      Republic of Afghanistan under President Mohammed Najibullah in Kabul. Other relevant factors
      may be addressed, for example the internal divisions in the regime of President Najibullah such as
      the opposition between the Khalq and Parcham factions, but with focus on the issue in the question.
      Candidates’ opinions or conclusions will be presented clearly and supported by appropriate
      evidence.

Section 16: Developments and challenges in South Asia after 1947

31.   To what extent were economic issues the most important reason for the independence of
      Bangladesh (1971)?

      The question requires that candidates consider the merits or otherwise of the suggestion that
      economic issues were the main cause for the independence of Bangladesh. Candidates may refer
      to the unfair economic policies of West Pakistan towards East Pakistan, which was treated as a
      colony with an underdeveloped economy. East Pakistan earned foreign exchange by exporting
      jute, but this was used to industrialize West Pakistan with very little revenue allocated to East
      Pakistan. Cyclone management was also neglected by West Pakistan and trade was adversely
      affected. Candidates may challenge the question and discuss other relevant factors. These could
      include racial tensions between the Urdu-speaking Pakistanis and the Bengalis in East Pakistan,
      the Awami League’s election victory not being accepted by West Pakistan and India’s support of
      the Mukti Bahini. The military atrocities committed by the Pakistan army against unarmed Bengalis
      may also be discussed as an immediate cause. Candidates’ opinions or conclusions will be
      presented clearly and supported by appropriate evidence.


32.   Evaluate the political and economic developments in India under Indira Gandhi.

      The question requires that candidates make an appraisal of the political and economic developments
      under Indira Gandhi, weighing up the strengths and limitations or otherwise of each. Candidates may
      offer equal coverage of political and economic developments, or they may prioritize their evaluation
      of one of these aspects. However, both aspects will be a feature of the response. Candidates may
      refer to her socialist policies including the nationalization of banks and the coal mines, the Green
      Revolution and the Five-Year Plans. For political developments, they may refer to the splitting of the
      Congress, declaration of India as a nuclear state, the constitutional amendments, the Emergency,
      and the Twenty Point Programme as well as Operation Bluestar. Candidates may discuss the
      controversial nature of these events. Accusations against Indira Gandhi of malpractices in elections
      led to the formation of a grand opposition alliance, the Janta Morcha. Candidates’ opinions or
      conclusions will be presented clearly and supported by appropriate evidence.

Section 17: Developments in Oceania after the Second World War (1945–2005)

33.   “Multiculturalism was the most significant development in society.” Discuss with reference to
      either Australia or New Zealand.

      The question requires that candidates offer a considered and balanced review of the statement
      that multiculturalism was the most significant development in society. Candidates should discuss
      the impact of multiculturalism on society, such as the growth in religious and ethnic diversity.
      Candidates may also consider the impact of multiculturalism on language, education and the arts.
      It could also be argued that multiculturalism led to many social problems such as racial and
      religious tensions. Candidates may also challenge the assumption in the question and argue that
      there were other significant developments that had a wider impact on society. These could include
      women’s rights or the rights of indigenous people. Candidates’ opinions or conclusions will be
      presented clearly and supported by appropriate evidence.


34.   To what extent did the rise of Asian economies significantly impact the economic policies of
      either Australia or New Zealand?

      The question requires that candidates consider the merits or otherwise of the suggestion that the
      rise of Asian economies significantly impacted the economic policies of either Australia or
      New Zealand. Candidates may begin their response by stating that before the Second World War
      both countries’ closest trading partner was the UK. However, following the war, trade relations
      changed significantly. The growth of the “Asian Tiger” economies led to stronger economic ties
      with these countries and both Australia and New Zealand traded more with ASEAN. Candidates
      may challenge the assumption in the question and argue that other factors such as the UK joining
      the EEC or the nationalization of key industries had a greater impact. Candidates’ opinions or
      conclusions will be presented clearly and supported by appropriate evidence.

            and India) (1980–2005)

35.   Compare and contrast religious tensions in two Asian countries (excluding China, Japan and India).

      The question requires that candidates give an account of the similarities and differences between
      religious tensions in two Asian countries (excluding China, Japan, and India), referring to both
      throughout. There does not need to be an equal number of each. Candidates may refer to the
      causes and origin of the tension, its nature and the groups involved. They may also discuss the
      role of leaders, ideologies and rituals while highlighting similarities and differences. There may
      be a discussion of the political motivation for these tensions. Depending on the countries chosen,
      the role of external factors and other countries could also be discussed. Candidates’ opinions or
      conclusions will be presented clearly and supported by appropriate evidence.


36.   Discuss the cultural impact of globalization in two Asian countries (excluding China, Japan and
      India).

      The question requires that candidates offer a considered and balanced review of the cultural
      impact of globalization in two Asian countries (excluding China, Japan and India). The impact
      may extend beyond the timeframe, but must be clearly linked to the issue raised in the question.
      Candidates may refer to the diffusion of ideas, the influence on popular culture and lifestyle and
      the impact of globalization on language and education in two countries. They may also refer to
      food-fusion, cultural exchanges in theatre, dance, music and the arts as well as the influence on
      religion and clothing and general lifestyle. Literature and the media’s impact on reaching out to
      remote areas and addressing global issues may be looked at. Candidates’ opinions or
      conclusions will be presented clearly and supported by appropriate evidence.
