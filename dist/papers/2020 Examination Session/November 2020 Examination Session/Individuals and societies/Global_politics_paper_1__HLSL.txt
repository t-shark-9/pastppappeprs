Source B                Adapted from: “Press Release: Justice, Truth and Reparations for Victims of the
                        Aceh Conflict, Ten Years On”, August 14, 2015, by Asia Justice and Rights: a
                        non-profit organization, based in Indonesia, whose aim is the strengthening of
                        human rights.

The Aceh conflict had a devastating impact on the civilian population, in particular between 1989 and
2004 when military operations were conducted by the Indonesian authorities to suppress claims for
separatism. Between 10,000 and 30,000 people were killed during the conflict, many of them civilians.
However, ten years after the peace agreement – which has brought relative peace and security to
the province – victims and family members are still waiting for the Indonesian authorities to deliver on
promises for truth, justice and full reparation*.

Many of the human rights abuses committed during the Aceh conflict constitute crimes under
international law. However, most crimes have not been investigated and those suspected of committing
them have not been charged and prosecuted. Further, crimes under international law are currently not
defined in the Indonesian Criminal Code, making it very difficult for victims to seek justice before ordinary
criminal courts.

Financial and other material assistance to victims of the Aceh conflict was not designed or intended to
address the harm suffered by victims of human rights abuses and did not specifically include women and
girl survivors of sexual violence.

Our organizations recommend that local and central authorities set up immediately a truth commission
in line with international standards to ensure that victims, their families and affected communities are
provided with full disclosure information about what happened during the Aceh conflict.



* reparation: the action of making amends for a wrong one has done, by providing
  payment or other assistance to those who have been wronged

Source C                Adapted from: “13 Years of Peace Without Justice or Truth in Aceh: There may be
                        peace in Aceh, but truth and justice remain elusive” by Usman Hamid (Indonesia
                        Director of Amnesty International), August 15, 2018, for a current affairs journal,
                        The Diplomat.

Today marks 13 years since the government of Indonesia and the armed pro-independence movement,
the Free Aceh Movement (GAM), signed a peace agreement in Helsinki.

While the agreement brought an end to the conflict in Aceh, the failure of the authorities to establish the
truth about what happened has left countless families struggling to find justice, truth, and reparation.
During the conflict, Indonesian security forces and their paramilitaries committed serious human rights
violations, including unlawful killings, enforced disappearances, and torture as part of a policy to
suppress the independence movement. Human rights abuses by GAM included hostage taking and the
targeted killings of those suspected of having ties to the government.

The 2005 Helsinki Agreement mandated that a commission be established no later than one year after
the peace agreement. However, the Indonesian government has so far failed to act on it and it took the
Aceh House of People’s Representative (DPRA) eight years to pass a bylaw for its establishment in
December 2013. A further delay of three years, and lack of funds has subsequently called into question
the Aceh government’s support. In leaving the local government alone to remedy violations committed
by national authorities, the central government is trying to evade any responsibility for what happened
in Aceh. Peace is not enough if no truth is established about the past and victims are left to suffer
without reparation.


Source D                Adapted from: “Aceh Truth and Reconciliation Commission: A Diplomatic Brief”,
                        2019. A document produced by the Commission to illustrate progress.

The Truth and Reconciliation Commission (TRC) has three main objectives that are important in carrying
out its work; first, strengthening peace by revealing the truth about past human rights violations. Second,
helping to achieve reconciliation between perpetrators of human rights violations, both individuals
and institutions, with victims. Third, recommending comprehensive reparation for victims of human
rights violations.

In order to carry out these objectives, the Aceh TRC has formed six working groups; including a Truth
Working Group, a Women Working Group, and a Working Group on the Protection of Witnesses and
Victims. Priorities of the Aceh TRC include the delivery of urgent reparations, developing reconciliation
methods and engaging with various religious and public actors. To date, TRC has taken 1,335
statements from victims. A second public hearing will be conducted in August 2019 with specific themes
of enforced disappearance, and the third in November 2019 to focus on sexual violations.

However, the Aceh TRC is continuing to face limited political and economic support from the
Aceh government. “We would like to invite international communities to support and monitor the
transitional justice process in Aceh. As experienced by most truth commissions in other countries,
support from international communities is essential to ensure the effectiveness of truth seeking and
reconciliation process.”
