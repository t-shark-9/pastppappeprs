Answer two questions. Each question is worth [20 marks].

1.   E-voting

     A number of countries, such as India, have introduced e-voting systems. Citizens can vote
     by going to a specified location, such as a school, or they can vote from home using a
     computer. Each voter is provided with a unique identifier, such as IND55454, that they must
     enter into the system when they vote.

     These e-voting systems usually consist of a user interface, such as the one in Figure 1,
     linked to a relational database (see Figure 2).

2.   BYOD at Xingu Academy

     Some students at Xingu Academy have been allowed to “bring your own device (BYOD)”
     into school so they can use assistive technologies, such as speech-to-text, to support
     their learning (see Figure 3). Mayu Jimenez, the Head of Learning and Teaching, has
     seen the benefits for these students. A number of other teachers believe there will be
     benefits if the school becomes a BYOD school. However, before a decision can be made,
     Alejandro Glandolla, the Head of IT, has been asked to investigate whether the school would
     be able to cope with the demands of the increased number of devices.

                                   Figure 3: Assistive technologies




     (a)   (i)	Identify two pieces of information that would be used to identify a device on the

           (ii)   Identify the steps used by speech-to-text software.                                 [4]

     (b)   Digital citizenship is included in Xingu Academy’s IT acceptable-use policy.

           Explain why it is important that students at Xingu Academy are both competent users of
           digital technologies and good digital citizens.                                            [6]

     (c)   Discuss whether Xingu Academy should become a bring-your-own-device (BYOD)
           school.[8]

3.   Clouds under the sea

     Microsoft has located one of its data centres on the seabed. Project Natick is now operating
     100 feet below the surface of the North Sea (see Figure 4).

                   Figure 4: An artist’s representation of a data centre on the sea bed




     Microsoft has chosen to develop data centres on the seabed because concerns have been
     raised about the impact of data centres built on land. These seabed data centres can be
     constructed and placed on the sea bed in 90 days. This is compared to the two years that
     are required for land-based data centres.

     The demand for data storage is doubling every two years, so it is likely that an increasing
     number of data centres will need to be constructed under the sea as cloud computing
     continues to grow. Google patented their design for an underwater data centre in 2009 but,
     although functioning prototypes have been trialled, none have been used commercially.

     (a)   (i)     Identify two characteristics of cloud computing.                                     [2]

           (ii)    Servers used in cloud computing hold considerable amounts of data.

                   Identify two forms of backup that could be used for the data on these servers.       [2]

           (iii)   A user is downloading a ZIP (zipped file) from cloud storage.

                   The ZIP file is 0.6 GB in size and the download rate is 8 mb/s.

                   Calculate the total time it will take to download the ZIP file.

                   Note: 1 GB = 1000 MB.                                                                [2]

(Question 3 continued)

     (b)   (i)     Compression software can be used to speed up the upload and download of files.

                   The ZIP file recently downloaded from the cloud-based server contained a
                   number of images and videos.

                   Explain why lossy compression techniques would be used for the images that
                   have been downloaded from cloud storage.                                            [2]

           (ii)    Explain why lossless compression techniques would be used for the videos that
                   have been downloaded from cloud storage.                                            [2]

           (iii)   Cloud storage providers are responsible for protecting the privacy and anonymity
                   of the individuals whose data is held on their servers.

                   Distinguish between privacy and anonymity.                                          [2]

     (c)   Evaluate Microsoft’s decision to build data centres on the seabed.                          [8]

Answer one question. Each question is worth [20 marks].

4.   Your personal avatar

     SBE Cruise Lines is implementing new IT systems to enhance their passengers’
     experiences. Recently, the company equipped their ships with touch screens where
     passengers can interact with their own customizable 3D avatar. Passengers wear a bracelet
     on their wrist and their 3D avatar appears on touch screens as they walk around the ship
     (see Figure 5).
                               Figure 5: A child interacting with the avatar




     The bracelet tracks a passenger’s location on the ship using thousands of sensors, and this
     data is constantly synchronized with that passenger’s data stored in the cloud. This may
     include their photo, room number or passport information.

     To improve the passenger’s experience, the avatar developers update the IT systems on
     the cruise ship every night. To ensure that the IT updates are completed, George Smith, the
     Project Manager, must communicate with a number of stakeholders.

     George believes that to make the best improvements, the avatar developers who are in
     charge of quality assurance should observe the passengers’ real-time interactions with
     the system.

     (a)   (i)	Identify two stakeholders that George, the Project Manager, must consult before
                implementing the IT updates.                                                         [2]

           (ii)    Identify two responsibilities of the Project Manager in addition to consulting
                   stakeholders.[2]

           (iii)   Identify two characteristics of quality assurance.                                [2]

(Question 4 continued)

     (b)   (i)	Explain why the avatar developers would not use alpha and beta testing when
                the nightly updates are implemented.                                                   [4]

           (ii)   Explain one reason why the nightly updates should make use of a project
                  management methodology.                                                              [2]

     (c)   Matt Earle, the CEO of SBE Cruise Lines, has been investigating using artificial
           intelligence (AI) systems to track passengers and suggest activities they may wish
           to take part in when they interact with the touch screens on the ship. Some of his
           colleagues have concerns about taking this approach.

           To what extent should Matt rely on the recommendations from the AI system to suggest
           activities to passengers?                                                                   [8]

5.     Skin care app

       SkinSmart is an app1 that requires the user to take a selfie2 and answer a few questions
       about their skin. The expert system linked to the app will then recommend skin care
       products to suit the user.

       As artificial intelligence (AI) is becoming more sophisticated, SkinSmart has developed a
       new app, SkinSmartPro (SSP), which uses AI instead of an expert system.

       Marta is a young woman who uses the SSP app. The developers of SSP say that Marta will
       gain the most benefit from using the app if she takes a daily selfie and inputs information,
       such as how she is feeling, how long she has slept, how much she has exercised and what
       she has done throughout the day. The app will then use machine learning to analyse the
       data provided by Marta and recommend skin care products for her.

       The SSP app is being developed in consultation with MAGS, a data management company.
       This means that the data of the users of the SSP app could be shared with third parties.

       (c)   Some SSP app users have expressed concerns about the AI features in the new SSP
             app and have decided to change back to the original SkinSmart app despite its use of
             an expert system.

             Evaluate the decision of some SSP app users to change back to the original
             SkinSmart app.                                                                               [8]

6.   Autonomous weapons

     Advances in technology have led to the possibility of fully autonomous weapons, also known
     as killer robots, being used in war.

     The United Nations is trying to create policies for the development and use of fully
     autonomous weapons. There are currently 125 countries working on these policies.

     A major concern associated with fully autonomous weapons is whether the decision to kill a
     human being should be left completely to a machine.

     (a)   (i)     Identify two characteristics of a robot.                                         [2]

           (ii)    Identify two project management methodologies that could be used in the
                   development of autonomous weapons.                                               [2]

           (iii)   Outline why prototyping would be used in the development of autonomous
                   weapons.[2]

     (b)   Explain two reasons why the development of policies for the use of autonomous
           weapons may be difficult to achieve.                                                     [6]

     (c)   Discuss who would be accountable if harm were caused by the use of an autonomous
           weapon.[8]
