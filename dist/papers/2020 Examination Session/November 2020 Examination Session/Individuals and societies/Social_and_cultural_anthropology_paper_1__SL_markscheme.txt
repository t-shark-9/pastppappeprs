The following interpretation of the markscheme is offered as an example of the types of responses we
may expect, however it is not prescriptive or exhaustive, and other possible answers should be
appropriately rewarded if relevant.


1.     Define the term exchange and describe how it can be understood and applied in the
       context of the passage.                                                                             [4]

       This question requires candidates to demonstrate conceptual knowledge and
       understanding of the term exchange, and apply it in relation to the text. Stronger
       responses will also develop a critical discussion of the concept.

2.     Analyse the ethnographic data presented in the passage using the concept of identity.                   [6]

       This question requires candidates to develop an analysis and explanation of this
       ethnographic text using the key concept of identity to help make sense of the
       ethnographic data. In order to do this, candidates are required to demonstrate an
       understanding of the key concept and use it to illuminate certain issues within the
       context of the passage, supporting their arguments by making reference to the
       ethnographic data of the extract.

       Candidates may write in terms of any of the following outlined guidance, but other
       definitions or applications will also be acceptable if made relevant to the context of the
       passage.

                                                            However, the response may be inconsistent,

3.   Compare and contrast the way in which the key concept of culture or symbolism is
     evident in this passage and how it is evident in one other ethnographic example you
     have studied.                                                                                [10]

     The target societies for this comparative question are varied and many. Candidates are
     expected to show an ability to think about the text in relation to other contexts and draw
     explicit comparisons. In order to do this, responses must demonstrate an
     understanding of how either the key concept of culture or symbolism relates to this
     ethnographic context. They should be able to establish a relevant comparison with any
     other group or society based on any of these concepts. The response should be
     structured as a comparison and contrast, highlighting similarities and differences.
     The passage focuses on begging as a system of exchange. It emphasizes innovations
     in Kinsasha that mobilize cultural ideas of dependence and independence within
     society. Documents come to symbolize the legitimacy of both the exchange and the
     identity of the documentaires. These allow beggars to create more sustainable
     relations and a more respectable image for themselves as a community. Candidates
     are expected to show an ability to think about the text in relation to other contexts and
     to draw explicit comparisons and contrasts. Either of the two key concepts chosen on
     which such comparison may be drawn should be made explicit and clearly linked to
     any anthropological issue raised by the text. Candidates must situate the comparative
     case in terms of place, author and historical context. The discussion should be
     supported with reference to concept and ethnographic material.

     Additional guidance
     For the key concept of culture: candidates may draw on the differences between
     cultural approaches to dependence and independence. In Kinsasha, while independent
     work may be the ideal, being part of a network of dependency as created by the
     documentaires is still valued. In this cultural perspective, it may be a valued
     achievement. Dependency is not stigmatized in the way that it is in some other
     cultures.

     Some of the concepts that candidates may draw on include: ideology, personhood,
     morality, classification, performance, exchange, identity, inequality, boundaries,
     inclusion/exclusion, etc.

     For the key concept of symbolism: candidates are likely to focus on the receipt
     (document) given by the documentaires. The document symbolizes that the money
     received is conceptualized as a reciprocal exchange rather than a gift or charity. This
     symbolism depends in part on their understanding of other social institutions such as
     government taxation and humanitarian aid in the form of NGOs. Some of the concepts
     that candidates may draw on include: classification, morality, performance,
     globalization, governmentality, exchange, authority, sustainability, suffering, inequality
     and possibly development; etc.

     All of the above simply tries to anticipate what candidates might include in their
     responses. We are not implying that a response must include one or all of the above in
     order to achieve a particular mark.

       studied. Make reference to concepts and ethnographic material in your answer.                     [10]

       While in the previous question the stress of the comparison needs to be drawn on the
       key concepts which would help to frame the responses; here candidates are expected
       to show an ability to think about the text with emphasis on the methodological and
       theoretical perspectives of the anthropologists as the main principle on which such
       comparisons should be established.

       By "approaches to research" the question essentially refers to the research methods
       used by the anthropologist to gather data.

5.       What does it mean to live in society? Discuss with reference to at least two sources of
         ethnographic material and examples from the passage.                                               [10]

         This question requires candidates to develop an argument which is built on an
         understanding of the following “big anthropological question”: what does it mean to
         live in society? This argumentative response includes discussion and analysis that
         should be supported by relevant, detailed ethnographic material that gives evidence of
         the understanding of this big question in different cultural contexts. This “big”
         anthropological question should be the very backbone of the response, and be
         informed by the ethnographic material studied. The aim of this question is to facilitate
         students to think with and through ethnographic material; to explore these materials
         analytically, aided by the focus on a “big” anthropological question. A broad variety of
         ethnographic data can be put forward in order to create meaningful responses.

         In the development of their response, candidates may make reference to a number of
         ideas or propositions connected to the relevance of anthropology. For this reason,
         below are some ideas that may appear in candidates' responses. However, any other
         relevant lines of thought should be rewarded.

         The unseen passage, which is the focus of questions 1–4, shows that anthropology
         gives voice to subaltern groups and attempts to understand how they themselves
         conceptualize society, their own roles within it, and their strategies for survival and
         sustainability. These voices might not emerge in other methods of research such as
         census-based data gathering.

         This particular passage shows that not all societies have the same understanding of
         dependence and independence, and that in some societies beggars have their own
         role to play rather than being considered as marginalized or a social burden.
