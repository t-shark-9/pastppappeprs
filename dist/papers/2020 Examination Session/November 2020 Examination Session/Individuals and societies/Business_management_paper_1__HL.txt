     (b)   Explain the factors that DA would need to consider before deciding to outsource some
           of its production (line 110).                                                              [6]

                                             Section B

Answer the following question.

4.   There are several important items to be discussed at DA’s board meeting, three of which are
     outlined below.

     Item 1: Budgets. DA produces its budgets based on the functional areas of the business.
     For example, the Marketing, Production, Innovation and Corporate Social Responsibility
     (CSR) Departments are all separate cost centres. Pierre is proposing that budgets should be
     more detailed so that, for example, each of DA’s products has its own cost centre and each
     separate innovation project is also a cost centre.

     Item 2: Recommendations from the management consultants. The management
     consultants propose bringing DA more up to date with employment practices by replacing
     the many benefits that employees get with a low basic pay and a profit-related bonus,
     and charging market rents for the housing in Ville d’Ablet. There will also be penalties on
     employees for failing to meet targets. The CSR department are opposed to this idea because
     they believe it will change the culture of the business, which has built up over many years.

     Item 3: The manufacture of rechargeable batteries used in cordless products. DA
     currently makes its own rechargeable batteries. In 2019, it made 10 000 batteries. The
     variable cost is €15 per battery and the fixed costs are €30 000. XL, a public limited company,
     is a major manufacturer of batteries. DA has contacted XL to manufacture the rechargeable
     batteries, which they will buy from XL at €17 each.


     (a)   Define the term public limited company.                                                     [2]

     (b)   Explain one advantage and one disadvantage for DA of changing from function-based
           cost centres to the cost centres proposed by Pierre.                                        [4]

     (c)   (i)	Calculate the difference between the cost for DA to make the rechargeable
                batteries and the cost to buy them from XL.                                            [3]

           (ii)   Suggest one other factor that DA should consider before deciding whether to
                  make the rechargeable batteries or buy them from XL.                                 [1]

     (d)   Discuss the likely impact on DA’s organizational culture of the changes recommended
           by the management consultants.                                                             [10]




                                                                                                Turn over
                                                  –4–                                           8820 – 5011


                                              Section C

Answer the following question.

5.   The final item in the board meeting (Item 4) is to discuss and decide which of the directors’
     proposals, Option A, B or C, to implement.

     Mia withdrew her proposal (Option C), and there is now additional information available on
     the remaining two proposals.

     Additional information on Option A: Market development

     Louise plans to target the mass market and proposes using the brand name DuLow for the
     redesigned products. She is planning for DA to outsource production to Star Electrics (SE).
     SE uses mass production together with some customization of products. SE keeps costs low
     by importing cheap raw materials and paying low wages.

     Ben, the human resource management director, is concerned about the impact this change
     would have on DA’s employees and about the impact of DuLow on DA’s other brands. He
     has collected relevant information on household electrical appliances (see Figure 1).

                     Figure 1: Data on household electrical appliances, France

             y   The market is expected to grow by 0.5 % per annum.
             y   Average spending per household is €114 per annum.
             y   Major national brands have 95 % of the market share.
             y   Top-selling brands compete on advertising and price.
             y   Washing machines and vacuum cleaners are at saturation.
             y   Sales of kettles, toasters and microwaves are growing at 1 % per annum.
             y   Sales of food mixers have high growth.

     Louise has estimated that the investment necessary to launch the DuLow product range will
     have a payback of about two years and an average rate of return (ARR) of about 30 %. This
     assumes high market penetration.

(Question 5 continued)

     Additional information on Option B: Product development

     Salah’s plan requires new production lines, one for each product. Salah thinks that
     cellular manufacturing, together with a flow production assembly line, would be a good
     way to manufacture the interchangeable modules. The investment cost is estimated to
     be €100 million if production lines are converted gradually and €20 million more if all
     conversions are done at the same time. Salah estimates the following net cash inflows
     (excluding the initial investment cost) (Table 1).

            Table 1: Forecast financial information for Option B (figures in € millions)

                                               Net cash inflow

                                               of €100 million)

                            1                          20

                            2                          30

                            3                          40

                            4                          60

                            5                          30

     Louise does not think DA can afford the project because profits are low. Dodi, the finance
     director, thinks that the investment is too large and he believes that some shareholders are
     also concerned about the size of future dividends. Salah believes that shareholders will
     be pleased about the revenues that this investment will generate. Mia is worried that the
     products would be expensive to market and it would be difficult to make a profit. She also
     thinks that demand for these new products will be difficult to predict.
