                                        Section A
1.   (a)   With reference to DA, outline two suitable methods of sampling (line 112–113).           [4]

           DA used sampling for recognition of brand name. It would have used sampling to
           set up focus groups and surveys. It also used focus groups in five different
           European countries for click and fix.


           Context can be achieved by making reference to:

                     The market(s) that DA operate in (mass vs niche)
                     The geographical markets (five European countries)
                     The need for DA to gain information within financial constraints
                     The type of information required (brand awareness, customers in Europe etc)



           Methods could include:
                 quota
                 random – may not be suitable as customer population is only a small
                   part of whole
                 stratified/systematic – probably for 5 European countries
                 cluster
                 convenience – most convenient unlikely to be those influenced by
                   brand, bias
                 snowball – but for the European market?

           Award [1] for each suitable method identified and [1] for a description of how
           that method relates to DA. Award a maximum of [2] per method. Unsuitable
           methods cannot get context mark

     (b)   Explain the factors that DA would need to consider before deciding to outsource
           some of its production (line 110).                                                       [6]

           Factors include:
            Quality: DA produces high quality products for the top end niche market,
             would outsourcing produce this quality
            Employment issues: DA currently looks after its employees. How would this
             continue if work is sent elsewhere? Redundancy costs.
            Control: To what extent to they want to keep in control of everything. It’s a
             family business so this may be important
            Costs: They are already under cost pressure. Would outsourcing help or
             hinder?
            Production issues: Could they benefit from better production techniques at the
             outsourced business? (No evidence of this in the case)
            Logistical issues: Possibly greater flexibility but no evidence
            Customer issues: Would they know? Would it make a difference? Maybe
             ‘upmarket’ customers would prefer locally made products.

           Accept any other relevant explanation.

           Marks should be allocated according to the markbands on page 3.

Award a maximum of [3] for a theoretical answer, often a pre-prepared textbook
answer or if there is only one factor

Award a maximum of [5] if the explanation is mainly descriptive, but in context.
                                                  –7–                 N20/3/BUSMT/SP1/ENG/TZ0/XX/M


2.   (a)   Outline two STEEPLE factors that have influenced DA’s business strategy.              [4]

           The STEEPLE factors are:
           Most relevant:
            Economic: Evidence in case of recession, periods of economic growth
            Political: Events in 1940s
            Environmental: issues to do with plastics
            Social: DA’s attitudes towards employees and their families
            Technological: Battery technology, new plastics, introducing robots etc
            Legal: No evidence in case – not relevant
            Ethical: Decisions made within DA particularly with regards to culture.

           Although STEEPLE strictly refers to external factors reward can be given where
           external factors have influenced decisions within DA such as its focus on
           employee welfares (ethics) and its use of technology in design/manufacture.

           Mark as 2 + 2.

           Award [1] for each relevant factor identified and [1] for a description of how that
           factor relates to DA. Award a maximum of [2] per factor.

     (b)   Explain how knowledge of the product life cycle may have influenced DA’s
           product range.                                                                        [6]

           References include:
            Vacuum cleaners launched and then reaching saturation which led to:
            Washing machines at introduction then eventually maturity hence other
             products
            Some other products in growth, others in decline
            Reversing declining trends by introducing rechargeable batteries
            Extension strategy using click and fix

           Throughout the business’s life, new products have been introduced when others
           are in maturity/saturation, and existing products are given revitalized lives
           through extension strategies. Candidates may draw a product life cycle. This is
           not necessary but may help the explanation.

           Accept any other relevant explanation.

           Marks should be allocated according to the markbands on page 3.

           Award a maximum of [3] for a theoretical answer or for an answer that does not
           identify any stages of the product life cycle.

           Award a maximum of [5] if the explanation is mainly descriptive, but in context.
                                                  –8–                  N20/3/BUSMT/SP1/ENG/TZ0/XX/M


3.   (a)   Outline one benefit of Viv’s leadership style and one benefit of Salah’s leadership
           style (lines 82–84).                                                                  [4]

           Leadership styles identified:
           Viv: Autocratic when re-establishing business. Benefit is that it got things done
           and she had very clear determination. Later more democratic when she
           consulted engineers. Benefit is that manager may have been in a better position.
           Overall situational which may be appropriate for an evolving business.

           Salah: Largely laissez-faire although some elements of democratic. Candidates
           will have to identify this for themselves. Creative employees work best when left
           alone – suitable for the innovation division.
           There is no need for answers to identify the leadership style – the question is
           about benefits.

           Award [1] for relevant benefit identified and [1] for a description of how that
           benefit relates to DA. Award a maximum of [2] per benefit.

     (b)   Explain suitable sources of finance for Option B.                                     [6]

           Key factors:
            Amount: It’s a large amount needed.
            Private limited company: so shares could be issued to family members but
             may not raise a lot. Would family members be able to buy more shares?
            Converting to public limited and raising share on the stockmarket
            Family business: so ownership and control very important so venture
             capitalists, business angels and other external investors may not be suitable
             unless argued otherwise
            Retained profits: Seems like a major impact on Dividends. Would
             shareholders be happy with that?
            Loans/mortgages/Debentures: has a policy of internal finance. With
             disagreement in the business would it be willing to change this policy?
            Leasing the necessary machinery for the option
            Short term sources: Overdrafts, debt factoring, trade credit, hire
             purchase/leasing not sufficient finance. Short term sources are not suitable.
            Sale of assets: not suitable - no evidence of underused or unused assets but
             is contextual with leaseback
            Selling shares on the stockmarket is not suitable unless linked with converting
             to plc.

           Remember the concept of positive marking – full marks can be achieved with
           more than one suitable method even if some unsuitable methods are identified.

           Accept any other relevant explanation.

           Marks should be allocated according to the markbands on page 3.

           Award a maximum of [3] for a theoretical answer (unsuitable methods) or if there
           is only one source.

           Award a maximum of [5] if the explanation is mainly descriptive, but in context.
           E.g. if most of the context is mentioned but not developed.
                                                    –9–                  N20/3/BUSMT/SP1/ENG/TZ0/XX/M


                                          Section B
4.   (a)   Define the term retained profit.                                                       [2]


           Profit made by the business, calculated after all deductions, including dividends.
           It is reinvested into the business as an internal source of finance.

           Award [1] for a partial definition and [2] for a full, clear definition. This answer
           does not need to be in context and can be worded differently to the above.

     (b)   Using Table 1, calculate for Option B:

           (i)    the average rate of return (ARR) (show all your working).                       [3]

                                                 (total returns – capital cost)
                                                          years of use
                  Average rate of return (ARR) =                                 100
                                                           capitalcost

                        ((50  150  200  300  400)  500)
                  ARR =                   5                   100  24 %
                                        500

                  Award [3] for a correct answer which must include %

                  Award [2] if there are no, or incorrect, units

                  Award [1] if the working is not shown

           (ii)   the payback period (no working required).                                       [1]

                  After 3 years $400m paid back so needs 4 more months
                  So payback = 3 years 4 months

                  Accept alternative formats such as “40 months” or “3 and 1/3 years” or
                  “month 4 of year 4”

                  Award [1] for correct answer

     (c)   Explain one advantage and one disadvantage for DA of replacing the current
           pay system and benefits with the proposed employment package (Decision 1).             [4]


           Advantages include:
            More motivated workforce as a result of bonuses, higher productivity (possible
             link to Taylorism)
            Generous redundancy can encourage workers who are thinking about moving
             out of the village of Ville d’Ablet

           Accept any other valid advantage.
                                             – 10 –               N20/3/BUSMT/SP1/ENG/TZ0/XX/M


      Disadvantages include:
       Less certainty for employees in terms of pay, which may affect motivation
       Loss of current benefits will affect morale (possible link to Herzberg or
         Maslow)
       Likely increase in staff turnover, reduced staff retention and more difficult to
         recruit staff.

      Accept any other valid disadvantage.

      Award [1] for each relevant advantage identified and [1] for a description of how
      that advantage relates to DA. Award [1] for each relevant disadvantage identified
      and [1] for a description of how that disadvantage relates to DA.

(d)   Using the case study and additional information from Section B, recommend
      whether DA should choose Option A or Option B (Decision 2).                          [10]

      Option A

      Advantages include:
       Much larger market
       Some customization of products
       Lower investment cost
       Brand widely recognized so maybe strong market

      Disadvantages include:
       May impact on DA's upmarket brands.
       Cheaper raw materials, lower wages, issues with outsourcing.
       DA employees may feel insecure
       Ben, Salah, Mia do not like idea

      Option B

      Advantages include:
       Good return (24 %) and 3 years 4 months payback and is likely to be longer
        than Option A payback.
