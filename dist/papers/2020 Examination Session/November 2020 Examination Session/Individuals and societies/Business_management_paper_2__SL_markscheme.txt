                                                Section A

1.   (a)    State two features of debt factoring.                                                   [2]

            Debt factoring:
             is short-term form of finance
             is an external source of finance
             enables a business to receive immediate cash from the factor, instead of
              waiting for its customers to pay their invoice.

            Another feature is that the business selling its invoices does not receive the full
            value of the invoices as factor makes a charge (buys at a discount).

            If a candidate defines debt factoring accurately, award at least [1] for some
            understanding. Examiners should review the definition to determine if, in defining
            the term, candidates have included at least two features. If so, award [1] for each
            feature up to [2]. Maximum award: [2].

            Award [1] for each feature identified up to a maximum of [2].

     (b)    Using the information in Table 1, construct a fully labelled cash flow forecast for
            MV for the first six months of 2021.                                                    [6]

            Award [1] if the candidate has some idea of a six-month cash-flow forecast but
            otherwise has numerous errors. Award [2] if the cash flow has four or more errors
            or has a largely inaccurate format. Award [3] if it is largely formatted correctly
            and/or has three errors. Award [4] for a correctly formatted forecast with just two
            errors. Award [5] for a correctly formatted forecast with just one error.

            Award [6] for a correctly formatted and mathematically correct forecast.

     Some possibility exists that candidates will misinterpret one portion of the stimulus and
     think that marketing, warehouse overheads, and office salaries total 36 000 for the
     three-month period Jan – Mar. and for the three-month period Apr – Jun. If a candidate
                                              –7–                 N20/3/BUSMT/SP2/ENG/TZ0/XX/M


interprets the stimulus in that fashion, accept as accurate provided that the candidate
consistently applies the stimulus based upon that interpretation.

(c)   Explain the potential impact on MV’s gross profit margin if the prices charged by
      its suppliers increase in the second half of 2021.                                   [2]

      MV’s gross profit margin is forecast to be 50 % for the first half of 2021.

           75 000 – 37 500                      70 000 – 35 000
      Eg                   for months 1 to 3 OR                 for months 4 to 6.
               75 000                               70 000

      If supplier prices increase in the second half of 2021 and the finance director is
      correct that the online market for light bulbs in the UK will become increasingly
      price competitive, MV’s gross profit margin would fall. Under this scenario, MV
      would be unable to pass on to its customers the increase in prices that it, MV, is
      paying to suppliers. The margin would fall below 50 %.

      If the candidate says “the margin will decrease” but with no clear explanation and
      application to the stimulus, award [1].

      Award [1] for a basic explanation that conveys partial understanding.

      Award [2] for a full explanation that conveys knowledge and understanding
      similar to the above.
                                                         –8–            N20/3/BUSMT/SP2/ENG/TZ0/XX/M


2.   (a)   Define the term price discrimination.                                                   [2]

           Price discrimination is when a firm charges a different price to different groups of
           consumers for an identical good or service.

           Award [1] for a basic definition conveying the idea that it allows a business to sell
           the same goods/services at different prices. Award an additional [1] for stating
           the differing prices are for different groups of consumers that can be separated in
           some way.

           A candidate may achieve the second mark through the use of a good exemplar,
           eg by explaining that a cinema charges higher prices for adults than for children.

     (b)   Using Table 2, calculate:

           (i)    X (no working required);                                                         [1]

                  X = Gross profit

                  Gross profit = Sales revenue – costs of goods sold

                  =$175 000 – £122 000 = $53 000

                  Award [1] for correct answer with or without working.

           (ii)   the current ratio for 2019 (no working required).                                [1]

                           = 1.23
                      $6800

     (c)   Using Table 2, prepare a balance sheet for the year ending 31 December 2019.            [4]

                                      Balance sheet as of 31 December 2019
                  Net fixed assets                                   63 000

      Award [4] if the candidate constructs an accurate balance sheet (that balances)
      according to the IB prescribed format.

      Award [3] for a largely accurate balance sheet that balances, according to a
      generally accepted format, such as the vertical format above or the horizontal
      model typically used in the United States.

      Award [2] if the candidate constructs a largely recognizable balance sheet but it
      does not balance, or it has two major problems of classification.

      Award [1] if the candidate conveys some idea of what a balance sheet is.

      For full marks, the balance sheet must be dated. Failure to date the balance
      sheet is an error and, therefore, the maximum award that an undated balance
      sheet could receive is [3].

(d)   Explain the possible changes to KPJ’s balance sheet for 2019 if KPJ spent
      $30 000 on a new digital projector.                                                   [2]

      The purchase of a new digital projector will increase net fixed assets by $30 000.
      Award [1] for recognizing that the net fixed assets will increase. Award [1] if the
      candidate then addresses the offset, which could be
          a reduction in cash
          an increase in long-term debt (KPJ takes outa long-term loan).

      Accept any other reasonable suggestion for financing the projector. Do not
      accept a short-term loan or expansion of trade credit.

      The two potential marks for this question are independent of one another. In
      other words, a candidate may address the financing (the candidate suggests
      taking out a bank loan) and receive [1] even if s/he did not mention that net fixed
      assets will increase. Or, the candidate could state that net fixed assets will
      increase but not mention the offset, in which case the candidate would receive
      [1].

      Maximum award: [2].

                                                   Section B
3.   (a)   State two appropriate sources of finance Ben may have used when he first opened
           his vegan food stall.                                                                [2]

           Appropriate sources of finance include:
            Personal savings
            Loan from family or friends
            Small business grant
            Loan from a bank secured by some personal asset of value
            Crowd sourcing.

           Accept any other appropriate sources of finance.

           N.B. A bank loan without any other qualifying information is not appropriate, as
           few banks would make such a loan.

           Award [1] for each appropriate source of finance stated up to [2].

     (b)   Explain one positive impact and one negative impact on BTO as a result of
           having low labour turnover.                                                          [4]

           Positive impacts of low labour turnover include:
            Lower recruitment, induction, and training costs.
            Better customer service (as employees are experienced and know the culture
             of the organization).
            Improve the motivation of the work force.

           Negative impacts of low labour turnover:
            Lack of new ideas.
            Higher labour costs (because of the bonus scheme).

           Accept any other relevant positive negative impact.

           Mark as [2 + 2].

           Award [1] for identification of a positive impact and an additional [1] for
           explanation and application to the stimulus.

           Award [1] for identification of a negative impact and an additional [1] for
           explanation and application to the stimulus.

           Maximum award: [4].

     (c)   Explain one advantage and one disadvantage for BTO as a result of its use of
           social media.                                                                        [4]

           Advantages of using social media include:
            It is relatively low cost (compared to many other forms of promotion).
            Through social media, BTO was able to build a community, which reinforced
             customer loyalty.
                                             – 11 –              N20/3/BUSMT/SP2/ENG/TZ0/XX/M


      Disadvantages of using social media include:
       As a platform, social media forums are relatively closed and do not reach out
         to people other than existing customers of BTO.
       Negative information about BTO has an immediate widespread diffusion
         among BTO’s previously loyal customer base.
       Competitors can post false information.

      Award [1] for identification of an advantage and an additional [1] for explanation
      and application to the stimulus.

      Award [1] for identification of a disadvantage and an additional [1] for explanation
      and application to the stimulus.

      Mark as [2 + 2].

(d)   Discuss Ben’s decision to enlarge the scale of BTO from one restaurant to three
      restaurants.                                                                           [10]

      Advantages of expansion include:
       Leveraging its brand and USP to reach a larger market.
       Potential economies of scale.
       Potentially increased revenue and profits.

      Accept any other relevant advantage.

      Disadvantages of expansion include:
       Loss of control, especially with respect to quality.
       Potential diseconomies of scale.
       BT loses its “small community feel.”
       Increased costs for recruitment, induction, and training.
       New employees may not have the same attention to quality as long-time
         employees.

      Accept any other relevant disadvantage.

      It is expected that candidates provide a conclusion with a substantiated
      judgment.

      Marks should be allocated according to the markbands on page 3.

      For one relevant issue that is one-sided, award up to [3]. For more than one
      relevant issue that is one-sided, award up to a maximum of [4].

      If a candidate addresses only advantages of expansion, award a maximum of [4].

      If a candidate addresses either two advantages of expansion and only one
      disadvantage, or only one advantage of expansion and two disadvantages,
      award a maximum of [5].

      A balanced response is one that provides at least two advantages of expansion
      and two disadvantages of expansion. However, if the candidate does not provide
      substantiated judgments, maximum award of [6].

4.   (a)   State two types of business, other than grocery stores, that operate in the tertiary sector. [2]

           The tertiary sector is the service sector of an economy, including retail outlets.
           Candidates may name any type of service sector business. Do not give credit for
           “online grocery stores” but award a mark for convenience store (or some other
           small shop where some grocery items might be sold).

           Award [1] for each type of business in the service sector identified up to [2].

     (b)   Explain two elements of U-Foods’ marketing mix other than price.                             [4]

           The four Ps of the marketing mix that candidates may write about are place,
           promotion, and product. In the stimulus, place and product can be identified:
            Place: retail stores.
            Product: According to the stimulus, U-Foods sells all-organic foods. High-
              quality, all-organic products are its USP.

           Award [1] for identification of one of the three Ps and an additional [1] for
           application to the stimulus and explanation.

           Mark as [2 + 2].

           N.B. If the candidate mentions promotion, award a maximum of [1], as nothing in
           the stimulus would allow for application. Thus, if a candidate explained promotion
           with some theoretical types and, then correctly explained and applied product,
           the total mark would be [3]: [1] for promotion and [2] for product.

     (c)   Calculate for 2019:

           (i)    NS 507’s gross profit margin (no working required);                                   [1]

                  $5 300 000
                             x 100 = 26.5 % Gross profit margin is 26.5 %
                  20 000 000

                  Award [1] for the correct answer.

           (ii)   NS 507’s net profit before interest and tax (no working required).                    [1]

                  Net profit before interest and tax = 3 % x 20 000 000 = $600 000.

                  Award [1] for the correct answer.

     (d)   Explain one economy of scale, other than purchasing economies of scale, from
           which NS might benefit.                                                                      [2]

           Other economies of scale from which NS might benefit include:
            Marketing economies of scale
            Financial Economies of scale
            Managerial economies of scale
            Human resources economies of scale
            Network economies of scale

           Accept any other relevant economy of scale.

      Award [1] for identification of an appropriate economy of scale and an additional
      [1] for appropriate application to and explanation of the stimulus. Maximum
      award: [2].

(e)   Discuss two possible methods that NS 507 could use to regain lost market share.            [10]

      The stimulus provides some guidance to the students on ways to recover lost
      market share. The fact that sales revenue is down 12 % suggests that NS 507
      has lost some sales to U-Foods. Given that the number of transactions has
      remained the same suggests that some customers continue to shop at NS but
      also go to U-Foods for certain items. One way that NS could attempt to recover
      those lost sales is to determine which specific items have seen their sales go
      down. It is likely that, for these items, shoppers are going to U-Foods. Once NS
      has identified which items customers are going to U-Foods for, NS can make
      modifications: improve the product, alter the price, or have better promotions. A
      disadvantage to this strategy is that it may not work or may be too expensive to
      work. For example, some customers are probably going to U-Foods for locally
      produced organic meats. However, probably few opportunities exist for
      economies of scale when U-Foods (or NS) purchase this type of meat. For
      U-Foods, passing on high costs to customers is probably not a problem. U-Foods
      is more expensive than NS and customers expect that. For NS customers,
      however, prices lower than U-Foods is the expectation. Were NS to start
      charging more, many customers may resist.

      Another strategy is to use more aggressive pricing. NS is a huge firm, and it
      could lower its prices to try to gain more customers. Predatory pricing is probably
      illegal, but NS 507 could, with the backing of the whole organization, be very
      aggressive in its pricing – just short of predatory – to win back customers or the
      specific purchases that are going to U-Foods. The problem with this strategy is
      that NS already has thin margins – typical of the grocery store industry – and
      lowering prices even further may be a problem.

      A third option is to start allowing customers to order online and have home
      delivery. This option would be expensive to set up and operate, and NS would
      lose impulse sales.

      Accept any other relevant way that NS 507 can recover lost market share.

5.   (a)   State two characteristics of a business angel.                                                [2]

           Features of angel investors include:
            Angel investors provide relatively small amounts of finance to early-stage /
             start-up companies (new ventures),
            Is an external source of finance,
            The finance is usually in exchange for equity
            Angel investors typically invest in high risk ventures, ones banks are unlikely
             to lend to.
            Angel investors typically participate in the management/decision-making of the
             company

           Accept any other relevant feature.

           Award [1] for a relevant feature with appropriate description up to a maximum of
           [2].

     (b)   Explain two reasons why Pablo conducted primary market research.                              [4]

           Reasons include:
            To reduce the risk associated with launching a new product (garrapiñada) to
             the Latin American markets in Miami Florida.
            To predict future demand for garrapiñada, which appears very important as
             the market was overwhelmed with positive response.
            Pablo needs up-to-date and relevant data.
            Pablo can further define his target market. Is it only Argentine and Uruguayan
             consumers?
            Some types of primary market research are inexpensive to conduct, which is
             important for a start-up.

           Award [1] for each relevant reason explained and [1] for appropriate application to PP to a
           maximum of [2].

     (c)   Explain one advantage and one disadvantage of using a break-even analysis
           for PP.                                                                                       [4]

           Break-even analysis is a forecasting tool. Advantages of BE include:
            Charts are relatively easy to construct and interpret and Pablo was able to
              make business decisions based on the results such as the doubling of profits.
            It provides a useful guideline to Pablo and allowed him to make decisions
              such as expanding the business to include a second truck.
            It provided guidance to the local Miami bank that helped them with their
              decision to make a loan.

           Accept any other relevant advantage.

           Disadvantages include:
            Break-even analysis/chart assumes that costs and revenues are always
              straight lines, which is unrealistic with costs such as the fuel for the truck.
            The break-even analysis/chart assumes that all peanuts produced are sold,
              which in reality may not be the case. I.e.: Demand at the different markets is
              unlikely to be constant.
            Break-even analysis/chart depends on accuracy of data and assumptions.

           Accept any other relevant disadvantage.

      Award [1] for a disadvantage and [1] for appropriate application to PP to a
      maximum of [2].

(d)   Recommend whether Pablo should choose Option 1 or Option 2.                       [10]

      Option 1, the bank loan:
      Advantages:
       Pablo gets to maintain 100 % ownership of PP. This also means Pablo
        maintains full decision-making power and PP.
       Pablo does not have to share his profits.
       The 10 % interest on the loan is tax deductible.

      Disadvantages:
       There is a risk associated with the loan increasing the gearing ratio to 50 %
       Loan repayments ($10 000 per year) and the burden of the loan can be
         problematic for PP if the BE data is incorrect.
       Pablo and 1 other employee are the sole vendors of the garrapiñada. If
         something were to happen to them or the trucks, paying the loan could be
         difficult.
       Because of the loan repayment, Pablo can only take $10 000 in dividends.

      Option 2, finance from an angel investor:
      Advantages:
       Pablo gets much needed advice from Ana, who has an extensive experience
        in the Latin American food market.
       Pablo can share some of the management roles and responsibilities, which
        would allow him to focus on his truck and selling his products at the market.
       Pablo and PP do not have as much risk. 0 % gearing. Also, he would have no
        loan repayments and any costs associated with borrowing.
       Pablo can take a greater percentage of his profits in the form of dividends
        ($13 000)

      Disadvantages
       Pablo must share his profits.
       Pablo is no longer the sole decision maker, which means decision-making will
         be slower and potential exists for disagreement with Ana.

      It is expected that candidates provide a conclusion with a substantiated

6.    With reference to an organization of your choice, examine the impact of culture on
      organizational ethics.                                                                         [20]

7.    With reference to an organization of your choice, discuss the ways in which innovation
      can influence organizational change.                                                           [20]

8.    With reference to an organization of your choice, examine the impact of globalization
      on marketing strategy.                                                                         [20]

N.B. Although the question asks for the application of one concept on another, it is still
expected that Business Management content will be aligned with the concepts especially the
second concept (the one being acted on).

Please note that candidates can conclude that there was a minimal impact, however it has to
be based on balanced arguments and evaluation.

Additional guidance in relation to the assessment criteria
For each criterion, the aim is to find the descriptor that conveys most accurately the level
attained by the candidate, using the best-fit model. It is not necessary for every single aspect
of a level descriptor to be met for that mark to be awarded.

 The highest level descriptors do not imply faultless performance and should be achievable by a
  candidate.
 A candidate who attains a high level of achievement for one criterion will not necessarily reach high
  levels of achievement for the other criteria and vice versa.

If only one concept is addressed:
 Criteria A, B, C and E: award up to a maximum [3].
 Criterion D: full marks can be awarded.

Where the question asks for impacts of two concepts on content, examiners must allow for
unbalanced treatment of the two concepts throughout a candidate’s response. One concept may be
more significant than the other.

Criterion B
For [2]: “…connection is not developed” should be treated the same as superficial.

Criterion C
1+1 arguments are expected per concepts.
 Questions 6 to 8 require consideration of the impact of one concept on a second concept – therefore
   accept 2+2 arguments for a balanced response.
 Justification is through logic or data.
 For [2] there is no balance as there are no counter arguments at all, or the arguments are all one-
   sided then this would be unjustified.
 For [3] there are some balanced arguments – some of which are justified.

Criterion D
 Introductions need to be concise and related to the question.
 The candidate’s response does not to have explicit headings for each structural element.
 A body is the area in which the substance of arguments occurs. It is usually located between the
   introduction and the conclusion.

 Fit-for-purpose paragraph means that ideas are presented in a clear academic way. For example, one
  idea per paragraph.

Criterion E
 One example of an “individual” could be an individual consumer or an individual manager. However,
   this cannot be considered with a “group” of consumers or a management team.
 For [4], a balanced response: look at the perspectives of both individual and group(s).
 The chosen individual, group needs to be applicable and relevant to the question with specific
   explanation.
 Candidates need to go beyond stating the stakeholder.

Candidates need not explicitly say “stakeholder”.
