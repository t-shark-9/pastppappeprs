General comment to examiners
Please note that the markscheme is provided as guidance for marking. There are many potential and
valid ways in which to approach the questions and examiners need, therefore, to use their judgment
when attributing marks to a candidate’s answers. Examiners are also reminded to accept cultural /
geographical differences in terminology (eg quavers / eighth notes).

Each question is worth [20 marks].

                                              Section A
This criterion concerns the candidate’s ability to:
 question 1 or question 2 – analyse and examine essential musical elements (including form and
   structure) within one of the two prescribed works
 question 3 (HL only) – compare and contrast the two prescribed works, emphasizing the presence of
   any significant musical links.

Marks    Level descriptor
   0     The work does not reach a standard described by the descriptors below.
         The answers, which generally do not address the question, show a minimal level of musical
         understanding. There is limited use of musical evidence, though this is poorly located, or
         none at all. There is limited use of musical terminology or none at all.

  1–4    There is limited use of musical evidence, though this is poorly located, or none at all.
         Musical evidence is never or rarely used. When evidence is given, it is inaccurate, superficial

         instrument(s).
         There is limited use of musical terminology or none at all.
         The responses communicate without the use of musical terminology, or where musical
         terminology is applied, it is generally not relevant and/or inaccurate. However, a rudimentary
         understanding of terminology in relation to the material/topic in question may surface on
         occasion.

        Examiners may refer to the following features of the fourth movement (Finale: Allegro
        molto) to inform their marking. Candidates are not expected to mention every feature in
        order to receive marks within the highest mark bands.

    The movement is a rondo-sonata. The rondo theme recurs always in the tonic key and the
     sonata element is reflected in tonal and thematic development evident primarily in the
     episodes.

       1 -36 – rondo theme: a 1 – 16, b 17 – 30 a 31 36 forming an opening statement in ternary form
        with a cadence to the tonic.

        37 - 73 - episode beginning in tonic and modulating through other keys in the manner of a
        sonata development incorporating motivic features of the rondo theme.

    74 – 99 begins with a bar pause before the entry of a second subject theme being part of a
     second subject group from which development occurs. The key returns to D major, the
     dominant typical of sonata form.

 100 – 141 beat 1 - Four-bar link to return of the rondo theme. The return of the theme itself is
  brief; the subsequent bars contain some chromatic harmonic development in the reprise of the
  first episode.

 141 beat 2 – 181 After a link, the rondo theme returns in its tonic key and undergoes further
  harmonic development from the change to the tonic minor from bar 154. The dominant is
  reached at bar 177 and links to the reintroduction of the rondo theme in the tonic from bar
  181b2. Bars 100-181 relate to the development section in sonata form.

 181 beat 2 – 209 rondo theme in tonic ending on the dominant followed again by a bar pause
  followed by…

    210 – 225 beat 1 - …second subject theme, first heard in the dominant, but now in the tonic at
    bar 210, as in a recapitulation of sonata form.

 225b2 – 239 beat 1 rondo theme in the tonic and thematically developed with a key change to E
  flat approached by way of a nine-bar pedal point on the tonic played by horns and timpani. The
  modulations are chromatic and culminate in the diminished 7th chord of D minor in second
  inversion.

 239 beat 4 – 268 coda/episode – The harmony moves towards the tonic which is established by
  bar 249 and a perfect cadence.

2. Rhapsody on a Theme of Paganini, Op 43 by Sergei Rachmaninoff
     Examine how the theme (bars 33-56) is used in the final variation (XXIV) of Rhapsody on a Theme
     of Paganini. Refer to rhythm, melody, harmony and orchestration in your discussion.

     The answers should refer to the prescribed work.

     Answers should address the question and be consistent and convincing in their display of musical
     understanding. Evidence should be located by using bar(s)/measure(s), rehearsal number(s),
     and/or instrument(s) in the works/extracts. Musical terminology should be effective in its use.

     Answers should address all four elements identified in the question in order to access the higher
     marks.


    Observations and analysis should provide evidence of the connection between the theme and the
     variation in question.

    N.B. For the benefit of examiners, references to variation XXIV in the mark scheme assume the
     first bar of the variation as bar 1 [a tempo un poco meno mosso]. When candidates quote
     original/different bar numbers examiners should calculate that the quoted bar is correct.

     A: Rhythm and instrumentation


    The semiquaver motif of the theme is changed to a triplet variant from bar 1 of variation XXIV
     played by the flutes and harp and answered by oboes, passed to clarinets. The motif returns in
     its original semiquaver form from bar 32 in the Più vivo section.

    Use of fragmented lines complements the piano part, adding colour to orchestration and
     continued reference to the original theme.

    Più vivo (bar 27) - three four bar sections: 27 – 30 chromatic motif on the last quaver of each bar
     in the strings; 31 – 34 four semi-quaver completed motif between strings and upper woodwinds;
     35-38 similar to 27-30 but not chromatic. The section then builds towards the fortissimo and
     sforzando section at bar 39.

    Bar 39: the varied theme is presented in the piano with a group of four semiquavers followed by
     triplet quavers. Under this, the brass, pesante, present the Dies Irae theme [first heard in
     Variation VII].

    Tutti orchestration with 3 against 2 recurring rhythm, the woodwind broken chords, sustained
     string lines, strident brass and fortissimo percussion, create a climactic build leading to the end of
     the work.

   Candidates may also mention some of the following details:

B: Melodic and motivic

    Bar 1 on: triplet motif from the first part of the theme on the flutes, interjecting at the end of each
     triplet figure played by the piano.

    The motif is in oboes at bar 4, ascending as a semi-inversion.

    The triplet figure continues as interjections from the woodwinds, but now based on the answering
     phrase of the original theme.

    The semiquaver motif from the theme is played by the flutes at bar 32, imitated from strings in bar
     33, then together in bar 34. The strings reduce it further to a two-note semiquaver figure from bar
     35 building toward the ff tutti section at bar 40.

    The variation ends with the piano solo referencing the semiquaver motif from the theme, at p
     dynamic supported by the horns and strings on the tonic.

    The original theme is presented by the violins at bar 33 in 2/4 time, accompanied by single notes
     from the piano solo that outline the harmony.

B: Harmonic

    Harmonic progressions are mostly traceable from the piano solo which is often formed from
     broken chord patterns: it alternates between tonic and dominant chords before moving to D
     minor and ending on the tonic.

    Presented by the piano, the theme is in A minor until bar 55, where a shift to the parallel major
     occurs.

    Chromaticism, including chromatic sequences, is characteristic such as from bar 5 where melodic
     dissonance is also evident [A/G#, for instance in bar 9].

 The tonal relationship is also sometimes tritonal such as from bar 39 [Dies Irae] which begins on
  A minor, passes through several keys (including Eb) to a cadence on D major in bar 47

 The perfect cadence which ends the work is preceded by E flat with a dissonant A natural in the
  bar 52.

3. Symphony No 94 in G major (“The Surprise”) by Joseph Haydn and Rhapsody on a Theme of
Paganini, Op 43 by Sergei Rachmaninoff

Compare the orchestration of the second movement (Andante) of Haydn’s Symphony No 94 in G major
with the orchestration of variations VII and XIII of Rachmaninoff’s Rhapsody on a Theme of Paganini.


     (HL only)

     The answers should refer to both prescribed works. The comparing and contrasting of significant
     musical links must focus on orchestration.

     Answers should be consistent and convincing in their display of musical understanding and should
     be backed up by clearly located evidence. Musical terminology should be effective in its use.

     highest mark bands and they may also refer to features not listed. All valid responses
     should be rewarded.

    Differences
    Haydn uses a standard classical orchestra with double woodwind, horns, trumpets and timpani.
     Rachmaninov uses a large orchestra with piccolo, cor anglais, large brass section with tuba,
     percussion including glockenspiel, harp and piano.
    In the Rachmaninov the piano is often featured soloistically.
    Contrasts of timbre and texture are more marked in the Rachmaninov.
    A variety of orchestral textures is used e.g. Haydn opens with strings only in what is effectively a
     monophonic texture; that contrasts with the loud tuttis for example at bar 23 and the more
     elaborate orchestration from bar 57 which leads to the first violins playing a single line melody
     into the Maggiore. The piano in Variation XII is mainly homophonic in block chords with melodic
     additions forming what might be termed ‘homophonically supported melody’ but the density of the
     orchestration is sparse.

  Similarities

 Both composers state the main material simply; either homophonically or in unison/octaves
 Share motifs/themes between different groups of instruments e.g. Var VII (7th bar of R18)
  between w/wd and upper strings, Var XIII theme in unison strings with piano interjections.
  In the Haydn the theme begins in violins and moves to w/wd frpm bat 29. Also a tutti presentation
  Towards the end of the Minore.
 Unison/octaves in woodwinds and strings: Variation XIII and in Andante bb. 62-70, bassoon and
  bass.
 Both composers make use of the orchestral tutti and doubling in unison or octaves to mix
  instrumental timbre as the in Andante Bar 16 and bb. 49-52 where wind instruments double the
  strings. In Variation VII the cello doubles the bassoons.
 The themes in both works are decorated with countermelodies as in the Haydn (Vln 1 bar 34)
  And in Var XIII (R35) between w/wd and strings.
 Both composers exploit independent voices for timbral variety; in the Andante (bar 57 onwards)
  the strings present a decorative version of the theme whilst the woodwinds outline the triadic first
  bar of the theme. In Var VII the melody is fragmented over piano block chords and in Var XIII the
  woodwinds, strings and piani form a three-part texture.
 Both composers use timpani but sparingly; in the Andante to strengthen tutti chords and in Var
  VII create a simple antiphonal effect.

     Musical context
     Dmitri Shostakovitch (1906 – 1975)

       Shostakovitch was a Soviet composer of the twentieth century and wrote numerous works in all
        forms including fifteen string quartets, opera, music for film and fifteen symphonies

       The style is tonal and neo-classical but encompasses other stylistic references ranging from
        vaudeville, honky-tonk and Mahler.

       The musical motif (DSCH = D, E flat, C, B the letters of which represent the composer’s own
        name) of the String Quartet 8 is one which appears in many other works such as the G minor
        Piano Trio and Symphony No 10

       Shostakovitch’s difficult relationship with the Soviet government, particularly under Stalin, was
        reflected through his music.
