                          A student talks about her
                        experience of homeschooling
         Elena Kervitsky, Contributor
         Student in Maryland, USA



         I left school in the third grade1                      Removed for copyright reasons
         because it is difficult to learn when
         there are 30 or more kids in each
         class. Most students don’t get the
     5   attention they need for a proper
         education.
         With homeschooling, you can learn as slow or as fast as you want. You must learn the required
         topics but you can choose what you learn on top of that. Your choice is not limited to the five or
         less options you get as extra classes if you are in school.
    10   Someone who is in a school has a very restricting schedule — you have an exact amount of
         sick days or snow days2 and holidays. A benefit of homeschooling is that you can work when
         you want so you can take a trip at any time of the year. I have been all over the world thanks to
         my choice of education.
         In most schools, you learn with a textbook, but homeschoolers also learn with hands-on learning.
    15   It is difficult to have this type of learning in a classroom because of the number of students, but
         for homeschoolers it’s an effective and exciting way to learn.
         Some people think that homeschoolers have no social life. However, most homeschoolers take
         classes with other kids — sports or arts classes usually. In fact, I have met some of my best friends
         at classes like those. With homeschooling, you meet some really cool people, and you learn a lot
    20   from people who are different from you.
         Homeschooling requires a lot of discipline. Once a year, all homeschoolers meet with a teacher
         who reviews the work they have done that year. You either pass or get a warning. If you get a
         warning, you have not done enough work and they will expect you to do a lot more of it the next
         year. If you don’t pass the next year, you will be sent back to school, and no one who has enjoyed
    25   homeschooling wants that. Homeschooling has its ups and downs, but it is an amazing experience
         altogether.

         Britain’s gender pay gap
         starts with pocket money
         By Magdalena Mis

         ... The gender pay gap ... between women and men’s.
         earnings starts in childhood in Britain with girls
         receiving 20 percent less pocket money than boys,
         according to a [recent online] survey ... [of 2000 children
    5    in the UK undertaken by the market research agency
         Childwise].

         Boys aged five to 16 receive an average allowance of
         10.70 pounds ... per week, while girls [of] the same age get just
         8.50 pounds ... , according to ... [the] report. ...

  10     The pay gap grows to 30 percent as children get older, with boys aged 11 to 16 receiving 17.80 pounds
         ... each week, while girls receive almost a third less with an average of 12.50 pounds, ... the report said.

         [There are] “an early gender imbalance in the way parents educate their children about
         money matters and financial independence,” said Jenny Ehren, Childwise research manager.

         “The challenge for parents is to avoid inadvertently perpetuating these gender divisions
  15     themselves, and to help children learn the skills needed to be a confident and independent
         adult,” she said in a statement.

         Girls seemed to ... [receive less money] than boys and were more likely to have things bought for them.
         ... [This approach] helped to bridge the pay gap but also ... [partially explained it], the report said.

         Parents were more likely to hand out cash to the boys while managing money on [the] girls’
  20     behalf.

         British boys were more likely than girls to receive some kind of regular income while
         girls were more likely to receive no cash at all, the report said.

         Sam Smethers of The Fawcett Society, a campaign group promoting women’s ... [employment]
         rights, ... said [the] gender pay gap between boys and girls reflected the situation they face in
  25     adult life.

         “These figures reveal that we undervalue girls from a very early age. What chance do they
         have at work?”

         According to [The] Fawcett [Society], ... women in Britain were paid 13.9 percent less than
         men. [The group has calculated that] at the current rate, it will take another 62 years before
  30     women’s work is valued as much as that of men. ...




                                                                     Turn over / Tournez la page / Véase al dorso
