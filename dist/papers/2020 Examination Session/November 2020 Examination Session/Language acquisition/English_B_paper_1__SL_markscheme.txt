Criterion A: Language

How successfully does the candidate command written language?
• To what extent is the vocabulary appropriate and varied?
• To what extent are the grammatical structures varied?
• To what extent does the accuracy of the language contribute to effective communication?

  Marks                                         Level descriptor
     0       The work does not reach a standard described by the descriptors below.
             Command of the language is limited.
             Vocabulary is sometimes appropriate to the task.
    1–3
             Basic grammatical structures are used.
             Language contains errors in basic structures. Errors interfere with communication.
             Command of the language is partially effective.
             Vocabulary is appropriate to the task.
             Some basic grammatical structures are used, with some attempts to use more
    4–6
             complex structures.
             Language is mostly accurate for basic structures, but errors occur in more complex
             structures. Errors at times interfere with communication.
             Command of the language is effective and mostly accurate.
             Vocabulary is appropriate to the task, and varied.
    7–9      A variety of basic and more complex grammatical structures is used.
             Language is mostly accurate. Occasional errors in basic and in complex grammatical
             structures do not interfere with communication.
             Command of the language is mostly accurate and very effective.
             Vocabulary is appropriate to the task, and varied, including the use of idiomatic
             expressions.
  10–12
             A variety of basic and more complex grammatical structures is used effectively.
             Language is mostly accurate. Minor errors in more complex grammatical structures
             do not interfere with communication.


Language
Not all errors have the same importance, and examiners should bear this in mind. Some errors
affect the communication of meaning significantly, and others do not. Also, some errors indicate a
fundamental lack of command of the language, while others may simply indicate a moment of
forgetfulness.

SLIPS – mistakes at all levels of difficulty, but erratic and occasional – eg the candidate normally
forms past tenses well, but occasionally forgets “-ed”.

FLAWS – errors occur more regularly, particularly in certain structures – eg past tenses are formed
correctly quite often, but are not really reliable, and there may be basic confusions (eg past simple
versus present perfect).

GAPS – some structures are rarely correct, or simply don’t appear – eg the past tenses are
needed, but do not appear.

Criterion B: Message
To what extent does the candidate fulfil the task?
  • How relevant are the ideas to the task?
  • To what extent are ideas developed?
  • To what extent do the clarity and organization of ideas contribute to the successful delivery of
    the message?

The “descriptor unpacked” explain the assessment criteria in greater detail. Where a candidate’s
response does not correspond exactly to a single mark band, the statements in bold should be
used as a guide for the ‘best fit’ approach.

Note: When marking candidate responses, keep in mind that neither the factual accuracy of the
information presented, nor the validity of the candidates’ personal opinions, are being assessed.
Therefore, scripts that are factually inaccurate should not be marked down, provided the ideas
presented have coherence and are sufficiently developed.



Criterion C: Conceptual understanding

To what extent does the candidate demonstrate conceptual understanding?
   •       To what extent is the choice of text type appropriate to the task?
   •       To what extent are register and tone appropriate to the context, purpose and audience of
           the task?
   •       To what extent does the response incorporate the conventions of the chosen text type?

              task.
              The response fully incorporates the conventions of the chosen text type.



Note: Examiners must balance all three elements in criterion C (choice of text type, appropriateness
of tone and register, and use of text type conventions) to arrive at the final mark.

Question specific guidance (Criterion B and C)

Task 1

 You recently met a business owner who thinks that after-school activities are more useful than
 lessons. You found his/her ideas interesting and you want to share them with the other students
 at your school. Write a text describing and discussing the business owner’s ideas in more detail.

 Interview                         Online forum posting                Proposal


Criterion B:

• Focus should remain on ‘after-school activities’ in relation to lessons, rather than activities or
  leisure time at large.
• While the question clearly indicates that the business owner is in favour of “after school
  activities” which are more useful than lessons, it is expected that some scripts cater for the
  benefits of lessons as another part of the argument.
• While having detailed information about the business owner is not the focus of the question, it is
  expected to have a brief introduction about name, position, company, type of business, etc.
• ‘describe” and “discuss” may be presented in an overlapping manner. Thus, it may not be
  expected to have scripts addressing each aspect separately as long as the script presents the
  ideas clearly and evaluates them effectively.

Criterion C:

Choice of text type:

                            Text type    Rationale
Appropriate                 Interview    The text type is suitable for sharing the ideas of
                                         another person first-hand with a large audience (i.e.
                                         the other students at the school).
Generally appropriate       Online forum The text type is suitable for sharing the ideas of
                            posting      another person but it is typically used to communicate
                                         with an undefined group of people. The choice may be
                                         considered “appropriate” if the response makes clear
                                         the posting is on a school forum.
Generally inappropriate     Proposal     The text type is usually used to make a proposal,
                                         rather than to share ideas. It is usually read only by
                                         the person(s) that the text is sent to.

Note: If a response makes the context, audience and purpose of the writing clear, and these
conform to the task, the “generally appropriate” text type may be considered “appropriate”, or the
“generally inappropriate” text type considered “generally appropriate”.


Register and tone:
• Semi-formal register, probably with flashes of informality.
• Excited, engaging and serious tone.

Please refer to the appendix for a list of text type conventions.
                                                 –7–                N20/2/ABENG/SP1/ENG/TZ0/XX/M


Task 2

 You have written the words for a song but you do not play a musical instrument. Therefore, you
 want to find a musician with similar tastes who can set your words to music. Write a text to
 explain what your song lyrics are about and describe the type of musician you hope to work with.

 Interview                         Leaflet                          Online forum posting


Criterion B:

• ‘The musician you hope to work with’ does not necessitate the writer mentions a specific name
  or a real music figure. What is expected is reference to the similar tastes and a clear
  explanation of the type of the musician to work with based on these interests.
• It is not expected to have the song lyrics produced in the script. ‘What your song lyrics are
  about’ entails an explanation of topic, theme, aspects, or embedded into the personal interests
  of the writer.
• Two elements are required in the question: ‘explanation of what the song lyrics are about ‘ +
  description of the type of musician’. There does not need to be equal space devoted to each of
  the two, but none of them should be left minimal (barely mentioned in a single sentence) or
  completely ignored.

Criterion C:

Choice of text type:

                            Text type        Rationale
Appropriate                 Online forum     The text type is suitable for advertising something that
                            posting          you require, to as large a group of people as possible
                                             (for best possible chance of being successful in
                                             finding what you require).
Generally appropriate       Leaflet          The text type is suitable for advertising something that
                                             you require, but the range of people that it can reach
                                             is limited by geography. The choice may be
                                             considered “appropriate” if it is clear that the leaflet is
                                             addressing a mass audience.
Generally inappropriate     Interview        The text type is usually used to communicate the
                                             ideas of another person, rather than to advertise
                                             something that you require.

Note: If a response makes the context, audience and purpose of the writing clear, and these
conform to the task, the “generally appropriate” text type may be considered “appropriate”, or the
“generally inappropriate” text type considered “generally appropriate”.


Register and tone:
• Semi-formal register, with some flashes of formality.
• Serious and engaging.

Task 3

 Your school, which is in an English-speaking country, is planning to offer beginners English
 classes to help new overseas students settle into school life. Your school principal has asked all
 English B students to recommend useful topics for these lessons. Write a text offering your ideas
 for such lessons and explaining why they would be helpful to the new students.

 Leaflet                              Letter                        Proposal


Criterion B:

• The school’s plan to offer English classes need not be explained in great detail since it is
  assumed the audience of the communication know about it already. However, it is needed
  briefly to set the reason for writing the proposal.
• These lessons/ideas need to be focused on helping overseas students settle into school life.
  This could be through referring to activities, learning the language, participating in festivals, etc.
• It is expected that the ‘topics’ or ideas for such lessons’ should be plural i.e. that there should be
  2 or more distinguishable topics/ideas. If there is really only one idea, and this is very general
  and superficial, script will be marked down.
• Two elements are required in the question: ‘offering ideas’ + ‘explaining why they would be
  helpful’. There does not need to be equal space devoted to each of the two, but none of them
  should be left minimal (barely mentioned in a single sentence) or completely ignored.

Criterion C:

Choice of text type:

                             Text type         Rationale
Appropriate                  Proposal          The text type is suitable for making a proposal, to be
                                               read by the individual that it is submitted to.

Generally appropriate        Letter            The text type is suitable for communicating with an
                                               individual, but it is not necessarily used to make
                                               proposals. The choice may be considered
                                               “appropriate” if the response makes clear that the
                                               purpose of the writing is to propose.
Generally inappropriate      Leaflet           The text type is typically used to inform or raise
                                               awareness among a mass audience. It is not usually
                                               used to make a proposal to an individual.

Note: If a response makes the context, audience and purpose of the writing clear, and these
conform to the task, the “generally appropriate” text type may be considered “appropriate”, or the
“generally inappropriate” text type considered “generally appropriate”.


Register and tone:
• Formal register
• Serious and convincing tone
