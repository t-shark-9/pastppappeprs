      (c)   Construct an algorithm in pseudocode for reversing the queue using a stack data structure.
            You may assume that the data in the queue is input and a new empty stack is created.
            Only the standard queue and stack operations are allowed.                                 [5]

      Consider the following recursive method:

      mystery(N)
          if N>0 then

13.   Images in computers are stored as two-dimensional arrays.

      A black-and-white image (Figure 1) is stored as a 10 × 10 two-dimensional array named
      MAT (Figure 2).

      Each element of MAT holds a number for a colour; 1 represents the colour black and 0
      represents the colour white.

      In an application, the black-and-white image can be inverted (all white pixels are changed
      to black, and all black pixels are changed to white).

      Method invert(N,A)accepts a positive integer N and an N × N two-dimensional array A that
      holds the data for a simple black-and-white image; it returns the inverted N × N two-dimensional
      array A.

      (a)   Construct an algorithm in pseudocode for the method invert(N,A).[3]

(Question 13 continued)

     In the application, it is also possible to rotate an image clockwise by 90 degrees (90°).
     For example, when the simple black-and-white image is rotated, the corresponding
     10 × 10 two-dimensional array MAT is updated.

     This would mean the first row of the original MAT is the last column in the rotated MAT,
     the second row is the second-to-last last column, … and the last row is the first column.

     Consider the following algorithm fragment:

     K=input()
     loop for M=0 to K mod 4 - 1
         A=rotate(N,A)
     end loop

     where:

     y N is an integer and A is the N × N two-dimensional array that holds data about an image
     y K(K>=0) is an integer showing how many times the image should be rotated
     y method rotate(N,A) accepts an integer N and an N × N two-dimensional array A
       representing an image. It returns an N × N two-dimensional array representing the image
       rotated clockwise by 90°.

     (b)   (i)	State the number of degrees by which the image will be rotated if the input value
                of K is 3.                                                                                    [1]

           (ii)   Outline why it is more efficient that the loop in the given algorithm fragment
                  executes (K mod 4) times instead of K times. You may give an appropriate
                  example in your answer.                                                                     [2]

(Question 13 continued)

     The algorithm for method rotate(N,A) uses an additional N × N two-dimensional array,
     named B. The N × N dimensional array B is initialized and updated using the values from A to
     represent the image rotated clockwise by 90°.

     (c)   Construct the algorithm in pseudocode for the method rotate(N,A) described above.          [3]

     To avoid inefficient use of memory, a new algorithm for the method rotate(N,A) is constructed.

     The N × N two-dimensional array A should be rotated clockwise by 90°, without the use of
     any additional arrays.

     One way of rotating the two-dimensional array A clockwise by 90° is to transpose A, and then
     reverse each row of A.

     The transpose of A is formed by turning all the rows of A into columns. For example, the
     value in the first row and third column (A[1][3]) is swapped with the value in the third row
     and first column (A[3][1]).

     (d)   Construct the new algorithm in pseudocode for the method rotate(N,A)described above. [6]
