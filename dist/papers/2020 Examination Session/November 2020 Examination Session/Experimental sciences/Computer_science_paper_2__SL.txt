Option A — Databases

1.   The Driving Licensing Agency stores information about individuals who hold a driving license
     and/or own vehicles.

     The following rules apply:
     y Each individual may only hold one driving license.
     y Each individual may own more than one vehicle.
     y Each vehicle may be owned by one individual only.

     (a)   Construct the entity-relationship diagram (ERD) that shows the relationship between
           the individual, their driving license, and their vehicle(s).                                   [2]

     When an individual applies for a driving license, they have to complete a license application form.
     The following is an extract from that form:

                       Figure 1: Extract from driving license application form


                         Surname

                         First name(s)

                         Mr        Mrs        Miss         Ms

                         Other title                            Male          Female
                                           Day        Month            Year
                         Date of birth


     (b)   Explain why Date of birth has been separated into three fields.                                [3]

     The data in the form shown above is stored in the Person table. The license application form
     also requires an individual’s medical information. This is stored in a table called PersonMedical.

     The following extract is a sample of the medical questions that are asked.

       Figure 2: A sample of the medical questions asked on the license application form


                         Have you ever had any of the
                         following conditions?                       No          Yes

                         If you have answered “Yes”, please tick all the appropriates boxes.

                         Epilepsy
                         Fits or blackouts
                         Repeated attacks of sudden disabling giddiness
                         Diabetes controlled by insulin

Option B — Modelling and simulation

4.   EnviroBuild is a construction company that recently purchased land. It has permission to
     build either small houses or large houses but not both types of house. The maximum number
     of small houses that can be built is 10. The maximum number of large houses that can be
     built is five.

     The cost of building the houses is calculated using a model with the following three variables:

     House_Type:      The type of house (small or large).

     House_Num:       The number of houses to be built.

     Profit:          The total sales revenue minus the land costs, labour costs and material costs.

     (a)   Identify the data types for the House_Type, House_Num and Profit variables.                 [3]

     The decision whether to build small houses or large houses is a purely financial one and is
     based on the following information:
     y A single payment of $500 000 for the land, regardless of whether 10 small houses or five
       large houses are to be built.
     y The revenue from each house sale will be $220 000 for a small house and $400 000 for a
       large house.
     y The labour costs will be $2500 per day, regardless of the type of house built.
     y It will take 17 days to build each small house and 23 days to build each large house.
       Houses are built sequentially so that they can be sold as soon as they are completed.
     y The material costs will be $100 000 for each small house and $190 000 for each large house.

     (b)   Construct a spreadsheet model that shows the total profit for the chosen type of house.
           The user must input the House_Type and House_Num to calculate the total profit.             [6]

     (c)   Outline two validation tests that should be included in the test plan for this
           spreadsheet model.                                                                          [4]

     To finance this project, EnviroBuild took out a bank loan of $400 000 and will be required to
     pay interest on this loan. The project starts on 1 January 2021.

     The following steps are used to calculate the total profit:
     y Read the Profit variable and the No_of_Days variable from the spreadsheet model in (b).
     y Calculate the number of months that the project will take.
       ◦ There are no partial months.
       ◦ For example, if a project finished on 1 July 2021, the loan interest rates will include
           July: the project will last for 7 months.
     y The rate of interest on the bank loan of $400 000 is 1 % per month.
     y The land tax is $500 per month.

     (d)   Construct the pseudocode that will calculate the profit after these additional costs have
           been considered. You can introduce any new variables, if necessary.                         [5]

5.   Global warming is a term used to describe the increase in mean global temperatures.

     There have been numerous computer simulations developed to predict the effects of
     global warming. One simulation is NASA’s Virtual Earth System Laboratory (VESL), which
     allows users to see how climate change affects glacier size, global sea level and changes to
     the coastline.

     The VESL runs simulations in real time and is an abstraction of reality.

     (a)   (i)	Outline what is meant by a real-time simulation in the context of a glacier size
                simulation.[2]

           (ii)   Outline what is meant by the statement “the VESL simulation is an abstraction
                  of reality”.                                                                        [2]

     A recent study reported that previous simulations of predicted global sea levels for 2100 were
     highly inaccurate.

     (b)   Outline two reasons why predictions of global sea levels from simulations may not
           be accurate.                                                                               [4]

     (c)   NASA has decided to make its simulation software available for other scientists as well
           as members of the public.

           Evaluate the social and ethical implications of this decision.                             [6]

6.   Simulation software can be used to produce a 3D visualization of rising sea levels that
     change as the user alters the percentage of ice that has melted.

                             Figure 3: 3D visualization of rising sea levels




     (a)   (i)	Define the term visualization.[1]

           (ii)   Identify how a 2D visualization could be used in this scenario.                     [1]

     (b)   Explain the benefits of using visualization when simulating rising sea levels.             [5]

     Once the 3D visualization has been rendered, when the user drags a slider bar to simulate
     the amount of ice that has melted, the visualization is re-rendered without any delay.

     File name: index.html
     <!DOCTYPE html>
     <html>
     <body>
     <script>
           function setVar(){
           var subject=document.getElementById("kippers").value;
           document.getElementById("subj").innerHTML = subject;
           }

     </body>
     </html>

     (a)   (i)	State the output of the index.html file in the web browser.                              [2]

           (ii)   Describe the processing that takes place when the user inputs “Pugh” into the
                  text box and then uses the clickme button.                                             [3]

     When a student enrolls, they must enter their name on a web page. Before being added to
     the database, the system should check that the name typed is not blank and that it has not
     already been added to the database.

     (b)   Explain why these two validation checks occur on different computer systems.                  [4]

     Consider the following URL:

(Option C continued)

8.   The internet and World Wide Web are often considered to be the same, or the terms are
     used in the wrong context.

     (a)   Distinguish between the internet and the World Wide Web.                                   [2]

     Many organizations produce computer-based solutions that implement open standards.

     (b)   Outline two advantages of using open standards.	                                           [4]

     A search engine is software that allows a user to search for information. The most commonly
     used search algorithms are the PageRank and HITS algorithms.

     (c)   Outline why a search engine using the HITS algorithm might produce different page
           ranking from one using the PageRank algorithm.                                             [2]

     Web crawlers browse the World Wide Web.

     (d)   Explain how data stored in a meta-tag is used by a web crawler. 	                          [3]


9.   The World Wide Web can be divided into three categories: the surface web, the dark web
     and the deep web.

     (a)   Distinguish between the surface web and the deep web.                                      [2]

     The dark web is only accessible by using specialist software, such as TOR and I2P. Many users
     of the dark web use it to protect their anonymity.

     (b)   Explain how a user’s anonymity can be maintained while accessing the dark web.             [3]

     Many users of the dark web use peer-2-peer (P2P) networks for activities like torrent
     streaming. This opens up ports on the computer to upload and download data.

     (c)   Explain why users have concerns about opening up ports to upload and download data.        [3]

     (d)   The founders of the World Wide Web intended it to be a decentralized and democratic
           environment.

           To what extent have the aspirations of the founders of the World Wide Web been met?        [6]

Option D — Object-oriented programming

10.   A company provides car parking services in large cities and needs a computer system to
      keep track of the number of vehicles using its parking areas.

      When a vehicle arrives, its registration plate is recorded on the system and it is allocated a
      number that identifies where it should park. When the vehicle leaves, that space is made
      available for other vehicles to use.

      Vehicles are identified by their unique registration plate, which is an alphanumeric code of
      eight characters (eg X1234567). This is clearly displayed on the vehicle.

      A programmer created the classes ParkingArea and Vehicle to model the above situation.

      public class ParkingArea {
          private Vehicle vehicles[];
          private String name;

           ParkingArea(String name, int capacity) {
               this.name = name;
               if (capacity > 300) capacity = 300;
               this.vehicles = new Vehicle[capacity];
           }

           String getName() {
               return name;
           }

           public int getCapacity() {
               return vehicles.length;
           }

           public int findVehicle(String reg) {
               //find where the vehicle is located in the array and
               //return the index not yet written
           }
      }

           Vehicle class.                                                                                   [2]

     (d)   (i)	Construct code to create an instance of the Vehicle class that has a registration
                of X1234567.[2]

           (ii)   Construct code that sets the colour of the object created in part (i) as black.           [2]

11.   (a)	Construct the method addVehicle(Vehicle v) that will add a vehicle to the first
           empty position of the array vehicles[] and return the position (ie the index of the
           array) at which it has added the car. If it is not possible to fit the vehicle into the array
           then it should return -1.[6]

      (b)   Outline two differences between inheritance and aggregation.                                 [4]

      Two further classes, Car and Motorbike, are created.

      public class Car extends Vehicle{
          public static double hourlyFee=3.5;
          public double pay(int hours) {
              //code to calculate and return the complete price

      public class Motorbike extends Vehicle{
          public static double hourlyFee=2.5;
          public double pay(int hours) {
              //code to calculate and return the complete price
          }
      }

      (c)   Construct a UML diagram that shows the relationships between the ParkingArea,
            Vehicle, Motorbike and Car classes. There is no need to include the attributes or
            methods of each class.                                                                       [4]

      The method pay in the Vehicle class returns the administration fee (which is only part of the
      total price), while the method pay of the Car class calculates the total price for a car staying
      in the parking area.

      (d)   (i)	Construct the method pay in the Vehicle class that returns the admin fee
                 stored in the variable AdminFee if the vehicle has stayed for five hours or less;
                 otherwise, it returns 0.                                                                [2]

            (ii)   Construct the method pay in the Car class, where it uses the vehicle method pay
                   but adds the charge for the amount of time spent in the parking area.          [2]

      The array vehicles[] in the ParkingArea class is used to store instances of the Car or
      Motorbike class.

      (e)   Outline why Vehicle is a valid type for this array.                                          [2]

12.   The management of the company will launch a new scheme to give every 50th car driver and
      every 60th motorcyclist a free coffee voucher. The code for printing this voucher has already
      been created and is activated by calling the static method Vouchers.printCoffeeVoucher().

      A getKind() method has already been added to the Vehicle class, which returns a char
      value indicating whether it is a car (c) or a motorbike (m).

      (a)   Describe, without writing code, any changes required to the addVehicle method
            and the ParkingArea class to make the new voucher scheme work.                               [5]

      One test performed on the finished code was defined as follows:

                                   Test data          Vouchers printed

                                   29 cars                    0

                                   130 motorbikes             2

      (b)   Identify three other tests you might perform on the completed code to prove that it
            functions correctly.                                                                         [3]

      The removeVehicle method of the ParkingArea class searches in the array for a Vehicle
      object with a specified registration plate, then removes it by setting that array index to null.

      The method returns a reference to the Vehicle object that has been removed from the array,
      or null if no matching registration plate was found.

      (c)   Construct the removeVehicle method.                                                          [6]
