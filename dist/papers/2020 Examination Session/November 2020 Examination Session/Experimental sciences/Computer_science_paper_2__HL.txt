Option A — Databases

1.   The Driving Licensing Agency stores information about individuals who hold a driving license
     and/or own vehicles.

     The following rules apply:
     y Each individual may only hold one driving license.
     y Each individual may own more than one vehicle.
     y Each vehicle may be owned by one individual only.

     (a)   Construct the entity-relationship diagram (ERD) that shows the relationship between
           the individual, their driving license, and their vehicle(s).                                   [2]

     When an individual applies for a driving license, they have to complete a license application form.
     The following is an extract from that form:

                       Figure 1: Extract from driving license application form


                         Surname

                         First name(s)

                         Mr        Mrs        Miss         Ms

                         Other title                            Male          Female
                                           Day        Month            Year
                         Date of birth


     (b)   Explain why Date of birth has been separated into three fields.                                [3]

     The data in the form shown above is stored in the Person table. The license application form
     also requires an individual’s medical information. This is stored in a table called PersonMedical.

     The following extract is a sample of the medical questions that are asked.

       Figure 2: A sample of the medical questions asked on the license application form


                         Have you ever had any of the
                         following conditions?                       No          Yes

                         If you have answered “Yes”, please tick all the appropriates boxes.

                         Epilepsy
                         Fits or blackouts
                         Repeated attacks of sudden disabling giddiness
                         Diabetes controlled by insulin

     (c)   Explain two reasons why medical information should not be stored in the Person table.        [6]

     (d)   Outline two issues caused by storing redundant data.                                         [4]

     (e)   Outline two situations where data stored by the Driving Licensing Agency may need to
           be open to interrogation by other parties.                                                   [4]


2.   Billetmania is an online company that sells tickets for theatre performances and music concerts.
     After a customer has chosen their seats, they can pay for the tickets through a secure online
     payment system. Once the transaction has been completed, the customer receives an
     email receipt.

     (e)   Outline why a single-field primary key is not always an appropriate solution for
           normalized databases.                                                                             [2]


4.   The Criminal Information Support System (CISS) project is being developed to provide the
     Puerto Rico Police (PRP) with countrywide access to a centralized data warehouse. The data
     warehouse will be created from the databases of several police departments.

     (a)   Identify two differences between a data warehouse and a database.                                 [2]

Option B — Modelling and simulation

5.   EnviroBuild is a construction company that recently purchased land. It has permission to
     build either small houses or large houses but not both types of house. The maximum number
     of small houses that can be built is 10. The maximum number of large houses that can be
     built is five.

     The cost of building the houses is calculated using a model with the following three variables:

     House_Type:      The type of house (small or large).

     House_Num:       The number of houses to be built.

     Profit:          The total sales revenue minus the land costs, labour costs and material costs.

     (a)   Identify the data types for the House_Type, House_Num and Profit variables.                 [3]

     The decision whether to build small houses or large houses is a purely financial one and is
     based on the following information:
     y A single payment of $500 000 for the land, regardless of whether 10 small houses or five
       large houses are to be built.
     y The revenue from each house sale will be $220 000 for a small house and $400 000 for a
       large house.
     y The labour costs will be $2500 per day, regardless of the type of house built.
     y It will take 17 days to build each small house and 23 days to build each large house.
       Houses are built sequentially so that they can be sold as soon as they are completed.
     y The material costs will be $100 000 for each small house and $190 000 for each large house.

     (b)   Construct a spreadsheet model that shows the total profit for the chosen type of house.
           The user must input the House_Type and House_Num to calculate the total profit.             [6]

     (c)   Outline two validation tests that should be included in the test plan for this
           spreadsheet model.                                                                          [4]

     To finance this project, EnviroBuild took out a bank loan of $400 000 and will be required to
     pay interest on this loan. The project starts on 1 January 2021.

     The following steps are used to calculate the total profit:
     y Read the Profit variable and the No_of_Days variable from the spreadsheet model in (b).
     y Calculate the number of months that the project will take.
       ◦ There are no partial months.
       ◦ For example, if a project finished on 1 July 2021, the loan interest rates will include
           July: the project will last for 7 months.
     y The rate of interest on the bank loan of $400 000 is 1 % per month.
     y The land tax is $500 per month.

     (d)   Construct the pseudocode that will calculate the profit after these additional costs have
           been considered. You can introduce any new variables, if necessary.                         [5]

6.   Global warming is a term used to describe the increase in mean global temperatures.

     There have been numerous computer simulations developed to predict the effects of
     global warming. One simulation is NASA’s Virtual Earth System Laboratory (VESL), which
     allows users to see how climate change affects glacier size, global sea level and changes to
     the coastline.

     The VESL runs simulations in real time and is an abstraction of reality.

     (a)   (i)	Outline what is meant by a real-time simulation in the context of a glacier size
                simulation.[2]

           (ii)   Outline what is meant by the statement “the VESL simulation is an abstraction
                  of reality”.                                                                        [2]

     A recent study reported that previous simulations of predicted global sea levels for 2100 were
     highly inaccurate.

     (b)   Outline two reasons why predictions of global sea levels from simulations may not
           be accurate.                                                                               [4]

     (c)   NASA has decided to make its simulation software available for other scientists as well
           as members of the public.

           Evaluate the social and ethical implications of this decision.                             [6]

7.   Simulation software can be used to produce a 3D visualization of rising sea levels that
     change as the user alters the percentage of ice that has melted.

                             Figure 3: 3D visualization of rising sea levels




     (a)   (i)	Define the term visualization.[1]

           (ii)   Identify how a 2D visualization could be used in this scenario.                     [1]

     (b)   Explain the benefits of using visualization when simulating rising sea levels.             [5]

     Once the 3D visualization has been rendered, when the user drags a slider bar to simulate
     the amount of ice that has melted, the visualization is re-rendered without any delay.

8.   Genetic algorithms are used to influence the behaviour of non-playing characters (NPCs)
     in role-playing games (RPGs). NPCs are computer-controlled characters that the player
     interacts with but does not control.

     (a)   Outline two advantages of developing NPCs using genetic algorithms.                         [4]

     A series of generic NPCs are being developed for use in any multi-player RPG. The environmental
     and social interactions of these NPCs are being developed using supervised learning and will
     continue to develop as the game is played.

     (b)   Explain how supervised learning of a genetic algorithm could be used to support the
           way NPCs learn.                                                                             [6]

     Once NPCs have completed their supervised training, they are placed in a dynamic game
     environment. Each NPC learns to adapt its behaviour to its environment.

     At this stage of the training, NPCs will not be verbally communicating with other characters in
     their environment.

     (c)   Describe the way an NPC in a game could adapt its behaviour when moving and
           interacting with its environment.                                                           [6]

     The last stage of NPC development is verbal communication with player characters and other
     NPCs. To assist with this process, it was decided to explore research related to chatbots.

     (d)   Explain the benefits of giving NPCs the functionality of chatbots.                          [4]

10.   The internet and World Wide Web are often considered to be the same, or the terms are
      used in the wrong context.

      (a)   Distinguish between the internet and the World Wide Web.                                   [2]

      Many organizations produce computer-based solutions that implement open standards.

      (b)   Outline two advantages of using open standards.	                                           [4]

      A search engine is software that allows a user to search for information. The most commonly
      used search algorithms are the PageRank and HITS algorithms.

      (c)   Outline why a search engine using the HITS algorithm might produce different page
            ranking from one using the PageRank algorithm.                                             [2]

      Web crawlers browse the World Wide Web.

11.   The World Wide Web can be divided into three categories: the surface web, the dark web
      and the deep web.

      (a)   Distinguish between the surface web and the deep web.                                      [2]

      The dark web is only accessible by using specialist software, such as TOR and I2P. Many users
      of the dark web use it to protect their anonymity.

      (b)   Explain how a user’s anonymity can be maintained while accessing the dark web.             [3]

      Many users of the dark web use peer-2-peer (P2P) networks for activities like torrent
      streaming. This opens up ports on the computer to upload and download data.

      (c)   Explain why users have concerns about opening up ports to upload and download data.        [3]

      (d)   The founders of the World Wide Web intended it to be a decentralized and democratic
            environment.

12.   The World Wide Web can be represented as a web graph.

      (a)   Describe how a web graph can be used to represent the connectivity of the
            World Wide Web.                                                                           [4]

      The World Wide Web has expanded significantly over the last 10 years. In June 2018, there
      were an estimated 1600 million websites and 4100 million users. This is approximately twice
      the figures of January 2014.

      (b)   Explain why a user can still navigate from one web page to another web page in
            the same amount of time as previously, even though the number of web pages is
            significantly larger.                                                                     [4]

      The World Wide Web can be divided into the text web and the semantic web.

      (c)   Outline two reasons why there needs to be a balance between expressivity and
            usability on the semantic web.	                                                           [4]

Option D — Object-oriented programming

13.   A company provides car parking services in large cities and needs a computer system to
      keep track of the number of vehicles using its parking areas.

      When a vehicle arrives, its registration plate is recorded on the system and it is allocated a
      number that identifies where it should park. When the vehicle leaves, that space is made
      available for other vehicles to use.

      Vehicles are identified by their unique registration plate, which is an alphanumeric code of
      eight characters (eg X1234567). This is clearly displayed on the vehicle.

      A programmer created the classes ParkingArea and Vehicle to model the above situation.

      public class ParkingArea {
          private Vehicle vehicles[];
          private String name;

           ParkingArea(String name, int capacity) {
               this.name = name;
               if (capacity > 300) capacity = 300;
               this.vehicles = new Vehicle[capacity];
           }

           String getName() {
               return name;
           }

           public int getCapacity() {
               return vehicles.length;
           }

           public int findVehicle(String reg) {
               //find where the vehicle is located in the array and
               //return the index not yet written
           }

      The method pay in the Vehicle class returns the administration fee (which is only part of the
      total price), while the method pay of the Car class calculates the total price for a car staying
      in the parking area.

      (d)   (i)	Construct the method pay in the Vehicle class that returns the admin fee

15.   The management of the company will launch a new scheme to give every 50th car driver and
      every 60th motorcyclist a free coffee voucher. The code for printing this voucher has already
      been created and is activated by calling the static method Vouchers.printCoffeeVoucher().

      A getKind() method has already been added to the Vehicle class, which returns a char
      value indicating whether it is a car (c) or a motorbike (m).

      (a)   Describe, without writing code, any changes required to the addVehicle method
            and the ParkingArea class to make the new voucher scheme work.                               [5]

      The removeVehicle method of the ParkingArea class searches in the array for a Vehicle
      object with a specified registration plate, then removes it by setting that array index to null.

16.   A single parking space that holds one car can be used to hold two motorbikes. The programmer
      has decided to use a two-dimensional array to create a map of the parking area.

      Vehicle parkingSpaces[][] = new Vehicle[2][200];

      [0] [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] [13]                       etc   [198][199]

[0]     c     m     c     m    c     c    m     c     c      m        c     c                   c

[1]           m                                              m   m                                        m

      Note: m and c have been used to show where motorbikes and cars are parked.

      (a)   (i)	Identify one advantage of using a two-dimensional array for this purpose.                   [1]

            (ii)   Identify one disadvantage of using a two-dimensional array for this purpose.              [1]

      Police have requested a way of searching the parking area for vehicles with a specified
      registration plate, and a binary tree has been suggested.

      (b)   Outline why searching for the registration plate in a binary tree would be faster than
            looking for it in the two-dimensional array.                                                     [3]

      (c)   Identify the steps that would be involved in taking the data from this two-dimensional
            array and creating a binary search tree.                                                         [5]

17.   A new parking service has been introduced: staff will park the car for the driver and then return
      it later when the driver wants to leave. This service will use a narrow parking area surrounded
      on three sides by walls, where any cars behind the required car must be reversed out. For
      example, car X00000011 was the first vehicle to be parked, so to remove it from the parking
      area, the other five cars, starting with X00000123, will need to be removed. The cars are then
      returned starting with car X00000010.

                               Figure 5: Cars parked in the parking area




            X00000011     X00000010      X00000051      X00000022     X00000050      X00000123


      The class Stack, which contains the Vehicle objects, has the following methods:

              Method signature        Returns

              isEmpty()               Returns true if the stack is empty, otherwise false.

              push(Vehicle v)         Adds a vehicle to the stack.

              pop()                   Removes and returns a Vehicle object.

      The method staffRemoveCar will remove a vehicle with a specified registration plate from
      the parking area (you can assume the vehicle is in the parking area):

      public static void staffRemoveCar(Stack stack, String reg){
          Stack temp = new Stack();
          //add code here
      }

      (a)   Construct the staffRemoveCar method.                                                         [6]

      A stack can be implemented using an array or a singly linked list.

      (b)   Compare the use of these two data structures for creating a stack.                           [4]
