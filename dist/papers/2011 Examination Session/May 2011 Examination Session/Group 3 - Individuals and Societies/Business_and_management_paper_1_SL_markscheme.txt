                                               SECTION A

1.   (a)   (i)    Identify two external stakeholders of Reach Out.                                   [2 marks]

                  External stakeholders of Reach Out include:
                  • families of children with autism (and children themselves) – do not count
                    twice
                  • private therapists (accept “private sector companies” but not just
                    “competitors”)
                  • local university and trainee teachers who need work experience with
                    children with autism
                  • companies producing communication resources/PECS cards
                  • government (local, regional or national – not all)
                  • accept any other relevant external stakeholder (as long as they are
                    relevant for Reach Out – for example “suppliers” is too vague unless
                    specified).


                  Award [1 mark] for each correct and relevant external stakeholder identified
                  up to a maximum of [2 marks].

           (ii)   Outline a possible interest of one of Reach Out’s external stakeholders
                  identified in part (i).                                                 [2 marks]

                  Answers will depend on the chosen stakeholder – for example, the private
                  therapists see Reach Out therapists (trainee teachers) as a new form of
                  competition (i.e. new entrants); Reach Out’s approach to pricing (up to four
                  times cheaper) presents a real threat to them, hence the interest. They may
                  protest or complain over the fact that the Reach Out therapists are not
                  professionally qualified.

                  Accept any other relevant outline.


                  Award [1 mark] for a basic outline of a possible interest of one external
                  stakeholder identified in part (i).

                  Award [2 marks] for a clear outline of a possible interest of one external
                  stakeholder identified in part (i); for [2 marks] the interest must be realistic
                  and explicit.

                  If the chosen external stakeholder is not from the answer to part (i), award a
                  maximum of [1 mark], no matter how good the outline of the possible
                  interest.
                                             –6–              M11/3/BUSMT/SP1/ENG/TZ0/XX/M



(b)   Construct a fully labelled organizational chart of Reach Out after the
      appointment of Andrew Grandin.                                         [4 marks]

        Director – Communication and Networking               Director – Finance and Strategy


                                                Andrew Grandin
                                                Scheme Manager



                                                    Therapists

      Award [1 mark] for the relationship between Neil and Laura (at the same level).

      Award [1 mark] for the relationship between Andrew, Neil and Laura (Andrew
      reporting to both of them).

      Award [1 mark] for the relationship between Andrew and the therapists
      (trainee teachers) (the number of therapists on the chart does not matter).

      Award [1 mark] for the labelling of the job titles (for Andrew, accept alternatives
      such as “manager” or “therapists manager”; for Laura and Neil, accept
      “co-directors”).

(c)   Analyse the advantages and disadvantages for Reach Out of accepting the
      sponsorship offer from N-Pharma (Option 3).                             [7 marks]

      Advantages include:
      • a new and regular source of income for Reach Out ($10 000 a month), without
        any need for extra work/activities/spending
      • the sponsorship from N-Pharma could, in turn, attract other sponsors
      • the marketing advantage of being associated with N-Pharma – a well-known
        company
      • potential advice and support
      • information or research into autism
      • accept any other relevant advantage.

      Disadvantages include:
      • compromising Reach Out’s integrity (Laura’s main argument against it)
      • there is no link between a pharmaceutical company and the mission and vision
        statement of Reach Out (other than research on autism, line 137), so it is not
        clear what message this sponsorship would communicate to Reach Out’s
        stakeholders
      • should N-Pharma suffer bad publicity, Reach Out too could be negatively
        affected
      • accept any other relevant disadvantage.

      Accept any other relevant analysis.


      Marks should be allocated according to the markbands on page 3.

2.   (a)   Neil Johnson has prepared a business plan for Reach Out (line 31). Identify
           four elements of a business plan.                                           [4 marks]

           Possible elements could include:
           • an overall summary
           • the mission statement/vision statement
           • the aims/objectives of the business
           • a section about legal status
           • a section about marketing
           • a section about human resources (HR)
           • a section about operations
           • a section about finance/accounting
           • a calculation of start-up costs
           • appendices such as cash-flow forecast
           • accept any other relevant element.


           Award [1 mark] for each correct element identified, up to a maximum of
           [4 marks].

     (b)   With reference to Reach Out, distinguish between a vision statement and a
           mission statement (lines 44–47).                                          [4 marks]

           The vision statement is about the future: it presents the purpose of the
           organization, usually in terms of values or ideals. Reach Out’s vision is that
           “no child with autism will be left behind”: this is Reach Out’s driving force,
           the ultimate aim they seek, hence the idea of “vision”.

           In contrast, the mission statement is a concise description of what the organization
           does: in the case of Reach Out, they “provide online support for families of
           children with autism”. It is concrete and practical: it is about what they already do
           (e.g. through Laura’s blog and web site), their purpose or what they want to do as
           soon as possible (“to offer them communication resources at a greatly reduced
           price”).

           Accept any other relevant distinction.


           [1 to 2 marks]
           Award [1 mark] for an answer that just copies/lifts quotes from the case study.
           Award [2 marks] for an answer that shows some limited understanding of the
           difference between a vision statement and a mission statement, for example
           through a theoretical definition of the two.

           [3 to 4 marks]
           Award [3 marks] for an answer that combines “theory” (i.e. definition) and
           “practice” (i.e. reference to the case study). Award [4 marks] for an answer that
           clearly distinguishes between a vision statement and a mission statement,
           stressing the difference, with explicit reference to Reach Out.

     (c)   Analyse the importance of information and communication technology (ICT)
           in the creation and operations of Reach Out.                             [7 marks]

           On the one hand, ICT played an important role right from the beginning as
           Reach Out is originally based on Laura’s blog about raising a child with autism.
           That blog even enabled Laura and Neil to meet, as Neil read it and saw the
           business potential. The first part of Reach Out’s mission statement is about online
           activities; some fundraising comes from it and it has further potential, for example
           with the sponsorship from N-Pharma. ICT is also important in the interactions
           between families and therapists; it is through ICT shortcomings that Neil found
           out that Andrew is not able to use a computer, which is a major problem for
           Reach Out, as they rely a lot on electronic communication.

           On the other hand, ICT remains a tool to support the other activities of Reach Out,
           especially the current therapist scheme and the future marketing of
           communication resources such as PECS cards. Both could not just exist virtually:
           therapists need to be in a room with the children, the PECS cards have to be real
           objects in the hands of the parents.

           Accept any other relevant analysis.


           Answers must be balanced and analyse both creation and operations for full
           marks.

           Note: the balance may be between creation and operations; it does not have to be
           “for” and “against” the importance of ICT.

           Marks should be allocated according to the markbands on page 3.


3.   (a)   Define the term corporate social responsibility (line 138).                            [2 marks]

           A socially responsible business is one that realises it has an obligation or
           commitment which incorporates the interests of various stakeholders and the
           environment in a manner which is deemed to be beneficial and correct according
           to societal values, e.g. a socially responsible business may manufacture products
           in such a way as to limit carbon emissions. (This includes behaving ethically to
           its stakeholders.)


           Award [1 mark] for a basic definition that conveys partial knowledge and
           understanding.

           Award [2 marks] for a full, clear definition that conveys knowledge and
           understanding similar to the answer above.

           For only a relevant: example or application to the case study award [1 mark].

(b)   Identify two possible indirect costs of Reach Out.                                      [2 marks]

      Organizations’ indirect costs include rent, utilities, taxes etc. Possible answers in
      the case of Reach Out include the electricity bill, internet access and web site
      hosting – though a range of other answers can be accepted (e.g. office sundries,
      even rent as Laura’s office is in her house and Reach Out could pay her some
      rent).


      Award [1 mark] for each correct possible indirect cost relevant to Reach Out
      identified, up to a maximum of [2 marks].

(c)   Using information from Appendix 1,

      (i)   calculate the total cash receipts and the closing balance at the end of

(d)   Examine the success of two elements of the marketing mix used by Reach Out. [7 marks]

      The 7 Ps of the marketing mix may be used here: candidates are expected to
      examine two elements from the list of price, product, promotion, place, people,
      process and physical evidence.

      Example for promotion:
      Reach Out’s promotion has two main channels: Laura’s blog (and other online
      activities such as podcasts where she must mention the therapist scheme) and
      word-of-mouth (as parents of children with autism must talk to one another about
      the scheme). This has been very successful (as “the number of families asking for
      support was doubling each month” (lines 77–78), ensuring an ever increasing
      stream of income for Reach Out (see monthly cash flow) but many other
      promotional methods could be considered. Neil’s proposal about brand
      development would further develop Reach Out’s notoriety and goodwill, which
      could also help with further fundraising. At the moment, fundraising is a minor
      source of income ($200 on average a month) but it has a lot of potential (e.g. with
      the sponsorship from N-Pharma) – however, promotion and communication are
      essential: this is one aspect of its marketing mix that has been successful but
      Reach Out could further develop.

      Example for people:
      People here refers to all the staff of Reach Out: the two directors, Andrew as well
      as the therapists. They all have skills and strengths that contribute to the success
      of Reach Out (e.g. Neil’s business acumen, Laura’s passion and drive) but some
      weaknesses too (e.g. Andrew’s inability to use a computer, the therapists’ lack of
      qualifications). From a marketing viewpoint, Reach Out could further use its
      strengths (e.g. Laura’s and Andrew’s personalities for networking and
      fundraising) – however they have to be careful that the weaknesses do not
      negatively affect the charity (e.g. Andrew’s lack of computer literacy blocking the
      process of booking/confirming therapists’ sessions). This is an aspect of the
      marketing mix that has not been so successful.

      Accept any other relevant examination.


      If the response is a one-sided relevant approach with no examination, award a
      maximum of [4 marks]. If only one element of the marketing mix is examined,
      award a maximum of [4 marks].

      Marks should be allocated according to the markbands on page 3.

                                             SECTION B

4.   (a)   Identify four elements of the process of setting up a business.                     [4 marks]

           Although there is no definite answer, the following shows what could be included:
           • identifying a business opportunity e.g. a gap in the market
           • preparing a business plan (i.e. considering all aspects of the venture, from
              objectives to finance via staffing and operations)
           • finding the necessary resources especially from a financial viewpoint (funding)
           • preparing the launch or the opening
           • accept any other relevant element.


           Please note that country-specific answers must be accepted.

           Note: correct answers are likely to be written with verbs (e.g. “carry out market
           research”) though shorter answers such as “market research” are acceptable;
           vague answers however such as “finance” are not enough.

           Award [1 mark] for each correct element identified (e.g. reference to objectives)
           up to a maximum of [4 marks].
                                             – 14 –            M11/3/BUSMT/SP1/ENG/TZ0/XX/M


(b)   Explain the purpose of Reach Out’s final accounts (line 32).                            [4 marks]

      Final accounts include profit and loss accounts (candidates may refer to statement
      of financial activities (SOFA) for charities) and balance sheets (as well as others
      e.g. for manufacturing firms, final accounts also include trading accounts and
      appropriation accounts). They are called “final” because they are written at the
      end of a company’s financial year. The main purpose of these financial
      statements is to provide information to stakeholders (especially directors,
      managers and investors) about the financial profile, health and performance of the
      organization. It seems that Reach Out is a very successful venture but at the end
      of the financial year, when Neil prepares the final accounts, he will be able to
      calculate ratios such as current ratio and acid test ratio. He can then compare
      them to other charities’ benchmark performances. Once they start producing and
      commercializing communication resources, this will be very important; at the
      moment, they only deal with services and have no debt. A particular purpose here
      is to identify the success of the venture in meeting the needs of its client group –
      children with autism and their families.


      [1 to 2 marks]
      Award [1 mark] for an answer that shows some knowledge of what final accounts
      are (e.g. with references to profit and loss accounts (accept charity equivalent) and
      balance sheets). Award [2 marks] for an answer that refers to the purpose of
      final accounts at a generic, theoretical level (e.g. about providing financial
      information to stakeholders).

      [3 to 4 marks]
      Award [3 marks] for an answer that combines “theory” (i.e. definition) and
      “practice” (i.e. reference to the case study) though not fully/clearly explaining the
      purpose of final accounts to Reach Out. Award [4 marks] for an answer that fully
      and clearly explains the purpose of final accounts to Reach Out.

(c)   Explain two reasons why Neil Johnson wishes to brand the products offered
      by Reach Out (Option 2).                                                  [4 marks]

      Neil wishes to brand the products for several reasons:
      • the name Reach Out is already well-known so there will be no need to spend
        much time and money on raising brand awareness
      • some potential customers may buy the products (clothes and accessories) to
        support the charity as they recognize its name and its cause (children with
        autism)
      • all marketing and promotion for the brand Reach Out will benefit all products
        (e.g. accessories) and services (e.g. the therapist scheme) that are
        commercialized under the same umbrella name
      • to raise additional revenue for Reach Out which will also increase his salary.


      Mark as 2+2.

      Award [1 mark] for each correct reason identified, and [1 mark] for the
      development of that reason up to a maximum of [2 marks].
                                            – 15 –            M11/3/BUSMT/SP1/ENG/TZ0/XX/M


(d)   Laura Chan is unsure about the future growth of Reach Out (lines 156–158).
      Recommend an appropriate scale of operation for Reach Out, justifying your
      answer.                                                                    [8 marks]

      Laura is torn. On the one hand, she can see some of the long-term advantages of
      Neil’s plans (for example about branding) but on the other hand she does not want
      Reach Out to grow for growth’s sake.

      Different scales of operations are possible:
      • Neil could convince Laura that the next six months should be about maximum
         growth – then once Reach Out has one million dollars (for example as a target)
         of surplus in the bank, they will be able to start producing and distributing
         communication resources. (They will also be in a strong position to negotiate
         good deals with suppliers.)
      • Laura could convince Neil that the focus should already be on the
         communication resources (the mission statement), using the ongoing revenue
         from the therapist scheme for funding, rather than diversifying towards
         sponsorship or branding.
      • Laura and Neil could review the funding structure of the charity, deciding to
         develop the fundraising strand of income (rather than marketing, especially
         branding) by making use of Laura’s and Andrew’s public relation (PR) profile.
      • Laura and Neil could realize that their ambitions, motivations and personalities
         are too different and that they cannot work together any more on Reach Out;
         they would need to decide on the best exit strategy (for either of them – or both
         of them, should they decide to fold Reach Out in its current form).

      Accept any other relevant recommendation.


      Candidates could consider the advantages and disadvantages of small versus large
      organizations. This could be with reference to economies of scale, bureaucracy,
      organization, specialization, financial security, etc.

      Candidates are not expected to cover all the suggestions outlined above: they are
      only expected to recommend a scale of operation, examining its advantages and
      possibly disadvantages. The recommendation must be justified to reach the
      top markband.

      Marks should be allocated according to the markbands on page 4.
