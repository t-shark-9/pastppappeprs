                                                              SECTION A

Answer one question from this section. Each question in this section is worth [30 marks].

Core Theme: What is a human being?

1.        Read the following passage and develop your response as indicated below.

          I taught “War and Human Nature” again this fall. The course ponders the question, as my syllabus
          puts it, “Is war inevitable, or are peace and even universal disarmament possible?” During the
          first class, I posed that question to my undergraduate students. Thirteen said no, peace is not possible,
          and four said yes, it is.
          That pessimistic response no longer surprises me. Two years ago, I had my students ask classmates:
          “Will humans ever stop fighting wars, once and for all? Why or why not?” Of the 205 respondents,
          185 – more than 90 percent – replied no.
          “From this survey,” one of my students wrote, “we can conclude that most college students have little
          faith in mankind.”

          Write a response (of approximately 800 words) in which you:

          • identify a central philosophical concept or philosophical issue in this passage that addresses
            the question, “what is a human being?”
          • investigate two different philosophical approaches to the philosophical concept or philosophical
            issue you identified
          • explain and evaluate the philosophical concept or philosophical issue you identified.

Optional Theme 8: People, nations and cultures

17.   The United Nations Millennium Declaration states: “We believe that the central challenge we face
      today is to ensure that globalization becomes a positive force for all the world’s people. For while
      globalization offers great opportunities, at present its benefits are very unevenly shared, while its
      costs are unevenly distributed.” Evaluate philosophically this claim.


18.   Evaluate the claim that since each culture is different and has its own systems of meaning and value,
      cultural relativism is an unavoidable philosophical position.
