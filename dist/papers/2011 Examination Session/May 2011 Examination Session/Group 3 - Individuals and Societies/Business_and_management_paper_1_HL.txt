Answer the compulsory question from this section.

5.    7 months later …

      Reach Out’s financial situation under Neil Johnson’s control was secure and Andrew Grandin
      was coping better with managing the therapists. In March 2011, Reach Out received a prize for
      its work in raising the awareness of autism (Item 1). Laura Chan began to appear on several
      television shows. Her blog was becoming increasingly popular. Reach Out had also begun to sell
      PECS cards at a reduced price of $88.

      However, by conducting a new STEEPLE analysis (Item 2), Neil became aware that three
      new competitors, private publishing companies X, Y and Z, were also planning to sell PECS cards to
      parents at an even lower price than Reach Out’s $88. Neil also learned that there was a considerable
      change in the external environment, especially in social attitudes towards autism. Despite the
      considerable brand loyalty to Reach Out, recent comments on Laura’s blog (Item 3) revealed that
      a number of families were thinking of purchasing PECS cards from the new competitors and were
      starting to question Reach Out’s ethical credentials.

      Laura was concerned. She felt that the new companies were taking advantage of the goodwill
      generated by Reach Out. Unless quick action was taken, Reach Out’s mission statement would
      be compromised. Although she did not understand the full implications of predatory pricing for
      the PECS cards, Laura argued that they should further reduce Reach Out’s prices. Neil responded
      that the current changes in social attitudes to autism would ensure that all providers of PECS cards
      would benefit. The mission and vision of Reach Out need not change. Without informing Neil,
      Laura began giving interviews to the national media and stating that Reach Out was the only
      “true ethical” provider of PECS cards.

      To produce its PECS cards, Reach Out was using a local printing company that employed adults
      with autism. Neil contacted two overseas producers of PECS cards to obtain information on
      production costs (Item 4). Reach Out could outsource production overseas in order to lower
      the price of its PECS cards. Neil considered that this strategic move could benefit Reach Out,
      allowing them to continue to be a price leader in the provision of PECS cards. In their last meeting,
      Laura and Neil argued yet again. Laura did not agree with the strategic move and its impact on
      Reach Out’s stakeholders.



                                                           (This question continues on the following page)

(Question 5 continued)

      (a)   Referring to Item 2, identify two new additional factors that Neil Johnson
            could include in his STEEPLE analysis of Reach Out.                                [2 marks]

      (b)   Explain how changes in social behaviour towards autism (Items 1 and 2) could
            impact on Reach Out and its competitors.                                           [7 marks]

      (c)   Analyse the appropriateness for Reach Out of using a predatory pricing method
            for its PECS cards.                                                                [9 marks]

      (d)   Using information contained in the case study and Items 1 to 5, discuss whether
            Reach Out should outsource the production of its PECS cards to an overseas
            producer as part of a new strategy.                                               [12 marks]

Additional Information

Item 1: Extract from The Daily News, March 2011

Reach Out, a company started by a single parent in 2010, was today awarded a prize for its work in
raising awareness of autism, which affects one child in a hundred. In accepting the prize, Laura Chan
promised that she would use the prize money to help as many families as possible to cope with this
difficult condition. She thanked the awarding committee for its generosity. Ms Chan was pleased with
the changes in social attitudes towards autism. She fully supported a recent government announcement
that children in schools with autism would be given as far as possible the same access to education as
other children as part of its equal opportunities legislation. Ms Chan still feels that more can be done to
help children with autism.


Item 2: Extract from Neil’s new STEEPLE analysis

Social factors affecting Reach Out
− Greater awareness of autism through media celebrities who have come forward to state that they have
   a child with autism.
− More schools now have specialist autism classes with additional teaching staff employed to work
   with them.
Economic factors affecting Reach Out
− Three new competitors (companies X, Y and Z) who have decided to sell PECS cards, now imply the
   price elasticity of Reach Out’s PECS cards is 4.2.
− The economy is slowly recovering after one of the longest recessions since 1945. However, the threat
   of unemployment remains high.
Political factors affecting Reach Out
− Increase in government funding in the health system allowing doctors to diagnose children with
   autism earlier.
− As part of an equal opportunities programme, government is announcing that all schools will have
   to allocate part of their budget to providing special needs classrooms.


Item 3: Extracts of replies to Laura’s blog

“Thank you for your great advice Laura but given that my husband has recently been made redundant,
we feel that we will have to purchase our next set of PECS cards from company Z for $64.” A Fulton.

“With no government support, we think that our son’s best interests are being served by ordering the
PECS cards from company Y for $68. Is there any way Reach Out could match their prices?” P Millor.

“I saw you on the television last night. You must be making lots of money. Come on Reach Out surely
you can do better, after all you are non-profit and your competitors are private publishing companies?”
B Wong.

“Watched the show. Is all the prize money really going to the families?” K Singh.

Item 4: Cost to Reach Out of producing PECS cards, April 2011

Pack of 50 PECS cards

Current local producer 		              $80

Outsourced overseas producer 1         $24
Outsourced overseas producer 2         $28


Item 5: Extract from The Business News, April 2011: “The gains from outsourcing operations
        are unclear”

A leading group of business experts have carried out a survey of small to medium sized businesses
and discovered that the gains from outsourcing operations to lower cost overseas suppliers are not
always clear. Whilst it was acknowledged that wages and other direct costs were significantly lower,
a number of concerns around quality control and productivity were raised, possibly cancelling out some
of the benefits. The group also identified that other factors such as cultural differences, language barriers
and exchange rate volatility meant that the decision to move operations to a subcontractor was not
always a straightforward one.
