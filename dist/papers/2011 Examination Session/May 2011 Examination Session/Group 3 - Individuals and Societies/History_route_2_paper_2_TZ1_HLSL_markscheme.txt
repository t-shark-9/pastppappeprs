 0:     Answers not meeting the requirements of descriptors should be awarded no marks.
 1–3:   Answers do not meet the demands of the question and show little or no evidence of
        appropriate structure. There are no more than vague, unsupported assertions.
 4–5:   There is little understanding of the question. Historical details are present but are mainly
        inaccurate and/or of marginal relevance. Historical context or processes are barely understood
        and there is minimal focus on the task.
 6–7:   Answers indicate some understanding of the question but historical knowledge is limited in
        quality and quantity. Historical context may be present as will understanding of historical
        processes but underdeveloped. The question is only partially addressed.
 8–9:   The demands of the question are generally understood. Historical knowledge is present but is
        not fully or accurately detailed. Knowledge is narrative or descriptive in nature. There may
        be limited argument that requires further substantiation. Critical commentary may be present.
        An attempt to place events in historical context and show an understanding of historical
        processes. An attempt at a structured approach, either chronological or thematic has been
        made.
 10–12: Answers indicate that the question is understood but not all implications considered.
        Knowledge is largely accurate. Critical commentary may be present. Events are generally
        placed in context and understanding of historical processes, such as comparison and contrast
        are present. There may be awareness of different approaches and interpretations but they are
        not based on relevant historical knowledge. There is a clear attempt at a structured approach.
 13–15: Answers are clearly focused on the demands of the question. Specific knowledge is applied as
        evidence, and analysis or critical commentary are used appropriately to produce a specific
        argument. Events are placed in context and there is sound understanding of historical
        processes and comparison and contrast. Evaluation of different approaches may be used to
        substantiate arguments presented.
 16–20: Answers are clearly structured and focused, have full awareness of the demands of the
        question, and if appropriate may challenge it. Detailed specific knowledge is used as evidence
        to support assertions and arguments. Historical processes such as comparison and contrast,
        placing events in context and evaluating different interpretations are used appropriately and
        effectively.

Topic 1       Causes, practices and effects of wars

1.   Compare and contrast the causes of the Iran–Iraq war (1980–1988) and the
     Falklands/Malvinas war (1982).

     For “compare”
     Candidates could note that both wars began with invasion (Iraq into Iran and Argentina into the
     Falklands/Malvinas islands); both involved territorial disputes – in the case of the Falklands the
     issue of sovereignty had been long disputed. In the case of Iraq, the Shatt al-Arab waterway had
     proved a source of conflict. Both involved nationalism. In the Iran–Iraq war the Republic of Iran
     was associated with Shia Islamism and Saddam Hussein’s Iraqi regime was associated with Sunni
     Islamism. In the case of the Falklands/Malvinas – the invasion was viewed by Argentina as the
     re-occupation of its own national territory and by Britain as an invasion of British territory.
     Economic causes could be evidenced in both conflicts, although they varied in significance.

     For “contrast”
     For the Iran–Iraq War the case could be made that the war was caused by religious issues while the
     Falklands was not. A further motivation in the case of the Iran–Iraq War might have been rivalry
     for regional dominance as Saddam Hussein wished to promote Iraq as a strong regional power.
     A successful invasion of Iran would enlarge Iraq’s oil reserves and make Iraq the dominant power
     in the Persian Gulf. With regard to the Falklands/Malvinas War, the military junta sought to
     maintain power by diverting public attention from economic difficulties (a war of distraction)
     rather than pursuing regional domination.

     If only one war is discussed, mark out of a maximum of [7 marks].


2.   To what extent did militarism contribute to the origins of the First World War (1914–1918)
     and the Second World War (1939–1945)?

     Answers should focus on the contribution of militarism to the two world wars – thus it might be
     considered as a long-term and/or short-term cause of the conflicts. Militarism might not be
     considered a significant issue in causing the conflicts and other factors such as imperialism and the
     alliance system could be discussed for each one, but the role of militarism should be addressed.
     The role of militarism, particularly prior to the First World War, should not be confined to one
     country or one event. It could be illustrated, among other things, by the arms race or mobilization
     plans established by the Great Powers before the war.

     In the case of the Second World War, German militarism will probably be the focus, but Italian and
     Japanese militarism also played a role. Germany, Japan and Italy were militaristic expansionist
     nations. Other factors that could be considered include nationalism in both wars, the alliance
     system in the First World War and the failures of Collective Security in the Second World War.
     Militarism however should be the main focus.

     If only one war is discussed, mark out of a maximum of [12 marks].

3.   Analyse the impact of guerrilla war on the course and outcome of one twentieth century war.

     Answers will vary according to the selected war. Civil wars and revolutions can be accepted for
     this task. Possible examples could include civil war in China (accept coverage of the wider period
     1927–1949 or 1945/6–1949); Vietnam: First Indochina War (1945–1954) and the Vietnam War
     (1964–1975); the Cuban Revolution and the Soviet–Afghan War (1979–1989) amongst others.
     Guerilla tactics are adopted when one side is militarily weaker in terms of numbers or conventional
     arms and where geographical conditions make large scale battles difficult. Guerilla forces are
     motivated by a range of factors – economic, social, religious and political. Their aim is usually the
     overthrow of an unpopular regime.

     Guerrilla warfare usually involves small groups of combatants using tactics such as ambush, raids
     and sabotage to combat a conventional army. Such tactics weaken authority through a process of
     attrition. These methods increase the expenditure of the government and can undermine the
     regime’s morale.

     Guerrilla warfare has been successful to a varying degree in the case of the PLA in the Chinese
     Civil War, Castro during the Cuban Revolution, the Vietcong during the Vietnam War, Algeria, the
     Soviet–Afghan War and Cyprus.


4.   “No peace treaties have been made since the Second World War.” With reference to two
     specific examples, to what extent do you agree with this statement?

     The main task of the question is to identify and comment upon the variety of ways that wars ended
     after the Second World War, and not necessarily by peace treaties (such as armistice or cease-fire or
     United Nations’ resolution).

     Some examples of armistice are: the Korean War; the 1949 Armistice Agreements between Israel
     and its neighbours, Egypt, Jordan, Lebanon and Syria.

     Some examples of resolutions are: the Iran–Iraq War and the Gulf War. The Balkan Wars of the
     1990s were resolved by external mediation. Other examples may include the Arab–Israeli conflicts
     of 1967 and 1973.

     If only one example is discussed, mark out of a maximum of [12 marks].

5.   How effective have attempts been to achieve collective security since the Second World War
     (1939–1945)? Support your view with specific examples.

      “Collective security” can be defined as a system in which participants globally (in the case of the
     UNO, regionally, for example, in the case of NATO) agree that any breach of peace will result in a
     collective response.

     The idea of collective security re-emerged after the Second World War with the establishment of
     the United Nations. However, the Soviet Union and the United States confronted each other during
     the Cold War and their competing spheres of influence resulted in a new balance of power but not
     universal collective security.

     The UN initiated collective security as a response to North Korea’s invasion of South Korea. The
     resolution for intervention was possible as the Soviet Union was boycotting the Security Council at
     the time.

     Both superpowers pursued regional rather than global security. The United Nations made attempts
     to promote peace in many conflicts by intervention, mediation, peace-keeping forces and
     resolutions, the “good offices” of the Secretary General, sanctions and observer missions. There
     have been successes and failures.         Examples for investigation could include: Palestine
     1947–1949; Iran 1946; the Suez Crisis; the Congo Crisis 1960–1975 or other situations in which the
     UN or other regional organizations intervened.


6.   Assess the economic effects of either the Spanish Civil War (1936–1939) or the Nicaraguan
     Revolution (1976–1979).

     Although it could be argued that wars are followed by some economic development/progress
     as a result of the need to rebuild in the short term, economies may suffer longer term negative
     effects. Wars/revolutions are expensive (in money and other resources), destructive (of capital and
     human resources), and disruptive (of trade, resource availability, labour).

     For the Spanish Civil War some effects could be: population loss and displacement (600 000 dead);
     the destruction of the infrastructure and homes. Gold and foreign exchange reserves were virtually
     wiped out and the devastation of war reduced the productive capacity of industry and agriculture.
     These difficulties were exacerbated by the Second World War. After 1945 Spain was left with a
     stagnant economy and a poor standard of living until the late 1950s early 1960s.

     For the Nicaraguan Revolution: the country was in ruins with a debt of 1.6 billion dollars; an
     estimated 50 000 war dead; 600 000 homeless, and a devastated economic infrastructure. To
     achieve economic reconstruction, the Sandinistas obtained economic assistance from Cuba and
     countries within the Soviet bloc. In the context of Cold War events, the US supported the Contras
     against the Sandinistas and applied economic sanctions and a trade embargo on Nicaragua, which
     added to the country’s economic problems.

Topic 2       Democratic states – challenges and responses

7.   Analyse the problems that pressure groups can create for a democratic state.

     Pressure or lobby groups exist in all democratic states. They are dedicated to ensuring the passage
     of legislation or regulations favourable to specific sectors of the population. They employ
     representatives to present their requests to members of legislatures and/or the civil service – or they
     may mobilize public opinion in an attempt to influence government policy.

     The problems that the existence of such groups may pose for democracy can include:
      they may use bribery or other forms of corruption which undermines belief in democracy;
      they may encourage legislation which helps one group at the expense of many;
      voters may feel that their wishes are overridden by powerful and wealthy interest groups;
      there may be a suspicion of criminal behaviour;
      privileges for special groups may lead to outbursts of violence or other extremism by those who
       are not benefiting;
      the validity of elections and faith in elected officials may be lost;
      political morality is questioned and belief in the system may decline;
      parties which are influenced by pressure groups may be seen as working only in the interest of
       specific powerful or wealthy groups;
      voters feel disenfranchised.

     Candidates may also argue that pressure groups can be a force for beneficial change.

     Analysis should be supported by specific detail of examples where pressure groups have had
     an impact.

8.   “The Weimar Republic was doomed from the moment it was created.” To what extent do you
     agree with this statement?

     Many candidates will produce a number of factors in support of the statement. Better responses are
     likely to acknowledge that Weimar’s fate was not preordained.

     Factors which would support the statement could include:
      Weimar was associated with defeat and the signing of the Versailles Treaty – national
       humiliation;
      post-war economic weakness culminating in the 1923 inflation caused unrest;
      extremist anti-democratic groups emerged after the First World War – some of these attacked the
       regime – Spartacists, Freikorps, National Socialists;
      Germany had a limited democratic tradition; the proportional representation system allowed for
       the establishment of splinter parties – many of them extreme. No party had an absolute majority
       leading to coalition administrations which were often unstable or short-lived;
      the Army and civil service were headed by individuals who were often ambivalent – or at times
       hostile towards the new system of government;
      Germany was dependent on foreign loans for its economic stability.

     Factors that may be used to challenge the statement include:
      the economic crisis of the early 1920s was overcome and prosperity returned;
      new leaders such as Stresemann gained respect;
      splinter groups such as the Nazis lost popularity 1924-29;
      Germany began to recover her international status: Locarno, League of Nations membership,
       reduction of reparations;
      the Great Depression precipitated Weimar’s collapse and the move towards more authoritarian
       government.


9.   Assess the successes and failures of social and economic policies of either John F Kennedy
     or Richard Nixon as presidents of the United States.

     Candidates must choose one of the above named presidents of the United States and produce a
     well-structured assessment of their successes and failures in social and economic issues
     and policies. Reference to specific policies and examples to support claims of success or failure
     must be provided.

     Social policy may include, but not be limited to: health; education; gender; civil rights issues;
     matters relating to religion or ethnicity.

     Economic policies may include, but not be limited to: employment; welfare; inflation; recession;
     redistribution of wealth.

10.   Analyse the reasons for the growth of political extremism in democratic states.

      The growth of political extremism is often the result of an unsuccessful response to a serious crisis
      or challenges experienced by a democratic state. The failure or perceived failure of a government
      to respond to these challenges may encourage people to seek a radical solution.

      Extremism can also be the result of the emergence of a radical ideology or charismatic leader,
      which encourages people to abandon democratic beliefs for something more extreme.

      Candidates should present a well-structured analysis which shows that they understand the types of
      situation that led to extremism: Specific examples to illustrate the claims are necessary.

      Examples of a crisis or challenge that could lead to extremism may include:
       severe economic depression;
       military defeat or invasion which undermines the government;
       breakdown of society into racial or ethnic violence – civil war.

      A society in which democracy is new or has shallow roots will be more vulnerable to these factors –
      as may be evidenced in the new states which emerged after the Great War – or the ex-colonial states
      after 1945 which experimented with democratic models, but which did not always succeed.


11.   How successful was Nelson Mandela in overcoming the challenges faced by South Africa
      between 1991 and 2000?

      This question requires an awareness of the challenges faced by Nelson Mandela as leader of the
      ANC and president of South Africa (1994–1999). Candidates should select relevant issues for
      investigation and comment critically on the degree to which they feel Mandela dealt with them.

      Issues may include:
       the negotiations to draw up a new constitution in the post-Apartheid era;
       the first election by universal suffrage in 1994; implementation of the new constitution;
       programme to improve education, health and housing;
       challenge of creating economic growth and attracting foreign investment;
       high crime rates and dissatisfaction amongst various groups in South Africa;
       reconciling Whites and Blacks in the post-apartheid era;
       tribal conflicts, particularly in Natal;
       AIDS crisis/treatment.

      Specific examples and evidence are needed to support any critical commentary or analysis.

12.   In what ways can a system of proportional representation both support and weaken
      democratic states?

      Candidates should demonstrate an understanding of what is meant by proportional representation
      and how it is designed to operate. The advantages and disadvantages of proportional representation
      for a democratic society forms the basis of the answer.

      Specific examples are required for an effective response.

      The advantages of a proportional representation system for a democratic state may include:
       it gives fair representation in the legislature based on the percentage of popular vote for all
        parties;
       it allows smaller groups to gain representation in the legislature;
       it encourages new parties to stand for election;
       it encourages participation and involvement in the electoral and political process by a wider
        range of citizens;
       it is seen as more democratic and reflective of public opinion.

      The disadvantages of such a system may include:
       it encourages a large number of parties which makes a majority government difficult to obtain;
       coalition governments are common – these may be fragile and short-lived;
       lack of a majority and frequent coalitions may lead to legislative paralysis;
       the government may not be able to respond effectively in a crisis if the coalition cannot agree;
       the system may encourage extremist or splinter parties with narrow agendas.

      Answers should be supported with specific detailed reference to events in democratic states studied.

      More than one state should be addressed. If only state is addressed mark out of a maximum of
      [12 marks].

Topic 3     Origins and development of authoritarian and single-party states

13.   Compare and contrast the conditions which helped the rise to power of two right-wing leaders
      of single-party states.

      Popular choices here may be Hitler, Mussolini, Franco, Perón or Pinochet – but accept any other
      valid examples from the twentieth century. Conditions refer to social, economic, political and
      ideological tensions which existed in the selected countries.

      If only one leader is discussed, mark out of a maximum of [7 marks].


14.   To what extent did either Mao’s or Stalin’s domestic policies solve the problems they faced?

      Answers to this question should identify the problems and specific policies and assess the
      extent to which such policies addressed the stated problems.

      Stalin’s problems included the economy – with limited industrial development and food shortages.
      His solution was to adopt the policy of rapid industrialization at the expense of the peasants by
      implementing the Five Year Plans and Collectivization. Political problems included the need to
      fully establish the one-party state, to increase his own control of the party and control of all aspects
      of social and cultural life to ensure the population served the needs of the state. Policies to achieve
      this included purges of the party and other potential opponents, using coercion to control the
      population at large, issuing a new constitution in 1936, using the party and state to control arts,
      education and the Orthodox Church.

      Mao’s problems were: devastation of the country after the civil war and the war with Japan; to
      improve the conditions of the peasant masses that supported him; to organize the country; to
      eliminate opposition. The policies were: agrarian reform (redistribution of land and collectivization
      of farms); Five Year Plan to promote industry; the Hundred Flowers campaign in 1957 (calling for
      constructive criticism); the Great Leap Forward in 1958 (to meet China’s needs – a policy that was
      not based on Soviet experience and which introduced the communes and emphasis on small
      factories to promote industrialization) and the Cultural Revolution from 1966 to 1969 (to “save” the
      revolution and uproot opposition). Politically – by the mid-1950’s China had become a one-party
      state and the CCP formed the basis of all political and administrative structures.

      N.B. The focus of this question is rule and not rise!

15.   “Authoritarian leaders use political policies to maintain power.” With reference to either
      Nasser or Perón, to what extent do you agree with this statement?

      Answers to this question should discuss the meaning of “authoritarian”. There are many definitions
      of authoritarianism and accept the one provided if it is supported by relevant evidence.
      “To what extent” suggests that “other reasons”, apart from “political”, helped the leader to maintain
      power.

      In both cases, arguments in support of the question could mention: the centralized structure of the
      government, making policy implementation easier; the control over, and support of, the military in
      providing security for the system and control of society; a bureaucracy staffed by supporters of the
      regime; control of internal opposition and dissent; the use of political parties to mobilize people
      around the goals of the government; lack of pluralism and changes to the constitution.

      In both cases, arguments could be made that in addition to, or because of, other factors they
      maintained power – for example both Nasser and Perón were charismatic and popular leaders. Both
      used nationalism, and social and economic policies to maintain their regimes.

      In the case of Nasser, “Nasserism” was built on Egypt’s opposition to “imperialist influence” in the
      Arab world and a belief in the benefits of pan-Arab unity. Nationalism required the building of a
      strong state with a powerful military and a mission to defend the Arab world against imperialism
      and Zionism. Nasser’s charismatic leadership and the populist policies such as land reform, and
      social welfare as well as a nationalistic foreign policy legitimized the regime and helped his
      retention of power.

      Perón, a populist, offered “Justicialism” a combination of nationalism and social democracy. He
      was first elected president in 1946. His followers formed the Peronist Party. Perón appealed to the
      working class with higher wages, pensions, stronger unions and other benefits. He won the loyalty
      of the armed forces by increasing the military budget. Perón espoused nationalism and enhanced
      Argentinean pride by taking control of foreign-owned resources and industries. He increased
      government spending, built up manufacturing, and increased taxes on farm production. His charm
      and appeal to Argentina’s national pride helped him remain popular. He retained his position
      through a combination of authoritarian rule and popular policies, such as votes for women which
      helped him win elections.

16.   With reference to one left-wing totalitarian state, examine its impact on the lives of its citizens.

      Answers to this question should show an understanding of the term “totalitarian”. The general
      definition is one of a political system that seeks to mobilize entire populations in support of an
      official state ideology, and is intolerant of activities which are not directed towards the goals of the
      state, entailing repression or state control of business, the labour unions, churches, political
      opposition and most aspects of life.

      The impact could be examined by reference to the state’s influence upon the population in the areas
      of enforcing ideological conformity (and methods), the economic system, the political structure,
      religion, the curtailment of civil rights, the use of force, etc.

      Answers must be supported with specific detail.


17.   How and why was propaganda used in two single-party states, each chosen from a different
      region?

      The “how” could include: use of radio and of the arts, rallies, symbols used by the regime,
      sports events, slogans or posters.

      The “why” could include: to control and direct the minds of the people, to gain more support for the
      regime and to be able to achieve the goals of the regime.

      Answers should be supported with specific detailed examples from regimes studied.

      If only one state is discussed, or one region, mark out of a maximum of [12 marks].


18.   Analyse the treatment of religious groups in two single-party states, each chosen from a
      different region.

      Religious policies of single-party states which illustrate the treatment of groups could include:
      tolerance (for political reasons) and establishing links (such as alliances and treaties, role in
      education) with the predominant faith of the country; opposition or banishment; attempts at forming
      “new” faith movements; censorship or outright attempts to eliminate potential opposition.

      Analysis should focus upon not only policies and methods but upon the reasons why religious
      groups were treated in the manner identified.

      If only one state is discussed, or one region, mark out of a maximum of [12 marks].

Topic 4     Nationalist and independence movements in Africa and Asia and post-1945 Central and
            Eastern European states

19.   Assess the impact of the Cold War on the independence movements in two colonial states in
      Asia or Africa.

      Candidates must assess the impact of the Cold War in a well-structured response. Narrative
      accounts of independence movements will not gain the higher levels of award.

      Cold War rivalry between the US and the USSR had a significant impact on independence
      movements. Both powers sought to expand their influence to all areas of the world and wished to
      gain support of new leaders and countries. Their motives were strategic, economic and ideological.
      They may also have been motivated by the need for prestige.

      Ways in which the Cold War had an impact on independence movements may include:
       arms and equipment supplied for armed struggle;
       economic subsidies;
       training, education of leaders, troops, administrators;
       promises of alliance, security when independence was achieved;
       independence movements could bargain for support from both sides at once;
       US and USSR put pressure on colonial powers such as Britain and France to relinquish their
        colonies.

      Students must include specific examples from two states in their response.

      If only one state is discussed, mark out of a maximum of [12 marks].


20.   Analyse the importance of Gandhi to the success of the Indian independence movement.

      This may prove a popular question which may encourage students to write a narrative account of
      Gandhi’s work for independence. This will not score well: what is required is a structured analysis
      of the significance of Gandhi’s work relative to other factors which contributed to Indian
      independence.

      Gandhi’s contributions should be well-known: his civil disobedience campaigns, peaceful protests;
      his moral and spiritual influence; the mobilization of the masses to support the demand for
      independence.

      “Other factors” that helped achieve Indian independence may include:
       the impact of the First and Second World Wars in Britain and India;
       changing political attitudes in Britain towards the Empire;
       British economic weakness post-1945;
       the contributions of Jinnah and the Muslim league;
       pressure from the US on Britain to grant independence;
       the influence of other leaders such as Nehru;
       the evolution of a well-trained Indian political and bureaucratic class.

21.   By what methods, and with what results, did either Poland or Czechoslovakia seek to gain
      independence from Soviet control after 1968?

      This question asks candidates to address methods and results in the selected state.

      Methods
       Inspirational leadership e.g. Walesa, Havel;
       Non-violent forms of protest: Solidarity, Charter 77, Worker’s Defence Committee;
       Gaining the support of religious leaders;
       Developing a strong sense of nationalism among citizens;
       Using underground press to mobilize supporters, distribute criticisms of the regime and form
        resistance groups, labour unions and intellectual organizations.
      N.B. Helsinki Accords provided a basis for criticism of Soviet rule.

      Results

      Poland
       Solidarity was formed to provide economic and individual rights;
       Martial law was imposed – but with Polish leadership, which limited Soviet influence;
       As a result of Solidarity and other pressures, the communist government embraced Gorbachev
        and Glasnost, which ended Soviet influence.

      Czechoslovakia
       Charter 77 and Havel gained more influence as a result of persecution by the regime;
       Greater pressure for independence developed in Czechoslovakia after 1985;
       Intellectuals, students and religious institutions demonstrated against the regime and its attempts
        at repression;
       Czech efforts were limited in success until Gorbachev effectively withdrew Moscow’s support
        for repressive regimes in the satellite states marking an end to the possibility of interference as
        had been the case under the Brezhnev Doctrine.

22.   With reference to two states in Africa and/or Asia, assess the importance of armed struggle for
      states seeking to achieve independence.

      Independence for many African and Asian colonies was achieved relatively peacefully. A number
      of states gained their independence only after significant armed struggle. Examples of these would
      include, but not be limited to Angola, Vietnam, Algeria, Zimbabwe. However, armed struggle was
      not always the most significant reason for the achievement or attainment or independence – as
      noted in examples such as Ceylon, Gold Coast/Ghana/Nigeria, to name a few, where the relatively
      peaceful transition to independence was due to other factors. Candidates who indicate that armed
      struggle was not always necessary (and why) should be credited.

      Candidates could explain, why some independence movements were forced to resort to armed
      struggle bearing in mind the caveat above. A simple narrative of the struggle for independence
      will not reach the higher level of awards.

      Reasons why armed struggle occurred may include:
       colonial governments unwilling to surrender power peacefully or by negotiation;
       large non-native populations opposing independence;
       independence movements or leaders which promote violence as part of their ideology;
       a history of failed attempts to gain independence by peaceful means;
       availability of weapons from outside parties anxious to gain influence;
       impatience with the pace of the independence process by some militant groups.

      If only one state is discussed, mark out of a maximum of [12 marks].

23.   Analyse the reasons for the dissolution of Yugoslavia in the post-Soviet period.

      The collapse of Yugoslavia occurred for a number of reasons. Some are linked to the end of the
      Soviet presence in Eastern Europe, others are unique to the country itself.

      Yugoslavia was a country composed of six different states, each with distinct racial, ethnic and
      religious differences.

      Yugoslavia was held together by the personality of Tito and Marxist ideology which instituted a
      centralised dictatorial state, but which enjoyed relative economic prosperity.

      The collapse of Yugoslavia is largely related to these factors:
       Tito died in 1980 – leaving a structure of a collective presidency;
       the Yugoslavian economy collapsed in the mid 1980s destabilizing the federal state;
       this destabilization encouraged and allowed centrifugalist forces to assert and/or to re-assert
        themselves;
       the split was made wider by the tension between Serbian attempts to continue central control
        under Milosevic and separatist movements in the other states;
       dissolution was further encouraged by the evolution of multiparty states in Slovenia and Croatia
        in contrast to the Serbian desire for an autocratic form of government;
       historical differences, religious hostility and traditional hatreds contributed to and deepened the
        division;
       civil war resulted which ultimately led to the establishment of a number independent states in the
        former Yugoslavia.


24.   Assess the significance of ethnic, racial and separatist movements as challenges to
      post-colonial states in Asia and Africa.

      Many African and Asian states are composed of a number of ethnic and/or religious groups.

      Post-colonial governments faced challenges including: lack of experience and weak governmental
      structures; economic problems; international conflicts.

      Candidates should assess how significant a challenge was posed by ethnic, racial and separatist
      movements.

      Problems that ethnic, racial and separatist movements caused may include:
       civil conflict, violence and destruction;
       break-up of the state into separate parts;
       inability to form a government due to lack of cooperation;
       genocidal outbreaks as one group tries to eliminate the other;
       economic weakness due to destruction, internal strife and discouragement of investors;
       lack of investment from foreign sources;
       emergence of authoritarian leaders who repress dissidents;
       invasion by outside forces in support of one of the groups.

      N.B. Answers must be supported with specific detail.

      If only one state is addressed, mark out of a maximum of [12 marks].

Topic 5        The Cold War

25.   For what reasons, and to what extent, did the Yalta Conference of February 1945 contribute
      to the origins of the Cold War?

      At Yalta it was agreed to divide Germany into four zones of occupation (Berlin was also to be
      divided). All agreed that the United Nations was to be established. The Soviet Union agreed to
      enter the war against Japan in return for Sakhalin Island. It was also agreed that the Russo–Polish
      border would follow the Curzon line (with compensation to Poland from German territory). They
      also issued a Declaration On Liberated Europe.

      By February 1945 it was clear that Nazi Germany would be defeated and thus the need for the unity
      of the wartime alliance was less urgent. The Big Three failed to agree on specific detail regarding
      key issues such as reparations, war crimes and the Polish–German borders. They were also not
      definite as to what each considered to be “free elections” and “democratic governments” in
      liberated states – a source of later dispute.

      Yalta was the point in the relations of the Big Three when earlier tensions began to resurface and
      which were added to by the unresolved issues. The unresolved issue of “spheres of influence”
      foreshadowed the physical division of the Cold War.

      Answers should focus on “reasons” and “extent”.

      Do not expect all of the above but reward analysis and specific evidence.

      N.B. Answers which provide a general explanation or overview or origins of the Cold War are
      unlikely to score well.

26.   Compare and contrast the effects of peaceful coexistence during the 1950s and 1960s in any
      two countries.

      Popular choices could be China, the Soviet Union, Germany, Hungary, Poland or the United States.

      Answers to should define/explain the candidate’s understanding of the term “peaceful coexistence”
      and address its effects with supporting evidence. “Effects” refers to results and these can be
      positive or negative and should include social, economic – but more importantly political and
      diplomatic effects. International relations and foreign policy changes within a country might be
      also discussed. Long-term effects, such as the Sino–Soviet Split, could be addressed. Candidates
      might also provide a background of the selected country to explain the effects of peaceful
      coexistence. Other examples where the concept of peaceful coexistence had major effects were
      Poland and Hungary.

      Peaceful coexistence was suggested by Khrushchev in 1956. He believed that peaceful relations
      were possible despite ideological differences and that it was possible to avoid war by engaging in
      peaceful competition with regards to politics and economics against the commonly held view that
      Communism and Democracy/Capitalism could never coexist.

      If only one country is addressed, mark out of a maximum of [7 marks].


27.   “The events in Cuba during 1962 were the most evident display of brinkmanship.” To what
      extent do you agree with this statement?

      Candidates should approach this question by defining the term “brinkmanship” and applying it to
      the actions of Kennedy and Khrushchev during the Cuban Missile Crisis.

      Secretary of State Dulles defined the policy of brinkmanship as “the ability to get to the verge
      without getting into the war”. The concept implies pushing to a dangerous extent in order to force
      the opposition to make concessions.

      Arguments that support this view could maintain that during the crisis the superpowers were on the
      “brink” of a nuclear war, which was avoided by the eventual compromise reached by Khrushchev
      and Kennedy. Emphasis should be on Kennedy’s actions and words that demonstrated
      brinkmanship. Alternative arguments could focus on Khrushchev’s actions and argue that the
      example of brinkmanship was his, not Kennedy’s.

      “To what extent” implies that candidates could consider other events that exemplify brinkmanship.
      If that is the case, specific examples and evidence should support the answer.

28.   Analyse the role of Vietnam in the development of the Cold War between 1964 and 1975.

      The period indicated in the question corresponds to the escalation of the United States’ intervention
      in Vietnam to the end of the Vietnam War.

      Answers could develop the following areas: America’s fear of Communism contributed to the
      further development of the policy of containment; fear of China led to the decision to intervene in
      Vietnam. This was supported by Johnson’s belief in the domino theory which was enunciated by
      Eisenhower in 1954. Between 1965 and 1968, the Johnson administration escalated intervention in
      South Vietnam in terms of men and resources to protect unpopular, often incompetent but above all
      anti-communist regimes.

      The communist powers helped North Vietnam with economic and military aid which gave the
      conflict its Cold War features.

      Criticism of US policy and tactics grew both at home and abroad – for example it affected the
      “special relationship” with Britain which questioned US Cold War policies.

      Nixon adopted the policy of détente with the Soviet Union and rapprochement with the People’s
      Republic of China because the problems faced by the US as a consequence of the involvement in
      Vietnam made it critical to reduce tensions elsewhere. On the other hand, the Cold War continued
      for nearly fifteen years after the end of the Vietnam conflict.


29.   To what extent did events in Eastern European countries contribute to the end of the Cold
      War?

      In 1989 five Eastern European states experienced the collapse of their pro-Soviet Communist
      regimes. Poland, Hungary, East Germany, Czechoslovakia and Romania were then joined by
      Bulgaria in the middle of 1990. This was mainly peaceful change (Romania was an exception).
      Unpopular, economically inefficient governments collapsed under the weight of popular protest
      when Gorbachev made it clear that he would not use the Brezhnev Doctrine to maintain control of
      Eastern Europe. The destruction of the Berlin Wall in 1989 was the most potent symbol of the
      collapse of Communism. Since the Soviet states and her allies no longer posed a threat to the US or
      Western Europe 1989 is often considered to be the end of the Cold War.

      “Other factors” to be addressed could be arms limitation agreements between the US and the USSR
      which signalled the beginning of the end of the Cold War and the policies of Gorbachev and
      Reagan.


30.   With reference to one country, discuss the social impact of the Cold War between 1953 and
      1964.

      Social impact could address: education; employment opportunities and patterns; propaganda and the
      media; fear; stereotypes; demographic changes; conscription and the return of soldiers after a war;
      living conditions; access (or not) to consumer goods/commodities ; prosperity or poverty; changes
      in the role of women; etc.
