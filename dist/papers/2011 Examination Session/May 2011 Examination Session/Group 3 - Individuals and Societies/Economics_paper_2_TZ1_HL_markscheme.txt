maximum marks indicated. Each question is worth [10 marks].

1.       Explain the concept of opportunity cost and how it may be used to show the difference
         between free goods and economic goods.

         Candidates may include:
          a definition of opportunity cost
          a definition of free goods
          a definition of economic goods
          examples of free goods
          examples of economic goods
          an explanation of free goods having no opportunity cost and therefore no price

          an explanation of opportunity cost using examples and PPC diagram
          use of supply and demand diagrams to distinguish between free goods and economic goods.

         Candidates who incorrectly label diagrams cannot be rewarded with full marks.

         Examiners should be aware that candidates may take a different approach which if appropriate,
         should be rewarded.

           fixed income earners suffer lower real income

           menu costs
           the signalling power of relative price change is undermined

           inflation with negative consequences for the balance of payments
           inflation may lead to a depreciation/devaluation of the currency that would reduce the country’s
           purchasing power abroad and increase its external debt burden.

5.       Given that a country’s terms of trade are improving, explain the possible impact on its
         balance of payments on current account.

         Candidates may include:
           a definition of terms of trade
           a definition of balance of payments on current account
           an explanation of improving terms of trade
           an explanation of possible fall in quantity demanded for exports and increase in quantity
           demanded for imports
           consideration of price elasticity of demand (PED)
           consideration of the importance of the causes of the changes of terms of trade
           if the improvement in the terms of trade occurs due to an increase in demand for exports and/or
           decrease in demand for imports then the current account balance would improve regardless
           of PED
           if the improvement in the terms of trade occurs due to a decrease in the supply of exports and/or
           increase in the supply of imports, then the effect on the current account balance depends on PED.

         Examiners should be aware that candidates may take a different approach which if appropriate,
         should be rewarded.

6.       Explain the importance of the concept of income elasticity of demand for the exports and
         imports of less-developed countries (LDCs).

         Candidates may include:
           a definition of income elasticity of demand (YED)
           a definition of less-developed countries (LDCs)
           an explanation of type of exports from LDCs, assumed to be primary products
           an explanation of relatively low YED for exports of primary commodities
           an explanation of type of imports for LDCs, assumed to be mainly manufactured goods
           an explanation of relatively high YED for imports of manufactured goods
           an explanation that as trading partners (MDCs) experience economic growth, there will be a less
           than proportionate increase in the demand for LDCs exports
           an explanation that as LDCs experience economic growth, there will be a higher than
           proportionate increase in the demand for LDCs imports
           an explanation that the terms of trade may deteriorate over the long term
           the impact on the current account balance of payments of LDCs
           examples.

         N.B. The question and markscheme assume the classical conditions prevailing in LDCs some
         years ago. Some candidates may comment on this. These candidates may refer to a distinction
         between “less” developed countries and “least” developed countries. Many LDCs now export
         manufactures and services more than primary products.

         Examiners should be aware that candidates may take a different approach which if appropriate,
         should be rewarded.
