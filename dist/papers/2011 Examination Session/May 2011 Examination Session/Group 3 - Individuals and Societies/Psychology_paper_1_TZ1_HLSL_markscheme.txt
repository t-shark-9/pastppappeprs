                                              SECTION A

Biological level of analysis

1.   Explain how one hormone influences human behaviour.                                          [8 marks]

     Refer to the paper 1 section A markbands below when awarding marks.

     The command term “explain” requires candidates to give a detailed account of how the
     chosen hormone influences a chosen human behaviour. Responses should make a clear
     link between the function of the hormone and human behaviour.

     A number of different hormones could be chosen, including: adrenaline, cortisol,
     melatonin, testosterone, estrogen, oxytocin.

     Any aspect of human behaviour (e.g. aggression, depression, stress, sexual interest) is
     acceptable as long as the response focuses on how the hormone influences the particular
     behaviour.

     Examples of how hormones influence human behaviour could be the influence of
     cortisol on memory, oxytocin on attachment, testosterone on aggression, or melatonin
     on sleep patterns. Responses that address the influence of neurotransmitter such as
     dopamine, serotonin, GABA and acetylcholine should not be awarded any marks.
     Where a neurotransmitter and hormone are chemically the same (e.g. noradrenaline)
     answers should make it clear that they are explaining the hormonal function.

     Responses should address just one hormone’s influence, and where candidates have
     provided more than one example, credit should be given only to the first response.

     0              The answer does not reach a standard described by the descriptors below.

     1 to 3         There is an attempt to answer the question, but knowledge and
                    understanding is limited, often inaccurate, or of marginal relevance to the
                    question.

     4 to 6         The question is partially answered. Knowledge and understanding is
                    accurate but limited. Either the command term is not effectively
                    addressed or the response is not sufficiently explicit in answering the
                    question.

     7 to 8         The question is answered in a focused and effective manner and meets
                    the demands of the command term. The response is supported by
                    appropriate and accurate knowledge and understanding of research.

Cognitive level of analysis

2.   Describe one research study which has investigated schema theory.                            [8 marks]

     Refer to the paper 1 section A markbands below when awarding marks.

     The command term “describe” requires candidates to give a detailed account of a study
     related to the schema theory. This description may include the aim, procedure, results
     and conclusion of the study.

     Examples of studies which could be used include:
      Brewer and Treyens (1981) tested the influence of schemas on memory.
      Bartlett (1932) – War of the Ghosts.
      Bachen, McLoughlin, and Garcia (1999) tested Bem’s (1981) gender schema theory
       by examining college students’ behavioural expectations of male and female
       teachers.

     High markband responses should clearly relate the conclusion of the study to schema
     theory. No marks should be awarded for responses that describe only schema theory
     without reference to a study.

     Where candidates have described more than one study, credit should be given only to
     the first response.

3.   Outline two errors in attribution.                                                           [8 marks]

     Refer to the paper 1 section A markbands below when awarding marks.

     The command term “outline” requires candidates to give a brief account or summary of
     two errors in attribution.

     Candidates can choose from a large number of attribution errors including fundamental
     attribution error or correspondence bias, just-world hypothesis, illusory correlation,
     self-serving bias, in-group bias or the halo effect.

     Where candidates have outlined more than two examples of errors in attribution, credit
     should be given only to the first two responses.

     Where candidates have outlined one example of an error in attribution, apply the
     markbands up to a maximum of [4 marks].

Section B assessment criteria

A — Knowledge and comprehension

Marks         Level descriptor

0             The answer does not reach a standard described by the descriptors below.

1 to 3        The answer demonstrates limited knowledge and understanding that is of
              marginal relevance to the question. Little or no psychological research is used
              in the response.

4 to 6        The answer demonstrates limited knowledge and understanding relevant to the
              question or uses relevant psychological research to limited effect in the
              response.

7 to 9        The answer demonstrates detailed, accurate knowledge and understanding
              relevant to the question, and uses relevant psychological research effectively in
              support of the response.


B — Evidence of critical thinking: application, analysis, synthesis, evaluation

Marks         Level descriptor

0             The answer does not reach a standard described by the descriptors below.

1 to 3        The answer goes beyond description but evidence of critical thinking is not
              linked to the requirements of the question.

4 to 6        The answer offers appropriate but limited evidence of critical thinking or offers
              evidence of critical thinking that is only implicitly linked to the requirements of
              the question.

7 to 9        The answer integrates relevant and explicit evidence of critical thinking in
              response to the question.


C — Organization

0             The answer does not reach a standard described by the descriptors below.

1 to 2        The answer is organized or focused on the question. However, this is not
              sustained throughout the response.

3 to 4        The answer is well organized, well developed and focused on the question.

                                            SECTION B

4.   Discuss ethical considerations related to research conducted into genetic influences
     on behaviour.                                                                        [22 marks]

     Refer to the paper 1 section B assessment criteria when awarding marks.

     The command term “discuss” requires candidates to offer a considered and balanced
     review of ethical issues related to research conducted into genetic influences.

     Possible research could include: Bouchard (1990), Minnesota Twin Study, or Plomin
     and Petrill’s (1997) study on IQ.

     Discussions could be based around:
      how the study has been conducted in terms of ethical issues such as informed
       consent, confidentiality, psychological harm, right to withdraw and deception
      how the findings of research have been interpreted and applied, including the
       possible abuse of findings.

     Candidates may discuss a relatively small number of ethical considerations in greater
     depth or a greater number in less depth, thereby demonstrating a breadth of
     understanding. Both approaches are equally acceptable.

     Responses focused on research conducted on animals should be awarded the full range
     of marks.

5.   To what extent do social or cultural factors affect one cognitive process?                   [22 marks]

     Refer to the paper 1 section B assessment criteria when awarding marks.

     The command term “to what extent” requires the candidate to consider the merits or
     otherwise of the argument regarding the influence of social or cultural factors on one
     cognitive process.

     The aim of the essay is to produce an informed conclusion, whereby opinions and
     judgments are presented clearly and supported with appropriate evidence and sound
     argument.

     Some factors which may be used include, but are not limited to:
      education
      memory strategies in different cultures
      strategies to develop dual attention skills through video game training
      cultural differences exist in the susceptibility of making fundamental attribution
       error: people from individualistic cultures are prone to the error while people from
       collectivistic cultures commit less of it (Miller, 1984; Markus and Kitayama, 1991)
      perception – cross-cultural differences in the perception of illusions, depth perception
       and size constancy.

     Responses should address just one cognitive process, and where candidates have
     provided more than one, credit should be given only to the first response.

     Candidates may discuss a relatively small number of social or cultural factors in greater
     depth or a greater number of social or cultural factors in less depth, thereby
     demonstrating a breadth of understanding. Both approaches are equally acceptable.

     Where candidates have considered both social and cultural factors, credit should be
     given only to the first response.

6.   Discuss factors influencing conformity.                                                     [22 marks]

     Refer to the paper 1 section B assessment criteria when awarding marks.

     The command term “discuss” requires candidates to offer a considered and balanced
     review of factors influencing conformity. More than one factor should be addressed.

     There are a number of factors influencing conformity that can be discussed, including:
      culture
      groupthink
      risky shift
      minority influence
      group size.

     Individual factors could include Crutchfield’s conforming personality theory (1956) that
     argues that personality factors influence whether or not an individual will conform.

     In a meta-analysis, Bond (2005) found differences in the effect of group size based on
     the type of social influence. Specific research on the influence of unanimity and
     accuracy, cohesion, confidence, gender, status, cultural norms, among others could
     be cited.

     Candidates may discuss a relatively small number of factors in greater depth or a greater
     number of factors in less depth, thereby demonstrating a breadth of understanding.
     Both approaches are equally acceptable.

     If factors influencing obedience, rather than conformity, are discussed, no marks should
     be awarded for this. Responses discussing Stanford Prison Study should not be
     awarded marks unless they clearly address the influence of societal roles on conformity.
