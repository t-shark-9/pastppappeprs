Answer one question. Each question is worth [25 marks].

1.    (a)   Explain the roles of market forces and government in allocating resources in a
            mixed economy.                                                                      [10 marks]

      (b)   Evaluate the extent to which market forces should be used to lessen the problem
            of environmental pollution.                                                         [15 marks]


2.    (a)   Using appropriate diagrams, explain how a reduction in income tax could
            affect both aggregate demand and aggregate supply in an economy.                    [10 marks]

      (b)   “The lower the level of both direct and indirect taxation, the better.”
            Evaluate this view.                                                                 [15 marks]


3.    (a)   Using a diagram, explain the factors which might cause a depreciation of a
            country’s exchange rate.                                                            [10 marks]

      (b)   “A depreciation of a country’s exchange rate will always have a beneficial effect
            on the performance of its economy.” Evaluate this view.                             [15 marks]


4.    (a)   Explain the main features of market-led strategies used to achieve economic
            development in less-developed countries (LDCs).                                     [10 marks]

      (b)   Evaluate the view that economic development in less-developed countries
            (LDCs) can best be achieved through market-led strategies rather than
            interventionist strategies.                                                         [15 marks]
