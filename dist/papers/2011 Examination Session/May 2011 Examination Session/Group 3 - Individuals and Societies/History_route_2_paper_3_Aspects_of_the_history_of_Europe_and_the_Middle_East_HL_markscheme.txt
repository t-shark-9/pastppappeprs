 0:      Answers not meeting the requirements of descriptors should be awarded no marks.
 1–2:    Answers do not meet the demands of the question and show little or no evidence of
         appropriate structure. There is little more than unsupported generalization.
 3–4:    There is little understanding of the question. Historical knowledge is present but the
         detail is insufficient. Historical context or processes are barely understood and there
         are little more than poorly substantiated assertions.
 5–6:   Answers indicate some understanding of the question, but historical knowledge is
        limited in quality and quantity. Understanding of historical processes may be present
        but underdeveloped. The question is only partially addressed.
 7–8:   The demands of the question are generally understood. Relevant, historical knowledge
        is present but is unevenly applied. Knowledge is narrative or descriptive in nature.
        There may be limited argument that requires further substantiation.
        Critical commentary may be present. An attempt to place events in historical context
        and show an understanding of historical processes. An attempt at a structured
        approach, either chronological or thematic has been made.
 9–11: Answers indicate that the question is understood but not all implications considered.
        Knowledge is largely accurate. Critical commentary may be present. Events are
        generally placed in context, and historical processes, such as comparison and contrast,
        are understood. There is a clear attempt at a structured approach. Focus on AO1, AO2
        and AO4. Responses that simply summarize the views of historians cannot reach the
        top of this markband.
 12–14: Answers are clearly focused on the demands of the question. Relevant in-depth
        knowledge is applied as evidence, and analysis or critical commentary are used to
        indicate some in-depth understanding but is not consistent throughout. Events are
        placed in context and there is sound understanding of historical processes and
        comparison and contrast. Evaluation of different approaches may be used to
        substantiate arguments presented. Synthesis is present but not always consistently
        integrated. Focus on AO3 and AO4.
 15–17: Answers are clearly structured and focused, have full awareness of the demands of the
        question, and if appropriate may challenge it. Accurate and detailed historical
        knowledge is used convincingly to support critical commentary. Historical processes
        such as comparison and contrast, placing events in context and evaluating different
        interpretations are used appropriately and effectively. Answers are well-structured and
        balanced and synthesis is well-developed and supported with knowledge and critical
        commentary.
 18–20: Answers are clearly focused with a high degree of the awareness of the question and
        may challenge it successfully. Knowledge is extensive, accurately applied and there
        may be a high level of conceptual ability. Evaluation of different approaches may
        be present as may be understanding of historical processes as well as comparison
        and contrast where relevant. Evaluation is integrated into the answer. The answer is
        well-structured and well-focused. Synthesis is highly developed.

1.   Analyse the reasons for the violent nature of the French revolution in the years 1789–1794.

     Violent episodes will be well-known: the storming of the Bastille; continuous street violence in
     Paris; peasant violence in the countryside; the march on Versailles October 1789; September
     Massacres; execution of the King and Queen; Vendee revolt; the “Reign of terror” 1793–1794.

     Reasons could include: hatred of the ancien régime, largely as a consequence of economic hardship;
     radical politicians such as Marat inciting the mob; fear of invasion after 1792 led to more radical
     politicians (Jacobins) being in control of the Convention; conflict between leading revolutionaries
     such as Danton, Hebert and Robespierre. Better candidates might point out that the levels of
     political violence made the more moderate Thermidorians acceptable by 1794/5.


2.   “Napoleon’s ambitious imperial policy was the main reason for his ultimate failure.” To what
     extent do you agree with this statement?

     Reasons for Napoleon I’s failure could include: continued British resistance and naval supremacy;
     the British campaign in the Peninsular War; the overextension of the empire; emergence of Prussian
     resistance; the invasion of Russia (1812) and its impact – creation of the fourth Coalition 1814; the
     internal revolt of April 1814 led to his abdication. In 1815 on his return from Elba the Fourth
     Coalition acted to prevent his consolidation of power and finally defeated him at Waterloo.

     Napoleon’s imperial policy was ambitious for both himself and France. Analysis could comment
     on the overstretching of resources and resentment of the imposition of Bonapartist monarchies,
     creating resistance but also levels of popularity within France.

     Some candidates may take this question to refer to Napoleon III 1852 – 1870 if so credit all material
     relevant to Napoleon III.

     Napoleon III’s activities were mainly confined to European affairs. However his policies in Mexico
     1864 led to distrust from other major powers. Austria was alienated by the death of Maximilien.
     There was further interference in North Africa, Suez and Indo-China which caused French
     diplomatic isolation, leaving France to face Prussia alone in 1870.


3.   Why had Prussia emerged as the leading German state by 1862?

     Prussia’s main rival was Austria, so answers should consider the relative strengths of both in the
     years between 1815 and 1862. Areas to consider include: economic development and the
     importance of the Zollverein in strengthening Prussia (Austria excluded from the Zollverein);
     other economic aspects include railways, trade and industrial development. Strengths and
     weaknesses of both governments could include the post-1848 situation. Problems within the
     Austrian Empire could include: issues of nationalities; conflicts in Italy in the 1850s; all of these
     weakened Austria, although this was not entirely clear until the 1866 conflict.

     This is not a question on Bismarck’s policies but on Prussia’s position prior to Bismarck
     gaining power.

4.   Compare and contrast the unification of Germany and Italy in the nineteenth century.

     Comparisons: nationalism had emerged to some extent as a consequence of the French occupation –
     there were revolutions in 1830 and 1848 which kept nationalism on the agenda; both had
     dominant politicians who furthered unification (Cavour and Bismarck), who both achieved gradual
     unification as a consequence of war: German – Danish war (1864); Austro – Prussian war (1866);
     Franco – Prussian war (1870); Italy – War of Independence (1859) and Garibaldi’s Sicilian
     expedition (1860).

     Contrast: the key contrast is that the process in the German states was driven by Prussia, unaided by
     external assistance, whereas in Italy, Piedmont was not strong enough to deal with Austria without
     external assistance, particularly from France, and by establishing diplomatic links with Prussia,
     which resulted in the acquisition of Venetia in 1866.

     If only comparisons or limited coverage of one country is discussed, mark out of a maximum of [7 marks].


5.   Assess the impact of the Tanzimat reforms on the Ottoman empire.

     Answers should outline the key areas of the reforms: military; educational; legal; administrative;
     economic.

     The impact was variable: legal reform was gradual and often a compromise between European legal
     codes and Sharia.

     Some success was obtained with military reforms but Turkey was still weak. Education was
     removed from the Ulema but in reality the main changes were in towns and cities. In the
     countryside the Ulema remained influential.

     Better candidates might argue that the underlying aims were to strengthen and modernize the
     empire. This was not achieved, thus the impact was limited.


6.   “The Lebanese Civil War (1860) was caused by religious tensions rather than economic
     differences.” To what extent do you agree with this statement?

     Candidates should be able to outline the different religious groups (Druze, Maronites, Shia and
     Sunni Muslims) and be able to comment on levels of tension. However they should also consider
     the economic disparities between peasant and landlord and the fact that the Maronites were
     increasingly linked to the French traders in the area and were thus quite prosperous. They could
     also comment on relative Ottoman weakness in the area and the impact of foreign powers, such as
     Britain and France, which may have contributed to tensions.

     Both economic and religious tensions must be examined to reach a reasoned judgement.
                                                 –6–               M11/3/HISTX/HP3/ENG/TZ0/EM/M

7.   Why had the republic established in France in 1848, become an empire by 1852?

     Events of 1848 that should form the framework for an answer include: the collapse of the July
     monarchy; the establishment of the Second Republic; Louis Napoleon’s coup of December 1851
     and the establishment of the Second Empire (December 1852). However the focus of the question
     is why the Second Republic was so short-lived, so analysis should consider levels of support for
     radical reform especially outside Paris, which led to the election of a right-wing assembly and the
     election of Louis Napoleon as Prince-President indicating a desire for a strong leader. He also had
     the support of the military and the middle classes whilst also being linked to the notion of social
     reform. Louis Napoleon therefore seemed an acceptable leader. Louis Napoleon used the
     uncertainties to his political advantage and gained support for an imperial style of government.
     The Republic was seen as too radical


8.   Analyse Disraeli’s imperial and foreign policies in the years 1874–1880.

     Key events: Suez Canal shares (1875); Empress of India Act (1876); Congress of Berlin (1878);
     Zulu war (1879); Afghan wars (1878–1880).

     Analysis should consider Disraeli’s aims (if he had any, as he is often considered an opportunist,
     especially on imperial policy) but also the consequences. The Suez share purchase had benefits,
     such as the 75 % reduction in transport costs to Australia, New Zealand and India. However it also
     involved the British in Egypt which led to problems for Gladstone and the eventual British
     occupation. The Empress of India Act may have instilled more loyalty in India (debatable – but it
     certainly pleased Victoria). The Congress of Berlin helped to limit Russian influence in the Balkans
     for a time but also established weak states such as “Little Bulgaria”, which had longer-term
     consequences. Britain gained Cyprus. The Zulu war did not resolve the British/Boer tensions but
     the Afghan wars led to better relations between the British and Afghans for twenty years (it could
     be pointed out that events in Africa and Afghanistan were not a consequence of Disraeli’s policies
     but driven by the men on the ground – local officials and politicians), in an era when long-distance
     communications were difficult.
                                                   –7–               M11/3/HISTX/HP3/ENG/TZ0/EM/M

9.    To what extent were Stolypin’s political and economic policies successful in the years
      1906 – 1911?

      Stolypin’s aims need to be identified in order to judge success – maintaining the power of the
      monarchy whilst modernizing and improving Russia’s economy.

      His repression in the post 1905 period and the gradual erosion of the limited powers of the Dumas
      meant that the Autocracy in Russia retained ultimate political power. Repression (Stolypin’s
      Necktie) post 1905 led to the continuance of revolutionary opposition and diminishing support for
      the Tsar even amongst moderates. Economic policies should include encouragement of
      industrialization; foreign investment/trade; government investment in railways; etc. The industrial
      workforce reached 6 million by 1912, but only 6 % of exports were manufactured goods. The
      export of wheat contributed to famines. Stolypin also aimed to improve agriculture (the “gamble on
      the strong”) as well as establishing a loyal peasant class. There was limited success (by 1916 only
      two million peasants had their own land). Agriculture was still very backward and unmechanized,
      and peasant income was very low at GBP26 per annum.

      Candidates may use the phrase “too little too late” when assessing Stolypin’s policies and make the
      point that political opposition was still prevalent and increasing because of the repressive nature of
      the state and the undermining of the Duma.


10.   “There were two revolutions in Russia because of the weakness of the Provisional
      Government.” To what extent do you agree with this statement?

      Answers need to identify what the Russian people wanted – a successful prosecution of the war; land
      reform; democracy; effective government; management of the economy to improve life. It would also
      be appropriate to analyse the strength of the Bolsheviks. Answers may then outline how events
      increased support for the Bolsheviks and undermined support for the Provisional Government. The
      delay over land reform and the election of a Constituent Assembly until the autumn; the system of
      Dual Power with the Soviets; continued failure in the war (Brusilov Offensive); illegal land seizures;
      military desertions; the attempts to overthrow the PG (July Days and Kornilov Coup) all meant that
      by October the Bolsheviks had increased support (majorities on the Petrograd and Moscow
      Soviets) and could risk a coup. Also, Lenin actively worked for a coup in spite of some internal
      party opposition.

      Some students may make reference to the March revolution and suggest that the Provisional
      Government was not a factor. Credit analysis referring to this, however candidates should focus on
      the period of Dual Power.
                                                   –8–               M11/3/HISTX/HP3/ENG/TZ0/EM/M

11.   Analyse the impact of the new German Empire on European affairs in the years 1871–1910.

      Impact could include: the disturbance of the balance of power; tensions between France and
      Germany because of French desire for revenge for 1870/71; anxiety over a powerful Germany
      leading to the eventual establishment of the alliance system. In terms of detail, answers may focus
      on how Bismarck sought to address these fears by his complex policy of “checks and balances”,
      which maintained relative stability until 1890. This system was destabilized by Wilhelm II’s less
      consistent policy, his pursuit of “a place in the sun”, Weltpolitik, the Naval Race – all of which led
      to the division of Europe into the Triple Alliance and Triple Entente.

      This is not a question on the long-term causes of the First World War. Answers should address
      both Bismarck’s and Wilhelm II’s foreign policies.


12.   Discuss the impact of the First World War on domestic affairs in any one country of the region.

      Areas to consider could be: economic – greater government involvement in economic/industrial
      activity; society – the changing role of women (work) as a consequence of mass mobilization of
      men for the armed forces; impact on daily life – food shortages, rationing, military threat to
      civilians in some cases. Political – could include instability in Germany and Italy or the impact of
      the war on the political affairs of any valid example.

      Answers may also consider the post-war impact such as the extension of the franchise to women in
      Great Britain and universal suffrage in Germany. Candidates may legitimately examine conditions
      in Russia but this is not a question on causes of the 1917 revolution.


13.   “Allied diplomacy during the First World War in the Middle East was contradictory and
      caused instability in the region.” To what extent do you agree with this statement?

      Answers should identify the diplomatic events (Hussein–McMahon; Sykes–Picot; Balfour
      Declaration). Areas to consider could include: the contradictory promises to Jews and Arabs over
      Palestine which made the British mandate difficult to govern. Reasonable relations between the
      British the rulers in Iraq and Transjordan could be cited as a counter-argument, especially as Iraq
      gained independence in 1932.

      Diplomacy could include the final establishments of mandates at San Remo (1920) and comments
      could then be made regarding levels of Jewish immigration to Palestine, which contributed
      to tensions.


14.   In what ways was Ibn Saud able to extend his power and establish the kingdom of Saudi
      Arabia by 1932?

      “In what ways” should clearly consider the methods used to extend his power: military (use of the
      Ikhwan), gaining support from key religious/tribal groups (the Wahabis); the weakness of the
      Husseinis provided an opportunity for him; his diplomatic skills in reaching an accommodation
      with the British in 1927. His strong rule and determination to protect the holy places gained him
      the support of the Notables. By 1932 he was seen both internally and by other powers as the most
      effective ruler.

15.   Analyse the consequences of the Great Depression on any one country in Europe.

      Consequences will obviously include mass unemployment, with its attendant social ills. However,
      consequences should also be seen to be political – the growth of political extremism in many
      countries (both left and right-wing). Economic protectionism/growth of nationalism are also
      consequences. Detailed knowledge, not generalizations, is required. Obvious exemplars – Britain,
      France or Germany – but this also provides an opportunity for candidates to explore their own
      national history.


16.   Evaluate the success of Hitler’s domestic policies between 1933 and 1939.

      Hitler’s aims should be identified and analysis should consider how successful he was in achieving
      those aims. Policies to be examined could include: consolidation of power and the establishment of
      a strong dictatorship; economic recovery and Autarky; a racially pure society focus must be on
      internal measures and not on the Final Solution, the creation of the Volksgemeinschaft; levels of
      support/scale of opposition; scale of the police state; strength of the economy by 1939. It would be
      legitimate to argue that a strong, unified nation would enable Hitler to pursue his foreign
      policy goals.


17.   To what extent was Stalin’s foreign policy dominated by the desire for security up until 1941?

      Stalin’s foreign policy from the mid-1920s was driven by a desire to avoid conflict until the Soviet
      Union could recover economically and fully establish the one-party state. From the mid-1930s by
      the pursuit of collective security and arguably also by appeasement in the late 1930s until the
      Red Army had recovered from the effects of the purges – all with the underlying need to protect the
      Soviet Union from external threats.

      Evidence could include: directing the CCP to cooperate with the GMD in China to reduce the threat
      from Japan. The search for collective security – joining the League of Nations, signing
      Non-Aggression and Mutual Assistance pacts with European powers, even involvement in Spain
      could arguably be seen as restraining the more revolutionary elements on the Republican side to
      reassure the other powers. Trade relations were maintained with Nazi Germany despite ideological
      differences. The sale of the Manchurian railway to Japan and the Nazi–Soviet Pact 1939 could both
      be cited as instances of appeasement and avoidance of conflict until the Soviet Union was stronger.
      Stalin’s policies from 1927 to 1941 need to be addressed in order to gain higher level marks.

18.   Analyse the causes and consequences of the policies of glasnost and perestroika up until 2000.

      Answers will no doubt focus on the policies of glasnost and perestroika which aimed at preserving
      communism in Russia. However, higher marks should be reserved for answers that focus on
      economic issues and how they contributed to the need for change. Change was needed because the
      economy was stagnating as a consequence of inefficient planning and unbalanced spending
      (military). However, the policies were ineffective and actually led to a decline in economic growth
      and a budget deficit of 14 % by 1989 – continuing economic difficulties weakened his political
      position.

      Political reforms led to the growth of opposition groups but also to the 15 republics either declaring
      independence or autonomy. This had an economic impact (inflation was 22 % by 1991) but also
      weakened the state; Gorbachev began to lose credibility and the events of 1991 (such as the
      establishment of the CIS, the August coup and Gorbachev’s resignation) all contributed to the
      dismantling of the party state – behind all of the political instability was economic weakness.

      If only glasnost or perestroika are addressed, mark out of a maximum of [12 marks].


19.   Why was the Federal Republic of Germany able to experience an “economic miracle” in the post-
      Second World War years?

      Factors which could be considered include: a stable democratic political structure after 1949 under
      Adenauer ensured investment, funds from Marshall Aid began the process of economic recovery;
      West German membership of the European Coal and Steel Community; the Western European
      Union, and ultimately the EEC all assisted German trade and prosperity. An additional point which
      could be credited might be that as a consequence of wartime damage and subsequent economic
      recovery, West Germany’s production facilities were some of the most modern and technologically
      advanced in Europe, making German goods very competitive. Germany’s limited military
      establishment provided spare capital for investment in infrastructure.

      Answers should focus on economic issues and not on Germany in relation to the Cold War.


20.   Assess the political stability of one Western European state (excluding Germany and Spain) in
      the years between 1945 and 2000.

      Political stability could include an examination of the constitutional structure (so France could be
      considered unstable because of the constitutional changes which led to the establishment of the
      Fifth Republic). Political stability could also include industrial relations and the decline of
      extremist parties, which could be considered to indicate political consensus. Analysis could also
      consider the events of 1968, the strength of nuclear protest groups in the 1980s and the extent to
      which they posed a threat to existing political structures.

      There should be specific detail in relation to the chosen state.
                                                  – 11 –            M11/3/HISTX/HP3/ENG/TZ0/EM/M

21.   How important were religious, political and external factors in causing the outbreak of the
      Lebanese Civil War in 1975?

      It could be argued that it is impossible to separate religious and political factors because of the
      confessional nature of the state, with the president always a Maronite and the prime minister a
      Sunni and the allocation of cabinet posts being proportional on a confessional basis.

      External factors could be considered to be the influx of Palestinian refugees after Black September,
      which upset the delicate balance of Lebanese society. The emergence of the militias on
      confessional lines was also a key factor. Economic disparity also contributed to instability.
      Movement into the cities, especially Beirut, because of increasing tensions with Israel, led to an
      increasingly poor urban group who became attracted to the militias.

      All three factors should be considered in detail for more than [12 marks].


22.   Compare and contrast the causes and consequences of two conflicts between Israel and her
      neighbours in the years 1948–1980.

      Broad causes of all the conflicts was Arab–Israeli hostility – some might argue that in some of the
      conflicts Israel could be seen to be expansionist, whilst the Arab states were aggressive in their
      desire to destroy the Israeli state. Arab–Palestinian nationalism versus Israeli nationalism/Zionism.

      However, it is possible to look at each chosen conflict and find more detailed different causes for
      contrasts.

      E.g. causes of the 1948/49 conflict could be seen as driven by Arab nationalism (support for
      Palestinian refugees) but also as an opportunistic “Land Grab”. Consequences include: Israel
      gained territory and so did Jordan; refugee problem; no real solution to tensions.

      The Suez conflict occurred partly because of Arab nationalism, hostility between Egypt and Israel
      and also Cold War conflict or even a colonial conflict. Consequences include: Britain and France
      were no longer influential; Israel, militarily, was strong but the conflict also enhanced Nasser’s
      position as leader of Arab nationalism. Israel was seen to be more firmly in the Western camp in
      Cold War terms.

      The 1967 war was a pre-emptive strike by Israel – defensive – as a consequence Israel gained
      considerable territory (Gaza, Golan Heights, West Bank); the refusal to hand back the occupied
      territories could be seen as a cause of the 1973 war; Egypt was weakened by her defeat; 1973 Yom
      Kippur War – Egyptian/Syrian attack on Israel possibly because Sadat was trying to end the
      stalemate in the region; in relation to Syria it was an attempt to regain the Golan Heights.

      Consequences include: Israel pulled back from the Sinai peninsula and the Suez Canal reopened,
      and for the first time there was some contact and eventually better relations between Israel and
      Egypt (Camp David Agreements) – Israel refused to return other occupied territories so tensions
      remained.

      If only one war is addressed, mark out of a maximum of [7 marks].

23.   “The microchip was the single most revolutionary invention of the late twentieth century.”
      With specific reference to one country in the region, to what extent do you agree with this
      statement?

      Microchip technology has had a major impact on many areas of daily life including education;
      media; communications; leisure; etc. However good answers should be able to produce fairly
      specific detail on the scale and impact and really consider whether this has been revolutionary in the
      sense of its impact on society. There may also be mention of other technologies that have
      revolutionized life in the twentieth century, such as the Internet.


24.   Assess the impact of the welfare state on the lives of citizens of any one country in the region.

      A welfare state can be considered to be one that offers free/affordable education, health care,
      unemployment benefits and sickness benefits funded in part by the state and its citizens.
      Although the term “welfare state” can be regarded as a reference to Great Britain in the post-war
      years, it is legitimate to examine the scale and impact of similar provisions in other states.
