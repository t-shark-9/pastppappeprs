Read all the sources carefully and answer all the questions that follow.

Sources in this paper have been edited: word additions or explanations are shown in square brackets [ ];

These sources and questions relate to the enforcements of the provisions of the treaties, disarmament and
the London Naval Conference (1930).

SOURCE A                Statement by US president H. Hoover at a press conference about the Treaty
                        for the Limitation and Reduction of Naval Armament, 22 July 1930. Taken from
                       “The American Presidency Project” (online).

I shall have the gratification [pleasure] of signing the naval treaty this afternoon at 3 o’clock. With the
ratification by the other governments the treaty will translate an emotion deep in the hearts of millions of
men and women into a practical fact of government and international relations. It will renew again the faith
of the world in the moral forces of goodwill and patient negotiation as against the blind forces of suspicion
and competitive armament. It will mark a further long step toward lifting the burden of militarism from the
backs of mankind and to speed the march forward of world peace. It will lay the foundations upon which
further constructive reduction in world arms may be accomplished in the future. We should, by this act of
willingness to join with others in limiting armament, have dismissed from the mind of the world any notion
that the United States entertains ideas of aggression, imperial power, or exploitation of foreign nations.


SOURCE B                Extract from British and American Naval Power: Politics and Policy 1900–1936
                        by Phillips Payson O’Brien, 1998. The author is a lecturer in Modern History at
                        the University of Glasgow, UK.

With the first London Naval Conference the naval arms race control process reached its apex [peak].
Parity [equality] between America and Britain was agreed to for every type of warship while Japan had
accepted a smaller ratio for every category except submarines. The tragedy of the London Conference is
that while it marked a considerable success in the arms control process, it was not a lasting achievement.
Within six years naval arms control would be at an end. No ships were scrapped and naval construction
increased markedly after the conference. It must also be kept in mind that the London Naval Treaty was a
temporary agreement. The British were careful to tell the Americans that the London agreements extended
only until 1935, after which the Royal Navy “would have to have more cruisers”. Also, when the French
and the Italians chose not to sign the London agreements the British inserted a clause which would enable
them to withdraw.

SOURCE D                Extract from The Lights that Failed by Zara Steiner, 2005.

Neither the Italians nor the French signed the new limitation pact. France and Italy shared a common land
border and were colonial rivals in North Africa. Relations, particularly since Mussolini had taken power,
were uneasy, if not strained. For the Italians, lagging far behind the French, the navy became more than
a status symbol; it would herald [signal] the building of the new empire. The French argued that if parity
[equality] was conceded, the Italians could concentrate their fleet in the Mediterranean and achieve local
naval superiority as the French fleet was dispersed through the Mediterranean, the English Channel, and
North Atlantic.

The London Naval Treaty of 1930, with only three signatures to its key provisions, represented the high
point of inter-war naval limitation; it could not be extended and could not be maintained. There were
unique political reasons that had made the apparent compromise possible: American reluctance to translate
financial power into naval might; the British decision to cut back on naval construction; and the continuing
conservatism of the government in Tokyo.


SOURCE E                Extract from a speech by Winston Churchill to the British House of Commons,
                        2 June 1930.

This conference is the supreme failure of all conferences. We have seen what it does for our naval
defence. But what of other countries? France and Italy – their relations have been definitely worsened.
There was no particular assertion of naval competition but, by bringing this on to the table, you have
compelled both these nations to assert a demand for absolute parity [equality] which will undoubtedly lead
to large naval expenditure. There is tension created between America and Japan which did not exist three
months ago. And what of Anglo–American friendship? It is important, as I believe it is the foundation of
future safety. And after five years of this it will all have to be done over again. Once again the Great Powers
will meet around the table, having focused their attention upon these details, and compare their naval
power more. This time, in 1935, our navy will be definitely and finally weaker. I cannot think that it is a
wise course of policy for us to pursue.
