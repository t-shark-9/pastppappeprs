                                          Low-emission cars a future priority

           China’s campaign to bring cleaner, low-emission vehicles to its roads may have to wait as
            the government first tries to stimulate growth and prevent falling sales in the world’s largest
            car market. BYD Ltd, and other Chinese car manufacturers with ambitions to be among
            the first to market all-electric vehicles globally, are hoping for support from the government
            to stimulate demand.

           However, creating a low-emission vehicle market is unlikely to be a priority. While China
            has made much progress in setting standards regulating vehicle emissions, it has not
            gone as far as providing incentives for buyers of these expensive but low-emission cars.
            According to Henry Li, general manager of BYD Ltd, subsidies can help boost the
            quantity of cars demanded, because this is good technology, though expensive compared to
            conventional cars.

           Car sales growth in China slowed in 2008 as consumer confidence fell in a weaker economy.
            This has caused the government to take steps to increase demand. Beijing unveiled a number
            of policies in January to attract buyers back into showrooms, including halving the indirect tax
            on cars with smaller engines.

           The government has also eliminated some road fees. However, given the high cost of
            developing hybrid (partly-electric) and all-electric cars, car manufacturers require more than
            the reduction of road fees and tax breaks to stimulate demand, experts said. “There should
            be some incentives in place to convince consumers to switch to electric cars,” said the
            chief executive officer of EuAuto Technology Ltd, which recently began marketing a small,
            low-emission car, made in China.

                      Increasing poverty, cash transfers and cheaper rice in the Philippines

            The rate of growth of real GDP in the Philippine economy is expected to be 5.9 %
             in 2008. However, due to high population growth, increases in real GDP per capita are
             substantially lower. Moreover, the economy shows structural weaknesses, including poor
             tax collection, high unemployment and underemployment, and increasing poverty.

            A major challenge for the Philippine economy is the inflationary effect of increasing food
             and fuel prices, mainly because of its severe impacts on the poor. In May 2008, inflation
             rose to 9.6 %, the highest in nine years. Real incomes have declined significantly because
             of the increase in food prices, contributing to an increase in poverty. The price of rice,
             a food staple, has nearly doubled in just a few months. Economic growth has not prevented an
             increase in poverty, as the proportion of the population that cannot meet its daily food needs
             increased to 64 %.

            Poverty reduction in the Philippines has not been as successful as in some neighbouring
             countries, such as Indonesia, Thailand, Vietnam and China. Government spending on
             health care, education and infrastructure in the Philippines has been lagging behind that
             of the more successful countries. To achieve better outcomes in human development and
             poverty reduction, the Philippine government could place a greater emphasis on alternative
             policies such as spending on health care, education and infrastructure, family planning and
             the environment.

            The increase in poverty has prompted the government to introduce cash transfer payments
             to poor families of up to 1400 Philippine pesos (approximately US$33) per month, as well
             as rice subsidies, as emergency relief to help the poorest families meet their basic food
             consumption needs. The programme is expected to assist about 300 000 families, and will
             cost the government an estimated 5 billion Philippine pesos (approximately US$120 million)
             a year.

            The government plans to distribute “rice passes” that will enable the poorest families to buy
             government-subsidized rice. This programme in effect involves a maximum price that is set
             for the holders of “rice passes”, enabling the poor to buy rice at about half the market price.
             It is intended to ensure that the poor will have priority in the rationing of rice.

            However, there are fears that dishonest traders may buy rice at the low government-subsidized
             price and re-sell it at higher prices. “Rice passes” will therefore have barcodes to set off
             warnings if fraud is attempted.

                                                   The French economy

           The French government is preoccupied with how best to deal with the recession.
            The most urgent problem is how to confront high and rising unemployment,
            particularly the high rate of structural unemployment among young French adults.
            In addition, France experienced a record deficit on its balance of trade in 2008.
            While there was a surplus on its invisible balance, its current account deficit
            continued to deteriorate.

           As France is a member of the European Monetary Union, with a single currency (the euro),
            it cannot conduct an independent monetary policy, and must rely on interest rates set by the
            European Central Bank. It can, however, pursue expansionary fiscal policy, though it faces a
            high budget deficit.

           The OECD* urges France to pursue supply-side policies involving labour market reforms,
            such as avoiding increases in minimum wages, increasing incentives to work, and making it
            easier for firms to reduce their workforce. However, there is no guarantee that supply-side
            policies will always be successful and, in some cases, such policies are likely to meet with
            resistance from French trade unions.

                                 Thai finance minister happy with exchange rate

           The Thai finance minister said the current level of the Thai baht (Thailand’s currency)
            was appropriate and that the Bank of Thailand was broadly allowing the exchange rate
            to be set by the market. The central bank’s responsibility is only to prevent the value
            of the Thai baht from disrupting the economy. The minister also said that he was certain
            official interest rates would go even lower. The Bank of Thailand has cut its benchmark rate
            by 2.25 % since December 2008, taking it to a four and a half year low of 1.5 %.

           Asked if the Thai baht needed to weaken further, he said “it has been weakening, but relative
            to other currencies, I think its current value is fair. Exporters always want to see their
            currencies weaker, but I think the relative exchange rate for Thailand is appropriate. I also
            believe the central bank has left it to market forces, which I think is correct,” he added.
            The Thai baht hit its lowest value against the US dollar in over a year recently, and some dealers
            believed the central bank was pushing it down to help exporters.

           The minister was asked if he thought interest rates had reached the lowest possible level.
            “Given the struggling export sector, which contributes to a lack of aggregate demand and a
            danger of increased unemployment, I am quite certain there is more to come. I would expect
            to see interest rates fall further unless there is a very rapid change in economic conditions.”

           Thailand’s state planning agency reported last week that GDP fell a record 6.1 % in the
            fourth quarter of 2008. It expects zero GDP growth at best in 2009, and says the economy
            could shrink by as much as 1 %. According to this agency, unemployment is expected to
            rise to 2.5 %, up from 1.4 % in 2008, while the Commerce Ministry announced that exports had
            fallen 26.1 % compared with the previous year.

                                               Is Africa too dependent on aid?

           According to Zambian economist Dambisa Moyo, aid programmes have failed to improve the
            lives of most Africans and have created a damaging mutual dependence between donors and
            often corrupt governments. Moyo says that aid has done more harm than good in Africa.

           For example in Zambia, the government has given up its responsibility for health care,
            turning much of its administration over to foreign donors. African countries too often suffer
            from a cycle of corruption, disease, poverty and aid-dependence. Educated young people
            have few opportunities. Moyo opposes assistance which is not targeted for particular uses,
            but supports emergency financial relief from the International Monetary Fund (IMF).

           A former World Bank President defended aid programmes, praising the 12 to 15 African
            countries that are doing well, with several years of economic growth exceeding 6 %.

           The president of The Centre for Development and Population Activities (CEDPA), says that
            the evidence just doesn’t support Moyo’s view. “Malawi, while still among the poorest countries
            in the world, has seen real progress because of strong cooperation between donor agencies,
            the government of Malawi, international organizations and local community groups.”

           Over the past decade, investment in improving the lives of women and children in Malawi
            has paid off enormously. Child deaths have been reduced by nearly half (from 221 per thousand
            in 1990 to 120 per thousand in 2007); more children are going to school than ever before,
            and the number who complete primary school has doubled. Also, the number of women who
            are now using family planning services has more than tripled.

           These real results should not be ignored when we look at aid effectiveness. The CEDPA
            president argues that Moyo is really looking at only one particular kind of aid: the transfer
            of financial resources to governments. Good aid involves more than money; it responds to
            locally-driven needs, includes technical assistance and institution building to strengthen
            efficient and honest public administration.
