uncertain about the content/accuracy of a candidate’s work please contact your team leader.


 0:      Answers not meeting the requirements of descriptors should be awarded no marks.
 1–2:    Answers do not meet the demands of the question and show little or no evidence of
         appropriate structure. There is little more than unsupported generalization.
 3–4:    There is little understanding of the question. Historical knowledge is present but the
         detail is insufficient. Historical context or processes are barely understood and there are
         little more than poorly substantiated assertions.
 5–6:   Answers indicate some understanding of the question, but historical knowledge is
        limited in quality and quantity. Understanding of historical processes may be present
        but underdeveloped. The question is only partially addressed.
 7–8: The demands of the question are generally understood. Relevant, historical knowledge
        is present but is unevenly applied. Knowledge is narrative or descriptive in nature.
        There may be limited argument that requires further substantiation. Critical commentary
        may be present. An attempt to place events in historical context and show an
        understanding of historical processes. An attempt at a structured approach, either
        chronological or thematic has been made.
 9–11: Answers indicate that the question is understood, but not all implications considered.
        Knowledge is largely accurate. Critical commentary may be present. Events are
        generally placed in context, and historical processes, such as comparison and contrast,
        are understood. There is a clear attempt at a structured approach. Focus on AO1, AO2
        and AO4. Responses that simply summarize the views of historians cannot reach the
        top of this markband.
 12–14: Answers are clearly focused on the demands of the question. Relevant in-depth
        knowledge is applied as evidence, and analysis or critical commentary is used to
        indicate some in-depth understanding, but is not consistent throughout. Events are
        placed in context and there is sound understanding of historical processes and
        comparison and contrast. Evaluation of different approaches may be used to
        substantiate arguments presented. Synthesis is present, but not always consistently
        integrated. Focus on AO3 and AO4.
 15–17: Answers are clearly structured and focused, have full awareness of the demands of the
        question, and if appropriate may challenge it. Accurate and detailed historical
        knowledge is used convincingly to support critical commentary. Historical processes
        such as comparison and contrast, placing events in context and evaluating different
        interpretations are used appropriately and effectively. Answers are well-structured and
        balanced and synthesis is well-developed and supported with knowledge and critical
        commentary.
 18–20: Answers are clearly focused with a high degree of the awareness of the question and
        may challenge it successfully. Knowledge is extensive, accurately applied and there
        may be a high level of conceptual ability. Evaluation of different approaches may be
        present as may be understanding of historical processes as well as comparison and
        contrast where relevant. Evaluation is integrated into the answer. The answer is
        well-structured and well-focused. Synthesis is highly developed.

1.   With reference to one independence movement you have studied, analyse the significance of
     foreign aid in helping to achieve independence.

     There are multiple independence movements to select; answers could include those in: the
     United States; Cuba; Panama; Argentina; Chile; Brazil. However, accept any independence
     movement in the region providing that it is supported by specific evidence and that it addresses the
     “significance” to which foreign aid contributed to the obtaining of independence. The candidate’s
     focus should be on the kind and amount of foreign aid that was given and the reasons why it was
     significant.

     The Mexican Revolution is not an appropriate example of an independence movement.


2.   For what reasons, and with what results, was the Monroe Doctrine established in 1823?

     Candidates could show knowledge of the topic by defining the Monroe Doctrine.                A clear
     explanation of reasons and results is expected.

     The Monroe Doctrine was introduced by President Monroe and his Secretary of State John
     Quincy Adams in 1823. It aimed at preventing European re-colonization, further colonization, or
     intervention into the Americas. In turn, the United States promised to stay out of European affairs.

     Reasons
     Monroe was anxious to maintain the independence of the new Latin American states while
     expanding trading activities in the region. The United States disliked the continuation of
     European colonies such as Cuba. The United States was clear that she did not want involvement in
     world affairs. Stronger candidates might also include the stimulus of British Foreign Minister
     George Canning’s proposal for a joint statement on the subject, and US concern about Russian
     expansion in the Northwest.

     Results
     The doctrine had some success in that the influence of Spain, France and other powers was limited;
     however, it could be argued that this was more a consequence of British naval power than the
     military potential of the US. It was less successful in that Britain remained a major trading presence
     in the region. In the longer term, however, the US gained a key role acting as a mediator in disputes
     between European and Latin American countries. The Monroe Doctrine was eventually used as
     justification for US expansion in the region, and Theodore Roosevelt’s Corollary was used as a
     rationale for unilateral intervention.

     If only “reasons” or “results” are addressed, mark out of a maximum of [12 marks].

3.   Analyse the issues that led to changes in the United States’ political system between 1792
     and 1797.

     Candidates should be aware of the dates stated in the question. The changes in the United States
     political system during this period refer to the emergence of the first party system. This period is
     agreed by most historians as the beginning of the political parties. During Washington’s first
     presidency, political parties were unknown, but during his second term the emergence of the
     Hamilton–Jefferson rivalry led to the formation of parties. Answers might refer to the debates
     between Federalist and Anti-Federalist between 1787 and 1788 over the ratification of the
     Constitution, from where the seeds of the two political parties would grow, but arguments should be
     focused on the issues that led to the formation of the first party system in the United States: the
     Federalist and the Democratic-Republican parties.

     Some of the issues that could be mentioned are: the conflicting political philosophy of
     Washington’s Secretary of the Treasury, Hamilton, and Washington’s Secretary of State, Jefferson.
     The Federalists supported Hamilton and his financial programme. Opposing it were the
     Democratic-Republicans, founded by Jefferson and Madison around 1792, who supported Jefferson
     and opposed Hamilton’s programme. Hamilton’s political philosophy favoured a strong central
     government and a loose interpretation of the Constitution. Jefferson favoured the protection of
     states’ rights and a strict interpretation of the Constitution. Hamilton’s economic policies, such as
     the National Bank, tariffs, funding of the national debt and the assumption of the revolutionary
     debts of the states were supported by northern businesses and large landowners. Jefferson criticised
     these policies as unconstitutional; he favoured agriculture and the yeoman farmer over mercantile
     and financial interests. He was supported by skilled workers, small farmers and plantation owners
     chiefly in the southern states and the western frontier. Foreign affairs such as the French
     Revolution and the controversial Jay Treaty also found them on opposite sides. The Federalists
     were pro-British and the Democratic-Republicans were pro-French.

     By 1796 the two major political parties were already established and becoming well organized. The
     system was fully developed with the third presidential election; in this election, the parties’
     alignment was complete.

     Do not expect all of the above, but candidates should discuss the philosophical and policy views of
     Hamilton and Jefferson as well as the domestic and foreign issues that produced tensions and that
     established the tradition of political parties in the United States. This question might encourage the
     use of historiography, so reward accordingly.
                                                  –6–               M11/3/HISTX/HP3/ENG/TZ0/AM/M

4.   How significant were the 1837 rebellions for the political development of Canada?
     Candidates who select this question might have a good opportunity to use historiography since the
     rebellions are controversial issues. The causes of the rebellions may be considered relevant if they
     are linked to the political development of Canada through a “cause and effect” approach. As a
     consequence of the rebellions, Lord Durham was appointed and his subsequent report
     recommended unification of Upper and Lower Canada, which had long been the goal of the British
     in Canada. Durham’s report also recommended “Responsible Government”, modelled after the
     British Cabinet system.

     The United Province of Canada was established in 1841. It took seven years to fully establish
     “Responsible Government”. Durham also proposed measures to promote trade and his various
     initiatives led to him being regarded as one of the founders of the Commonwealth. The significance
     of the rebellions is controversial; the more traditional view is that they were a catalyst for change.
     Recent analysis suggests that the rebellions were irrelevant to Canada’s political development as the
     British were already considering reform.
                                                –7–              M11/3/HISTX/HP3/ENG/TZ0/AM/M

5.   Compare and contrast Abraham Lincoln and Jefferson Davis as wartime leaders during the
     United States Civil War.

     Candidates may focus their answers on any aspect of wartime leadership including political,
     economic, foreign policy and military decisions.

     For “compare”
     • Both faced significant foreign policy challenges – Davis to obtain European aid; Lincoln to
       prevent it.
     • Both faced significant challenges to maintain public support and morale.
     • Both had to deal with unrealistic expectations of the populace.
     • Both faced command problems – Lincoln initially had inefficient commanders; Davis lacked
       commanders who were willing to favour his defensive strategy.
     • Both had to address problems with maintaining unity – Davis in working within the states’ rights
       foundation of the Confederacy; Lincoln in dealing with the border states.
     • Both had to deal with man-power issues and both instituted drafts.
     • Both had to deal with dissent and responded by restricting personal freedoms.

     For “contrast”
     • Davis had previous military experience as an officer in the Mexican–American War and in
       managing military affairs as Secretary of War; Lincoln’s experience was limited to brief
       participation in the Black Hawk Wars.
     • Lincoln had significant executive powers in an established government; Davis had limited
       powers in a newly formed Confederation.
     • Davis was able to rely on experienced and capable military leaders from the onset of the war;
       Lincoln had to go through a “trial and error” process to identify an effective general.
     • Lincoln, by necessity, applied an offensive strategy; Davis, by choice, applied a largely
       defensive strategy.
     • Lincoln was able to secure the resources and finances necessary to wage the war (though he had
       to override some Congressional opposition); whereas Davis was in a constant struggle for both,
       thus limiting the South’s ability to pursue a successful campaign.
     • Lincoln strove for consensus with his cabinet; Davis gradually alienated his subordinates.

     Do not expect all of the above, but reward analytical arguments supported by relevant evidence.

     If only one leader is addressed, mark out of a maximum of [7 marks].

6.   “The Battle of Gettysburg was the turning point of the United States Civil War.” To what
     extent do you agree with this statement?

     Answers to this question might vary since the result of the Battle of Gettysburg has been the subject
     of historical controversy. Accept all arguments providing that they are supported with analysis and
     pertinent evidence. Candidates are not required to discuss the details of the battle itself, but do
     accept this as long as it is used to support their arguments.

     The Battle of Gettysburg (1–3 July 1863) was one of the bloodiest battles of the Civil War, with
     over 50 000 casualties. Lee’s army of Northern Virginia was defeated by Meade’s Army of the
     Potomac.

     Candidates who support the statement may include some of the following:
        • Lee’s casualties at Gettysburg were not sustainable by the South in a war of attrition.
        • Following Antietam and Gettysburg the South made no further attempts to invade the North.
        • The Union victory was a needed boost to Northern morale which had suffered from
           numerous defeats in the first two years of the war.
        • Lincoln’s political stature was enhanced as a result of the victory and led to his probable
           re-election.
        • The myth of Lee’s invincibility had been broken and this in itself was a huge morale booster
           for the Union.

     Those opposed to the statement could argue that Gettysburg was a serious defeat for the
     Confederacy but was not the turning point for the war. Support for this position could include:
        • The battle was not decisive because Meade did not follow up on his victory. For the rest of
           1863 there were few major engagements in Virginia.
        • Defeat at Gettysburg did not make Confederate defeat inevitable.
        • Victory at Vicksburg could be seen as more important because the South lost control of the
           Mississippi and support from the western Confederacy
        • If Lee had won he could not have held a single Northern city for any length of time and
           would ultimately have had to retreat.
        • It could be argued that the battle was not a turning point because no war aims were achieved
           and the war continued.

     Examiners should accept other arguments if properly supported.

7.   Assess the domestic and foreign policies of Wilfrid Laurier.

     Candidates should approach this question in an analytical manner and avoid a narrative of Laurier’s
     policies. The question asks for assessment and therefore an evaluation should be made.

     Domestic policies
     These could include: the Manitoba Schools Question; Saskatchewan and Alberta’s entry into
     the Confederation; policies toward immigrants; the construction of new transcontinental railways;
     the management of the relations between English and French-speaking Canadians.

     Foreign policies
     These could include: participation of Canada in the Boer War; trade relations with the United
     States; relations with Britain; the Naval Service Bill of 1910.

     If only domestic or foreign policies are addressed, mark out of a maximum of [12 marks].


8.   Examine the reasons for, and the impact of, the Harlem Renaissance.

     Candidates could demonstrate knowledge and understanding of the topic by: explaining what the
     movement was; discussing its roots; identifying some of its themes; assessing its effects.

     The Harlem Renaissance refers to the emergence of African American cultural and intellectual life,
     centred in Harlem in the interwar years. The Renaissance was more than a literary or artistic
     movement – it had sociological importance through a new racial consciousness and racial
     integration.

     “Reasons for” could include: the impact of the First World War; migration of African Americans
     to cities such as New York City, Chicago, and Washington, DC; the desire to explore their identities
     as black Americans and a celebration of black culture; an awareness of the need to address a sense
     of alienation and marginality. Politically, it was a result of increased political awareness as a
     consequence of the activities of the NAACP and the continued exclusion of African Americans
     from political life.

     “Impact of” could include: it influenced African American writers, artists and intellectuals; led to
     the growth of the Jazz Age due to the popularity of African American artists such as Duke Ellington
     and Louis Armstrong; helped to lay the foundation for the post-Second World War phase of the
     Civil Rights Movement.

     The work of individuals such as Marcus Garvey and WEB Dubois may be discussed both within the
     context of “reasons for” and “impact of” the Renaissnace.

     If only “reasons” or “impact” are addressed, mark out of a maximum of [12 marks].
                                                 – 10 –            M11/3/HISTX/HP3/ENG/TZ0/AM/M

9.    Why did the United States adopt a policy of neutrality from 1914 to 1917?

      Candidates answering this question have several arguments to explain the United States’
      motivations for neutrality, and should not focus on the reasons why it got involved in the First
      World War. Candidates may also effectively challenge the premise of US “neutrality”.

      There are several reasons why the US adopted this policy. George Washington’s position on the
      undesirability of “permanent alliances” was still influencing US policy. In 1914 the general
      consensus in America was that the war in Europe was a purely European affair, while US interests
      were predominantly focused on the Western hemisphere.

      Another reason was the prevalence and power of the peace movements during that time, for
      example: the Women’s Peace Party; the American Union Against Militarism set up by progressive
      pacifists; peace initiatives funded by Carnegie and Ford; the Socialist Party’s criticisms, led by
      Eugene V Debs.

      Their arguments focused on the corruption of war, the loss of young lives, interruption to domestic
      reforms and the inadequacy of war to solve problems. In the 1916 presidential election Wilson used
      the slogan, “He kept us out of the war”.

      Reasons for US entry into the war in 1917 can be discussed in regards to neutrality, but should not
      be the focus of the answer.


10.   Analyse the impact of the First World War on the society of one country of the region.

      Answers will vary according to the selected country. Probable choices would be Canada or the
      United States but accept any other relevant choice.

      Impact on society, during and after the war, could include: labour issues; changes to women’s status
      (work, family, suffrage); effects on minorities (African Americans, Native Americans, and French
      Canadians); the emergence of radicalism (Communism or right-wing movements) and the measures
      taken to control them; internal migration and immigration; wartime expansion of economic
      regulation.

      Answers should be supported with specific, detailed evidence.

11.   Compare and contrast the aims of Francisco Madero and Venustiano Carranza during the
      Mexican Revolution.

      Candidates should focus on and analyse the aims of both leaders and avoid a narrative of the
      Mexican Revolution. The question does not demand a discussion about the achievement of their
      aims, but if this is the approach accept it providing that it is not the core of the answer.

      For “compare”
      Both were committed to destroy Diaz’s regime; both made promises of agrarian reform but neither
      saw distribution of land as the key issue since they believed that only large landholders would
      permit Mexican agriculture to modernize; both spoke about social issues and workers’ rights, and
      both promised democracy but interpreted it as a democracy of the elite; both believed in capitalism;
      both addressed more political issues than social concerns; both were political moderates and wanted
      reform rather than a real revolution.

      For “contrast”
      Although both were nationalists, Carranza was more outspoken about Mexico’s rights and
      sovereignty. Madero was an idealist – his democracy was an instrument of social control by the
      elite that would promote the acceptance of capitalism through the granting of limited political and
      social reforms to the masses, with a stress on education. His political aims were for free and honest
      elections, municipal autonomy, improvement of the “material, intellectual, and moral condition” of
      workers, the need to curb drinking and gambling, and he saw free public education as crucial for
      social ills. He called for electoral reforms and his key idea was “effective suffrage and no
      re-election”. Carranza was a pragmatist – his goal was political and economic stabilization.
      He supported constitutional democracy, headed by a strong leader, and while he accepted that
      the people had to be considered, he did not see them as able to participate in the government.
      He initiated the process that led to the Constitution of 1917; however he refused to implement the
      more radical provisions of the document.

      If only one leader is addressed, mark out of a maximum of [7 marks].

12.   Assess the successes and failures of the Plutarco Elías Calles presidency.

      Candidates may have different perceptions as to success and failure. Accept different views if they
      are supported by evidence and persuasive arguments and examples.

      Calles’ goal was to rebuild the economy. He established the Bank of Mexico and several financial
      institutions. He developed a highway system and public education system, established health
      programmes and made labour more powerful. His agrarian reform was limited, but still greater than
      any of his predecessors. He institutionalized the revolution and established the principle of no
      re-election as the cornerstone of the political system. He founded the National Revolutionary Party
      (PNR) and although he did not present himself as a candidate, he established the “Maximato” –
      a system by which he remained the strongman of Mexico, ruling through token presidents.
      Candidates may see the “Maximato” as a failure and the PNR as a success or as a failure. There
      are, however, two clear failures in his attempts to implement the Constitution of 1917. Calles’
      presidency was overshadowed by the massive insurrection of the Catholic peasantry known as the
      War of the Cristeros. The rebellion was the result of his effort to enforce the separation of Church
      and State in education. He conceded to the Church. The second was to implement Article 27
      (subsoil and oil leases) which brought him up against the United States. After some mediation,
      war was averted and the law was rewritten allowing some concessions to the US, but reaffirming
      national ownership of subsoil.

      If only successes or failures are addressed, mark out of a maximum of [12 marks].


13.   “Franklin D Roosevelt’s greatest achievement was to make a more financially secure
      United States.” To what extent do you agree with this statement?

      Answers to this question will vary according to the point of view of the candidate. Accept different
      views if they are supported by evidence and analytical arguments and examples.

      It could be argued that the banking system became more stable with the establishment of the
      Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) and the Securities and Exchange Commission
      (SEC), which reassured depositors and investors. Other successful measures were the Federal
      Housing Administration, the National Labour Relations Board, the Fair Labour Standards Act and
      the Social Security Act, all of which contributed to social and economic stability.

      Those questioning the statement could argue that the legislation of the Hundred Days boosted
      the morale of US citizens in the short term but that only some of these initiatives survived in the
      longer term. While some may argue the success of the Public Works Administration (PWA) and
      Works Progress Administration (WPA) in reducing unemployment, full employment was not
      achieved until the coming of the Second World War. In that vein, some may point out that the
      New Deal did not end the Depression.

      There may be differing positions taken on what was Roosevelt’s greatest achievement, but as this
      is a “to what extent” question the importance of US financial security must be addressed.

14.   Analyse the response to the Great Depression of one Latin American country.

      Answers will vary according to the selected country. Some likely choices might be Getulio Vargas
      in Brazil or the Concordancia government in Argentina, but accept any country selected by the
      candidates providing that the “response” refers to the Great Depression 1929–1939. Perón’s regime
      in Argentina is not a valid selection since he came to power in 1946.

      Candidates should mention economic responses such as: Import Substitution Industrialization along
      with its forms and effectiveness; political changes such as the government’s intervention in the
      economy and/or the emergence of dictatorships; social aspects such as measures and/or institutions
      affecting different groups in society. International relations – such as diplomacy, trade, economic
      assistance, and treaties – could also be considered.


15.   Compare and contrast the treatment of Japanese Americans and Japanese Canadians during
      the Second World War.

      A compare and contrast on this topic could be done according to: the conditions and location of
      the internment camps (families v. male members); workload or types of work; civil and
      economic status; public opposition/approval of the measures.

      Comparisons and contrasts should be supported by specific detailed evidence. If only one country
      is discussed, mark out of a maximum of [7 marks].


16.   Analyse the economic effects of the Second World War in either Canada or one Latin
      American country.

      The term “effects” means the economic consequences. Candidates may discuss economic issues
      during and after the war; stronger answers will also link these issues.

      Answers will vary according to the selected country. Within Latin America some possible
      countries could be Brazil, Argentina or Mexico; but accept any chosen example which is supported
      with relevant analysis and evidence.

      Economic effects could be: inflation; end of the Depression; changes in trade patterns;
      industrialization; role of the government in the economy; economic integration of markets;
      promotion of technology and measures (institutions) to prevent another Depression.

17.   Examine the domestic policies of one Canadian or Latin American leader between 1945 and 1979.

      Answers will vary according to the selected leader but candidates should take into account the dates
      in the question. If the selected leader, for example in Latin America, continued in power after the
      date (Castro) or, as in Canada (Trudeau), the dates should indicate the period under discussion.
      Content identified which occurred after the period specified in the question is not to be considered
      relevant.

      Domestic policies make reference to social, political and economic aspects/programmes related to
      the chosen leader. They might include: policies relating to agrarian and industrial developments;
      trade deals; communications infrastructure; employment; labour issues. Social policies might
      include: healthcare; education; status of women; relations with minority groups. Political aspects
      such as nature of the rule, repression, and use of propaganda could also be discussed here.


18.   To what extent was Truman successful in his domestic policies as president of the United
      States (1945–1953)?

      In order to address this question, candidates need to consider the context: the end of the war and
      its economic and social impact, the beginnings of the Cold War and its impact on domestic politics
      in the United States; the Democratic/Republican balance in Congress and Truman’s level
      of popularity.

      Truman introduced the Fair Deal which addressed social and economic conditions such as
      employment and reversion to a peacetime economy; the policies which comprised the Fair Deal
      provide a basis to assess the extent of Truman’s success.

      Success
      A successful aspect of the Fair Deal was in relation to civil rights for African Americans. Truman
      used executive orders to ensure government contracts were non-discriminatory, which had an
      impact on a fifth of the economy. The integration of the Armed Forces began and was largely
      complete by the time of the Korean War. The passage of the GI Bill of Rights, an increase in the
      minimum wage, and the extension of social security were examples of economic achievements.

      Failure
      Truman was unable to satisfy his critics, who accused him of supporting corruption among White
      House staff, failure to meet expectations concerning the post-war economy, and failing to remove
      communists from government departments thus being soft on communism. Truman was often
      criticised for the frequency of strikes, high rate of inflation, and the initially high rates of post-war
      unemployment. The passage of the Taft-Hartley act, despite Truman’s veto, illustrated the
      president’s weakness.

      Truman’s economic programmes were substantially modified by Congress and are thus debatable as
      to their success or failure. Candidates might discuss other issues in order to make their assessment;
      therefore, credit any other relevant information.

19.   In what ways did the foreign policy of the United States change during the Eisenhower
      administration?

      Eisenhower’s foreign policy goals were shaped by their Cold War context. His policy was based
      like that of Truman, on NSC 68 and the need to contain communism. Eisenhower’s policies were
      more proactive than Truman’s – he believed in the Domino Theory but also accepted the notion of
      “rollback” in addition to containment. John Foster Dulles was his main spokesman and he outlined
      some of the strategies. Eisenhower’s policies were called the “New Look” and proposed the use of
      nuclear weapons and technology rather than conventional forces. New technology and
      “brinkmanship” and the threat of “massive retaliation” were also key components of his policy.

      Eisenhower’s New Look also involved covert CIA operations (coups in Iran and Guatemala,
      planning the Bay of Pigs invasion) and strengthening alliances (SEATO). Despite the Cold War
      rhetoric and various crises, the relationship between the USA and the USSR improved to some
      extent. The Eisenhower Doctrine gained the US some support in the Middle East. Eisenhower’s
      foreign policy had the appearance of change but was essentially a continuation of the policy of
      containment, as indicated by US involvement in Vietnam and reactions to the Hungarian uprising.

20.   “Kennedy’s Alliance for Progress was a turning point in the history of relations between
      North America and Latin America.” To what extent do you agree with this statement?

      Candidates selecting this question should be aware that the Alliance for Progress was Kennedy’s
      policy towards Latin America. They might discuss briefly the previous relations between the
      United States and Latin America but the focus should be on Kennedy’s initiative. Kennedy’s
      interest in Latin America was long-standing, but the rise of Castro in Cuba had made Latin America
      a key issue in the 1960 presidential campaign, since preventing other Latin American countries
      from “going Communist” proved to be a politically profitable campaign issue. He believed that it
      was necessary to distinguish between the interests of American private investors, protected by
      preceding administrations, and the national interest of the United States. He strongly believed that
      the national interest would be more effectively protected by the extension of popular government
      and the promotion of democracy and reform in Latin America.

      Kennedy’s Latin American policy might be considered a turning point, because the policy was
      based on the idea of a partnership between those governments and political parties of Latin America
      that were willing to mobilize national resources and enlist the energies of their people. The United
      States would provide economic assistance and political support. Convinced that the United States,
      could not realistically be expected to solve the problems of Latin America by itself, Kennedy
      considered that only a cooperative effort would have a chance of successfully carrying through a
      peaceful revolution, thus avoiding dislocations and turmoil in the social and economic fabric of the
      Latin American countries, which would damage the interests of the United States. The ultimate
      goal of the Alliance was the preservation of hemispheric stability and order. Kennedy felt that US
      interests in the region were being endangered by the American failure to understand the rapidly
      changing hopes and ambitions of the people in Latin America.

      Answers will vary according to different points of view since the Alliance has had harsh criticism
      due to limitations in its application and ultimate failure in some of its idealistic goals. Accept these
      views if they are supported by analysis and evidence.

21.   Assess the aims and impact of the Black Panthers between 1966 and the 1970s.

      Candidates could show understanding of the topic by defining what it was, and from there discuss
      its aims and impact. Answers should be specifically focused on the Black Panther movement and
      should not approach this question as a narrative or description of the civil rights’ movements.

      Aims
      The Black Panthers aimed to become involved in the worldwide non-white working class struggle.
      They had four main aims: equality in education, employment, housing and civil rights. In addition,
      they wanted compensation to black Americans for slavery, exemption from military service and
      trial by all black juries. Essentially they advocated radical political, social and economic change in
      the lives of Black Americans. Other areas of concern were police brutality and ghetto conditions.

      Impact
      The Black Panthers were always limited in numbers (5000 approx). Their Chapters tended
      to be based in urban ghettos where they gained respect and support via self-help initiatives.
      These included clinics to advise on health, welfare and legal rights and other activities such as the
      Free Breakfast Program. In the 1960s, while essentially based on the notion of Black Nationalism,
      they became more focused on socialism and were not so racially exclusive. This was not always
      acceptable within the movement and led to dissent. Their reputation for violence and confrontation
      had always led to conflict with the authorities. The use of the Second Amendment (right to carry
      arms) led to armed groups of Black Panthers attempting to expose police brutality. Calls for
      revolutionary war at the peak of the anti-Vietnam war protests led to an FBI clampdown.
      A combination of the FBI actions, anxieties about the militancy of the movement and a divided
      leadership all began to lead to the decline of the movement.

      Do not expect all of the above, but reward analysis and well-supported evidence.

22.   Analyse the reasons for Native American activism in one country of the region after the 1960s.

      Answers will vary according to the country selected. Candidates could discuss the influence of the
      civil rights movements, social, economic, and political conditions, and the counterculture
      movements of the 1960s.

      Many of the above factors stimulated Native American activism in different countries of the region.

      For specific countries candidates might reference the influence of liberation theology or the impact
      of the Vietnam War.

23.   Assess the successes and failures of Bill Clinton’s presidency.

      Answers to this question will vary since Clinton’s presidency has its supporters and detractors.
      Candidates should make their assessment in an analytical, balanced way and consider both domestic
      and foreign aspects. Analysis also needs to identify what his aims were.

      Domestic
      • Clinton began his presidency promising to focus on the economic needs of the nation:
        unemployment; the runaway deficit; the healthcare crisis; welfare reform.
      • He pushed an economic package through Congress which was a combination of tax increases
        and spending cuts – he lowered the deficit by US$ 87 billion and by 1999 had a budget surplus
        of US$ 124 billion.
      • Other major initiatives included: the Family and Medical Leave Act, the Brady Handgun
        Violence Prevention Act, minimum wage legislation and taxpayer relief helping poorer
        Americans.
      • Other policies were less successful; “don’t ask don’t tell” in the military was controversial.
        He was never able to bring about health care reform.

      Foreign
      Clinton was keen to maintain US influence and status in a post Cold War world. The success of his
      initiatives in pursuit of this goal varied.

      Failures:
      • Intervention in Somalia (Black Hawk Down).
      • Haiti where Clinton had to turn to ex-president Carter to negotiate the removal of Raoul Cedras.
      • US non-intervention in Rwanda to prevent genocide.
      • In the Middle East he was not able to bring about any real change despite facilitating
         negotiations.
      • Sanctions against Iraq were considered to be largely ineffectual and contributing to the deaths of
         100 000 people.

      Successes:
      • His “doctrine of enlargement” led to market democracies cooperating together on a range of
        issues including trade, peacekeeping and intervention in crisis situations.
      • He persuaded Russia to withdraw from Estonia and Latvia in 1994.
      • The US also helped broker peace negotiations in Northern Ireland.
      • He secured trade agreements such as GATT, NAFTA and supported the Mexican economy
        in 1995.
      • He sent troops to the former Yugoslavia to stop the “ethnic cleansing” by the Serbs.

      Do not expect all of the above but reward relevant examples supported by evidence.

      The focus of answers should be about the Clinton administration policies and not scandals.

      If only successes or failures are addressed, mark out of a maximum of [12 marks].

24.   Examine the positive and negative aspects of the impact of the Internet on society in one
      country of the region.

      Candidates selecting this question should support their answers with specific examples.

      Some of the issues that can be discussed are:
      On the positive side it has made possible new forms of social interaction, activities and organizing
      (email, chats and blogs); it is a major source of leisure activities (download of music, movies and
      games); a source of information (news, sports, travel, weather); as an instrument of education
      (research, investigations); it makes possible widespread political activism; internet based
      commerce.

      On the negative side it can be the source of misinformation, illegal activities, alienation from
      institutions such as the family, education and places of work; disruption of face-to-face interaction
      and the rise of a new form of individualism; in the case of education it might increase the possibility
      of plagiarism while decreasing the student’s capacities for critical thought and analysis by providing
      “ready” answers to questions or solutions to problems. There is also a danger to children who may
      be preyed upon by unscrupulous individuals.

      All examples in the markscheme precede 2001; examples identified which clearly occurred after
      2000 are outside the timeframe of the syllabus and should not be considered as relevant to the
      question and therefore not a basis for the award of marks.

      If only positive or negative aspects are addressed, mark out of a maximum of [12 marks].
