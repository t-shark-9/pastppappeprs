                       An explanation that it is the willingness and ability to purchase a
                       quantity of a good or service.

                  A vague definition with a diagram would be eligible for [2 marks].

                       An explanation that an amount of money is given by governments to
                       firms to:
                       • increase supply, or
                       • lower costs, or
                       • lower the price, or
                       • increase quantity, or
                       • improve competitiveness in international trade.

(b)   Using an appropriate diagram, explain why, in a free market, low-emission
      vehicles may be under-provided.                                           [4 marks]

       1    Identification of appropriate theory                                            1–2
            For drawing a diagram showing low-emission vehicles as having external
            benefits of consumption (MSB to the right of MPB) or an explanation
            that in a free market low-emission vehicles will be under-provided
            (or under-consumed), giving rise to market failure as the market does not
            produce where MSC is equal to MSB (or does not produce at the socially
            efficient/optimal level of output).

       2    Correct application of appropriate theory                                       3–4
            For drawing a diagram showing low-emission vehicles as having external
            benefits of consumption (MSB to the right of MPB) and an explanation
            that in a free market low-emission vehicles will be under-provided
            (or under-consumed), giving rise to market failure as the market does not
            produce where MSC is equal to MSB (or does not produce at the socially
            efficient/optimal level of output).

      N.B. An alternative approach would be to draw a diagram showing
      low-emission vehicles as having benefits to society such that marginal social
      costs that are lower than marginal private costs (MSC to the right of MPC)
      with an explanation that in a free market, low-emission vehicles will be
      underprovided giving rise to a market failure as the market does not produce
      where MSC is equal to MSB (or does not produce at the socially
      efficient/optimum level of output).

      Another alternative approach would be to use demand and supply analysis to
      explain and draw a situation where the Dprivate is less than Dsocial (or Ssocial is
      greater than Sprivate )and the market equilibrium where D = S occurs is at a
      lower level than the socially efficient/optimum level.

      Candidates might use demand and supply analysis to show and explain that
      low-emission vehicles are not provided in large quantities because of a low
      demand or low supply (due to high costs). If well explained, may be rewarded
      up to [2 marks]. If this approach is used, and there is some reference to
      external effects then full marks may be awarded.

      Candidates who incorrectly label diagrams can be rewarded with a maximum
      of [3 marks].

      The vertical axis may be price, P, marginal costs and benefits or costs and
      benefits. The horizontal axis may be quantity, Q or output.

(c)   Using an appropriate diagram, explain how “halving the indirect tax on
      cars with smaller engines” (paragraph ) is likely to affect the car market
      in China.                                                                               [4 marks]

            For drawing a market diagram to show that halving the indirect tax will
            shift the supply curve to the right, causing price to fall and quantity to
            increase or an explanation that halving the indirect tax will shift the
            supply curve to the right (or increase supply) due to a fall in costs,
            causing a fall in price and an increase in quantity.

       2    Correct application of appropriate theory                                             3–4
            For drawing a market diagram to show that halving the indirect tax will
            shift the supply curve to the right, causing price to fall and quantity to
            increase and an explanation that halving the indirect tax will shift the
            supply curve to the right (or increase supply) due to a fall in costs,
            causing a fall in price and an increase in quantity.

      N.B. An alternative approach would be to draw a diagram showing two supply
      curves (a market supply curve and a “supply + tax” curve) with a third supply
      curve which is shifted to the right of “supply + tax” due to the halving of the
      tax (does not have to be to scale) with an explanation that halving the tax will
      shift the “supply + tax” curve to the right (or increase supply), causing a fall in
      price and an increase in quantity. This approach does not need to include a
      reference to the fall in costs for full marks, as it is a suitably detailed approach.

      Candidates who incorrectly label diagrams can be rewarded with a maximum
      of [3 marks].

      Price and quantity, or “P” and “Q” on the axis are sufficient.

(d)   Using information from the text/data and your knowledge of economics,
      evaluate three of the policies the Chinese government has introduced or
      might introduce to bring cleaner, low-emission vehicles to its roads
      (paragraph ).                                                                         [8 marks]

      Responses may include:
      • consideration of three of the following policies mentioned in the text:
        – setting emission regulations (paragraph ) (Has introduced)
        – reduction of road fees (paragraph ) (Has introduced)
        – reduction of the indirect tax on cars with small engines (paragraph )
           (Has introduced)
        – subsidy to producers (paragraph ) (Might introduce)
        – provide incentives to convince consumers to switch to electric cars
           (paragraph ) (Might introduce)
      • fiscal consequences for the government in terms of the possible effects on
        expenditure and revenues
      • welfare arguments in terms of environmental and societal benefits
      • emission regulations could reduce demand for high-emission cars and
        increase demand for low-emission cars
      • as a major producer, subsidised low-emission vehicles may give the Chinese
        car industry an advantage in world trade so exports may increase
      • road fees will not necessarily encourage people to switch to low-emission
        cars if the fees are the same for both types of cars, as the relative price of the
        two types of cars will not change
      • policies are not likely to be effective unless they actually reduce the costs of
        production of firms and/or the price of low-emission cars to consumers.

      N.B. Candidates may introduce and evaluate policies that have not been
      mentioned in the text.

      Effective evaluation may be to:
      • consider short-term versus long-term consequences
      • examine the impact on different stakeholders
      • discuss advantages and disadvantages
      • prioritize the arguments.

      Examiners should be aware that candidates may take a different approach
      which if appropriate, should be rewarded.

      If there is no direct reference to the text/data, then candidates may not be
      rewarded beyond level 2.

                         An explanation that it exists when:
                         • workers are employed part-time even though they are available for
                           full-time employment, or
                         • workers are employed, but work less than they would have wanted
                           to, or

           distribution and two curves below, the curve nearer the line of perfect
           equality showing an improvement following transfer payments or an
           explanation that transfer payments improve income distribution by
           transferring income to poor families.

      Candidates who incorrectly label diagrams can be rewarded with a maximum

      The vertical axis may be “cumulative percentage of income”, “percentage of
      income” or “% income”. The horizontal axis may be “cumulative percentage
      of population”, “percentage of population” or “% income. There should be an
      arrow (or some form of labelling) to indicate the direction of change of the two
      Lorenz curves. If candidates do not write percentage (or %) or confuse the
      axis, they may not be rewarded full marks. It is not required that the
      candidates show the diagram as a “box” for full marks.

            price of rice that lies below the equilibrium price or an explanation that
            traders with a rice pass can buy at the maximum price and re-sell at
            higher prices because there are some unsatisfied consumers who are
            willing to pay a price higher than the maximum.

            higher prices because there are some unsatisfied consumers who are
            willing to pay a price higher than the maximum.

      N.B. An alternative diagram may be to show a government subsidy (increase in
      supply and lower price), so that traders with rice passes are able to buy at the
      “government subsidised price”. The explanation would refer to the ability of
      these traders to then sell at higher prices to people who were not eligible for the
      rice passes.

(d)   Using information from the text/data and your knowledge of economics,
      evaluate alternative policies that the Philippine government could pursue
      in an effort to reduce poverty.                                                    [8 marks]

      Responses may include:
      • the government might provide a range of merit goods such as health care
        and education that will help reduce poverty and achieve economic and
        human development (paragraph )
      • investments in infrastructure (such as transportation, sanitation, clean water
        supplies, etc.) make positive contributions to economic and human

        development and poverty reduction (paragraphs  and ) therefore it is
        necessary to have other policies in place.

      • consider short-term versus long-term consequences
      • examine the impact on different stakeholders
      • discuss advantages and disadvantages

      which if appropriate, should be rewarded.

      rewarded beyond level 2.

                         goods and services. Candidates may go further and explain that it also
                         includes net income flows, but this is not necessary for full marks.

           For drawing a diagram showing the inverse relationship between the rate
           of inflation and unemployment rate or for explaining that the data on
           inflation and unemployment illustrate this short-run inverse relationship:
           when the rate of inflation was increasing from 2005 to the end of 2007,
           the unemployment rate was falling; or when the rate of inflation began to
           fall from the beginning of 2008, the unemployment rate started to rise.

      The horizontal axis should be unemployment rate or % unemployment and the

      price level.

(c)   Explain why a record deficit on the balance of trade (paragraph )
      may be of special concern to a country like France, which is a member
      of the European Monetary Union, having adopted a single currency
      (the euro) (paragraph ).                                                          [4 marks]

           (the euro) can no longer rely on the use of exchange rate policy to correct
           a trade imbalance (or current account balance), or for explaining that if
           France had its own national currency, a depreciation would help correct
           the large trade deficit by making imports more expensive domestically
           and exports less expensive to foreigners.

       2   Correct application of appropriate theory                                         3–4

           the large trade deficit by making imports more expensive domestically
           and exports less expensive to foreigners.

      N.B. An alternative approach would be to explain that as a member of a
      monetary union, France does not have the ability to change interest rates in
      order to correct its trade balance. This means that it cannot correct the large
      trade deficit by raising interest rates as an expenditure reducing policy to
      reduce spending on imports.

(d)   Using information from the text/data and your knowledge of economics,
      evaluate some supply-side policies that the French government could
      pursue to lower its current account deficit.                                        [8 marks]

      Responses may include:
      • an explanation of current account deficit (paragraph )
      • an explanation that France could pursue policies that will increase its
        exports and decrease its imports, in order to lower the deficit, which
        according to the data has been growing and is expected to continue to
        increase into 2010
      • an explanation of relevant supply-side policies with examples
        (paragraph )
      • use of an AD/AS diagram to show the impact of supply-side policies on
        LRAS
      • an explanation of how market-oriented supply-side policies (labour market
        reforms suggested by the OECD) can help increase export competitiveness
        and increase exports (paragraph )
      • an explanation of how supply-side policies can help increase the
        competitiveness of domestic industries, this reducing demand for imports
      • an evaluation of possible negative effects of these policies, such as
        lower worker protection, long time lags, resistance from trade unions
        (paragraph )
      • an     explanation     of     how      interventionist  supply-side  policies
        (government-financed worker training and education, support for
        small businesses in the export sector, support for infrastructure
        development) can also help increase the competitiveness of domestic
        industries, thereby increasing exports and reducing imports
      • an evaluation of disadvantages, such as the need for tax revenues to
        finance these, which could be difficult for France in view of its already
        large budget deficit
      • a reference to the political difficulties of implementing reforms
      • a discussion of the view that supply-side policies may be needed to confront
        high and rising unemployment, but that the current account deficit may not
        necessarily be the priority.

      N.B. To reach level 3, candidates must direct their responses specifically to the
      issue of the current account deficit, rather than write in general terms about
      supply-side policies.

      Effective evaluation may be to:
      • consider short-term versus long-term consequences
      • examine the impact on different stakeholders
      • discuss advantages and disadvantages
      • prioritize the arguments.

           by Thailand’s central bank to sell Thai baht (or to buy foreign reserves)

      N.B. The following approaches, if properly drawn and explained, may be
      rewarded with full marks:
      • the Thai central bank could lower interest rates causing either an increase in
         the supply of the currency as savers move their savings elsewhere, or a
         decrease in demand as saving in Thai banks provides a lower return to
         savers, and thus reducing the demand for the Thai baht
      • the central bank could “talk down” the value of the Thai baht, causing either
         an increase in supply or decrease in demand as speculators fear that it will
         lose its value.

      Candidates who incorrectly label diagrams can be rewarded with a maximum

       2   Correct application of appropriate theory                                              3–4
           For drawing an AD/AS diagram to show an increase in AD, causing an
           increase in real GDP (real output, national income) and an explanation
           that a fall in interest rates may result in a fall in the value of the Thai baht
           and therefore an increase in net exports. The effect on the price level
           depends on the AS that is drawn. If a short run aggregate supply curve is
           drawn, candidates should say that there is an increase in the price level.
           If a Keynesian AS curve is drawn with an increase in AD remaining in
           the horizontal region then the price level will not change.

      N.B. An alternative approach may be to consider the effects of a decrease in
      interest rates on AS. A fall in interest rates may result in a decrease in the costs
      of production to firms, and thus an increase in SRAS. A fall in interest rates
      leading to an increase in investment can be seen to increase the quantity of
      capital in the economy, and thus shift out the LRAS. If appropriately
      explained and illustrated, then full marks may be rewarded.

      Candidates who incorrectly label diagrams can be rewarded with a maximum
      of [3 marks].

      The vertical axis may be price level, average price level or inflation.
      The horizontal axis may be output, real output, national output, real national
      output, national income (Y) or GDP.

(d)   Using information from the text/data and your knowledge of economics,
      evaluate the view that Thailand’s central bank should intervene
      in the foreign exchange market in order to weaken the Thai baht.                       [8 marks]

      Responses may include:
      • the economy has stagnated and so exporters need help. Exports have fallen
        26.1 % (paragraph )
      • a discussion of the benefits of a lower value of the currency including, the
        support for the “the struggling export sector” (paragraph )
      • although a lower value of a currency can be inflationary, this does not seem
        to be a problem in Thailand given that the economy is shrinking
        (paragraph )
      • a lower value of the currency will be damaging to consumers of imported
        goods, and will raise costs of imported factors of production
      • the J-curve and the Marshall-Lerner condition suggests that currency
        depreciation takes time to contribute to an improvement in export revenues
      • even if the central bank does intervene, the lower value of the currency may
        not have the desired effect of stimulating exports due to possible inelastic
        demand
      • it may be argued that currencies should be left to market forces
      • active intervention by the central bank might invite retaliation and
        competitive devaluation and/or trade protection
      • interest rates may continue to fall (paragraph ) so there is no need for the
        government to intervene
      • supply-side policies intended to increase efficiency and flexibility may be
        preferable to exchange rate manipulation.

      Effective evaluation may be to:
      • consider short-term versus long-term consequences
      • examine the impact on different stakeholders
      • discuss advantages and disadvantages
      • prioritize the arguments.

             which if appropriate, should be rewarded.

           An explanation of a poverty cycle, such as one where low incomes
           lead to low savings, which lead to low investment, in turn leading
           to low incomes and low savings once again, or an explanation that
           foreign aid can increase resources available in the economy, therefore
           leading to higher incomes which can allow Malawi to break out of the
           poverty cycle.

       2   Correct application of appropriate theory                                       3–4

      N.B. An alternate poverty cycle (any linked chain of events leading to low
      incomes) may be used, and if appropriately explained, may be fully rewarded.

      Candidates may explain a break in a poverty cycle in a different way, e.g. aid
      may be used to provide health care and improve human capital, and if
      appropriately explained, this approach may be fully rewarded.

           showing economic growth as a movement from one point on the diagram
           to another point further from the origin with or without a PPC shift,
           or a plausible explanation that economic growth may not lead to

        Responses may include:
        • discussion of types of aid e.g. multi-lateral/bilateral, tied, grant aid, soft
          loans, emergency relief, emergency financial relief, NGO aid
        • benefits of aid which is targeted to meeting development objective
          (paragraph )
        • aid can contribute to economic growth (paragraph ) which might then be
          used to achieve development objectives
        • benefits of cooperation between aid agencies, governments, international
          organisations and local community groups (paragraph )
        • benefits of aid which is driven by the needs of the people (paragraph )
          and linked to appropriate domestic policies and good governance
        • problems associated with corruption (paragraph ) that prevent aid from
          addressing development objectives
        • problems associated with aid which is given for political and strategic
          reasons
        • problems associated with aid dependency
        • problems associated with tied aid that is not related to development
        • a comparison of official aid and unofficial aid.
