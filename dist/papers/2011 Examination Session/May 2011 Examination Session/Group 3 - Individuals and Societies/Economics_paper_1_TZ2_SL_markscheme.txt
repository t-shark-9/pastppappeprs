1.       (a)   Explain the distinction between public goods and merit goods and why
               these goods are examples of market failure.                                        [10 marks]

               Answers should include:
                 definitions of public goods, merit goods, market failure
                 public goods are under-provided/not provided in a free market economy
                 because of their characteristics of non-excludability and non-rivalry
                 reference to the free rider problem with public goods
                 merit goods are provided in a free market economy but would be
                 under-consumed at market price
                 examples of public goods and merit goods
                 merit and public goods have strong positive externalities so governments
                 often provide public goods themselves, while merit goods may be provided
                 by the government or subsidized.

               Answers may include:
                 public goods can also be merit goods, but not all merit goods are public
                 goods as the latter do not necessarily have the characteristics of non-
                 excludability and non-rivalry.
                 governments may find it difficult to estimate the extent of positive
                 externalities
                 diagrams to show the market failure associated with public goods and merit
                 goods.

               Examiners should be aware that candidates may take a different approach
               which if appropriate, should be rewarded.

(b)   “The operation of the free market is always the best way to allocate scarce
      resources.” Evaluate this statement.                                            [15 marks]

      Answers may include:
        a definition of a free market economy
        a definition of scarce resources
        a definition of the centrally planned economy
        a definition of mixed economy
        explanation of the characteristics of a free market economy
        the advantages of the free market economy: relative efficiency with few
        surpluses or shortages thanks to the signalling and incentive functions of
        price to consumers and producers
        the disadvantages of the free market economy: market failures such as
        overprovision of merit and demerit goods and positive and
        negative externalities, public goods monopolies; economic instability and
        inequality
        the advantages of the centrally planned economy: central planning can
        potentially lead to full employment, stable prices and more equal
        distribution of income
        the disadvantages of the centrally planned economy: planning errors lead to
        resource misallocation, inefficiency, shortages and surpluses; lack of
        incentives, choice and motivation
        the reality that all economies are mixed with the private sector and public
        sector providing certain goods and services.

      Effective evaluation may be to:
         consider short-term versus long-term consequences
         examine the impact on different stakeholders
         discuss advantages and disadvantages
         prioritize the arguments.

      Examiners should be aware that candidates may take a different approach
      which if appropriate, should be rewarded.

      Answers may include:
      Arguments in favour of lower government spending:
        lower government spending and greater use of market forces to allocate
        resources leading to greater economic efficiency
        lower government spending leading to lower taxation
        lower government spending reduces government borrowing
        the importance of reduced government spending as a means of reducing
        AD, to reduce inflation and a current account deficit.

      Arguments against lower government spending:
        the importance of government spending for the supply-side of the economy
        the importance of government spending on merit goods, public goods
        and infrastructure
        the importance of government spending as a means of influencing the
        distribution of income through public services and state benefits
        the importance of government spending as a means of regulating AD,
        e.g. use of higher government spending to increase AD to encourage growth
        and to reduce unemployment.

3.   (a)   Explain the main reasons why international trade takes place.                      [10 marks]

           Answers should include:
             a definition of international trade
             the differences in factor endowments
             the variety and quality of goods available to consumers increases with trade
             gains from specialization, e.g. countries can consume goods from outside
             their PPC, greater output, economies of scale, technology transfer,
             higher incomes, better resource allocation
             political benefits of trade.

           Answers may include:
             use of a PPC diagram
             examples from particular countries
             law of comparative advantage and differences in opportunity cost.

      country’s balance of payments on current account and for its domestic
      economy.                                                                           [15 marks]

      Answers should include:
        a definition of terms of trade
        a definition of deterioration of the terms of trade
        a definition of balance of payments on current account.

      Answers may include:
        an explanation of consequences of deterioration of the terms of trade in
        terms of export prices falling and import prices rising
        an explanation of consequences of deterioration of the terms of trade in
        terms of possible fall in the quantity demanded of imports as import prices
        rise and increase in quantity demanded of exports as export prices fall thus
        improving the balance of payments
        the importance of the price elasticity of demand (PED) or exports and
        imports in determining whether a deterioration in the terms of trade
        increases export revenue and reduces import expenditure
        deteriorating terms of trade as an international trade barrier to development
        for less-developed countries (LDCs)
        an explanation that deterioration of the terms of trade could occur because
        of a fall in demand for exports and/or rise in demand for imports which
        could increase a balance of payments current account deficit.
        the impact on employment, living standards, incomes, aggregate demand.

      N.B. Examiners should be aware that consideration of the Marshall-Lerner
      condition and J-curve is not required as they are higher level extension topics.

      Effective evaluation may be to:
         consider short-term versus long-term consequences
         examine the impact on different stakeholders
         discuss advantages and disadvantages
         prioritize the arguments.

      Examiners should be aware that candidates may take a different approach
      which if appropriate, should be rewarded.

(b)   Evaluate the view that economic development in less-developed countries
      (LDCs) can best be achieved through export-led growth strategies rather
      than import substitution.                                                         [15 marks]

      Answers may include:
        a definition of less-developed countries (LDCs)
        a definition of import substitution
        use of PPC diagrams to illustrate development
        an explanation of import substitution strategies, e.g. in terms of
        protectionism, exchange controls, subsidies to domestic firms, the state
        playing an active role in the management of the economy, nationalization
        the advantages of export-led growth strategies, e.g. in terms of more
        efficient resource allocation from specialization, benefits of MNCs, benefits
        of free trade, flexible labour and capital markets, greater consumer choice,
        a reduction in government budget deficits
        the disadvantages of export-led growth strategies, e.g. in terms of exposure
        to the instability of world markets, vulnerability to foreign competition,
        over-dependence on a narrow range of exports, over-dependence on
        primary production, market failure such as the problem of environmental
        pollution, increased likelihood of structural unemployment, problems
        of MNCs, problems of structural adjustment programmes, greater wealth
        and income inequality, problems of capital outflows, vulnerability to
        international economic cases
        the advantages of import substitution, e.g. in terms of the infant industry
        argument, greater diversity of economic activity, supply-side improvements
        as a result of investment in health care and education and training, a more
        equal distribution of income and wealth, less inequality between rural and
        urban sectors, higher levels of employment, protection of local cultural
        heritage, protection from MNC dominance
        the disadvantages of import substitution, e.g. in terms of possible slower
        growth of the economy, inability to benefit from the gains from free trade
        such as greater choice and lower prices, inefficient resource allocation,
        preservation of inefficiency, drawbacks of government planning
        examples of countries that have used export-led growth
        examples of countries that have used import substitution.

      N.B. This question, as the markscheme indicates, is particularly broad, so a
      very wide range of answers is possible. Only some of the above points can be
      expected within the time allowed.

      Effective evaluation may be to:
         consider short-term versus long-term consequences
