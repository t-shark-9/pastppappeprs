Examiners should be aware that in some cases, candidates may take a different approach, which if
appropriate should be rewarded. If in doubt, check with your Team Leader.

In the case of an “identify” question read all answers and mark positively up to the maximum marks.
Disregard incorrect answers. In the case of a “describe” question, which asks for a certain number of
facts e.g. “describe two kinds”, mark the first two correct answers. This could include two descriptions,
one description and one identification, or two identifications. In the case of an “explain” question,
which asks for a specified number of explanations e.g. “explain two reasons”, mark the first two
correct answers. This could include two full explanations, one explanation, one partial explanation, etc.

“ITGS terminology refers to both the IT technical terminology and to the terminology related to social
and ethical impacts.”

                                               SECTION A

                                Area of impact: Business and employment

1.   (a)   (i)     Identify the key field in the RECEIVER_OF_LOAN table.                        [1 mark]

                   Business_ID.

                   Award [1 mark] for the correct answer.

           (ii)    Identify the data type for the field Phone_Number in the
                   RECEIVER_OF_LOAN table.                                                      [1 mark]

                   text/alphanumeric/string

                   Award [1 mark] for the correct answer.

                   N.B. “Number” is not appropriate as this data type would not
                   accommodate numbers beginning with “0”.

                   Do not accept: letters or word

     (b)   The database administrator wishes to produce an alphabetical list of lenders
           from France who have contributed at least US$50 after 01/01/2001.

           Describe the query that produces the list specified above.                          [4 marks]

           •     Amount_Loaned>=50
           •     Date_Loaned>01/01/2001
           •     Country=France
           •     Sort/display alphabetically by Family_Name.

           Award [1 mark] for each of the above statements up to a maximum of [4 marks].
                                              –4–                M11/3/ITGSX/SP2/ENG/TZ0/XX/M


(c)   The field Business_Description should not be included in the LOANS table
      because this would lead to data redundancy.

      Explain why this could lead to inaccuracies in the database.                          [4 marks]

      Answers may include:
      • at data entry, if Business_Description is included in both the
        RECEIVER_OF_LOAN and the LOANS table, then a typing error will result
        in two different versions of the same data
      • during editing (i.e. Business_Description is updated) a failure to update entries
        in both tables will result in two different versions of the same data
      • different versions of data will lead to different output depending on
        whether a query includes the Business_Description field from the
        RECEIVER_OF_LOAN or the LOANS table.

      [1 mark]
      A limited response that indicates very little understanding of the topic.

      [2–3 marks]
      A reasonable description of reasons for not including the field in the LOANS table
      although the answer may lack appropriate reasoning at the lower end of the band.

      [4 marks]
      A clear, detailed and balanced explanation of the reasons for not including the
      field in the LOANS table.

(d)   “Kiva provides a data-rich, transparent lending platform. We are constantly
      working to make the system more transparent to show how money flows
      throughout the entire cycle, and what effect it has on the people and
      institutions that lend, manage and borrow it along the way.”

                           [Source: http://kiva.org/about, 25 September 2009]

      Discuss what online services the Kiva web site could provide for effective
      online reporting back to the lenders about the status of the recipient’s
      business and the loan repayments.                                          [10 marks]

      Answers may include:
      • e-mail alerts – send e-mail alerts to lenders each time a loan repayment is made
        informing them of the repayment amount/amount still owing
      • cell (mobile) phone alerts
      • web site with a secure web page for each lender – e.g. the web page may
        include descriptions of outstanding loans and the status of the repayment
      • web site with a secure page for each business – this could include details of all
        loans, lenders and payments and videos/images of the business
      • web site with graphic information – maps, interactive charts, graphs showing
        information about lenders and statistics of loans embedded Google map
        locating the business, track bar showing loan status
      • widget to add to a web page/wiki – providing feedback on a lender’s
        businesses/as a language translator
      • blog – providing regular updates on status of loans
      • forums – questions and answers about loans may be posted
      • chat – lenders could chat with a Kiva representative about loans
      • RSS feeds – lenders could subscribe to RSS feeds e.g. to hear podcast updates
        on a business
      • the site could enable subscription to newsletters which are sent automatically to
        lenders
      • searchable database – Kiva posts updates to the database which can be viewed
        from a web page.
      • online rating system on the KIVA website to show status of the recipient’s
        business.

      Concerns for discussion
      • download speed may be a limiting factor when accessing some of these
        services
      • security is important to protect lenders’ privacy regarding their loans
      • some services require the user to download additional software which may
        have implications for security, disk space.

      In part (d) of this question it is expected there will be a balance in the ITGS
      terminology between IT technical terminology and the terminology related to
      social and ethical impacts.

  financial policy because a podcast adds a more personal touch to the
  accompanying statement
• book publishers can create podcasts so that blind students can listen
  to books.

Do not accept the university advertising their program.

Award [1 mark] for reasonable description of two possible educational uses for
podcasts or vidcasts other than providing access to lecture material up to a
maximum of [2 marks]. Award an additional [1 mark] for the explanation of each

(d)   Many universities around the world are also making their lectures publicly
      available through online podcast and vidcast hosting services. The lectures
      cover a wide range of topics, opening up new opportunities for lecturing
      and learning.

      To what extent could stakeholders, other than students enrolled in the
      university courses, be affected by the public availability of university lectures
      as podcasts and vidcasts?                                                         [10 marks]

      Answers may include:
      Benefits
      • lecturers in other universities can view the online material and determine the
        nature of the teaching in other institutions
      • students in other locations can view material in courses similar to ones that
        they are taking and get a broader perspective
      • students who cannot afford to attend university can still access university
        lecture material
      • lecturers can include more varied kinds of material in podcasts and vidcasts
        and this can be edited and updated
      • persons can follow courses in subjects that they may normally not have
        access to
      • the university may receive recognition for its outstanding lectures
      • governments that financially support universities may see the improved
        education of citizens as a benefit.

      Concerns
      • lecturers at the university may be concerned that their lecture material is being
        used in other institutions and that they are not receiving recognition
      • students in some parts of the world may experience difficulties in downloading
        podcasts and vidcasts due to technical problems
      • publishers may be concerned that not as many of their published materials will
        be sold
      • universities may lose fees, particularly for part-time or non-qualification
        courses, because potential students can access course material for free and do
        not enrol in the courses
      • university professors may be disappointed/less motivated due to a reduced
        number of students attending their lectures since the podcast/vidcasts are
        publically available
      • universities may have to upgrade their infrastructure due to the popularity of
        their podcasts and the increased number of persons accessing their servers.

      Potential students are not students enrolled in the university courses and can be
      considered stakeholders.

      In part (d) of this question it is acceptable if there is more emphasis on
      the terminology related to social and ethical impacts and less on IT
      technical terminology.

(c)   Explain why images of the retina need to be converted to JPG format before
      being displayed on the 2020 Vision web site.                               [4 marks]

      Answers may include:
      • JPG “Joint Photographic Expert Group” (JPEG) format was specifically
        designed for the storing of photographic images; other formats may not be as
        well suited to photographic images
      • JPG files achieve a smaller file size by compressing the image that retains
        detail (which matters most in the case of the retina)

(d)   The UK government has to decide whether to:
      • continue to fund the current IT medical records system in an attempt to
        get it working
      • abandon this development and outsource a similar records system to a
        third party such as MedSystems.

      Evaluate both of these strategies.                                                [10 marks]

      Answers may include:
      • privacy of the medical records (i.e. access by third parties, data mining)
      • security (i.e. unauthorized access to medical records)
      • reliability of medical information
      • control of the medical records
      • cost considerations for development
      • expertise in developing medical records system
      • ease of maintaining / upgrading the medical system
      • political impacts (i.e. views of taxpayers)
      • links to/consistency with other government databases.

      Responses that address only one strategy can receive a maximum of 5 marks.

      In part (d) of this question it is expected there will be a balance in the ITGS
      terminology between IT technical terminology and the terminology related to
      social and ethical impacts.

5.   (a)   Identify two methods of updating a database with data from a spreadsheet.           [2 marks]

           • import wizard
           • link the database and spreadsheet – updates are automatic / use a macro to automatically
             update
           • copy and paste.

           Award [1 mark] for each method up to a maximum of [2 marks].

     (b)   A spreadsheet will be unreliable if data has been entered incorrectly.

           Describe two ways to prevent the input of invalid data.                             [4 marks]

           Answers may include:
           • set validation checks on cells – this can restrict the type of data that can be
             entered / prevent data being entered if it is outside a certain range
           • cells can be locked – this prevents users changing cells that must not be
             changed / passwords only allow privileged users to make changes
           • data entry can be limited to predefined values using a drop-down list of
             valid entries.

           Award [1 mark] for identifying each way up to a maximum of [2 marks].
           Award an additional [1 mark] for the description of each way up to a maximum of
           an additional [2 marks].

(c)   The output from the spreadsheet (Diagram 2) contains valuable data for
      users of the web site. Compare two different ways a user may choose to save
      copies of this data to a personal computer (PC).                            [4 marks]

      Answers may include:
      • the data can be downloaded as an XLS file – this allows the user to perform
        calculations in a spreadsheet
      • the data can be downloaded as a data file/CSV file/comma-delimited format/
        comma-separated values – this allows data to easily be shared between
        applications (columns are separated by a comma and rows begin on a new line)
      • the data can be saved as a PDF – this allows the user to read/store/print the data
        but the user cannot operate on the numbers
      • a screen shot could be taken and saved to disk – this allows the user to
        read/store/print the data but the user cannot operate on the numbers, it may be
        difficult to read
      • the data can be copied and pasted into a spreadsheet – this gives the user access
        to the numerical data and the ability to perform calculations.
      • the data can be saved in HTML format (File => save as) – this does not allow
        manipulation of the data

(d)   Many companies create their own spreadsheets so they can use the data
      from the government bureau of meteorology web site in order to assist in
      their decision-making. Results are often limited due to poor design,
      maintenance or control of these spreadsheets.

      Discuss the policies that a company can implement to overcome such
      problems.                                                          [10 marks]

      Answers may include:
      • testing – all formulae should be tested – values can be set to zero and all
        formulae should output zero / the trace function in Excel shows relationships
        between cells and formulae / manual checking of output with varying
        input values
      • design should take into account ease of use – minimum inputs, clear, consistent
        and attractive layout
      • documentation must be provided – e.g. original design/modifications
      • if a spreadsheet is shared a single copy should be located centrally and all
        updates made to this file – otherwise multiple versions of the same spreadsheet
        will result
      • data should be protected from accidental deletion or alteration – individual
        cells can be locked to prevent data being deleted or changed
      • data should only be available to authorized users – the spreadsheet can be
        password protected / files can be stored on secure servers
      • the spreadsheet should be protected from viruses/malware – this can be
        achieved with regular virus scans/regular Windows updates to MS Office
      • a backup routine must be implemented – daily, weekly, monthly backups /
        backup media stored off site
      • consideration should be given to new software updates which may provide
        enhanced decision making features
      • data from the government web site should be downloaded on a regular basis to
        ensure currency of information
      • training needs to be provided for staff who are involved in designing,
        maintaining or controlling the spreadsheets.
      • spreadsheet software must be robust/offer online help/include templates

                             Area of impact: Politics and government

6.   (a)   Identify two reasons why the UK government is encouraging people to pay
           their vehicle tax online.                                               [2 marks]

           Answers may include:
           • fast – make a tax payment in minutes
           • convenient – available 24 hours a day, 7 days a week
           • accurate – verification steps along the way (i.e. to check and review
             information before it is sent)
           • easy to use – a step-by-step process to successfully complete the payment
           • secure – the government should offer the highest levels of security
           • government tax revenue collection costs are reduced
           • saves time waiting in lines
           • can be paid from anywhere in the world.

           Award [1 mark] for any reason up to a maximum of [2 marks].

     (b)   When paying the vehicle tax online, the URL of the vehicle tax web site uses
           the protocol HTTPS. Describe the difference between HTTP and HTTPS.          [4 marks]

           Answers may include:
           • different default ports: 80 for HTTP and 443 for HTTPS
           • HTTPS works by transmitting normal HTTP interactions through an encrypted
             system; HTTP does not use an encrypted system
           • HTTPS – the information cannot be accessed by any party other than the client
             and end server; HTTP – can be transmitted over other servers
           • HTTPS uses two common types of encryption layers: Transport Layer Security
             (TLS) and Secure Sockets Layer (SSL), both of which encode the data records
             being exchanged; HTTP does not encode.

           Award [1 mark] for identifying each difference between HTTP and HTTPS up to a
           maximum of [2 marks]. Award an additional [1 mark] for a relevant description
           of the difference between HTTP and HTTPS up to a maximum of [2 marks].

(c)   Explain how the UK vehicle tax database system could make use of
      private key/public key encryption in order to safeguard an owner’s data. [4 marks]

      Answers may include:
      • encryption is the transformation of data so that it cannot be read by anyone
        except the intended recipient
      • a key is an item of data that determines the form of the encryption
      • when data is being transmitted, it is encrypted using a public key that is known
        to anyone
      • it cannot be decrypted with the public key, but only with a private key that only
        the recipient has so anyone else who intercepts the data will not be able to
        decrypt it.

(d)   The UK government has access to a range of other databases such as:
      • vehicle registration database
      • income tax database
      • police records
      • cell (mobile) phone records
      • credit card records
      • Internet service provider (ISP) records of web sites visited.

      Data matching techniques allow the government to collate information from
      numerous sources and build up a comprehensive picture of an individual.
      Civil liberty groups are concerned about the amount of information that
      governments hold, the amount of access they have to other databases and
      how they use it.

      With reference to specific examples, to what extent are the concerns of the
      civil liberty groups justified?                                             [10 marks]

      Answers may include:
      Concerns are justified
      • using information for a purpose other than for what it was collected
      • removing human judgment by automating decisions affecting individuals
      • assuming that people found through data matching are guilty; requires people
        to prove their innocence
      • falsely identifying individuals due to errors in some government databases
      • sharing the results from data matching between government agencies and
        others (e.g. police, future employers, insurance claim agencies).

      Concerns are not justified
      • identifying someone who has not claimed an entitlement
      • correcting errors and inconsistencies in the databases (e.g. personal information,
        instances of under-paying or over-paying)
      • preventing/detecting instances of fraud (e.g. conflicting claims)
      • tracing people wanted by the government.

      In part (d) of this question it is acceptable if there is more emphasis on
      the terminology related to social and ethical impacts and less on IT
      technical terminology.
