1.       (a)   Using at least one diagram, explain why a firm in perfect competition
               might only be able to make supernormal (abnormal) profits in the
               short-run and not in the long-run.                                                [10 marks]

               Answers should include:
                 a definition of supernormal (abnormal) profits
                 an explanation of supernormal (abnormal) profits
                 an explanation of perfect competition
                 a standard short-run perfect competition diagram showing supernormal
                 (abnormal) profit at profit maximizing output
                 an explanation of short-run supernormal (abnormal) profit leading to entry
                 of new firms into the industry, the market supply curve shifting right, price
                 falling and the supernormal (abnormal) profits being eliminated (until only
                 normal profits are made).

               Answers may include:
                 a distinction between the short-run and long-run in microeconomics
                 diagrams to illustrate the last bullet point above
                 an explanation of why short-run abnormal profit is made.

               Examiners should be aware that candidates may take a different approach
               which if appropriate, should be rewarded.

             policy.

           Plus any two of the following:
              progressive, regressive and proportional taxation (a diagram may be used)

              (more regressive) taxes

(b)   “Measures to promote greater income equality should be a key feature of
      government economic policy.” Evaluate this proposition.                           [15 marks]

      Answers may include:
        a definition of income equality
        reference to the difficulty and disagreement over “fair” distribution
        consideration of benefits of greater income equality such as reduction of
        poverty, increase in consumption of the poor, greater incentives for low
        income groups, attainment of economic development
        definitions of the four objectives of government economic policy, with an
        explanation that income equality is a fifth and not always considered as
        important
        consideration of the Laffer curve
        consideration of the presumed disincentive effects of taxation
        reference to the positive externalities of merit goods such as education and
        health care for lower income groups
        consideration of the normative nature of the statement in the question
        the positive multiplier effects resulting from transferring income from
        sectors with high MPS to sectors with high MPC
        a reference to where the economy is in the business cycle, as an influence on
        whether greater income equality would be a key feature of government
        economic policy.

      N.B. Some candidates may mention the balanced-budget multiplier in
      connection with the last bullet point.

      In attempting evaluation candidates might point to the fact that arguments for
      greater or less equality coexist within economics and that notions of income
      equality and fairness are not the same.

      Effective evaluation may be to:
         consider short-term versus long-term consequences
         examine the impact on different stakeholders
         discuss advantages and disadvantages
         prioritize the arguments.

(b)   Evaluate the arguments in favour of barriers to international trade.              [15 marks]

      Answers may include:
        a definition of free trade
        a definition of protectionism
        the protection of declining industries to prevent structural unemployment
        the protection of infant industries until they are able to enjoy economies of
        scale and compete internationally
        the protection of the economy from low-cost labour imports from
        less-developed countries (LDCs)
        protection against dumping
        non-economic arguments such as artificial administrative regulations
        strategic considerations and self-sufficiency
        the exercise of political influence.

      In attempting evaluation candidates might assess each argument against the
      general benefits of free trade which are assumed to offer gains to all, and are
      supported by institutions such as the WTO and the EU while protectionism is
      often to prevent the decline of a particular industry or economic group.

      Candidates might consider the implications of barriers in more and
      less-developed countries and this may be fully rewarded.

      Effective evaluation may be to:
         consider short-term versus long-term consequences
         examine the impact on different stakeholders
         discuss advantages and disadvantages
         prioritize the arguments.

      Examiners should be aware that candidates may take a different approach
      which if appropriate, should be rewarded.

             a definition of economic development

             an explanation of any export-led growth strategies such as:
             – trade liberalization/low levels of protectionism

             – privatization
             – use of supply-side policies

(b)   Evaluate the view that economic development in less-developed countries
      (LDCs) can best be achieved through export-led growth strategies rather
      than import substitution.                                                         [15 marks]

      Answers may include:
        a definition of less-developed countries (LDCs)
        a definition of import substitution
        use of PPC diagrams to illustrate development
        an explanation of import substitution strategies, e.g. in terms of
        protectionism, exchange controls, subsidies to domestic firms, the state
        playing an active role in the management of the economy, nationalization
        the advantages of export-led growth strategies, e.g. in terms of more
        efficient resource allocation from specialization, benefits of MNCs, benefits
        of free trade, flexible labour and capital markets, greater consumer choice,
        a reduction in government budget deficits
        the disadvantages of export-led growth strategies, e.g. in terms of exposure
        to the instability of world markets, vulnerability to foreign competition,
        over-dependence on a narrow range of exports, over-dependence on
        primary production, market failure such as the problem of environmental
        pollution, increased likelihood of structural unemployment, problems of
        MNCs, problems of structural adjustment programmes, greater wealth and
        income inequality, problems of capital outflows, vulnerability to
        international economic cases
        the advantages of import substitution, e.g. in terms of the infant industry
        argument, greater diversity of economic activity, supply-side improvements
        as a result of investment in health care and education and training, a more
        equal distribution of income and wealth, less inequality between rural and
        urban sectors, higher levels of employment, protection of local cultural
        heritage, protection from MNC dominance
        the disadvantages of import substitution, e.g. in terms of possible slower
        growth of the economy, inability to benefit from the gains from free trade
        such as greater choice and lower prices, inefficient resource allocation,
        preservation of inefficiency, drawbacks of government planning
        examples of countries that have used export-led growth
        examples of countries that have used import substitution.

      N.B. This question, as the markscheme indicates, is particularly broad, so a
      very wide range of answers is possible. Only some of the above points can be
      expected within the time allowed.

      Effective evaluation may be to:
         consider short-term versus long-term consequences

         discuss advantages and disadvantages
         prioritize the arguments.
