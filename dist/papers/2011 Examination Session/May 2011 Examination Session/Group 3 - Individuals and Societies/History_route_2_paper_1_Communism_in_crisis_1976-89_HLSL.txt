These sources and questions relate to Gorbachev and his aims/policies (glasnost and perestroika) and
consequences for the Soviet state.

SOURCE A                Extract from The War That Never Was: The Fall of the Soviet Empire 1985–1991
                        by David Pryce-Jones, 1995.

Gorbachev’s trouble was that he weakened his own system. His only instrument of power was
the Communist Party, but his reforms weakened precisely that instrument. He was like the proverbial man
sawing off the branch on which he was sitting. … The moment a new NEP-type [NEP = New Economic
Policy] reform began, the party started to disintegrate and lose control. … Although Gorbachev had
premonitions [thoughts] of the destructive power of television, he found that he could not stop deputies
using television to promote themselves. For the first time people could see their leaders as they were.
Once they felt that the centralized power (of the party) had weakened, they (the people) perceived that there
was no very great risk any longer in demanding higher standards of confidence and honesty. Glasnost was
devised [intended] to keep the party obedient by unleashing criticism of it from outside, but there was no
way in between. Either you have a party-controlled centralized regime or you have a democracy.


SOURCE B                Extract from Yeltsin: A Life by Timothy J Colton, 2008. Colton is professor of
                        Government and Russian Studies at Harvard University, USA.

Although Mikhail Gorbachev presided over the decline of the Communist Party and the ending of
Soviet mastery in Eastern Europe, it was Yeltsin, the first elected national leader in Russia’s long history,
who buried the Soviet Union itself. … Gorbachev reminds us that “perestroika started from above. It could
not have been otherwise in totalitarian conditions”. The Soviet old guard [long serving party members]
warded it off as best they could. Newcomers to power gave it impetus and set the terms under which
non-leaders entered into it. Not always alert to the effects, they let change snowball from reform
to revolution. Thereupon, Yeltsin, and his supporters, came to constitutional choices about the future after
Communism and after the USSR.

SOURCE C               Extract from Mikhail Gorbachev: Memoirs by Mikhail Gorbachev, 1995.
                       Gorbachev is a former Soviet leader.

After leaving the Kremlin … I faced the question: what to do next? … My conscience was clear.
The promise I had made to the people when I started the process of perestroika was kept: I gave
them freedom. This was reflected in many quite specific things: glasnost, freedom of speech, the ending of
ideological persecution, the right to live anywhere one wanted, the removal of the monopoly on property
and power, the creation of the foundations of a genuine parliamentary system, the end of the nightmare
threat of nuclear war, and openness to the world, which responded with understanding and support for our
desire to become a normal democratic state. Perestroika did not give the people prosperity, something
they expected of me, as head of state. … But I did not promise that. I urged people to use this new-found
freedom to create prosperity, personal and social prosperity, with their own hands and minds, according to
the abilities of each.


SOURCE D               Extract from “Gorbachev and Glasnost – A New Soviet Order? Implications for
                       US Foreign Policy” by Thomas M Magstadt, taken from the journal
                       Policy Analysis, March 1989. Magstadt was chairman of the Political Science
                       department at Kearney State College, USA.

To summarize the argument thus far: Gorbachev is no doubt sincere about economic reforms, because
without them the Soviet Union is facing a period of decline. Glasnost is the price Gorbachev must pay
to get Soviet workers behind perestroika (which entails risks and sacrifices, especially in the short run).
Demokratizatsia [towards democracy] has been little more than superficial up to this point, although
some signs, such as occasional dissenting votes cast in the Supreme Soviet, hint at new possibilities. …
The bottom line is “Soviet young people must rethink old prejudices and past norms of Soviet behaviour”.
In other words, even if structural change does occur, it will not be irreversible until or unless it is
accompanied by a transformation of the underlying political structure – a slow process, at best.
