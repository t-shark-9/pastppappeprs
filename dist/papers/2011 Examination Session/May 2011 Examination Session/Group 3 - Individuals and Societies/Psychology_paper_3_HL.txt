The stimulus material below is based on a research article.

             “Befriending” is a term for developing a friendly relationship between a volunteer and a
             “befriendee”, i.e. a person who is given the opportunity to have a friend. The purpose of such a
             relationship is to benefit a person at potential risk: for example adolescents from minority groups.
             Befriending programmes have been found to benefit the befriendees by protecting them from
      5      loneliness and social isolation. One such befriending programme in Scotland was concerned with
             social inclusion of young people from minority backgrounds by establishing relationships between
             them and members of the majority group.

             McVittie, Goodall and Barr (2009) conducted a qualitative study on the befriending programme
             from Scotland mentioned above. The aim of their study was to investigate the outcome of
     10      befriending from the perspective of befrienders. The outcome of the befriending scheme was
             very much dependent on the motivation and involvement of the participants, i.e. the befrienders.
             Therefore the researchers were particularly interested in their view of the scheme and the
             befrienders’ relationships with the young people.

             The ten participants in this study were five males and five females ranging in age from 25 to 36.
     15      The researchers collected data with semi-structured interviews, which were audio recorded and
             transcribed with the participants’ consent. The researchers used inductive content analysis to
             analyse and interpret the transcripts.

             The findings of the study showed that the befrienders suggested that they themselves received
             several benefits from the befriending programme, for example appreciation of other cultures,
     20      being welcomed in the families of the young people, and getting insight into the community-based
             difficulties that minority cultures experience. Overall, the befrienders had a positive view of the
             programme. Research on befriending programmes has found that befriendees normally report
             positive experiences. This qualitative study now confirms that befrienders also benefit from such
             programmes.

2.        Discuss the use of semi-structured interviews in this study.                               [10 marks]

3.        Explain how researchers could use inductive content analysis on the transcripts of the
          semi-structured interviews in this study.                                                  [10 marks]
