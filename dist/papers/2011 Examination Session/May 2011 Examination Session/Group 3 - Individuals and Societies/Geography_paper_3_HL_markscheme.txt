Guide references such as “[Guide 3]” show where the suggested indicative content may be found in the
Part 3 Guide.

1.   (a)   Explain how and why one network                   (transport,    internet,   or
           communication) has grown over time.                                                [10 marks]

           The description of “how” may include some account of changes in user
           numbers and the global pattern of distribution, including key nodes and hubs
           where large amounts of traffic (people, goods or information) are routed.

           Some candidates may select one example of transport (e.g. container shipping)
           others may address transport in general. Either approach is acceptable and
           should be credited according to its merits.

           Whilst it is desirable that good answers can describe the spatial growth of the
           chosen network over time, it is also acceptable for the answer to instead
           describe growth in the intensity of use of the network over time (this applies
           particularly to an analysis of the world-wide web or of “global travel”).

           The account of “why” should focus on a rising number of users / affluent
           markets, thereby causing networks to grow (in size or intensity of use) to help
           meet the needs of more individuals (leisure / tourism / work) and businesses,
           including TNCs and/or governments.

           Overcoming of physical, economic, or political obstacles could form an
           important part of the account (either “how” or “why”). For example, an
           analysis of internet growth might mention physical challenges being overcome
           (through the laying of undersea cables). Or an account of airline growth might
           mention advancements in technology (airbus) or cheap airline growth.
           Equally, key milestones in the roll-out of the technology (e.g. invention of
           TCP/IP protocol for the internet) can be applied to support either strand of the
           answer.

           To access band D, both “how” and “why” need addressing in relation to the
           same network example. To access band E, the response should be well
           balanced, although a good explanation of “how” could balance a weaker
           account of “why” or vice versa.

           Other approaches may be equally valid. Marks should be allocated according
           to the markbands.

(b)   Examine the relative importance of the different financial flows that
      connect global core areas with peripheral areas.                                     [15 marks]

      Credit all content in line with the markbands. Credit unexpected approaches
      wherever relevant.

      Responses would be expected to outline some key financial flows: loans (and
      the repayment of interest/debt), Foreign Direct Investment, profit flows, share
      trades, remittances and international aid (government and NGOs) [Guide 3].
      Food, raw materials, manufactured goods and services (all sold for profit) may
      also be addressed. The response should also provide some explanation of what
      is meant by a “global core area” and perhaps some discussion of the varied
      nature of the periphery (LDCs and NICs, for instance) [Guide 1]. There will
      be varying interpretations of what constitutes a core or peripheral area (e.g. the
      issue of where BRICs are placed). The best answers may even critically
      address the issue of scale (e.g. rural India is peripheral to the world economy
      but Mumbai could be described as a core / hub area) [Guide 1].

      The relative importance of the flows needs to be addressed. Globally, FDI
      dwarfs aid flows, for instance. The power of TNCs is arguably greater than
      that of many sovereign states [Guide 6] and aid agencies, suggesting that trade
      flows may be more influential than aid flows in terms of the impact they have
      on different places and people’s lives.

      The idea of what constitutes “important” may also be reflected on, or explicit
      recognition that many flows operate in both directions and so net effects are
      hard to quantify.

      Any conclusion reached will be context-dependent. While the “Asian miracle”
      is often taught as a vindication of the transformative power of FDI, other
      localities have rejected FDI and aid flows (there are South American and
      African examples) and there is a spectrum of local reactions to international
      flows [Guide 7]. Accept a broad interpretation of what is meant by “currency”
      e.g. gold, diamonds.

      Marks should be allocated according to the markbands.

2.   (a)   Analyse the spatial and temporal pattern of adoption of one or more
           branded commodities.                                                             [10 marks]

           There are spatial and temporal dimensions to the topic and both should be
           addressed. Only one example is required. If two examples are used then credit
           breadth rather than depth of analysis.

           For Band C, expect a description of the pattern of growth that contains some
           reference to a time-scale and identifies countries or regions where the
           commodity/commodities have been adopted.

           For Bands D and E, expect a more thorough analysis that has good details or
           may additionally acknowledge the glocalized nature of the growth pattern or
           can identify growth boundaries (rather than implying the entire world has
           adopted the commodity) e.g. may view poverty in parts of the world periphery
           as an obstacle to complete global diffusion. The case studies of diffusion may
           highlight key “blind spots” or anomalies where local resistance exists for
           cultural, political or economic reasons. For instance, there may be religious
           obstacles to the diffusion of McDonald’s beef burgers. Good answers may be
           aware of tariffs and trade bloc arrangements making it difficult for TNCs to
           gain entry to certain key markets.

           Other approaches may be equally valid. Marks should be allocated according
           to the markbands.
                                             –6–              M11/3/GEOGR/HP3/ENG/TZ0/XX/M

(b)   “Global interactions have helped reduce disparities between places.”
      Discuss this statement.                                                              [15 marks]

      Credit all content in line with the markbands. Credit unexpected approaches
      wherever relevant.

      The term “global interactions” should be explained; many approaches are
      possible. Some responses may do this by reference to one of the indices of
      interactions [Guide 1]. This could then provide a structure for their response.
      Alternatively, responses may focus on different types of interactions, such as
      trade, aid, flows of labour, currency etc., and structure their response by
      looking at different examples [Guide 3].

      It is valid to examine disparities at any scale, including the local scale,
      provided they are linked to global interactions.

      The strongest responses will make explicit links between the changes they
      describe (e.g. poverty reduction in China) and specific global interactions
      (e.g. China building wealth through global trade).

      Some may argue that as global interactions have increased, core areas have
      expanded to include more people [Guide 1]. Expect most accounts to tackle
      the idea of a developing periphery e.g. NICs / BRICs / EAGLEs

      A broad interpretation of “disparities” should be credited e.g. gender or
      environmental degradation [Guide 4]. Expect some mention of “unfair” losses
      for people whose environment is damaged by global trade and transboundary
      pollution [Guide 4]. Also, local cultures may be eroded [Guide 5], while the
      political emasculation of small states by powerful TNCs might even be
      discussed in a creditable way [Guide 6].

      To access bands D and E, both sides of the argument should be addressed,
      although balance need not be expected if the candidate has a strong evidenced
      argument that mostly agrees or disagrees with the statement. Greater attention
      to scale (tackling disparities both between and within nations) is also indicative
      of high markband attainment.

3.   (a)   Explain how global interactions can foster environmental awareness.                [10 marks]

           There are many possible approaches. Responses may focus on examples of
           improved awareness in a single country or may consider the global
           realm of environmental management. Examples of the latter include
           response to transboundary pollution, such as oil spills or acid rain; and global
           climate change governance. They may also possess knowledge of global
           ecological / conservation initiatives such as Ramsar, WWF, and UNESCO.

           The work of NGOs such as Greenpeace may also be explored. Candidates may
           examine the environmental messages that are sent as well as explaining the
           medium through which they are transmitted / type of global interaction
           (e.g. internet, Facebook, etc.).

           Another approach is to argue that global interactions are often environmentally
           damaging and that we cannot help but be aware of them (e.g. Gulf of Mexico
           oil spill or climate change).

           Another response might look at how international movements of waste have
           improved environmental management for source countries who have simply
           paid to dispose of their problems elsewhere (e.g. waste sent to China for
           recycling) – and it may be noted that awareness of this trend is growing.

           To access bands D and E, the response should do more than list green
           initiatives; it should also tie them to the concept of global interactions. Good
           answers may also ask whose awareness has been raised – civil society,
           corporations, governments, etc.

(b)   “International interactions always result in the homogenization of
      culture.” Discuss this statement.                                                 [15 marks]

      Credit all content in line with the markbands. Credit unexpected approaches
      wherever relevant.

      The nature of international interactions should be made explicit. Pathways for
      cultural exchanges include the movement of workers, tourists, commodity
      flows, and military and imperial ventures, all of which can be accelerated by
      membership of multi-governmental organizations, such as the EU, NAFTA,
      ASEAN etc. [Guide 6]

      It is not true that homogenization is an inevitable outcome. Possible obstacles
      include nationalism and anti-globalization movements, as well as a range of
      local responses that challenge cultural imperialism or at least negotiate
      “glocalized” outcomes. [Guide 7]

      There is plenty of scope to discuss arts, music, cuisine and other fields of
      cultural expression, and to investigate hybridized outcomes – or to look at the
      obduracy of cultural traits amongst diaspora groups, meaning that cultural
      diversity is not lost in global hubs such as New York or Toronto. [Guide 5]

      In support of the statement, expect TNCs to feature, with some mention of
      “McDonaldization” or a similar argument using Starbucks, Disney etc. as
      examples; or broad observations about the spread of English and Spanish
      perhaps employing the concept of cultural imperialism. The strongest answers
      may critique the notion of glocalization – and question whether the innovation
      of a “curry burger” for the Indian McDonald’s franchise is truly symptomatic
      of heterogeneity. [Guide 3 and 5]

      The role of technology and the internet in fostering homogeneity through the
      relation of shrinking world / global village may also be a feature. [Guide 2]

      To access bands D and E, both sides of the argument should be addressed,
      although balance need not be expected.
