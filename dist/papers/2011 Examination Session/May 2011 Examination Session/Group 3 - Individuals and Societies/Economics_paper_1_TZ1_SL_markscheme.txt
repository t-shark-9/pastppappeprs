                 the role of the public sector

        an explanation of impact of depreciation on export and import prices,
        the demand for exports and imports and thus AD
        an explanation of “the performance of its economy” in terms of growth,
        employment, inflation and the balance of payments
        an evaluation of impact on growth, e.g. positive impact, particularly if
        exports are significant
        an evaluation of impact on employment, e.g. jobs created in export
        industries and import-substitution industries
        an evaluation of impact on inflation, e.g. cost-push effect if a country
        imports raw materials. Demand-pull effect if it is an exporting country
        an evaluation of impact on the balance of payments
        an appreciation that the responsiveness of demand to a change in price is
        significant.

      N.B. Examiners should be aware that consideration of the Marshall-Lerner
      condition and J-curve is not required as they are higher level extension topics
      but can still be rewarded.

      Effective evaluation may be to:
         consider short-term versus long-term consequences
         examine the impact on different stakeholders
         discuss advantages and disadvantages
         prioritize the arguments.

      Examiners should be aware that candidates may take a different approach
      which if appropriate, should be rewarded.

           economic development in less-developed countries (LDCs).                  [10 marks]

           Answers should include:
             a definition of economic development
             a definition of less-developed countries (LDCs)
             an explanation of market-led strategies such as:
             – trade liberalization/low levels of protectionism
             – an emphasis on private enterprise rather than state intervention
             – a floating exchange rate
             – encouragement of FDI
             – privatization
             – use of supply-side policies
             – flexible labour markets.

           Answers may include references to recent/current examples of market-led
           strategies.

(b)   Evaluate the view that economic development in less-developed countries
      (LDCs) can best be achieved through market-led strategies rather than
      interventionist strategies.                                                          [15 marks]

      Answers may include:
        an explanation of interventionist strategies, e.g. in terms of the state playing
        an active role in the management of the economy, economic planning,
        protectionism exchange controls, nationalization
        use of PPC diagrams to illustrate development
        the advantages of market-led strategies, e.g. in terms of more efficient
        resource allocation along the lines of comparative advantage, benefits of
        MNCs, benefits of free trade, flexible labour and capital markets, greater
        consumer choice, a reduction in government budget deficits
        the disadvantages of market-led strategies, e.g. in terms of market failure,
        increased likelihood of structural unemployment, problems of MNCs,
        problems of structural adjustment programmes, greater wealth and income
        inequality, problems of capital outflows, the greater vulnerability of
        countries to international economic crises
        the advantages of interventionist strategies, e.g. in terms of greater diversity
        of economic activity, supply-side improvements as a result of investment in
        health care and education and training, protectionism allowing industry a
        breathing space to grow, a more equal distribution of income and wealth,
        less inequality between rural and urban sectors, higher levels of employment
        the disadvantages of interventionist strategies, e.g. in terms of possible
        growth of the public sector and government spending, inability to benefit
        from the gains from free trade, inefficient resource allocation, growth of
        inefficient monopolies, drawbacks of planning
        after consideration of market-led and interventionist strategies, factors
        favourable to development regardless of strategy may be suggested,
        e.g. absence of corruption.

      N.B. This question, as the markscheme indicates, is particularly broad, so a
      very wide range of answers is possible. Only some of the above points can be
      expected within the time allowed.
