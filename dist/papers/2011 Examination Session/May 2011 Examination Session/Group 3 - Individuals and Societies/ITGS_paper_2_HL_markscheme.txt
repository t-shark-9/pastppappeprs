Examiners should be aware that in some cases, candidates may take a different approach, which if
appropriate should be rewarded. If in doubt, check with your Team Leader.

In the case of an “identify” question read all answers and mark positively up to the maximum marks.
Disregard incorrect answers. In the case of a “describe” question, which asks for a certain number of
facts e.g. “describe two kinds”, mark the first two correct answers. This could include two descriptions,
one description and one identification, or two identifications. In the case of an “explain” question,
which asks for a specified number of explanations e.g. “explain two reasons”, mark the first two
correct answers. This could include two full explanations, one explanation, one partial explanation, etc.

“ITGS terminology refers to both the IT technical terminology and to the terminology related to social
and ethical impacts.”

                                Area of impact: Business and employment

1.   (a)   (i)     Identify the key field in the RECEIVER_OF_LOAN table.                        [1 mark]

                   Business_ID.

                   Award [1 mark] for the correct answer.

           (ii)    Identify the data type for the field Phone_Number in the
                   RECEIVER_OF_LOAN table.                                                      [1 mark]

                   text/alphanumeric/string

                   Award [1 mark] for the correct answer.

                   N.B. “Number” is not appropriate as this data type would not
                   accommodate numbers beginning with “0”.

                   Do not accept: letters or word

     (b)   The database administrator wishes to produce an alphabetical list of lenders
           from France who have contributed at least US$50 after 01/01/2001.

           Describe the query that produces the list specified above.                          [4 marks]

           •     Amount_Loaned>=50
           •     Date_Loaned>01/01/2001
           •     Country=France
           •     Sort/display alphabetically by Family_Name.

           Award [1 mark] for each of the above statements up to a maximum of [4 marks].

(c)   The field Business_Description should not be included in the LOANS table
      because this would lead to data redundancy.

      Explain why this could lead to inaccuracies in the database.                          [4 marks]

      Answers may include:
      • at data entry, if Business_Description is included in both the
        RECEIVER_OF_LOAN and the LOANS table, then a typing error will result
        in two different versions of the same data
      • during editing (i.e. Business_Description is updated) a failure to update entries
        in both tables will result in two different versions of the same data
      • different versions of data will lead to different output depending on
        whether a query includes the Business_Description field from the
        RECEIVER_OF_LOAN or the LOANS table.

      [1 mark]
      A limited response that indicates very little understanding of the topic.

      [2–3 marks]
      A reasonable description of reasons for not including the field in the LOANS table
      although the answer may lack appropriate reasoning at the lower end of the band.

      [4 marks]
      A clear, detailed and balanced explanation of the reasons for not including the
      field in the LOANS table.

(d)   “Kiva provides a data-rich, transparent lending platform. We are constantly
      working to make the system more transparent to show how money flows
      throughout the entire cycle, and what effect it has on the people and
      institutions that lend, manage and borrow it along the way.”

                           [Source: http://kiva.org/about, 25 September 2009]

      Discuss what online services the Kiva web site could provide for effective
      online reporting back to the lenders about the status of the recipient’s
      business and the loan repayments.                                          [10 marks]

      Answers may include:
      • e-mail alerts – send e-mail alerts to lenders each time a loan repayment is made
        informing them of the repayment amount/amount still owing
      • cell (mobile) phone alerts
      • web site with a secure web page for each lender – e.g. the web page may
        include descriptions of outstanding loans and the status of the repayment
      • web site with a secure page for each business – this could include details of all
        loans, lenders and payments and videos/images of the business
      • web site with graphic information – maps, interactive charts, graphs showing
        information about lenders and statistics of loans embedded Google map
        locating the business, track bar showing loan status
      • widget to add to a web page/wiki – providing feedback on a lender’s
        businesses/as a language translator
      • blog – providing regular updates on status of loans
      • forums – questions and answers about loans may be posted
      • chat – lenders could chat with a Kiva representative about loans
      • RSS feeds – lenders could subscribe to RSS feeds e.g. to hear podcast updates
        on a business
      • the site could enable subscription to newsletters which are sent automatically to
        lenders
      • searchable database – Kiva posts updates to the database which can be viewed
        from a web page.
      • online rating system on the KIVA website to show status of the recipient’s
        business.

      Concerns for discussion
      • download speed may be a limiting factor when accessing some of these
        services
      • security is important to protect lenders’ privacy regarding their loans
      • some services require the user to download additional software which may
        have implications for security, disk space.

      In part (d) of this question it is expected there will be a balance in the ITGS
      terminology between IT technical terminology and the terminology related to
      social and ethical impacts.

2.   (a)   Define the term sensor.                                                               [2 marks]

           Answers may include:
           • a device that detects changes in a physical stimulus / responds to a physical
             stimulus / measures a physical quantity
           • a device that records a signal that can be measured / identification of a type of
             sensor, e.g. one that measures body temperature
           • a device that can measure analogue data which is then converted into digital
             data for analysis by a computer
           • it generates a signal as output / sends a signal to a computer

           Award [1 mark] for each of the above points up to a maximum of [2 marks].

     (b)   Describe the steps involved in the transmission of the user’s heart rate data
           to the exercise watch and then to the Garmin web site.                        [4 marks]

           Answers may include:
           • sensors on the chest strap detect the heartbeat
           • data is read as analogue then converted to a digital signal
           • a signal is transmitted by the chest strap to the watch
           • the signal may be sent by radio pulse/Bluetooth
           • the watch acts as a receiver
           • data is stored in the watch’s memory
           • the heart rate is displayed on the watch face
           • the user logs on to the web site using an ID and password
           • upload takes place using a cable/USB/flash drive to the computer/or wirelessly
             syncs to the Garmin website
           • [on the website] the user clicks a button/uses special Garmin software/drags
             data across to upload data on the Garmin upload page

           Award [1 mark] for each step in the process up to a maximum of [4 marks].

(c)   Some users have seen unusual/unexpected information displayed on
      the watch.

      Explain two possible causes of inaccuracies in the data.                           [4 marks]

      Answers may include:
      • the watch has a limited amount of storage available – if data is not deleted all
        the new data may not be recorded/recording errors could occur
      • the chest strap may not be correctly worn – the signal may not be transmitted
        correctly
      • sampling frequency – less frequent sampling may result in less accurate results
      • calibration – incorrect calibration could lead to errors as the base starting point
        would be wrong
      • digitization error – errors may occur when the signal is converted to a
        digital form
      • noise/interference – noise / magnetic fields may interfere with the reading
      • malfunction of the sensor – data capture may be intermittent
      • personal information is wrongly entered – this would lead to incorrect
        calculations of fitness.
      • a dying battery – giving unexpected results due to a weak signal/could affect
        data stored in memory

      Award [1 mark] for possible cause of inaccuracy of data up to a maximum of
      [2 marks]. Award an additional [1 mark] for the explanation of each possible
      cause up to a maximum of [2 marks]. Mark the first two possible causes
      identified.

(d)   Exercise watches have become very popular for athletes and individuals who
      exercise regularly. Evaluate the feature of this technology for the user.  [10 marks]

      Answers may include:
      Positives
      • allows the wearer to monitor and adjust exercise using watch feedback/web
        analysis during the training session – feedback is immediate
      • exercise data can be stored, tracked and later analysed on the Web site
      • some watches include GPS which allows the wearer to calculate distance and
        speed when running
      • accuracy of calculations – measurements are exact and not subject to human
        error in measurement/calculation
      • features such as the heart rate monitor give a better overview of the results
        of exercise
      • feedback is immediate – so the program can be instantly adjusted
      • fitness programs, e.g. goals can be set for the amount of calories to be burned –
        this could provide motivation for the exercise program
      • safety features – safe zones can be determined once personal data (e.g. height,
        weight, age) is inputted
      • using the inputted personal data (e.g. height, weight, age) performances can be
        measured against benchmarks – this provides feedback on the success of the
        exercise program.
      • data resulting from the exercise can be shared with other users online

      Negatives
      • inaccurate readings
      • approximations due to sampling frequencies
      • limited memory could mean new data is not recorded
      • privacy of personal data stored on the web site complacency or worry due to
        inaccuracies – possible inappropriate adjustment of exercise programs.

      In part (d) of this question it is acceptable if there is more emphasis on
      the terminology related to social and ethical impacts and less on IT
      technical terminology.

3.   (a)   Identify two methods of updating a database with data from a spreadsheet.           [2 marks]

           • import wizard
           • link the database and spreadsheet – updates are automatic / use a macro to automatically
             update
           • copy and paste.

           Award [1 mark] for each method up to a maximum of [2 marks].

     (b)   A spreadsheet will be unreliable if data has been entered incorrectly.

           Describe two ways to prevent the input of invalid data.                             [4 marks]

           Answers may include:
           • set validation checks on cells – this can restrict the type of data that can be
             entered / prevent data being entered if it is outside a certain range
           • cells can be locked – this prevents users changing cells that must not be
             changed / passwords only allow privileged users to make changes
           • data entry can be limited to predefined values using a drop-down list of
             valid entries.

           Award [1 mark] for identifying each way up to a maximum of [2 marks].
           Award an additional [1 mark] for the description of each way up to a maximum of
           an additional [2 marks].

(c)   The output from the spreadsheet (Diagram 2) contains valuable data for
      users of the web site. Compare two different ways a user may choose to save
      copies of this data to a personal computer (PC).                            [4 marks]

      Answers may include:
      • the data can be downloaded as an XLS file – this allows the user to perform
        calculations in a spreadsheet
      • the data can be downloaded as a data file/CSV file/comma-delimited format/
        comma-separated values – this allows data to easily be shared between
        applications (columns are separated by a comma and rows begin on a new line)
      • the data can be saved as a PDF – this allows the user to read/store/print the data
        but the user cannot operate on the numbers
      • a screen shot could be taken and saved to disk – this allows the user to
        read/store/print the data but the user cannot operate on the numbers, it may be
        difficult to read
      • the data can be copied and pasted into a spreadsheet – this gives the user access
        to the numerical data and the ability to perform calculations.
      • the data can be saved in HTML format (File => save as) – this does not allow
        manipulation of the data

      [1–2 marks]
      A limited description that shows some understanding of the two ways a user may
      choose to save copies of this data to a personal computer. The two ways are
      described in isolation.

(d)   Many companies create their own spreadsheets so they can use the data
      from the government bureau of meteorology web site in order to assist in
      their decision-making. Results are often limited due to poor design,
      maintenance or control of these spreadsheets.

      Discuss the policies that a company can implement to overcome such
      problems.                                                          [10 marks]

      Answers may include:
      • testing – all formulae should be tested – values can be set to zero and all
        formulae should output zero / the trace function in Excel shows relationships
        between cells and formulae / manual checking of output with varying
        input values
      • design should take into account ease of use – minimum inputs, clear, consistent
        and attractive layout
      • documentation must be provided – e.g. original design/modifications
      • if a spreadsheet is shared a single copy should be located centrally and all
        updates made to this file – otherwise multiple versions of the same spreadsheet
        will result
      • data should be protected from accidental deletion or alteration – individual
        cells can be locked to prevent data being deleted or changed
      • data should only be available to authorized users – the spreadsheet can be
        password protected / files can be stored on secure servers
      • the spreadsheet should be protected from viruses/malware – this can be
        achieved with regular virus scans/regular Windows updates to MS Office
      • a backup routine must be implemented – daily, weekly, monthly backups /
        backup media stored off site
      • consideration should be given to new software updates which may provide
        enhanced decision making features
      • data from the government web site should be downloaded on a regular basis to
        ensure currency of information
      • training needs to be provided for staff who are involved in designing,
        maintaining or controlling the spreadsheets.
      • spreadsheet software must be robust/offer online help/include templates

           Answers may include:
           UPS
           • it is battery powered and will keep a computer running for several minutes
              after a power failure
           • allows data in RAM to be saved
           • allows a safe shutdown routine to occur.
           • it acts as a surge protector to prevent surge of electricity e.g. during a storm or
              power cut
           Firewall
           • prevents unauthorized access to or from a private network
           • examines each message passing through and blocks those it deems a
              security risk
           • is frequently used to prevent unauthorized Internet users from accessing a
              private network
           • can create a list of trusted websites and/or list of websites to be blocked
           • protects users from malware.

(c)   Explain why a school may decide to spend their money on training and
      network infrastructure before purchasing more hardware and software. [4 marks]

      Answers may include:
      Training
      • teachers may not have sufficient skills to use the hardware and software in
        their teaching
      • technical staff may not have sufficient technical skills to manage a
        larger network
      • students may need extra classes/teaching in order to maximise the benefits of
        new and possibly different hardware/software
      • the school may train staff in the new software/hardware so they are proficient
        when it arrives/so they can decide on their exact licensing needs.

      Infrastructure
      • without a suitable network infrastructure (cables/wireless access point)
         new computers can only be used as standalone and will not have access to
         shared files/Intranet/shared apps etc
      • if applications are stored on network servers, new servers/server upgrades may
         be needed to accommodate extra software
      • students may only have access to dial up Internet, therefore purchasing
         a broadband connection may be considered more beneficial than
         further computers
      • they may wish to ensure the current network is totally reliable/secure/adequate
         (e.g. regarding storage/backup/firewall) before adding complications with more

      A limited response that indicates very little understanding of the topic.

      [2–3 marks]
      A reasonable description of reasons for this decision although the answer may
      lack appropriate balance and reasoning at the lower end of the band.
      Award [2 marks] for a training and an infrastructure need identified or
      one described. Award [3 marks] for a training and an infrastructure need
      both described.

      [4 marks]

(d)   In certain schools, students are able to purchase their own laptops which
      can be brought into school and configured to access the school network.
      Evaluate the school’s decision to allow this to happen.                   [10 marks]

      Answers may include:
      Positive impacts
      • increased access to IT in classes – enabling incorporation of IT in the
        curriculum
      • increased access to the Internet – for information research/global collaboration
      • increased flexible learning – laptops can be taken to each class
      • laptops can be used outside the classroom – e.g. taken on field trips/excursions
      • cost savings for the school – if parents purchase laptops there will be less need
        for computer labs/less cost for printed materials as many schools use e-books
      • laptops are becoming more affordable and features are improving for lower
        end machines end machines
      • cost saving to parents if children can use a private laptop they have at home
      • students who use a private laptop can choose their own hardware and
        applications – they may prefer a more advanced computer and the school
        laptops may be entry level
      • students will be more familiar with their private laptops/applications and this
        could lead to greater productivity/schools will need to do less training and
        therefore have more time for teaching the curriculum
      • work is easily transported between home and school – no need to transport
        work on a USB
      • students may be more responsible for their own laptops
      • students can synchronise their iPhone with their own laptop – they may
        download apps for school use – this may not be possible with school
        computers.

      Considerations
      • schools may not have the network infrastructure (wireless access/cabling etc.)
        to support additional computers
      • concerns about potential viruses being uploaded from student laptops
      • students may download inappropriate material to their laptops at home – this
        could be shared/displayed at school
      • there may not be sufficient technical support staff to assist students with
        technical problems – it will be harder to assist students with private laptops
        which may be configured differently/have different operating systems from the
        school network
      • teachers may not be sufficiently IT literate to manage laptops in the classroom
      • cost to parents for software purchase and hardware upgrades
      • equality of access – not all students will be able to afford their own laptops
      • some students will have more powerful laptops – this may give them an
        advantage in class
      • responsibility for security of personal laptops at school – who is responsible if
        they are damaged or stolen?
      • school may require students to install certain software (e.g. screen viewing
        software) – software may conflict with other programs on their laptop
      • unauthorised access to personal data on a private laptop.

In part (d) of this question it is acceptable if there is more emphasis on
the terminology related to social and ethical impacts and less on IT
technical terminology.

social and ethical impacts.”
