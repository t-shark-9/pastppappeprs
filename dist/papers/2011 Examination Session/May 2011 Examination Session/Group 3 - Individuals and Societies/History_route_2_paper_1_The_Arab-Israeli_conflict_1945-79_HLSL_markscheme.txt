1.    (a) What, according to Source C, were the reactions of the powers
          mentioned to the nationalization of the Suez Canal?                             [3 marks]

              Britain, France and Israel all felt threatened by the nationalization of the Suez Canal
              – candidates should mention all three or explain in detail how one of these countries
              felt threatened;
              Britain, France and Israel initiated a plan of action against Egypt, but they did not
              consult the US;
              The Soviet Union saw these countries as “aggressors” and threatened to intervene to
              defend Egypt and also wanted the US to be part of a joint operation against Britain,
              France and Israel;
              The US rejected this proposal and wanted to stop the nationalization by appealing to
              the UN to apply sanctions.

            Award [1 mark] for each relevant point up to a maximum of [3 marks].

      (b)   What is the message conveyed by Source E?                                     [2 marks]

              Britain has lost control of the situation in the Middle East;
              The US and the USSR are competing in an attempt to bring the situation back under
              control;
              Khruschchev is dressed in Arab clothes which suggest that he is a supporter of the
              Arab world and Eisenhower as a cowboy;
              The cartoon suggests that the Middle East has now become a Cold War issue.

            Award [1 mark] for each valid point up to a maximum of [2 marks].

     Do not enter half marks or + and – but compensate between (a) and (b) if necessary for a
     final mark out of [5 marks].
                                            –4–        M11/3/HISTX/BP1/ENG/TZ0/XX/S2/M



2.   Compare and contrast the views expressed in Sources B and D about the
     Suez Crisis.                                                                   [6 marks]

     For “compare”
       Both sources agree that the source of the problem was the nationalization of the canal;
       Both sources agree that measures had to be taken in order to solve the crisis;
       Both sources agreed that vital interests are in danger;
       Both sources mention the traditional friendship between the United States and
       Great Britain;
       Both sources mention that the use of force as a mechanism to solve the crisis
       was considered.

     For “contrast”
       Source B is asking for US alignment and D is stating that the US did not approve;
       B shows Britain consulting US while D says “The US was not consulted in any way about
       any phase”;
       D mentions the UN while B makes no reference to any role the UN could have played to
       prevent the crisis;
       B shows friendly relations between US and Britain while D is very critical of the use of
       force as well as the veto of France and Britain.

     Do not demand all of the above. If only one source is discussed award a maximum
     of [2 marks]. If the two sources are discussed separately award [3 marks] or with
     excellent linkage [4–5 marks]. For maximum [6 marks] expect a detailed running
     comparison/contrast.

3.   With reference to their origin and purpose, assess the value and limitations
     of Source A and Source C for historians studying the Suez Crisis of 1956.            [6 marks]

     Source A
     Origin:          It is an extract from a book, A History of the Arab–Israeli Conflict, written
                      by Ian J Bickerton and Carla L Klausner published in 2007.

     Purpose:         It is an educational textbook which aims at analysing the history of the
                      conflict between Arabs and Israelis.

     Value:           The fact that it was published in 2007 gives the treatment of the Suez Crisis
                      the benefit of hindsight. As a book on the History of the Arab–Israeli
                      conflict, it puts the Suez Crisis into its historical context and contributes to
                      its understanding.

     Limitations:     As it is a general history book on the History of the Arab–Israeli conflict, it
                      may have limited detail on the Suez Crisis.

     Source C
     Origins:         It is an extract from a book on Eisenhower and the Suez Crisis of 1956,
                      written by Cole C Kingseed in 1995.

     Purpose:         To analyse Eisenhower’s performance during the Suez Crisis.

     Value:           The book is a study of Eisenhower’s role in the Suez Crisis, so detailed
                      analysis can be expected. Published in 1995, it enabled the author to look at
                      the crisis in hindsight.

     Limitations:     The specific focus on Eisenhower’s role may suggest that information about
                      the role and the significance of other politicians or countries may not be
                      fully developed.

     Do not expect all of the above. Ideally there will be a balance between the two sources, and
     each one can be marked out of [3 marks], but allow a [4/2 marks] split. If only one source is
     assessed, mark out of [4 marks]. For a maximum of [6 marks] candidates must refer to both
     origin and purpose, and value and limitations.

4.   Using the sources and your own knowledge, evaluate the role played by
     the United States in the Suez Crisis of 1956.                                     [8 marks]

     Source material
     Source A:    Indicates that the United States was playing a significant role in the Middle
                  East by trying to neutralize the Arab–Israeli conflict. It wanted to protect the
                  oil supplies and contain Communism. However, the decision not to sell arms
                  by John Foster Dulles precipitated the crisis by withdrawing US support for the
                  Aswan Dam which provided the opportunity for the Soviet Union to step into
                  the Middle East.

     Source B:     Shows that Eden was trying to persuade US to align policies with Britain and
                   France. This shows that US was considered to be important for the resolution
                   of the conflict.

     Source C:     Argues that the United States’ decision to take the matter to the United Nations
                   came as a result of Eisenhower’s sense of betrayal of the US by her allies, and
                   also as a need to prove to them and the Soviet Union, the power that the US
                   had in the world.

     Source D:     Maintains that the appeal to the General Assembly was a way to show US
                   power and to end the crisis by peaceful means.

     Source E:     Portrays the US as trying to intervene in the Middle East to prevent the USSR
                   taking control as Britain under Eden is left behind.

     Own knowledge
     Other issues that had an influence on US involvement in the Suez Crisis might include the
     Baghdad Pact, the Hungarian Revolution, (23 October to 10 November 1956), the USSR and
     “peaceful coexistence” and United States’ domestic concerns (campaign for re-election,
     outrage at the invasion). Similarly candidates might make mention of Dulles’ “northern tier”
     policy, which aimed at containing Soviet influence in the Middle East and the effect this had
     on the US’s involvement. Eisenhower was against the British and French decision to use
     force. He realised that US military intervention on the side of Britain, France and Israel
     would have alienated the Arab world. It could also have led to the risk of Soviet military
     action and a major conflict. Other US actions such as imposing oil sanctions, gaining Soviet
     support in the United Nations and threatening ejections from NATO, all helped to resolve the
     crisis. The US was also a key participant in the peace settlement and the creation of the
     UNEF.

     Do not expect all of the above, and credit other relevant material. If only source material or
     only own knowledge is used, the maximum mark that can be obtained is [5 marks].
     For maximum [8 marks], expect argument, synthesis of source material and own knowledge,
     as well as references to the sources used.
