1.    (a)   What, according to Source B, was the significance of the 1930 London
            Naval Conference?                                                              [3 marks]

              It was the apex of the naval arms race control process;
              Parity (equality) between America and Britain was agreed to for every type of
              warship;
              Japan had accepted a smaller ratio for every category except submarines;
              Although it did not last, it marked a considerable success in the disarmament process;
              When the French and the Italians did not sign the treaty Britain inserted a clause that
              would allow it to withdraw.

      Award [1 mark] for each relevant point up to a maximum of [3 marks].


      (b)   What is the message conveyed by Source C?                                      [2 marks]

              The cartoon shows the lack of enthusiasm of Italy and France for the Conference.
              It also shows the hostility between them, as their leaders are pictured looking at one
              another suspiciously across a table;
              It shows good relations between Great Britain and the US who are portrayed arm in
              arm and demonstrating enthusiasm about the prospects of disarmament;
              The fact that Britain and the US are standing could also be interpreted as an
              indication of them taking a lead in disarmament conferences.

      Award [1 mark] for each valid point up to a maximum of [2 marks].

Do not enter half marks or + and – but compensate between (a) and (b) if necessary for a final
mark out of [5 marks].

2.   Compare and contrast the views expressed in Sources D and E about the
     London Naval Conference.                                                      [6 marks]

     For “compare”
       They both make criticisms of the London Naval Agreement of 1930;
       Both recognise strains in the relations between France and Italy;
       Both consider the Treaty to have limited duration.

     For “contrast”
       Source E is more critical of the agreement than Source D;
       Source D addresses some of the reasons why the agreement was made possible; Source E
       only focuses on effects;
       Source E focuses on how the agreement could affect Britain in a negative way; Source D
       offers a more general perspective of the effects;
       Source E mentions tension between the US and Japan; Source D makes no reference to
       this.

      Do not demand all of the above. If only one source is discussed award a maximum
      of [2 marks]. If the two sources are discussed separately award [3 marks] or with
      excellent linkage [4–5 marks]. For maximum [6 marks] expect a detailed running
      comparison/contrast.

3.   With reference to their origin and purpose, assess the value and limitations
     of Source A and Source B for historians studying the 1930 London Naval
     Conference.                                                                         [6 marks]

     Source A
     Origin:        Statement by US president Herbert Hoover at a press conference on 22 July
                    1930.

     Purpose:       To inform that the US government is signing the treaty on that day. To explain
                    why the US government is supporting the treaty.

     Value:         It’s an official communication recorded at the time the treaty was made and
                    shows the views of the president of the United States on the significance of the
                    Naval Treaty. This speech offers the rationale of the US government’s public
                    position at this point in time.

     Limitations:   As a statement to the press, the speech could be serving the purpose of
                    justifying US foreign policy before opposition to the government and before
                    public opinion.

     Source B
     Origin:        Extract from a book written by Phillips Payson O’ Brien an academic in the
                    UK published 1998.

     Purpose:       To analyse the naval policies of Britain and the US between 1900 and 1936.

     Value:         The academic background of the author. The fact that the book was published
                    many years after the conference enabled the author to look at events with
                    hindsight and produce an assessment of the Naval Conference.

     Limitations:   The title of the book suggests that the focus is only on US and British naval
                    policies, so the information about France, Italy and Japan may not be fully
                    developed.

     Do not expect all of the above. Ideally there will be a balance between the two sources,
     and each one can be marked out of [3 marks], but allow a [4/2 marks] split. If only one
     source is assessed, mark out of [4 marks]. For a maximum of [6 marks] candidates must refer
     to both origin and purpose, and value and limitations.

4.   Using the sources and your own knowledge, discuss the extent to which you
     agree with the view that the London Naval Conference was unsuccessful.               [8 marks]

     Source material
     Source A:    The source believes that the conference was a success as it produced a treaty
                  that would improve international relations by limiting armaments.

     Source B:     The source acknowledges achievements in the negotiations (parity between
                   America and Britain; Japanese acceptance of a smaller ratio). However, it also
                   states that “No ships were scrapped and naval construction increased markedly
                   after the conference”. It mentions that the British would need more cruisers
                   after 1935 and had included a clause allowing them to withdraw, which
                   indicates uncertainty about the Conference’s success.

     Source C:     The source shows that even before the conference had taken place, there was
                   suspicion and lack of enthusiasm among participants. It portrays the tense
                   relations between France and Italy over naval disarmament. Only Britain and
                   the US seem to have reasons to celebrate the conference.

     Source D:     The source refers to the rivalry between France and Italy and how it affected
                   negotiations over naval disarmament. It also mentions the fact that the Treaty
                   could not be extended nor maintained and was a product of very particular
                   circumstances rather than political will to achieve disarmament.

     Source E:     The source is very critical of the conference. It considers that it had a negative
                   impact on British naval defence, and that it damaged relations between France
                   and Italy as well as those between the US and Japan. It mentions that the
                   conference’s terms had a limited duration and that negotiations would be more
                   difficult in 1935. It believes Britain would be in a weaker position to negotiate
                   at that time.

     Own knowledge
     Relative successes: Some level of agreement was reached, such as a 10:10:7 ratio between
     the US, Britain and Japan; an agreement not to build capital ship replacements between 1931
     and 1936 was reached; negotiations in areas such as the size and numbers of vessels each
     nation was allowed to have shown some success; the treaty also set some restrictions on
     submarine warfare; also the funds which were saved by the governments could be used to
     contribute to other areas of their economies affected by the Great Depression.

     Failures: The impact of the treaty on Japanese politics contributed to increased nationalism
     and militarism which eventually led to the withdrawal of Japan from the naval disarmament
     system; the failure of further negotiations between Italy and France; the treaty allowed
     escalation of weapons if there was an act of aggression by a non-signatory country; and
     further details on the negative impact of the treaty on the British Navy. The Anglo–German
     Naval Agreement (1935) also indicates the limited success of the treaty.

     Do not expect all of the above, and accept other relevant material. If only source material
     or only own knowledge is used, the maximum mark that can be obtained is [5 marks].
     For maximum [8 marks] expect argument, synthesis of source material and own knowledge,
     as well as references to the sources used.
