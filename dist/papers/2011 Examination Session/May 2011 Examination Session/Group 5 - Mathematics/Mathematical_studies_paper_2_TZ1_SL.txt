Please start each question on a new page. You are advised to show all working, where possible. Where an
answer is wrong, some marks may be given for correct method, provided this is shown by written working.
Solutions found from a graphic display calculator should be supported by suitable working, e.g. if graphs
are used to find a solution, you should sketch these as part of your answer.

      The heat output in thermal units from burning 1 kg of wood changes according to
      the wood’s percentage moisture content. The moisture content and heat output of
      10 blocks of the same type of wood each weighing 1 kg were measured. These are
      shown in the table.
