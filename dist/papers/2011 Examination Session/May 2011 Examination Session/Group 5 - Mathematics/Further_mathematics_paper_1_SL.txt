Full marks are not necessarily awarded for a correct answer with no working. Answers must be supported
by working and/or explanations. In particular, solutions found from a graphic display calculator should be
supported by suitable working, e.g. if graphs are used to find a solution, you should sketch these as part of
your answer. Where an answer is incorrect, some marks may be given for a correct method, provided this
is shown by written working. You are therefore advised to show all working.

      (a)   Bottles of iced tea are supposed to contain 500 ml. A random sample of 8 bottles
            was selected and the volumes measured (in ml) were as follows:

                         497.2 , 502.0 , 501.0 , 498.6 , 496.3 , 499.1, 500.1, 497.7 .

		          (i)    Calculate unbiased estimates of the mean and variance.

		          (ii)   Test at the 5 % significance level the null hypothesis H 0 : µ = 500 against
                   the alternative hypothesis H1 : µ < 500 .                                      [5 marks]

      The rectangle ABCD is inscribed in a circle. Sides [AD] and [AB] have lengths 3 cm
      and 9 cm respectively. E is a point on side [AB] such that AE is 3 cm. Side [DE] is
      produced to meet the circumcircle of ABCD at point P. Use Ptolemy’s theorem to
      calculate the length of chord [AP].
