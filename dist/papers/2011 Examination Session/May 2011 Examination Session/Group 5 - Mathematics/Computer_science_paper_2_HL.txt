                         Seat A0                                      Seat B9

      A program has been written that allocates seats to passengers.   In the program,
      the details for each seat are stored as a  Seat object.   The  Seat class is partly
      defined below.

      public class Seat
      {
        private String seatName;      // e.g. "A0"
        private String passengerName; // e.g. "Jones" if reserved or
                                      // null if not reserved

            public Seat       // constructor is incomplete

            // accessor methods
            public String getPassengerName() { return passengerName; }
            public String getSeatName()      { return seatName; }

            // transformer methods
            public void setPassengerName(String p) { passengerName = p; }
            public void setSeatName(String s)      { seatName = s; }
      }

      The two class variables are declared as  private.

      (a)     Explain the feature of object-oriented programming (OOP) that can be
              implemented when class variables are declared as  private.                          [3 marks]

      (b)     Complete the constructor for the  Seat class (started above), that would allow a
              seat name and passenger name to be assigned to a  Seat object.                      [3 marks]




                                                             (This question continues on the following page)

(Question 1 continued)

      The class that manages the allocation of seats to the various passengers is called
      SeatManager.   The  SeatManager class, which uses objects of the  Seat class,
      is partially shown below.

      public class SeatManager
      {
        ...seatArray... // seatArray is a two-dimensional array variable
                        // used to store details of all of the seats

            public int seatsRemaining()            // returns the number of empty seats
            {}

            public String freeWindowSeat() // defined in part (e) below
            {}
      }

      (c)     Describe fully the two-dimensional array  seatArray which will be used to
              store the seat names and passenger names of all of the seats.                      [3 marks]

      As shown in the diagram, the airplane numbers its rows from 0 to 9.  Each row contains
      4 seats labelled A, B, C and D.  Each seat can be identified by a letter and a number
      (e.g. “A0”).

      (d)     By making use of nested loops and the array variable  seatArray, construct the
              method  seatsRemaining() that will return the number of seats that have not
              yet been allocated.                                                                [5 marks]

      Window seats are those that are labelled “A” or “D”.

      (e)     Construct a method that would return the  seatName of a window seat that is
              available (has not already been allocated), or a suitable message if all windows
              seats have already been allocated.                                                 [4 marks]

      A larger airplane has two levels (upper and lower) containing seats for the passengers.

      (f)     Suggest one way in which the data structure described in part (c) could be
              changed or modified to allow for this.                                             [2 marks]

                                                     –4–                  M11/5/COMSC/HP2/ENG/TZ0/XX

2.    An unordered file contains records storing the names and year of birth of different
      people.

      For example:
                           Molina, 1932; Lakhi, 1910; Arthurs, 1962; …

      To print out the names in order of year of birth, the records are first read one by one
      into a linked list, so that the list is always correctly sorted in ascending order of year.

      (a)     By using a diagram, construct the linked list after the 3 records shown above
              have been read in.                                                                    [2 marks]

      (b)     Explain, with the aid of a diagram, how the node  Guy, 1915 would now be added
              to the list.                                                                          [2 marks]

      The class  Node, shown below, allows for new nodes to be created for the linked list.

      public class Node
      {
        public String name;
        public int yearOfBirth;
        public Node next;       // points to the next node in the list
                               // or to null if there is not one

            public Node(String x, int y, Node z)                   // constructor
            {
              this.name = x;
              this.yearOfBirth = y;
              this.next = z;
            }
      }

      (c)     Explain how a new  Node  object with the following data would be created.

                                           name: Xiao
                                           yearOfBirth: 1920
                                           next: null                                               [2 marks]




                                                              (This question continues on the following page)

(Question 2 continued)

      The class  ListManager contains methods that manage the list.  The class is partially
      shown below.

      public class ListManager
      {
        private Node first; // points to the first node in the linked list

            // the method addNode() adds a node to the correct position in
            // the list so that the list remains sorted
            public void addNode(String name, int year)
            {
              // lines of code missing
            }

            // the method removeLeast() removes the first node in the list
            public void removeLeast()
            {
              // lines of code missing
            }
      }

      (d)     Construct the method  removeLeast() that has been started above.                [2 marks]

      (e)     Construct the method  addNode() that has been started above.                    [8 marks]

      (f)     Analyse the BigO efficiency of

              (i)    the  removeLeast() method;                                               [2 marks]

              (ii)   the  addNode() method.                                                   [2 marks]

3.    A very large file containing employee data, which is principally used for reference,
      is stored on disk.  The program that manages this file allows a particular record to be
      searched for.  The key field is the ID number of each person.

      Various methods of file organization are being considered.

      (a)   (i)    Outline the steps required to display the required record if the file
                   organization was  sequential.                                                   [2 marks]

            (ii)   Explain why it would be impractical to store this data as a sequential file.    [2 marks]

      An alternative is  direct access file organization.

      (b)   (i)    Explain how a  hashing algorithm can be used to locate the required record
                   on disk.                                                                        [4 marks]

            (ii)   State three requirements of a well designed hashing algorithm.                  [3 marks]

      It is decided to allow the user to search for a record by more than one field
      (e.g. the person’s surname as well as the ID number).

      (c)   (i)    Explain why directly using a hashing algorithm now becomes impractical.         [2 marks]

            (ii)   Explain how indexing the file can allow searching by more than one field.       [3 marks]

      Each index will be read into a data structure in the memory.

      (d)   (i)    Suggest reasons why a  dynamic data structure might be used instead of a
                   static data structure.                                                          [2 marks]

            (ii)   Explain why a  binary search tree would be preferred to a  linked list as the
                   dynamic data structure.                                                         [2 marks]

4.    This question requires the use of the case study.

      (a)   With reference to the diagram on page 3 of the case study, explain the advantage
            of networking the Air Traffic Control (ATC) system with the Flight Information
            Display System (FIDS).                                                                [2 marks]

      (b)   (i)    Identify one communication medium which would be used to connect
                   different parts of the airport network.                                         [1 mark]

            (ii)   Suggest reasons for the communication medium identified in part (i).           [2 marks]

      (c)   Describe a suitable security measure that could confirm the identity of employees
            as they pass through the various sections of the airport.                             [2 marks]

      (d)   Describe two features related to computer systems found inside a modern airport
            that improve the passenger experience.                                                [4 marks]

      (e)   A modern airport relies on highly computerized systems.  By making reference
            to one area of airport operation, discuss how this can be both an advantage and
            a disadvantage for the traveller.                                                     [5 marks]

      (f)   Suggest how tagging passengers inside an airport could

            (i)    improve airport security;                                                      [2 marks]

            (ii)   help the airlines maintain their schedules.                                    [2 marks]

      (g)   (i)    With reference to the baggage system on page 9 of the case study,
                   suggest two ways in which the use of computer simulation in the
                   development of the baggage system would have been beneficial to the
                   design team.                                                                   [4 marks]

            (ii)   Explain why maintenance is an important part of the system design cycle.       [3 marks]

      (h)   Explain why encryption should be an important feature of Wi-Fi hotspots.              [3 marks]

      The passenger list for each flight would initially be stored in order of time of booking.

      (i)   Explain how a binary tree could be used to display all passenger details in
            alphabetical order of passenger surnames, without storing all of the passenger
            information in the main memory.                                                       [4 marks]
