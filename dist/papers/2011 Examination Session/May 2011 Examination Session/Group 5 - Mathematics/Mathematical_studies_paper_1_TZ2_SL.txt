12.   A manufacturer in England makes 16  000 garden statues. 12 % are defective and
      cannot be sold.

      The manufacturer sells each non-defective statue for 5.25 British pounds (GBP)
      to an American company. The exchange rate from GBP to US dollars (USD)
      is 1 GBP = 1.6407 USD .

            non-defective statues. Give your answer correct to two decimal places.                            [2 marks]

      The American company sells one of the statues to an Australian customer for 12 USD.
      The exchange rate from Australian dollars (AUD) to USD is 1 AUD = 0.8739 USD .
