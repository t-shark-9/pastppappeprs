                                                SECTION B

Answer all the questions.

10.   A college issues student ID cards that contain a magnetic strip. These cards can be
      used in the college cafeteria to purchase meals.

      There is a card reader in the cafeteria which is connected to a server via a local area
      network (LAN).

      (a)   Define the term LAN.                                                                   [1 mark]

      The purchase of a meal requires two transactions with the server.

      • Before a meal is chosen, the card is read and the account balance is displayed.
        If the account has a negative balance no meal will be allowed. Otherwise the
        student chooses a meal.

      • After the student has chosen a meal, the cashier enters the cost of the meal which is
        deducted from the account (which may become negative).

      (b)   Identify the processes that take place in the server for both transactions.            [5 marks]

      (c)   Discuss two possible improvements to the system.                                       [4 marks]


11.   A children’s hospital has decided to provide Internet facilities to its long-term patients
      to support their education during medical treatment.

      Two schools have offered to support this initiative. School A will allow access to
      class work stored on files. School B will provide classes where pupils in hospital can
      interact in real-time with those in the school.

      (a)   Identify two additional input devices that would be required for School B’s
            approach.                                                                              [2 marks]

      (b)   Compare the advantages of School A’s approach and School B’s approach for
            the patients.                                                                          [4 marks]

      (c)   Discuss the social implications of implementing this educational project
            in hospitals.                                                                          [4 marks]

12.   Consider the following method.

      public static boolean whatPropertyIsIt(String s)
      {
        int i = 0;
        int j = s.length() – 1;

            while (i < j)
            {
              if (s.charAt(i) != s.charAt(j))
              { return false; }
              i = i + 1;
              j = j – 1;
            }
            return true;
      }

      Note that s.charAt(i) is the character in the ith position of String s.
      For example, where s is the string “abcde”, s.charAt(2) is the character ‘c’.

      (a)     By copying and completing the following table, trace the method for the call
              whatPropertyIsIt("xyzdyx").                                                    [4 marks]

                  i        j     i < j s.charAt(i) != s.charAt(j) return value
                  0        5      true            false




      (b)     Identify the purpose of this program.                                           [1 mark]

      (c)     Identify the termination conditions for the loop.                              [2 marks]

      (d)     Explain the effect of changing the condition in the while loop to i <= j.      [3 marks]

13.   A business is considering computerizing its operations and has employed a team of
      system analysts to investigate possible solutions. The first task of this team is to
      clearly define the problem.

      (a)   Outline the benefits of two methods of data collection that will help them to
            clearly define the problem.                                                      [4 marks]

      Once the problem is defined, the analysis team will produce different types of
      documentation.

      (b)   Outline the documentation that would be presented to

		(i)            the business;                                                               [2 marks]

		(ii)           the design team.                                                            [2 marks]

      (c)   Outline one additional piece of documentation that would be produced after the
            analysis stage.                                                                  [2 marks]
