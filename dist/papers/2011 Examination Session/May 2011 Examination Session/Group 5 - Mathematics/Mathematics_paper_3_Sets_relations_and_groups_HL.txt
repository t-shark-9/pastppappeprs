Please start each question on a new page. Full marks are not necessarily awarded for a correct answer with
no working. Answers must be supported by working and/or explanations. In particular, solutions found
from a graphic display calculator should be supported by suitable working, e.g. if graphs are used to find
a solution, you should sketch these as part of your answer. Where an answer is incorrect, some marks may
be given for a correct method, provided this is shown by written working. You are therefore advised to show
all working.

      The universal set contains all the positive integers less than 30. The set A contains
      all prime numbers less than 30 and the set B contains all positive integers of the form
      3 + 5n (n ∈ ) that are less than 30. Determine the elements of

      (a)   Given that p , q and r are elements of a group, prove the left-cancellation rule,
            i.e. pq = pr ⇒ q = r .

		          Your solution should indicate which group axiom is used at each stage of
            the proof.                                                                                 [4 marks]

            the identity element e .

		          (i)    Giving a reason in each case, explain why ab cannot equal a or b .

		          (ii)   Given that c is self inverse, determine the two possible Cayley tables for G .

                  is isomorphic to the group defined by the set {1, − 1, i , − i} under
                  multiplication of complex numbers. Your solution should include a
                  correspondence between a , b , c , e and 1, − 1, i , − i .                          [10 marks]
