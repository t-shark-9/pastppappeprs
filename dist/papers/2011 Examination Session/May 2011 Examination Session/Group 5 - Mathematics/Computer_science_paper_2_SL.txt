Answer all the questions.

1.    The following integer array sales[] gives the sales figures for 6 salespersons for
      one month.  The salespersons are identified with an ID number from 0 to 5.
                      0          1         2          3           4          5

      (a)   State the sales for salesperson with ID 3 for this month.                              [1 mark]

      (b)   Construct the code fragment started below, that outputs the highest number
            of sales.

            int bestSales = 0;
            for (...
            {
              // lines of code missing
            }
            output("Best sales = " + bestSales);                                                   [3 marks]

      (c)   Construct a modified algorithm to output the ID of the salesperson with the
            highest number of sales.                                                               [2 marks]

      Sales figures for an entire year are stored in the two-dimensional integer
      array  theYearSales[][], with one row for each month and one column for
      each salesperson.
                          0          1         2          3           4          5

      were 875 as represented in  theYearSales[2][3].

      (d)   State the sales by salesperson with ID 4 in February.                                  [1 mark]

(Question 1 continued)

      (e)   Construct the method started below that returns the total sales for the year for a
            given salesperson’s ID.

            public int totalSales(int id)

              // lines of code missing

                return tot;

      (f)   By making use of the  totalSales() method from part (e), construct the
            method  bestSalesperson() that returns the ID of any salesperson with the
            highest sales for the year.                                                          [6 marks]

2.    A program has been written for the purpose of processing data about cities and
      producing a national survey.

      For each city, the following data is stored:
      • name
      • area in km2
      • population.

      The following class  City has been devised for this purpose.

      class City
      {
        public String name;
        public double area;
        public int population;

            public City(String n, double a, int p)                // constructor
            {
              // lines of code missing
            }

            // other methods are available here
      }

      (a)     Outline the difference between the data types  int and  double.                      [2 marks]

      (b)     With reference to the class defined above, explain the importance of making the
              constructor  public.                                                                 [2 marks]

      (c)     A  City object can be created as shown below.

                           City c1 = new City("Cardiff", 75, 300000);

              Explain what happens when the line above is executed.                                [3 marks]

      (d)     State the value of the data item  c1.name.                                           [1 mark]

      (e)     (i)    Describe an efficient way of creating 100 objects of class  City, that need
                     to be adequately stored for further processing.                               [2 marks]

              (ii)   Construct the method that returns the name of the city with the
                     highest population.                                                           [4 marks]

      (f)     The 100  City objects are to be sorted into ascending order of population,
              using a bubble sort algorithm.  Without writing code, outline the steps needed to
              sort the objects.                                                                    [6 marks]

            of networking the Air Traffic Control (ATC) system with the Flight Information
            Display System (FIDS).                                                              [2 marks]

      (b)   (i)    Identify one communication medium which would be used to connect
                   different parts of the airport network.                                      [1 mark]

            (ii)   Suggest reasons for the communication medium identified in part (i).         [2 marks]

      (c)   Describe a suitable security measure that could confirm the identity of employees
            as they pass through the various sections of the airport.                           [2 marks]

      (d)   Describe two features related to computer systems found inside a modern airport
            that improve the passenger experience.                                              [4 marks]

      (e)   A modern airport relies on highly computerized systems.  By making reference
            to one area of airport operation, discuss how this can be both an advantage and
            a disadvantage for the traveller.                                                   [5 marks]

      (f)   Suggest how tagging passengers inside an airport could

            (i)    improve airport security;                                                    [2 marks]

                   suggest two ways in which the use of computer simulation in the
                   development of the baggage system would have been beneficial to the
                   design team.                                                                 [4 marks]
