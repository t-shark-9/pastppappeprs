Write a commentary on one of the following:

1.

                  Now it’s June, and night is brief as the brush of a wing, only an hour of yellow stars in a sky
            that never darkens beyond deep, tender blue.
                  No one sleeps. Crowds surge out of cafés and wander the streets, not caring where they go
            as long as they can lift their faces and drink the light. It’s been dark for so many months.
      5           A line of young men, arm in arm, drunk, stern with the effort of keeping on their feet,
            sways on the corner of Universitetskaya Embankment and Lieutenant Schmidt’s bridge.
            They won’t go home. They can’t bear to part from one another. They’ll walk, that’s what
            they’ll do, from one end of the city to another, from island to island, across stone bridges and
            shining water.
     10           These are the nights that seal each generation of Leningraders1 to their city. These nights
            are their baptism. The summer light will flood every grain of Leningrad stone, as it floods every
            cell of their own bodies. At three o’clock in the morning, in full sun, they’ll find themselves
            in some backstreet of little wooden houses, miles from anywhere. There’ll be a cat licking its
            paws in a doorway, a lime tree with electric-green leaves hanging over a high wooden fence,
     15     and an old woman slowly making her way down the street with a little bunch of jasmine
            pinned to her jacket. Each flower will be as white and distinct as a star against the shabby grey.
            And she’ll smile at the young men as if she’s their grandmother. She won’t disapprove of their
            drunkenness, their shouting and singing. She’ll understand exactly how they feel.
                  However old you are, you can’t stay indoors on a night like this. It stirs again, the promise
     20     and recklessness of white nights. Peter’s icy, blood-sodden marshes bear up the city like a swan.
            The swan’s wings are still folded, but they are trembling in the summer light, stirring, and getting
            ready to fly. Darkness scarcely touches them.
                  The wind breathes softly. Water laps under the midnight bridges. And suddenly you
            know that there’s no greater possible happiness than to be here, even when you’re so old you’re
     25     beyond walking. You lean out of your apartment window, with stiff joints and fading strength,
            over the city that will outlive you.

                  But Anna is not in Leningrad tonight. She’s out in the country, at the dacha2, alone with
            her father and Kolya. She doesn’t belong in the crowds of students celebrating the end of their
            examinations. She doesn’t share the jokes any more, or know which books everyone’s reading.
     30     Hers is a daylight city of trams packed with overworked mothers, racing from work to food
            queue to kitchen and back again.
                  The white nights rouse up too many longings. Anna has a duty to crush them. She has
            five-year-old Kolya, her job at the nursery, and her responsibilities. It’s no good letting herself
            dream of student life. She’ll never have long days in a studio, mind and body trained on the
     35     movement of hand across paper. It’s no good remembering what it was like to be seventeen,
            only six years ago, with graduation from school a year ahead of her, and a crowd of friends
            round the table at the Europe, packed together, laughing and talking so loudly that you could
            hardly hear what anyone said. The words didn’t matter. The noise of happiness was what
            mattered, and the warmth of someone else’s arm pressed against yours. There was a smell of
     40     sunburnt skin, coffee, cigarettes and marigolds.

                  Don’t think about all that. She’s at the dacha, leaning out of the window and resting her
            elbows on warm, silver-grey wood. It’s very quiet. Behind her, Kolya sleeps in his cot-bed.
            They have a bedroom divided in two by a plywood partition. One half for her father, the other for
            Anna and Kolya. Downstairs, the living-room opens on to the verandah. Every sound echoes in
   45       the dacha’s wooden shell.

                                                 Wife Hits Moose

                             Sometime around dusk moose lifts
                             his heavy, primordial jaw, dripping, from pondwater
                             and, without psychic struggle,
                             decides the day, for him, is done: time
                         5   to go somewhere else. Meanwhile, wife
                             drives one of those roads that cut straight north,
                             a highway dividing the forests

                             not yet fat enough for the paper companies.
                             This time of year full dark falls
                       10    about eight o’clock – pineforest and blacktop
                             blend. Moose reaches road, fails
                             to look both ways, steps
                             deliberately, ponderously … Wife
                             hits moose, hard,

                       15    at a slight angle (brakes slammed, car
                             spinning) and moose rolls over hood, antlers –
                             as if diamond-tipped – scratch windshield, car
                             damaged: rib-of-moose imprint
                             on fender, hoof shatters headlight.
                       20    Annoyed moose lands on feet and walks away.
                             Wife is shaken, unhurt, amazed.

                             – Does moose believe in a Supreme Intelligence?
                             Speaker does not know.
                             – Does wife believe in a Supreme Intelligence?
                       25    Speaker assumes as much: spiritual intimacies
                             being between the spirit and the human.
                             – Does speaker believe in a Supreme Intelligence?
                             Yes. Thank You.

                                                                    Thomas Lux, New and Selected Poems (1997)

      – How is the accident presented in the first three stanzas?

      – How do form and structure support the poem’s meaning?

      – Consider the relationship between moose, wife and speaker.
