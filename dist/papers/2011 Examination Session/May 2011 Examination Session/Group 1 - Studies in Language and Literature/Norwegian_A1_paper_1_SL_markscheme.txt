Provisional marking

During the early period of your marking your team leader (or principal examiner in the case
of team leaders) will contact you to discuss the standard of marking and the interpretation
of the marking notes. Before this discussion, it is necessary to have marked provisionally
(in pencil) about ten scripts.

If your team leader has failed to make contact with you, please try to make contact with
him or her yourself, by phone or e-mail. Owing to work commitments and differences
between time zones it is often difficult for team leaders to make contact with all examiners in
their teams.

                                  ASSESSMENT CRITERIA
Criteria A and B

The danger of rewarding or penalizing the use of illustrations/references/quotations twice in both
these categories should be avoided.

Criterion B

The passages offer candidates a variety of possibilities for analysis and interpretation. The test of
any interpretation is that it has to be tied carefully to the words, images and relevant details of
the text. “Personal response”, in the same way, must be tied to the passage.

Criterion C

“Awareness” and “appreciation” of literary features are the key elements under this criterion.
The mere labelling, without appreciation, of literary features will not score the highest marks.
On the other hand, the candidate who is attentive to literary features and deals with them in a
meaningful way, but who does not consistently use the vocabulary of literary criticism, can still be
awarded the higher achievement levels.

Reminder: The term “literary features” is broad and includes elements as basic as plot, character, etc.,
attention to which is valid and must be rewarded as appropriate.

Criterion D

Any form of structuring to the commentary will be rewarded if it is effective and appropriate.
Different conventions are in operation and therefore all approaches (including the line by line
analysis) are acceptable and will be judged on the basis of their effectiveness. Examiners should
remember that structure does not exist by itself, but any structure must be measured by appropriate
references to the passage or poem and by its capacity to integrate these towards the development of
an organized and coherent commentary.

Reminder: In this criterion, supporting examples must be evaluated in terms of how fluently they
are incorporated/integrated to shape/advance the argument, not in terms of their appropriateness
or accuracy.

Criterion E
If you have reservations about awarding a four, you should ensure that these are well founded
before awarding a three. The breadth of achievement in level three sometimes makes examiners
reluctant to award four.
Use judgment when dealing with lapses in grammar, spelling and punctuation; therefore do not
unduly penalize.
Mechanical accuracy is only a part of this criterion.         Ensure that all the other elements are
considered.
Examiners should be careful to avoid being prejudiced in their application of this criterion by
achievement levels in other criteria. It is possible to score highly on this criterion even if candidates
have scored in the lower levels on the other criteria, and vice versa.


These notes to examiners are intended only as guidelines to assist marking and as a supplement to
the published external assessment criteria for written paper 1. They are not offered as an exhaustive
and fixed set of responses or approaches to which all answers must rigidly adhere. Good ideas or
angles not offered here should be acknowledged and rewarded as appropriate. Similarly, answers
which do not include all the ideas or approaches suggested here may still be very good responses.
Of course, some of the points listed below will appear in weaker papers, but are unlikely to
be developed.

The following elements are particularly relevant to criteria A, B and C.
Question 1. Prose
A barely satisfactory answer will describe the incident in the text (that Madness personified
knocks on the main character’s door). Furthermore, the candidate will identify the personal
relationship between the main character and the Madness, and to some extent describe
this relationship. The candidate will, in one way or another, comment on the flowers that
Madness brings, but not necessarily use correct vocabulary for literary analysis.
A better answer will describe the plot more thoroughly and in a more satisfactory manner.
The candidate will also explicitly mention that Madness is personified in this realistic text, and say
something about what this has to say for the meaning of the text as a whole. The candidate should
also say something about the sober language in the text. The candidate will not necessarily use
correct vocabulary for literary analysis, but will demonstrate adequate understanding of the author’s
use of literary devices.
The best answers will independently identify many of the literary devices in the text (what the
flowers and the bee imply) and use well chosen examples. Furthermore, the candidate will reflect
upon the effect these have on the reader. The candidate should, more or less, use correct concepts
for literary analysis in a way that shows their understanding of these devices. The best answers will
provide precise observations on the main features of the text based on a close reading of the text.
The candidate will also comment on the struggle between the two characters, and give an
interpretation of the ending in light of the text as a whole.
Please note: alternative interpretations of the prose passage may also be accepted and rewarded if
appropriate. For example, the character knocking at the door may be interpreted as a former
friend or lover and this incident may be linked to a former love affair.

Question 2. Poem

A barely satisfactory answer will identify the most important literary trope in the poem:
the metaphor, and describe the main theme of the poem – that we are using metaphors and idioms in
our daily lives to describe the world. The candidate must, in one way or another, comment on
the last and most complicated four lines, but will not necessarily use the correct vocabulary for
literary analysis.

A better answer will include the features above in addition to reflecting more independently on the
different metaphors in the poem. The candidate will also say something about the repetitions and
the rhythm in the poem and reflect over what this means to the text as a whole. Here the candidate
should say something about the form and structure of the text, i.e. that the poem may be split in to
four blocks, and also give an interpretation of the last four lines. The candidate will demonstrate an
adequate understanding of the author’s use of literary devices.

The best answers will include the features mentioned above. In addition the candidate will
comment on how the form and repetitions/rhythm influence the content. The candidate will also
give a plausible interpretation of the last four lines, and relate the “conclusion” of the poem to the
rest of the text. The best answers will also provide precise observations on the main features of the
text based on a close reading of the text.
