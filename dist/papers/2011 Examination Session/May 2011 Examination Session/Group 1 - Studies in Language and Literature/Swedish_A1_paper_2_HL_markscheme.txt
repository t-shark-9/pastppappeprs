All adequate to good answers must include some pertinent detail (described, paraphrased or
directly quoted) to support assertions and reveal knowledge of the texts studied. Relevant
discussion of literary features must appear in every response. Answers should demonstrate
some discernible form of organization and demonstration standard use of language.

Good to excellent answers must be grounded in the features demanded for “adequate”
answers. In going beyond those features, it may be in the ways described below as well as
in other, somewhat unpredictable ways which show individual thinking and an engaged,
well-supported address of the texts.

Drama

1.   An adequate to good answer will identify and describe whether or not the ending is happy
     or unhappy and, with some examples, show how it might be interpreted by the reader
     or audience.

     A good to excellent answer may additionally describe, with the support of carefully selected
     examples, the reader’s view of the ending and the evidence that may support its interpretation.


2.   An adequate to good answer will clearly identify the task the main character must complete
     and, with some examples, show how far they succeed in doing so.

     A good to excellent answer will show with greater precision, supported by well
     chosen examples, how the main character completes the task and what its significance is in
     the work as a whole.



Poetry

Note: Poems should be taken from the works of at least two poets.
If the candidate fails to use at least two poets, mark down two levels in criterion A,
Knowledge and Understanding of Works.

3.   An adequate to good answer will identify and show, with some examples, how the title of a
     poem influences our understanding of the poem as a whole.

     A good to excellent answer will additionally give pertinent and convincing examples showing
     how the title of a poem influences our understanding of the poem as a whole.


4.   An adequate to good answer will show, with some examples, clear awareness of the ways in
     which the chosen poets influence the emotions of the reader through the use of different
     literary techniques. Additionally they will highlight the effect this has on the reader’s
     interpretation of the poems.

     A good to excellent answer will, using carefully chosen examples, show with greater
     pertinence and precise analysis of the poets’ use of language the significance of the
     manipulation of the reader’s emotions.
                                                –4–           M11/1/A1SWE/HP2/SWE/TZ0/XX/M


Short Story

5.   An adequate to good answer will identify the narrative techniques used and give some
     examples showing what effect these have on the reader’s general impression and
     understanding of the works studied.

     A good to excellent answer will, with the use of carefully chosen examples, show deeper
     insight into the narrative techniques being used and their significance for the reader’s
     interpretation and understanding of the works as a whole.


6.   An adequate to good answer will be able to understand and explain, using examples,
     the meaning of the prompt and its significance in understanding the short stories studied.

     A good to excellent answer will show, with the use of carefully chosen examples, the different
     ways in which the subtle use of hint and suggestion shape the short story and determine
     its interpretation.



Novel

7.   An adequate to good answer will identify and describe the crisis and its effect on
     the character. They will go on to show, with the use of some examples, how their chosen
     authors use this.

     A good to excellent answer, with the use of well chosen examples, will clearly identify and
     show the significance of the crisis, how it is expressed and give detailed insight into the effect
     this has on their understanding of the works.


8.   An adequate to good answer will be able to identify and describe the setting and discuss
     whether or not it is more important or as important as the characters in the novel.

     A good to excellent answer will clearly show the use of setting and, with pertinent examples,
     precisely discuss its significance in relation to the characters.
                                                –5–           M11/1/A1SWE/HP2/SWE/TZ0/XX/M


General Questions on Literature

9.    An adequate to good answer will attempt to identify and define tragic and comic in the
      context of their chosen authors and show, with examples, the results of their combination in
      their chosen works.

      A good to excellent answer will define tragic and comic more precisely and show, with well
      chosen examples, deeper insight into the ways in which their combination is exploited by their
      chosen authors and to what effect.


10.   An adequate to good answer will identify, with examples, the ways the usual can be presented
      in a striking and unusual way. They will attempt to discuss the purpose and significance of
      the writers’ decision to do this.

      A good to excellent answer will, with thoughtfully analysed and pertinent examples, show
      how the usual is given greater significance when presented in an unusual way and show clear
      understanding of the significance and effects of this and the techniques used to achieve it.


11.   An adequate to good answer will agree or disagree with the question’s opening statement and
      show, with examples, the conflict and its role in the works studied.

      A good to excellent answer will additionally demonstrate, with pertinent examples,
      the candidate’s response to the question’s statement showing the significance of conflict in the
      works chosen or, conversely, the way in which features other than conflict can be seen to be
      central to a work.


12.   An adequate to good answer will give examples of repetition and attempt to explain its
      significance and function in their chosen works.

      A good to excellent answer will discuss the significance of repetition with deeper insight and
      highlight the different ways it appears in the works chosen. Pertinent and precisely analysed
      examples will support the candidate’s ideas.
