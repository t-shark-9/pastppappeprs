All adequate to good answers must include some pertinent detail (described, paraphrased or
directly quoted) to support assertions and reveal knowledge of the texts studied. Relevant
discussion of literary features must appear in every response. Answers should demonstrate
some discernible form of organization and demonstrate standard use of language.

A good to excellent answer must be grounded in the features demanded for “adequate”
answers. In going beyond those features, it may be in the ways described below as well as in
other, somewhat unpredictable ways which show individual thinking and an engaged,
well-supported address of the texts.

Drama

1.       An adequate to good answer will identify some characters where the importance of language
         is significant in depicting the persons as a whole.

         A good to excellent answer will discuss pertinent examples of the importance of language
         for the overall presentation of the chosen characters. They will also bring about detailed
         features of the language of the chosen characters.


2.       An adequate to good answer will identify and describe the use of differences in generations
         in the plays chosen. They will also show some awareness of the ways in which these
         differences contribute to the interpretation of the plays.

         A good to excellent answer may additionally present a deeper understanding of how these
         differences in generations are handled, and demonstrate an ability to recognize a range of
         ways in which differences in generations contribute to a deeper understanding and
         interpretation of the plays.

If the candidate fails to use at least two poets, mark down two levels in criterion A,
Knowledge and Understanding of Works.

3.       An adequate to good answer will present an argument which includes examples that
         demonstrate how, and to what effect, musical qualities (e.g. rhythm, repetitions, rhymes etc.)
         are expressed in some poems.

         A good to excellent answer will provide a convincing argument with pertinent examples
         which explore the different ways in which musical qualities are expressed in some poems.


4.       An adequate to good answer will identify instances where contrasting emotional expressions
         are in focus and be able to give some examples that demonstrate what effect these
         contrasting emotional expressions have.

         A good to excellent answer will clearly and convincingly identify instances where
         contrasting emotional expressions are in focus and will give pertinent and detailed examples
         of the effect of these.

        the importance of this portrayal for the overall understanding of the text.


6.      An adequate to good answer will provide examples of how surprising turning points are
        presented in short stories, referring to stories from at least two authors.

        A good to excellent answer may additionally provide well chosen examples of how
        surprising turning points are presented in short stories by at least two authors, and reveal a
        deeper insight into how this is done.



Novel

7.      An adequate to good answer will present examples of how the candidate has felt sympathy
        or antipathy towards some characters in the novel and relate his or her personal feelings to
        the literary text. They should also comment on the effect these emotions have on the

        further detail the role this has in their understanding of the works as a whole.

      means of influencing the reader.

      how the author is trying to influence the reader and present a discerning choice of examples
      identifying this influence.


10.   An adequate to good answer will provide an argument with examples that show some
      understanding of the statement and consider some ways in the works where less privileged
      individuals and groups may be given a voice.

      show a deeper understanding of the statement, and will discuss how the idea is presented

      understanding of the works.
