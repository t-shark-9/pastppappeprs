                                                           Snow

                                 Snow, you create a country of ghosts.
                                 To you perhaps our souls might migrate,
                                 you are the land of the souls that confronts us,
                                 seeming eternal yet of course not so.

                            5    We rise in the morning to shrouded trees,
                                 to houses with fairy tale windows,
                                 to hills voluminous and novel,
                                 to a fresh country without signposts.
                                 This silence, where does it come from?
                           10    This holy quietness.
                                 This blankness without the individual,
                                 this communal burial.

                                 Magician, you have cast your handkerchief over us.
                                 We are lost in the folds.
                           15    We struggle to find the road again
                                 Where is our destination?

                                 Or shall we holiday in childhood
                                 with our red gloves and jumpers
                                 plunging up to our waists
                           20    in the gravity of the adult.

                                 Or as in a mirror do we see our souls
                                 so whitely staring back at us
                                 with a conspicuous sparkle,
                                 the doubleness of death.

                           25    Yet it is not so, it is not eternal.
                                 Suddenly the hills become water,
                                 the fragile windows are cracked
                                 and the green land appears
                                 somehow stagy and distant:
                           30    after that soul-knowledge
                                 the body with its smells and veins,
                                 our undisguisable home.
