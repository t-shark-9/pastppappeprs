Drama

1.    With reference to at least two plays you have studied, discuss the significance of dialogue in the
      playwright’s presentation and construction of character.


2.    “The key to the dramatic life of any play is the fact that action takes place in particular, limited
      spaces.” How important is the sense of spatial confinement to the drama of at least two of the plays
      you have studied?



Poetry

3.    “Poetry, either directly or indirectly, is ultimately about itself, its own coming into being.” In what
      ways, either directly or indirectly, do the works of at least two poets in your study explore the
      concept of creative inspiration?


4.    Discuss the ways in which at least two poets in your study have offered the familiar as a way of
      entering the unfamiliar.



Prose: The Novel and Short Story

5.    In what ways and for what reasons do the works of prose fiction you have studied seek to represent
      thought or interior consciousness? In your answer you should refer to at least two of the works you
      have studied.


6.    “Fiction is an essentially rhetorical art – that is to say the novelist or short-story writer persuades
      us to share a certain view of the world for the duration of the reading experience.” To what extent
      do you agree with this statement? In your answer you should refer to at least two of the works in
      your study.

Prose: Other than the Novel and Short Story

7.    In prose other than the novel and the short story the writer is not constrained by the demands of
      plot and/or the development of tension. To what extent is this true of at least two of the works in
      your study?


8.    The non-fictional prose genre is typically “a wonderful mixture of history, fact, anecdote and
      opinion”. From your reading of at least two of the works in your study, discuss how writers have
      used some or all of these ingredients.



General Questions on Literature

9.    Authors are aware of the power of their works to shock the reader. Referring to at least two of
      the works in your study, explore some of the methods they have employed to do this.


10.   In what ways and to what effects do at least two of the works you have studied make use of one or
      more aspects of the natural world as a significant motif?


11.   Texts frequently present two (or more) realities, which are often very different. Referring to
      at least two of the works you have studied, show to what extent and in what ways writers have
      made use of the interest and tension this creates.


12.   “A writer is always being asked ‘For whom do you write?’.” Discuss the author’s sense of his or her
      audience in at least two of the works you have studied.
