General notes:
  The following are to be considered suggestions rather than prescriptions, i.e. all points made by
  candidates to be marked on their merits.
  Any attempt to answer should be acknowledged as such; that should be followed especially in
  translation, when some candidates depart from literal in favour of a more poetic rendition, faithful,
  of course, to the original idea.
  The second use of the same figure of speech to answer a style question should be penalized, by not
  being taken into account: e.g. double mention of alliteration.

           (tense, number, etc.). Answers with two or three minor errors or one major error should be
           awarded [2 marks]. Answers with two major errors (or four minor errors) award [1 mark].
           Otherwise, no mark should be awarded.

     (b)   Give [1 mark] for “describing”, and [2 marks] for two examples, e.g. use of concepts: lepos,
           facetiae; epithets: miser, indomitus; diminutives: ocelli, lectulus; direct expression of own

2.   (a)   “I have lived my life, till lately popular with girls” (translation G. Williams) [1 mark];
           because of the use of the perfect, it seems that Horace has finished his career as a ladies man;
           however, he wants to have a come back, because his new fancy is Chloe, which is revealed

6.   (a)   “Some think that Larentia, having been free with her favours, had got the name of „she-wolf‟

           voluptate; contrast ego otium in litteris colloco vs. alii otiosissimis occupationibus perdunt.

           gloriae, aeternitas, aeternitatis; repetition of the phrase sine praemio; the final induces more
           pathos: amissoque filio matrem adhuc agere. Quotation + comment [2 marks] each.
                                                                                                 [12 marks]
