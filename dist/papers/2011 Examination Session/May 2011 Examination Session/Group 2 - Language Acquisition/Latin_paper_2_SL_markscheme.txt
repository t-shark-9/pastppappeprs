General notes:
• The following paragraphs are to be considered suggestions, rather than prescriptions, i.e. all points
  made by candidates to be marked on their merits.
• Any attempt to answer should be acknowledged as such; that should be followed especially in
  translation, when some candidates depart from literal in favour of a more poetic rendition, faithful,
  of course, to the original idea.
• The second use of the same figure of speech to answer a style question should be penalized, by not
  being taken into account: e.g. double mention of alliteration.


Elegiac and Lyric poetry

1.   (a)   Any three of: to Cornelius (Nepos,) countryman [1 mark], fellow poet, homo doctus [1
           mark]; his appreciation of Catullus’ poetry as worthwhile (tu soleba … nugas) [1 mark]; he
           wrote several historical works [1 mark].

     (b)   nugae: (here) light poems, occasional pieces opposed to epic [1 mark]; (false?) modesty,
           self-deprecatory [1 mark], in contrast with lines 6–7: tribus … chartis, doctis, … et laboriosis
           [1 mark].

     (c)   Award [3 marks] for a correct answer, or for an answer with no more than one minor error
           (tense, number, etc.). Answers with two or three minor errors or one major error should be
           awarded [2 marks]. Answers with two major errors (or four minor errors) award [1 mark].
           Otherwise, no mark should be awarded.

     (d)   [1 mark] for any of: the Muse of lyric poetry/Minerva/Athena [1 mark], as inspiring the poet
           [1 mark].

     (e)   Any three of: form: metre (hendecasyllable, often used by Catullus) [1 mark]; light tone,
           pleasant, charming [1 mark]; content: direct expression of emotions and sentiments [1 mark];
           presence of humour [1 mark]; religiosity [1 mark]; poetic concepts: short poem vs. long,
           i.e. lyric vs. epic/or narrative [1 mark], here his own nugae vs. history written by Nepos,
           whose supremacy Catullus is happy to acknowledge [1 mark].
                                                                                            [15 marks]
                                                    –4–             M11/2/LATIN/SP2/ENG/TZ0/XX/M


Elegiac and Lyric poetry

2.   (a)   Seres refers to China; Bactra refers to the Persian Empire, actually allusion to Parthia;
           Tanais refers to the river Don in Russia, alluding to Scythians; troubled places at the
           boundaries of the Roman Empire; the use of these names suggests what a politician’s mind as
           Maecenas’ is busy with; that in turn means that all is quiet in Rome and across the Empire;
           also, literary flavour: exotic places, also ironical hyperboles.

     (b)   curas, times in English/Latin or both.

     (c)   “The rest (everything else/the future) is carried along like a river”; simile alluding to the
           destructive force water can sometimes have, just as human life.

     (d)   Award [3 marks] for a correct answer, or for an answer with no more than one minor error
           (tense, number, etc.). Answers with two or three minor errors or one major error should be
           awarded [2 marks]. Answers with two major errors (or four minor errors) award [1 mark].
           Otherwise, no mark should be awarded.

     (e)   At the heart of this extract is the contrast between the busy life, negotium and leisure, otium
           [1 mark]. Maecenas, a politician, represents the former in the first stanza, whereas Horace is
           a supporter of the latter in the rest of the extract [1 mark]. In the second stanza, in contrast
           with the first one, the Gods’ power is emphasized [1 mark]; therefore men are not encouraged
           to see how the future looks (imagery: caliginosa nocte; deus framed between premit and ridet;
           deus vs. mortalis; ultra fas in enjambment) [1 mark]; the simile of the flood (suggestion to
           enjoy the present) [1 mark]; exhortation: memento componere [1 mark]; friendship with
           Maecenas; enjoying life [1 mark]; rural landscape (pecus, montium, amnis) [1 mark].
                                                                                               [15 marks]
                                                    –5–                M11/2/LATIN/SP2/ENG/TZ0/XX/M


Epic

3.     (a)   Any two of: the two/a pair of [1 mark] doves [1] of venus [1]

       (b)   Any two comments + quotations. Many verbs, which give dynamic pace to the narrative;
             mixture of dactyls and spondees in the first line, to show change of speed, as they advance
             and implicitly meet with various dangers; olfactive imagery: grave olentis; line 202 with
             alliteration of “l”, that suggests fluidity, therefore immaterial; line 204: visual imagery:
             discolor aura, plus assonance; the Homeric simile quale … vento; aurum – auri: polyptoton
             for emphasis.

       (c)   Judge only for length of syllables. [1 mark] for each error-free line.

       (d)   Any three out of: Aeneas’ trumpeter/companion/previously with Hector [1 mark].
             Challenged the Gods to a musical contest [1 mark] and was drowned by Triton [1 mark]. He
             had died just before the events narrated here [1 mark] and the Trojans were bringing him the
             last homage, preparing to bury his body [1 mark].

       (e)   Any two out of: the Trojans prepare to bury Misenus’ corpse: flebant: were weeping; ferebant
             suprema: were paying their last respects; struxere: they raised (a pyre); intexunt: weave its
             sides; constituent: set cypress; decorant: decorated it; expedient: prepared (heated water);
             lavant: washed; unguent: anointed (the corpse).
                                                                                               [15 marks]


4.     (a)   Judge only for length of syllables. [1 mark] for each error-free line.

       (b)   Any two comments + quotations: physical: horrendus, echoed in terribili, both emphasis on
             fear; plurima canities: age, announcing senectus in line 304, but also disorder, through
             inculta; line 300 chiasmus, with verbs in the middle; line 302: Charon is on his own; actions
             in close succession; ferruginea: choice of word: red, because rusty, so absence of beauty, like
             the region, or dull reddish, again to add an inhospitable note; the prefix sub- twice: subigit,
             subvectat: Charon makes efforts to push the boat; the portrait is closed with a new touch of
             physical description: iam senior, to introduce the idea of old age, then immediately oxymoron
             to remind the reader that is a god: viridis senectus. The idea of vigour has been already
             mentioned through cruda: fresh.

       (c)   Award [3 marks] for a correct answer, or for an answer with no more than one minor error
             (tense, number, etc.). Answers with two or three minor errors or one major error should be
             awarded [2 marks]. Answers with two major errors (or four minor errors) award [1 mark].
             Otherwise, no mark should be awarded.

       (d)   Simile [1 mark] plus any two of the following: frigus: coldness of weather, but also that of

Historiography

5.   (a)   Any three of: vi compressa: had suffered violence/had been raped and consequently gave birth
           to Romulus and Remus/the twins; seu ita rata: either because she thought it useful; seu quia
           deus honestior erat; nuncupat: indicates.

     (b)   Award [3 marks] for a correct answer, or for an answer with no more than one minor error
           (tense, number, etc.). Answers with two or three minor errors or one major error should be
           awarded [2 marks]. Answers with two major errors (or four minor errors) award [1 mark].
           Otherwise, no mark should be awarded.

           the babies [1 mark].

     (e)   Any four + quotations. Livy’s historical approach is not critical [1 mark]: when different
           presentations appear in his sources, he could present them both [1 mark], or make an average
           [1 mark], or follow his own choice according to what seemed acceptable to him [1 mark];
           introduces elements pertaining to the early Roman tradition: seu … seu … [1 mark]; tenet
           fama, ferunt; sometimes he tries to find a reason: ut opinor [1 mark]. However, Livy brings
           details from his own experience or verified sources: ubi nunc ficus Ruminalis est [1 mark].
                                                                                               [15 marks]
                                                   –7–               M11/2/LATIN/SP2/ENG/TZ0/XX/M


6.   (a)   Award [3 marks] for a correct answer, or for an answer with no more than one minor error
           (tense, number, etc.). Answers with two or three minor errors or one major error should be
           awarded [2 marks]. Answers with two major errors (or four minor errors) award [1 mark].
           Otherwise, no mark should be awarded.

     (b)   Livy is quite specific: there is a double tradition and he gives both variants: defeated in battle
           [1 mark], King Latinus joins in peace (sanctioned through Aeneas’ marriage to Lavinia)
           [1 mark]; just before the battle [1 mark], King Latinus would ask to talk to the enemy leader
           [1 mark]. This variant is more impressive, as it shows Latinus’ personal courage, wisdom,
           ultimately desire for peace [1 mark]; therefore Livy insists on it: the king wants to understand
           why the stranger came to Italy. He seems to anticipate the answers: casu, domo … quaerere.
           Each time the king is called by his name; the second time the name is deferred to the
           middle of the sentence; questions (percontatum): qui …, unde aut quo …, quidve: tricolon/
           tetracolon etc.

     (c)   Any three of: leader of the Trojans [1 mark]; Anchises and Venus’ son [1 mark]; his native
           country had been sacked [1 mark]; fugitive/exiled [1 mark]; searching for a suitable place to
           found a city [1 mark].

     (d)   vel bello vel paci: either to engage in war [1 mark] or to make peace [1 mark].

     (e)   Any three of: the key verb, sanxisse is postponed at the very end to create suspense [1 mark];
           series of answers to the questions in the previous section [1 mark]; multitudinem: collective
           singular, juxtaposed to Troianos [1 mark]; Aeneam framed by ducem and filium [1 mark];
           cremata patria, to add pathos [1 mark]; vel … vel to balance etc. [1 mark].
                                                                                              [15 marks]

           awarded [2 marks]. Answers with two major errors (or four minor errors) award [1 mark].
