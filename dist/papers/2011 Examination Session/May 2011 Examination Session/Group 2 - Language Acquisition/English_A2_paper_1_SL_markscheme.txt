These notes to examiners are intended only as guidelines to assist marking. They are not offered as
an exhaustive and fixed set of responses or approaches to which all answers must rigidly adhere.
Good ideas or angles not offered here should be acknowledged and rewarded as appropriate.
Similarly, answers which do not include all the ideas or approaches suggested here should not be so
heavily penalized as to distort appreciation of individuality.

                                            SECTION A

This question invites candidates to compare extracts from an essay and a web site selling dolls.

A barely satisfactory comparative commentary may:

  note that both texts are about dolls
  call attention to the different genres
  call attention to one or two stylistic devices in each text; for example the use of quotations and
  descriptive language in text 1; the use of italics and exclamation marks in text 2.


A better comparative commentary may:

  discuss tone in each text (e.g. text 1 begins as a humorous narrative which becomes more
  polemical, while text 2 employs a tone of earnestness)
  consider the idea that text 1 seems to be in favour of a potentially “inappropriate” doll as a
  children’s toy, while text 2 is critical of many mass-produced toys
  look in some detail at personification: in text 1 Barbie is animated (a “survivor” with “fickle
  careers”); in text 2 the toys are imbued with the power to “teach acceptance, tolerance, cultural
  awareness and self-esteem”
  discuss point of view and perspective (both texts feature adults talking about children, text 1
  being spoken in the first person singular, text 2 in the first person plural)
  consider tense and how that contributes to the mood of the extract: text 1 is written in the past
  tense and sounds more like a story, then shifts to the present tense; text 2 is written in the present
  tense and sounds more urgent or timely
  note that we hear from a succinct, confident girl in text 1, whereas we don’t hear from any
  children in text 2
  note that Barbie is described in detail in text 1 but no toys are described in text 2.

The best comparative commentary may:

  look at tone as a device which helps make a point (the humour of text 1 co-opts us into agreeing
  with the author, while the righteous tone of text 2 might potentially convince us to buy the
  product being offered)
  discuss toys as tools of empowerment (Barbie in text 1; the toys being sold in text 2)
  point out that text 1 celebrates freedom from parental participation whereas text 2 encourages it
  consider the use of irony in text 1 (e.g. “bad” Barbie of text 1) with the lack of it in text 2
  examine the rollicking girlhood pictured in text 1, versus the snapshot of a more carefully-
  managed childhood in text 2 (which considers whether toys are age-appropriate and safe, for
  example)
  discuss the notion of stereotype in both texts: the girl in text 1 seems to resist it, while the
  children of text 2 are being protected from it.
                                               –5–            M11/2/A2ENG/SP1/ENG/TZ0/XX/M


                                           SECTION B

This question invites candidates to compare an extract from a novel and an Internet advice column
for parents.

A barely satisfactory comparative commentary may:

  note that both texts are about death
  call attention to the different genres, one a novel and the other an advice column
  call attention to one or two stylistic features of each text: for example, the use of quotation and
  description (wind-buffeted car, throbbing earlobes) in text 3; the use of imperatives/commands
  and professional language in text 4.


A better comparative commentary may:

  be more specific about the shared subject, noting that both texts address how one deals with
  children’s questions about death
  discuss generic differences in more detail (e.g. text 3 is fiction, which allows limitless
  possibilities around this conversation; text 4 deals with reality and is more succinct)
  comment on perspective (text 3 features a mother talking to her son; text 4 features a
  professional addressing parents)
  comment on point of view (text 3 employs the first person, text 4 employs the second person)
  compare the irreverent, humorous tone of text 3 with the professional tone of text 4
  note that we are introduced to the grieving child in text 3, whereas childrens’ voices are absent in
  text 4 (spoken of only in terms of generalizations).


The best comparative commentary may:

  note that the message of text 3 seems to be that it’s a good idea to insulate children from death,
  whereas text 4 encourages the reader always to tell the truth
  comment on the self-deprecating narrator of text 3 versus the confident, educated speaker of
  text 4
  consider that the child in text 3 deals with death in precisely the way the professional of text 4
  predicts he will
  discuss the way religion is represented in both of these texts
  discuss the fact that death is represented as something to be feared/avoided in text 3, whereas
  death is represented as something to be talked about/prepared for in text 4.
