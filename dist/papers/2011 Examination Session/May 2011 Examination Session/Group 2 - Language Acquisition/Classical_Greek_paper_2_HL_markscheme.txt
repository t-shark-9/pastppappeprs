     (b)   Comparison between envy for the glorious living and undisputed fame for the brave dead;

Tragedy

5.   (a)   He was summoned by Oedipus, at Creon’s suggestion, to interpret Apollo’s oracle given
           to Creon.

     (b)   “I shall not stand enrolled under Creon for my patron”; “you charge me with being the tool of
           Creon’s treason” (Jebb); the foreigners residing in Athens needed someone to represent them;
           Teiresias means he can stand for himself.

     (c)   ἆρ᾽ οἶσθ᾽ ἀφ᾽ ὧν εἶ; Oedipus does not know the truth about his parents; ἆρα = in emphatic
           position [1 mark]; καὶ λέληθας ἐχθρὸς ὢντοῖς σοῖσιν αὐτοῦ νέρθε κἀπὶ γ῅ς ἄνω;
           Oedipus has committed murder and incest, i.e. behaved as an enemy to his kin [1 mark]; καί
           σ᾽ ἀμφιπλὴξ μητρός τε καὶ τοῦ σοῦ πατρὸς ἐλᾷ ποτ᾽ ἐκ γ῅ς τ῅σδε δεινόπους ἀρά;
           there is a double curse upon him [1 mark]; βλέποντα νῦν μὲν ὄρθ᾽, ἔπειτα δὲ σκότον;
           although Oedipus can presently see, he does not perceive the reality; later on he will lose this
           faculty [1 mark].

     (d)   Κιθαιρὼν; the mountain where baby Oedipus was exposed; τὸν ὑμέναιον; Oedipus’
           marriage to Jocaste; τοῖς σοῖς τέκνοις; their cursed children.
                                                                              [10 marks]


6.   (a)   “Since this land now calls you saviour”, as Oedipus had saved Thebes from the riddle of the
           Sphinx.

     (b)   Judge only for length of syllables. [1 mark] for each error-free line.

     (c)   Award [1 mark] for any stylistic device and [1 mark] for its quotation. Any four valid points,
           e.g. use of imagery suggesting strong religious beliefs: ὄρνιθι αἰσίῳ; the King is the
           representative of his people, so Oedipus is made unique and supreme among mortals:
           βροτῶν ἄριστ᾽; anaphora used at the beginning of line 11.46, and 47; use of a sententia in
           lines 11.56–57; use of poetic words (some of them shared with Homer): βροτῶν, κλῄζει,
           μεμνώμεθα; pathos etc.
                                                                                             [12 marks]
                                                  –6–               M11/2/GREEK/HP2/ENG/TZ0/XX/M


Comedy

7.   (a)   Herakles’ journey to the Underworld to fetch Cerberus.

     (b)   Charon, the ferryman taking people across Styx for two obols.

     (c)   In war time Athens two obols was: daily allowance for jurors; or daily pay for soldier/sailor;
           or the price of a ticket for the theatre; Charon used to charge only one obol, but prices go up
           in war time.

     (d)   Aristophanes’ penchant for social satire: people who have wronged their guests [1 mark];
           physically abusing one’s parents; 1 and 2 are examples of impiety, with no punishment in
           court but with requital after one’s death [1 mark]; perjury, punished both in court and after
           one’s death by Erinyes [1 mark].
                                                                                            [10 marks]


8.   (a)   That Euripides’ prologues are lacking in poetic style and using common language: ποιεῖς
           γὰρ οὕτως ὥστ᾽ ἐναρμόττειν ἅπαν; examples are given: κῳδάριον, ληκύθιον,
           θύλακον.

     (b)   Comic contrast between tragic lines versus comic end; repetition; increases the discrepancy
           between tragic and comic; obscene allusion in ληκύθιον.

     (c)   Tries to be an objective judge by requesting further examples in support of Aeschylus’ claim;
           self-irony: οἴμοι πεπλήγμεθ᾽ αὖθις, line 1214, which means that he does not take himself
           too seriously; tactful: asks Euripides to admit defeat rather than him declaring Aeschylus the
           winner; witty: the sailing metaphor, the ληκύθιον pun plus appropriate quotations.
                                                                                              [12 marks]
                                                   –7–              M11/2/GREEK/HP2/ENG/TZ0/XX/M


Philosophy

9.    (a)   The sacred ship is now back from Delos, which means Socrates will soon die; Crito has
            already arranged Socrates’ escape from prison bribing the guard.

      (b)   [3 marks] for a correct answer or an answer with no more than one minor error
            (tense, number, etc.). Answers with two or three minor errors or one major error should be
            awarded [2 marks]. Answers with two major errors (or four minor errors) award [1 mark].
            Otherwise, no mark.

      (c)   The sacred ship has returned from Delos; on the next day will enter the harbour of Piraeus,
            and that will be the day when Socrates will die.

      (d)   initial contrast to set the tone: ἄρτι versus πάλαι; πάλαι explains Crito’s τοσαύτῃ τε
            ἀγρυπνίᾳ καὶ λύπῃ [1 mark]; Crito insists on the fact that Socrates continues to be calm as
            he has been throughout his life: πολλάκις μὲν δή σε καὶ πρότερον ἐν παντὶ τῷ βίῳ
            ηὐδαιμόνισα τοῦ τρόπου, πολὺ δὲ μάλιστα ἐν τῆ νῦν παρεστώσῃ συμφορᾷ; note
            the polyptoton πολλάκις, πολὺ [1 mark]; Crito’s double use of a euphemism: συμφορᾷ,
            συμφοραῖς, whereas Socrates is unambiguous: τελευτᾶν [1 mark]; repetition of χαλεπήν
            [1 mark]; contrast σοί versus ἐμοὶ καὶ τοῖς σοῖς ἐπιτηδείοις [1 mark]; polyptoton
            βαρεῖαν, βαρύτατ᾽ [1 mark].
                                                                                            [10 marks]


10.   (a)   Content: we should not commit any wrong or inflict an injury under any circumstances, not
            even to take revenge; also, we should be committed to apply that in our own lives, otherwise,
            we act in an immature way (“as children”); if wrongdoing means evil and disgrace to the
            wrongdoer, then we should stick to this, and not do it under any circumstances.
            Style: strong negative; rhetorical questions, contrast grownups versus children; hyperbole; use
            of polarized concepts: good versus bad plus appropriate quotations.

      (b)   οἱ πολλοὶ refers to the majority, common people, who consider it right to take revenge,
            whereas Socrates insists on describing it as morally wrong. He states that it is one’s choice to
            act as οἱ πολλοὶ do, as it is to accept to do only what is right. Any other point on its merits.

      (c)   [2 marks] for a correct answer or with no more than one minor error (tense, number, etc.).
            Answers with two or three minor errors or one major error should be awarded [1 mark];
            otherwise, no mark.
                                                                                          [12 marks]
