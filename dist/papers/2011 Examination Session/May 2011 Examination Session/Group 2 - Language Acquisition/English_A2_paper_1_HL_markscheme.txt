Higher Level, paper 1

These notes to examiners are intended only as guidelines to assist marking. They are not offered as
an exhaustive and fixed set of responses or approaches to which all answers must rigidly adhere.
Good ideas or angles not offered here should be acknowledged and rewarded as appropriate.
Similarly, answers which do not include all the ideas or approaches suggested here should not be so
heavily penalized as to distort appreciation of individuality.

                                            SECTION A

This question invites candidates to compare extracts from a recipe book and a web site from an
online store.

A barely satisfactory comparative commentary may:

  note that both texts are about juice
  call attention to the different genres
  call attention to one or two stylistic features of each text: e.g., the use of metaphor and the strings
  of examples in text 1; the use of capitals and quotations in text 2.


A better comparative commentary may:

  be more specific about the shared subject – the benefits of juice
  consider the use of persuasive language in both texts
  discuss stylistic features in more detail
  look at point of view in each text (first person in text 1 versus third person in text 2)
  discuss the tone in each text (passionate and intimate in text 1; upbeat but professional in text 2)
  note that while the descriptive language of text 1 concentrates on various types of juices, the
  descriptive language of text 2 concentrates on the toxins in your body and never mentions
  specific juices at all.


The best comparative commentaries may:

  consider the sensual response to juice in text 1 versus the intellectual response to juice in text 2
  note that although the purpose of both texts is to convince the reader of something (the delicious
  recipes in text 1, the juicers in text 2), the motivation behind text 1 seems less commercial
  consider the fact that the focus of juice in text 1 is the taste (with the health benefits being merely
  a “bonus, an extra”), while the focus of juice in text 2 is its medicinal benefits and the fact that
  it’s easier to eat than solid food
  discuss the fact that while both texts make reference to the body, text 1 concentrates on
  the mouth, face, and chest, while text 2 concentrates on the “bowls, liver and kidneys”
  note that while the speaker of text 2 employs a professional to back up claims, the speaker of
  text 1 relies on his own persuasive abilities
  note that Nigel Slater distances himself from “the world of people who eat for health rather than
  for pleasure” while text 2 could be seen to address itself to those people
  show a perceptive and detailed understanding of stylistic features and their effects.
                                                –4–           M11/2/A2ENG/HP1/ENG/TZ0/XX/M


                                           SECTION B

This question invites candidates to compare an extract from a short story and a self-help book.

A barely satisfactory comparative commentary may:

  note that the two texts are about smart children
  call attention to the different genres
  point out one or two stylistic features in each text (e.g. use of quotation and lists in text 3;
  the fact that text 4 begins as a narrative and then switches to a directive in the last third,
  use of lists).


A better comparative commentary may:

  be more specific about shared subject (pressuring children, pushy parents)
  discuss generic differences in more detail
  discuss the use of proper names and book titles in both texts, especially text 3
  look at point of view (first person in text 3, third person which shifts to first person plural in
  text 4) and its effects
  consider perspective (text 3 is from that of the child being pressured, text 4 is from
  a professional)
  note that we hear from the child in text 3, whereas Queeney is only talked about in text 4
  discuss the homey references of text 3 (Formica kitchen table, magazines in a pile in the
  bathroom) and their effect
  note that the quotations in text 3 feature modern language whereas those in text 4 feature more
  archaic language
  note that much of the advice proffered in text 4 is applicable to the situation discussed in text 3.


The best comparative commentaries may:

  note that the child of text 3 is average and miserable, whereas the child of text 4 is exceptional
  and miserable
  discuss tone (text 3 is poignant, sad and funny at same time; text 4 is professional, that of a
  social historian)
  suggest inferences that can be drawn about the characters in the two texts (text 3 seems to
  be about working-class immigrants; text 4 opens with a picture of a privileged English family)
  comment on purpose (text 3 seems to focus on sharing a personal recollection, with the
  advice implicit; text 4 also opens with a story, but the advice is explicit. The story is in service
  to the advice)
  show a perceptive and detailed understanding of stylistic features and their effects.
