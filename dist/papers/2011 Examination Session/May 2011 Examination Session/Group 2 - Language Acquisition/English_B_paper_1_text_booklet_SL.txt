              A ROLE MODEL FOR DISABILITY
            Kelly Knox never thought of herself as being “disabled”.
            Although she was born without a left forearm, the word
            was never used in her home and, surprisingly, she was
                                                                              Image removed for copy-
            never made fun of at school. Only when she appeared
                                                                                   right reasons
 5          on the reality show Britain’s Missing Top Model did
            Knox become aware of the discrimination surrounding
            disability.

            “When I went on the show it was the first time I’d met disabled people,” she says.
            “Some of the other girls were bullied as children. It was a real eye-opener.”

10          It was at the modelling agency, she feels, that things started to go wrong. Despite
            appearing on the catwalk at London Fashion Week, Knox’s modelling career did not
            take off as might have been expected. “I don’t want to say the agency didn’t care,
            but I felt left in the dark,” she says.

            Melissa Richardson, one of the agency’s founders, says that Knox’s lack of success
15          was not due to any lack of effort on the agency’s part. “We like to think the fashion
            world is, or should be, broad-minded enough to see past the disability, but we always
            warned Kelly it wasn’t going to be easy. Most clients tend to want models to represent
            perfection, so her disability was already a little contrary to expectations.”

            Despite the obstacle, Knox got involved with a number of good causes and disability
20          charities. Today she recalls the standing ovation she received after speaking at a
            conference as one of her favourite moments. She has also done some modelling,
            and her recent projects include an online advert and a campaign for a new jewellery
            company.

            While Knox is pleased with her success as a model, she would like to write a magazine
25          advice column. “I love modelling, but there’s only so much I can do with it. I want to
            move things on and help people.”

      THE IMPORTANCE OF AWARDS
       Why do we work? For money? For success,
       fame, honour? For the good life? Each of
       us is driven by an entirely different set of
       desires. But one thing is certain; some
 5     professions are meant for those who want to
       make money and some for those who want
       to discover themselves.

       Even when you succeed in your calling,
       rewards can differ. Some become, like
10     Mukesh Ambani, owners of prized
       enterprises in India. Others become, like
       Sachin Tendulkar, undoubted leaders of
       their own profession. There are others like
       Rahul Gandhi who are blessed with the

PROTECTING YOUR ONLINE IDENTITY AND REPUTATION
From the first time you log on to a social networking site like Facebook or
MySpace, you’re creating an online identity. This identity may be different
from your real-world identity and some parts of it may be entirely
made up. Playing around is part of the fun of an online life. And while
the virtual world is full of opportunities to interact and share with people
worldwide, it is a place where nothing is temporary and there are no
“take-backs”; a lot of what you do and say online can be retrieved even
if you delete it.

Research proves teenage users who had taken certain measures to ensure their privacy online
protected their information and photographs from being copied by others and shown to the world.
Ashley, a high-school junior, says she’s very careful about the information, pictures, and comments
she posts even though her profile is private. “I know teens who have gotten kicked off their sports
teams because of pictures they have on their profiles,” she says.

Researchers believe frequently changing passwords prevents online “identity trashing” when a
profile is hacked. They also advise picking passwords that are difficult to guess and never sharing
them with anyone except parents or trusted adults.

In addition, teenagers are always advised to be careful of what they post online. Hartley Harris,
a researcher at the University of Columbia, states that things that seem funny or cool right now
might not seem so cool years from now – or when a teacher, admissions officer, or potential
employer sees them.

                    Mr Harris also warns teenagers against responding to inappropriate requests.
                     “These can be scary, strange, and even embarrassing,” he says. “If teens feel
                      harassed by a stranger or a friend online, they should immediately tell an
                       adult they trust.”

                        Paula Jenkins, an online education specialist, says teens should also learn
                      about copyright laws and make sure they don’t post, share, or distribute
              copyrighted images, songs, or files.

Your online identity and reputation are shaped in much the same way as your real-life identity,
except that when you’re online you don’t always get a chance to explain your tone or what you
mean. Thinking before you post and following the same rules for responsible behavior online as
you do offline can help you avoid leaving an online identity trail you regret.
