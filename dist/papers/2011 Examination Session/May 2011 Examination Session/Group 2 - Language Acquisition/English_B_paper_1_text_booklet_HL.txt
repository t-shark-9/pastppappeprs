TEXT A



            A DAY IN ADELAIDE
       It’s hard to put a finger on Adelaide; it has that curious blend of high sophistication and
       big country attitude. Adelaide is Australia’s cultural heart, home to international festivals of
       music, arts, film, and literature. It hosts a Festival of Ideas, and its Fringe Festival is the second
       largest in the world.

 5     Adelaide is a city to be explored on foot. The best place to start
       exploring is North Terrace. This is Adelaide’s cultural precinct,
       a pleasant tree-lined boulevard where a short stroll from the
       Boer War Memorial on the corner of King William Street will
       bring you past the gates of Government House (where the
10     Queen’s representative resides; open to the public twice a year)
       and on to the State Library, the South Australian Museum, and the
       Art Gallery of South Australia.

       The South Australian Museum, recognizable by the whale skeleton in its huge front window,
       houses what may be the world’s finest collection of Aboriginal artifacts, as well as exhibits
15     on the state’s geology and opals (South Australia accounts for 80 % of the world’s opals).
       The third floor is devoted to the life and adventures of Sir Douglas Mawson, Australia’s greatest
       Antarctic explorer. Next door is the Art Gallery of South Australia with its superb mix of modern
       and colonial art.

       A little farther along North Terrace is Ayers House, an elegant nineteenth century bluestone
20     mansion and the flagship museum of the National Trust of South Australia. Beyond that is the
       Botanic Garden with its conservatory and enclosed rainforest. When you’re walking along
       North Terrace, don’t overlook the museum which honours the exploits of Sir Donald Bradman,
       Australia’s sports hero.

       If it seems too nice a day to spend inside a
25     museum, head for the beach. The best way to get
       there is on the original 1929 tram that rattles along
       from Victoria Square in the city to sunny Glenelg.
       Or if cricket is on, wander up to the Adelaide Oval
       cricket ground and watch a session of play. It’s one
30     of the prettiest grounds in the world, with its
       rose-garden setting near St Peter’s Cathedral and,
       even if you don’t understand the game, the ambience
       speaks for itself.

                                         ACTING UP
            Hartley got to Central Station nearly an hour before his train was due to leave. A lifetime
       in the theatre had given him a healthy – indeed excessive – sense of punctuality; a lifetime of
       unwanted cups of coffee, obsessive checking of the time, yet another turn around the block before
       that all too often pointless, nerve-wracking audition.
 5          Hartley was 75 – pretty fit for his age, legs holding up, memory still ticking over nicely,
       though the occasions for obsessive punctuality were now rather fewer. But he was a creature of
       habit and couldn’t change now.
            He repaired to the restaurant, purchased a coffee and a blueberry muffin, tried and failed
       to find a litter-free table. The coffee was awful, the muffin was stale – but the coffee was
10     always awful, the muffin always stale. Hartley refused to let himself be annoyed. His visit to
       the city had not been without its pleasures. He had recorded a series of television voiceovers
       – his rich baritone and faultless diction extolling the virtues of a popular make of Japanese car.
       Lunch with an old actor-chum, then a film – regrettably not utilizing his own talents – had
       rounded out an agreeable day.
15          Hartley was a good actor although the calls on his talents were now infrequent. But really, he
       thought draining his awful coffee, he’d had a reasonably good career. Something to be proud of.
       But he’d never had that break-through part.
            He headed for his platform. Just as the train was about to pull out a man ran down the
       platform, jumped aboard as the door slammed shut and sank into the seat next to Hartley.
20        “Cutting it a bit fine,” he said.
          “Indeed,” Hartley replied. “A close run thing.”
          The man – fortyish, amiable looking – gave him an amused glance.
          This brief exchange served as an adequate ice-breaker and they chatted their way through
       the outer suburbs and into the countryside. Having satisfactorily disposed of the sad state of the
25     railways and country versus city living, his neighbour asked Hartley what he did – or had done –
       for a living.
          Hartley hated telling people he was an actor. He was not ashamed of his job. Not in the least,
       but he had long tired of reactions ranging from “what have I seen you in” to “how do you learn all
       those lines”.
30        So in situations like this he simply selected an occupation from a former role. Bit risky,
       of course. You say you’re a doctor and find yourself meeting the quizzical gaze of a heart surgeon.
       But he’d never been caught out and it was a harmless enough game, Hartley felt. It amused him,
       and he’d given some damn good performances too.
          “I’m a lawyer,” he replied. “Retired several years ago. Conveyance, property law. Bit of
35     criminal stuff.”
          The train was slowing down. The man glanced out the window.
          “My station. I had you quite wrong then.”
          He stood and took down his briefcase from the overhead rack.
          “Yes, I’d have said you were an actor. The voice especially. Still, lawyers are actors in a way,
40     don’t you think? Plenty of drama in a courtroom.”
          The train drew into the station.
       “I’m a film director. Casting a feature at the moment. You study faces. On the train. Everywhere.
       Always on the lookout. Anyway, enjoyed our chat. ’Bye.”

        EARLIER BEDTIMES PROTECT ADOLESCENTS


                                 A
                                                study found that adolescents with early parent-set bedtimes
                                                were significantly less likely to suffer from depression,
                                                suggesting that early bedtimes could have a protective effect
                                                by lengthening sleep.
                                       Results show that adolescents with parent-set bedtimes of midnight
                                  or later were 24 % more likely to suffer from depression than adolescents
                                  with parent-set bedtimes of 10 pm or earlier. Adolescents who reported
                                  that they usually sleep for five or fewer hours per night were more likely
                                  to suffer from acute muscle pains, dizziness, nausea and headaches than
                                  those who reported getting eight hours of nightly sleep. Participants who
                                  reported that they “usually get enough sleep” were less irritable than those
                                  who didn’t.
      James E Gangwisch, assistant professor at Columbia University Medical Center, said that the results
strengthen the argument that short sleep duration could play a role in the study of depression causes.
“Our results are consistent with the theory that inadequate sleep is a risk factor for depression, working
with other risk and protective factors through multiple possible causal pathways to the development of
this mood disorder,” said Gangwisch. “Adequate quality sleep could therefore be a preventative measure
against depression.”
      From the data collected, it was found that some participants suffered from memory loss and
hallucinations. These were associated with later parent-set bedtime, shorter sleep duration, and
self-perception of not getting enough sleep.
      54 % of parents reported that their adolescent had to go to bed by 10 pm or earlier on weeknights,
1 % reported setting a bedtime of 11 pm, and 25 % reported setting a bedtime of midnight or later.
Nearly 70 % of adolescents reported going to bed at a time that complied with the weeknight bedtime set
by their parents. Adolescents reported going to bed only about five minutes later on average than their
parent-set bedtime.
      The average adolescent-reported sleep duration was 7 hours 53 minutes, which contrasted sharply
with the 9 or more hours of nightly sleep that is recommended for adolescents. Participants with a
parent-set bedtime of 10 pm or earlier reported that they usually slept for an average of 8 hours 10 minutes,
which was 33 minutes more than adolescents with a bedtime of 11 pm and 40 minutes more than those
with a bedtime of midnight or later. With the exception of sleep durations of 10 hours or more per night,
higher average sleep durations were associated with progressively earlier average bedtimes.
      The authors of the study reported that there are a number of potential methods by which constant
partial sleep deprivation could contribute to depression. Lack of sleep may produce moodiness that hinders
the ability to cope with daily stresses, impair relationships with peers and adults, and affect judgment,
concentration and impulse control. They also suggested that behavioral interventions that involve educating
adolescents and their parents about healthier sleep practices and helping them modify sleep habits could
serve as the main preventative measures against depression.
