These notes are not intended to replace the published criteria but to supplement them in some instances.

 These notes are intended to define the top mark of the scale in this examination. The phrase,
“a good answer”, is intended to refer to scripts which are likely to be placed in the 9 to 10 band
of descriptors. Scripts should be marked proportionately lower to the degree to which they fail to
meet these requirements.

In each case, good answers will meet most, though not necessarily all, of the following requirements.

1.    The cafeteria services at your school are poor. You have been invited by the editor of your
      school newspaper to write an article about these poor cafeteria services and suggest ways in
      which they can be improved. Write your article.

      Analysis and critique – semi-formal – article

      A good answer
      • will have an eye-catching title
      • will adopt a semi-formal register
      • may have flashes of informality
      • will discuss why the services provided by the cafeteria are considered poor
      • will discuss the cafeteria services with courtesy
      • may touch on positive aspects but mention how the negative ones outweigh/outnumber
        them
      • will provide suggestions on how to improve the cafeteria services
      • will include both parts of the task – description of the poor cafeteria services and how they
        can be improved; if one part of the task has been largely or entirely ignored, no more than
        6 marks may be awarded for Criterion C
      • may personalize the topic; this should be rewarded.


2.    You believe everybody should play a positive role in preventing bullying at school. Write a
      letter to the principal suggesting ways in which this could be achieved.

      Written interaction – formal – letter

      A good answer
      • will adopt a formal register
      • will adopt a formal letter format (address(es), the date, greetings, closing salutation, etc.)
      • will strongly express the writer’s point of view
      • may give personal examples; this should be rewarded
      • will focus on suggestions/solutions. A script which does not do this clearly should be
        penalized for lack of relevance under criterion C.

3.   A friend of yours is concerned about his/her lack of confidence in public (public speaking,
     social gatherings, etc.) and has asked you for advice. Write an e-mail to your friend
     suggesting ways in which s/he can develop more self-confidence.

     Written interaction – informal – e-mail

     A good answer
     • will adopt an informal register
     • may have a short appropriate greeting with personal news
     • will adopt a style that has a light, friendly touch
     • will suggest changes that are practical
     • may adopt the e-mail format (“To” and “Subject”)
     • should end on an optimistic note.

     Note: Some limited use of Textese (e.g. 4 for four/for and u for you) and/or emoticons is
           permissible.


4.   You are participating in a debate: “Famous sports personalities should be good role
     models”. The debate will be held at your local community centre. Write the text of your
     speech, either agreeing or disagreeing with this statement.

     Controversial argument – semi-formal to formal – speech

     A good answer
     • will adopt a semi-formal to formal register
     • may have limited informal asides
     • will clearly express the writer’s (speaker’s) viewpoint for OR against
     • may devote some space to opposing viewpoints but refute them; this should be rewarded
     • will maintain contact with audience (greeting, personal pronoun, rhetorical questions,
       closing statements etc.)
     • will give specific examples.
