General Marking Instructions

Subject Details:             Biology SL Paper 3 Markscheme
Mark Allocation

Candidates are required to answer questions from TWO of the Options [2  18 marks].
Maximum total = [36 marks].

1.   A markscheme often has more marking points than the total allows. This is intentional. Do not award
     more than the maximum marks allowed for part of a question.

2.   Each marking point has a separate line and the end is signified by means of a semicolon (;).

3.   An alternative answer or wording is indicated in the markscheme by a slash (/). Either wording can
     be accepted.

4.   Words in brackets ( ) in the markscheme are not necessary to gain the mark.

5.   Words that are underlined are essential for the mark.

6.   The order of marking points does not have to be as in the markscheme, unless stated otherwise.

7.   If the candidate’s answer has the same “meaning” or can be clearly interpreted as being of
     equivalent significance, detail and validity as that in the markscheme then award the mark.
     Where this point is considered to be particularly relevant in a question it is emphasized by
     writing OWTTE (or words to that effect).

8.   Occasionally, a part of a question may require an answer that is required for subsequent
     marking points. If an error is made in the first marking point then it should be penalized.

9.   Only consider units at the end of a calculation.

Option A — Human nutrition and health

A1. (a)   Ascorbic acid: 2 mg (units are needed)
          Dehydroascorbic acid: 2 mg (units are needed)                                             [1]
          Both required for the mark.

          from six hours onwards more ascorbic acid is released than dehydroascorbic acid;
          maximum release of dehydroascorbic acid at three hours whereas maximum
          release of ascorbic acid at six hours;
          ascorbic acid release rises then falls whereas dehydroascorbic release falls (until
          12 hours after loading);                                                              [2 max]

          breastfeeding avoids allergies to proteins in cow’s milk;
          human milk naturally sterile;

    (b)   decreasing responsiveness to insulin;
          high blood glucose;
          glucose in urine;
          loss of weight / tiredness;
          increased production of urine;

    (c)   regulate diet/total calorie intake and exercise to ensure a balanced energy budget;
          low fat diet to avoid weight gain;

          do not go for long periods without meals to avoid large drop in blood glucose;

     (c)   weight-bearing machines require higher energy expenditure (than non weight-
           bearing);
           body trec highest energy expenditure and stationary cycle lowest;

           participants / no clear trend apparent;                                               [2 max]

     (d)   Advantages: [2 max]
           energy expenditure is higher so greater weight loss/greater use of
           carbohydrates/fats;
           shorter recovery times needed due to higher oxygen supply;
           heart rate is increased but not to an excessive level;
           higher ventilation rate means more aerobic respiration (although lactate levels
           indicate more anaerobic respiration as well);

           Disadvantages:
           possible strain on joints;
           body trec results in very high blood lactate values;
           increased heart rate potentially dangerous for obese subjects / too much stress for
           obese subjects (as indicated by high lactate levels);                                 [3 max]



B2. (a)    cardiac output/stroke volume increases more rapidly during exercise;
           heart rate increases more gradually during exercise;

     (b)   lactate can be converted to pyruvate in liver;
           pyruvate can then be converted into glucose (Cori cycle);
           glucose/pyruvate can then be used for aerobic respiration;
           additional oxygen is supplied during deep/fast ventilations after exercise;           [2 max]

     (c)   increase blood flow to muscles;
           stretch tendons and ligaments;
           improve flexibility of joints;

           in the effectiveness of warm up / placebo effect during scientific trials / mental
           preparation for intense exercise;                                                     [2 max]

          Ca2+ ions are released from the sarcoplasmic reticulum;
          binding sites for myosin heads are exposed;
          this allows cross-bridges between myosin and actin to form;            [2 max]

           decrease (in rate of photosynthesis) between pH 7 and pH 7.5;

           rate of photosynthesis falls again (slightly) at pH 9;                                 [2 max]

     (d)   uses hydrogen carbonate ions;
           uses stored carbon dioxide / carbon dioxide from respiration;                    [1 max]

     (e)   pH
           optimum pH may be less than 7;
           reducing the pH below 7 may lead to a higher rate (of photosynthesis);
           (but) enzyme activity can be affected by low pH;

           or

           Temperature
           optimum temperature may not be 15 ºC;
           enzyme activity is affected by temperature;

           or

           Light intensity
           light intensity may not be optimal/may be limiting;
           too low light intensity produces less ATP/NADPH + H+ ;
           higher light intensities may result in a higher rate (of photosynthesis);
           as light intensity/temperature increases rate of photosynthesis may not increase as
           another factor becomes limiting;                                                       [2 max]

          Lowest probability: 0.25 (Allow answers from 0.24–0.26)                                    [1]
          Both required for the mark.

          different sizes/feeding habits/habitat (shore versus open water) seem to contribute

          this could lead to speciation/formation of separate species in each lake;
          same varieties from different lakes do not show strong reproductive isolation/
          geographical isolation is a weak factor in speciation / no evidence of allopatric
          speciation;

          warm conditions/pools near geothermal vents/volcanic pools allow high reaction
          rates;
          evaporation of water allows organic (precursor) molecules to become more
          concentrated;
          high temperatures not desirable as organic molecules become unstable;
          clay minerals/metal ions may act as catalysts / clay forms a matrix for monomers
          to attach;                                                                              [2 max]

    (c)   early atmosphere was oxygen free;
          some prokaryotes could carry out chemosynthesis;
          cyanobacteria (and other varieties) developed the ability to photosynthesize;
          used water as hydrogen source so released oxygen;
          oxygen began to accumulate in the atmosphere;

           less leaves means less food/habitats / easier for predators to see invertebrates;
           defoliation occurs in winter/autumn and the cold may kill invertebrates;                 [2 max]

     (d)   (aquatic invertebrate flux) decreases because movement to the forest has occurred
           (by adult forms) / fewer aquatic invertebrates left in the stream so fewer are

           chemicals are passed (unaltered) from one trophic level to the next;
           chemicals become more concentrated in the bodies of each (subsequent) trophic
           level;

    (b)   UV light causes CFCs to release chlorine;
          CFCs cause ozone to form oxygen (by chlorine atoms reacting);
