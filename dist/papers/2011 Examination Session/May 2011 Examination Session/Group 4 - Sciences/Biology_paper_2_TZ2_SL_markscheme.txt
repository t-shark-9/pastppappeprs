General Marking Instructions
Subject Details:             Biology SL Paper 2 Markscheme
Mark Allocation

Candidates are required to answer ALL questions in Section A [30 marks] and ONE question in
Section B [20 marks]. Maximum total = [50 marks].

1.   A markscheme often has more marking points than the total allows. This is intentional. Do not award
     more than the maximum marks allowed for part of a question.

2.   Each marking point has a separate line and the end is signified by means of a semicolon (;).

3.   An alternative answer or wording is indicated in the markscheme by a slash (/). Either wording can
     be accepted.

4.   Words in brackets ( ) in the markscheme are not necessary to gain the mark.

5.   Words that are underlined are essential for the mark.

6.   The order of marking points does not have to be as in the markscheme, unless stated otherwise.

7.   If the candidate’s answer has the same “meaning” or can be clearly interpreted as being of
     equivalent significance, detail and validity as that in the markscheme then award the mark.
     Where this point is considered to be particularly relevant in a question it is emphasized by
     writing OWTTE (or words to that effect).

8.   Occasionally, a part of a question may require an answer that is required for subsequent
     marking points. If an error is made in the first marking point then it should be penalized.

9.   Only consider units at the end of a correct calculation.

Extended response questions - quality of construction

        Extended response questions for SL P2 carry a mark total of [20]. Of these marks, [18] are
         awarded for content and [2] for the quality of construction of the answer.

        Two aspects are considered:
            expression of relevant ideas with clarity
            structure of the answers.

        [1] quality mark is to be awarded when the candidate satisfies EACH of the following criteria.
         Thus [2] quality marks are awarded when a candidate satisfies BOTH criteria.

     Clarity of expression:
         The candidate has made a serious and full attempt to answer all parts of the question and the
         answers are expressed clearly enough to be understood with little or no re-reading.

     Structure of answer:
         The candidate has linked relevant ideas to form a logical sequence within at least two parts
         of the same question (e.g. within part a and within part b, or within part a and within part c
         etc. but not between part a and part b or between part a and part c etc.).
