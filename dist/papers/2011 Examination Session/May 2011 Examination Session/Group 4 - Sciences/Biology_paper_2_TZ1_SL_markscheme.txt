General Marking Instructions

Subject Details:             Biology SL Paper 2 Markscheme
Mark Allocation

Candidates are required to answer ALL questions in Section A [30 marks] and ONE question in
Section B [20 marks]. Maximum total = [50 marks].

1.   A markscheme often has more marking points than the total allows. This is intentional. Do not award
     more than the maximum marks allowed for part of a question.

2.   Each marking point has a separate line and the end is signified by means of a semicolon (;).

3.   An alternative answer or wording is indicated in the markscheme by a slash (/). Either wording can
     be accepted.

4.   Words in brackets ( ) in the markscheme are not necessary to gain the mark.

5.   Words that are underlined are essential for the mark.

6.   The order of marking points does not have to be as in the markscheme, unless stated otherwise.

7.   If the candidate’s answer has the same “meaning” or can be clearly interpreted as being of
     equivalent significance, detail and validity as that in the markscheme then award the mark.
     Where this point is considered to be particularly relevant in a question it is emphasized by
     writing OWTTE (or words to that effect).

8.   Occasionally, a part of a question may require an answer that is required for subsequent
     marking points. If an error is made in the first marking point then it should be penalized.

9.   Only consider units at the end of a correct calculation.

Section B
Extended response questions – quality of construction

      Extended response questions for SL P2 carry a mark total of [20]. Of these marks, [18] are
       awarded for content and [2] for the quality of construction of the answer.

      Two aspects are considered:
        expression of relevant ideas with clarity
        structure of the answers.

      [1] quality mark is to be awarded when the candidate satisfies EACH of the following criteria.
       Thus [2] quality marks are awarded when a candidate satisfies BOTH criteria.

     Clarity of expression:
     The candidate has made a serious and full attempt to answer all parts of the question and the
     answers are expressed clearly enough to be understood with little or no re-reading.

     Structure of answer:
     The candidate has linked relevant ideas to form a logical sequence within at least two parts of the
     same question (e.g. within part a and within part b, or within part a and within part c etc. but not
     between part a and part b or between part a and part c etc.).

                                               SECTION A

1.   (a)   (i)    (population) 1 and (population) 2 (both needed)                                      [1]

           (ii)   (population) 11/7/7 and 11                                                           [1]

           Both must be correct for the mark to be awarded, accept frequencies in form of
           ratio.

     (c)   (i)    greatest/great frequencies of PanIA at lowest/low latitudes / a rapid drop in
                  frequency at (60–65 degrees latitude) / lowest/low frequencies at

                  Answers which describe/imply the correct step-wise relationship should get
                  credit. Answers stating or implying a negative correlation alone should not
                  get credit.

           (ii)   lowest/low frequencies of PanIA at lowest/low temperatures / a rapid
                  increase in frequency at (8–10 degrees Celsius) / highest/high frequencies at
                  warmest/warm temperatures                                                            [1]
                  Answers which describe/imply the correct step-wise relationship should get
                  credit. Answers stating or implying a negative correlation alone should not
                  get credit.

     (d)   (cod with) PanIA allele selected/favoured/better adapted to warmer water;
           (cod with) PanIB allele selected/favoured/better adapted to colder water;
           cod that survive can reproduce and pass alleles on to offspring;                       [2 max]
           It takes a whole organism to reproduce in order to pass on the allele, hence we
           expect reference to the fish to gain this last marking point

     (e)   higher frequency of PanIA/PanIA PanIA (cod) in warm (surface) water;
           higher frequency of PanIB/PanIB PanIB (cod) in colder (deeper) water;

           further north;

           increase;
           PanIB PanIB (cod) may become extinct / frequency of PanIB allele may decrease;         [2 max]

           A duct is preferred to a line, but since this is a diagram, both are acceptable.



3.   (a)   (gel) electrophoresis                                                                     [1]

     (b)    diagram of food chain showing at least three organisms and two linkages with
            arrows showing direction of energy flow;
            trophic level is a step/position in the movement/flow of energy through an
            ecosystem;
            (in a field situation) observe which organisms eat each other;
            producer/name from example (first trophic level) does not eat other
            organisms/captures energy through photosynthesis;

     (b)   both lipids and carbohydrates are primary sources of energy for organisms;
           lipids store more energy per unit mass/per gram than carbohydrates / lipids
           generally provide 2 to 3 times the energy of carbohydrates for a given mass;
           lipids provide 38 kJ g–1/9 C g–1 whereas carbohydrates have 17 kJ g–1/4 C g–1;
           carbohydrates are easier to transport (than lipids) making their energy more
