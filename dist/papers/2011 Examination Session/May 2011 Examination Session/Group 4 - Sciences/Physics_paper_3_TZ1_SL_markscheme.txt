General Marking Instructions

Subject Details: Physics SL Paper 3 Markscheme
Mark Allocation

Candidates are required to answer questions from TWO of the Options [2 × 20 marks].
Maximum total = [40 marks]

1.    A markscheme often has more marking points than the total allows. This is intentional. Do not award
      more than the maximum marks allowed for part of a question.

2.    Each marking point has a separate line and the end is signified by means of a semicolon (;).

3.    An alternative answer or wording is indicated in the markscheme by a slash (/). Either wording can
      be accepted.

4.    Words in brackets ( ) in the markscheme are not necessary to gain the mark.

5.    Words that are underlined are essential for the mark.

6.    The order of marking points does not have to be as in the markscheme, unless stated otherwise.

7.    If the candidate’s answer has the same “meaning” or can be clearly interpreted as being of
      equivalent significance, detail and validity as that in the markscheme then award the mark.
      Where this point is considered to be particularly relevant in a question it is emphasized by
      writing OWTTE (or words to that effect).

8.    Occasionally, a part of a question may require an answer that is required for subsequent
      marking points. If an error is made in the first marking point then it should be penalized.

9.    Only consider units at the end of a calculation.

10.   Significant digits should only be considered in the final answer. Deduct 1 mark in the paper for
      an error of 2 or more digits unless directed otherwise in the markscheme.

                                         e.g. if the answer is 1.63:
                                                       2     reject

    (b)   (i)    wave from tuning fork travels down tube and is reflected;
                 incident and reflected waves interfere/superpose/combine/add together to

          (ii)   the surface of the water (in/at the bottom of the tube);                         [1]

          (iii) the length of the air column has changed;
                boundary conditions can no longer be met / the length is no longer equal to
                one quarter of a wavelength;
                hence a standing wave cannot form / resonance no longer occurs / natural
                frequency of air column no longer equal to frequency of sound;                    [3]

          moving observer intercepts more wavefronts per unit time / the time between

Option B — Quantum physics and nuclear physics

B1. light consists of photons/quanta/packets of energy;
    each photon has energy E = hf / photon energy depends on frequency;
    a certain amount of energy is required to eject an electron from the metal;
    if photon energy is less than this energy, no electrons are emitted;                     [4]

          = 1.89 eV
           or
           the photon of wavelength 658nm is the longest (in the emission graph);
           therefore it has the shortest frequency and lowest energy (from E = hf );
           therefore it arises from the transition between the –1.51eV and the –3.40eV
           energy levels which have a difference of 1.89eV;                                  [3]

(c)   at higher energy levels, energy levels become closer together;
      the energy differences between higher energy levels and the lower level (n = 2)
      become more equal;
      hence the difference in wavelength of emitted photons decreases / OWTTE;          [3]

           (iv) the spaceship is never completely inside the tunnel;
                because (according to observer B) the spaceship is longer than the tunnel;        [2]
                Apply ECF in all parts of question (b).

     (c)   observer B will not see the two flashes simultaneously;
           according to B, light 2 is moving to the left/towards observer B;
           since the speed of light is the same for both sources;
           the flash from light 2 reaches B before the flash from light 1;
           or
           according to B, the two flashes arrive at A simultaneously;
           according to B, A is moving to the left/away from light 2;
           since light from both sources moves with the same speed;
           for the flashes to be received by A at the same time, the flash from light 2 must be
           emitted first;                                                                         [4]
