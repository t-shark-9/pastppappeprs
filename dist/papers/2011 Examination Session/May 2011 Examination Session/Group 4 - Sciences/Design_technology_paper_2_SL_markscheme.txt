1.    Follow the markscheme provided, award only whole marks and mark only in RED.

2.    Where a mark is awarded, a tick/check () must be placed in the text at the precise point where it
      becomes clear that the candidate deserves the mark. One tick to be shown for each mark awarded.

3.    Sometimes, careful consideration is required to decide whether or not to award a mark. In these
      cases write a brief annotation to explain your decision. You are encouraged to write comments
      where it helps clarity, especially for moderation and re-marking. It should be remembered that the
      script may be returned to the candidate.

4.    Unexplained symbols or personal codes/notations are unacceptable.

5.    Record marks in the right-hand margin. For Section A this should be against each mark allocation
      shown in square brackets e.g. [2]. The total mark for a question must equal the number of ticks for
      the question.

6.    Do not circle sub-totals. Circle the total mark for the question in the right-hand margin at the end
      of the question.

7.    Where an answer to a part question is worth no marks, put a zero in the right-hand margin next to
      the square bracket.

8.    Where work is submitted on additional sheets the marks awarded should be shown as ticks and
      a note made on both the additional sheet and in the right-hand margin of the corresponding question
      part in the body of the script to transfer these marks to that question part in the script.

9.    Section A: Add together the total for each question and write it in the Examiner column on the
      cover sheet.
      Section B: Insert the total for each question in the Examiner column on the cover sheet.
      Total:       Add up the marks awarded and enter this in the box marked TOTAL in the
      Examiner column on the cover sheet.

10.   After entering the marks on the cover sheet check your addition to ensure that you have not made an
      error. Check also that you have transferred the marks correctly to the cover sheet. All scripts are
      checked and a note of all clerical errors will be given in feedback to examiners.

11.   If an answer extends over more than one page and no marks have been awarded on a section draw a
      diagonal line through that section to indicate that it has been marked.

12.   If a candidate has attempted more than the required number of questions within a paper or section
      of a paper, mark all the answers and use the marks of those answers that have the highest mark,
      even if the candidate has indicated the question(s) to be marked on the cover sheet.

13.   A mark should not be awarded where there is contradiction within an answer. Make a comment to
      this effect in the left-hand margin.

Subject Details: Design Technology SL Paper 2 Markscheme
Mark Allocation

Candidates are required to answer ALL questions in Section A (total 20 marks) ONE question in
Section B [20 marks]. Maximum total = 40 marks.

1.    A markscheme often has more marking points than the total allows. This is intentional. Do not
      award more than the maximum marks allowed for part of a question.

2.    Each marking point has a separate line and the end is signified by means of a semicolon (;).

3.    An alternative answer or wording is indicated in the markscheme by a slash (/) – either wording can
      be accepted.

4.    Words in brackets (   ) in the markscheme are not necessary to gain the mark.

5.    Words that are underlined are essential for the mark.

6.    The order of marking points does not have to be as in the markscheme, unless stated otherwise.

7.    If the candidate’s answer has the same “meaning” or can be clearly interpreted as being of
      equivalent significance, detail and validity as that in the markscheme then award the mark.
      Where this point is considered to be particularly relevant in a question it is emphasized by
      writing OWTTE (or words to that effect).

8.    Remember that many candidates are writing in a second language. Effective communication is
      more important than grammatical accuracy.

9.    Occasionally, a part of a question may require an answer that is required for subsequent marking
      points. If an error is made in the first marking point then it should be penalized. However, if the
      incorrect answer is used correctly in subsequent marking points then follow through marks should
      be awarded. Indicate this with ECF (error carried forward).

10.   Only consider units at the end of a calculation. Unless directed otherwise in the markscheme,
      unit errors should only be penalized once in the paper. Indicate this by writing –1(U) at the first
      point it occurs and U on the cover page.

11.   Do not penalise candidates for errors in significant figures, unless it is specifically referred to in
      the markscheme.

                                               SECTION A

1.   (a)   (i)    Award [1] for stating the number of pairs of sliding doors on each car.
                  8;                                                                                  [1]

                  8 10 12 10 8 48;                                                                    [1]

           (iii) Award [1] for identifying one advantage of the folding seats shown in
                 section A of the car in Figure 3 and [1] for a brief explanation [2 max].
                 can accommodate wheelchair users / provides space for luggage;
                 seats fold out of way to provide more room;

                  enables more flexible use of the car;
                  tube trains can get very busy at peak times;                                    [2 max]

     (b)   (i)    Award [1] for stating one reason why bright colours are used for
                  the handrails.
                  aesthetics;
                  increased visibility;
                  ease of maintenance;                                                            [1 max]

           (ii)   Award [1] for each distinct correct point in an explanation of how the
                  tubular sections for the handrails would have been produced [3 max].
                  extrusion of long tubular sections of steel;
                  cut to appropriate lengths;
                  finish to required colour with appropriate finish, e.g. heavy duty paint;       [3 max]

     (c)   (i)    Award [1] for identifying the adult percentile which would have been used
                  to determine the height for the hanging handholds and [1] for a brief
                  explanation [2 max].
                  5th percentile (female) vertical reach;
                  so that most adults would be able to reach the handhold;                            [2]

           (ii)   Award [1] for each point in an outline of one advantage of using the vertical
                  handrail shown in Figure 5 over the hanging handholds [2 max].
                  people can stand next to vertical rails or hold onto overhead rails;

2.   (a)   Award [1] for a definition of thermal expansion to the effect of:
           a measure of the degree of increase in dimensions/expansion                     of
           material/elongation of material when an object is heated;                                 [1]

     (b)   Award [1] for each of three distinct correct points in an explanation of one reason
           why the expansion joint shown in Figure 6 is an important consideration in the
           design of the bridge [3 max].
           in hot and cold weather a bridge would expand and contract;
           if the expansion joint were not there then the expansion would cause the bridge
           to crack;
           this would make the bridge unsafe;                                                        [3]



3.   (a)   Award [1] for a definition of assembly-line production to the effect of:
           the mass production of a product via a flow line based on the interchangeability
           of parts, pre-processing of materials, standardization and work division;                 [1]

     (b)   Award [1] for each of three distinct correct points in an explanation of the impact
           of assembly-line production on the workforce for a mechanized production
           process [3 max].
           job specialization;
           a worker would do one job repetitively;
           this would be monotonous and worker might get bored;

           the assembly-line runs continuously;
           this means that workers have to remain at station;
           they are not free to move around, e.g. to go to the toilet;

           repeating the same movements for hours can lead to repetitive strain injury;
           this may lead to increased levels of sickness absence;
           need to consider occupational safety;

           assembly line can be very noisy;
           this means that the workers will have to wear ear protection;
           they will not be able to converse normally with their colleagues;

           job creation;
           mechanized assembly lines require many people;
           who do not need expensive training;                                                   [3 max]

                                               SECTION B

4.   (a)   (i)    Award [1] for each of two advantages of using polypropene to make the seat
                  of the chair [2 max].
                  cheap;
                  durable;
                  lightweight;
                  non-absorbing surface/liquids do not soak in;
                  resistant to dirt;
                  easy to clean;
                  can be recycled;
                  suitable for injection moulding/low melting point;
                  little need for finishing;
                  available in a range of colours;
                  flexes for comfort;
                  toughness;
                  tensile strength;                                                                 [2 max]

           (ii)   Award [1] for each of two distinct correct points in a description of how
                  production of the chair in a range of sizes is an example of product
                  development [2 max].
                  variations to the product through variations in the sizes/colours makes it
                  suitable for use for children of different sizes/ages in schools;
                  the robust design of the Robin Day chair thus becomes the basis for a family
                  of products;                                                                          [2]

     (b)   (i)    Award [1] for each of two distinct correct points in a description of the
                  concept of break-even in relation to the manufacture of the chair [2 max].
                  fixed costs are divided by a break-even number determined by the
                  chair manufacturer;
                  this portion of the fixed costs is added to the variable costs of manufacturing
                  each chair;

                  at break-even point fixed costs are covered;
                  further sales means a profit can be made;                                         [2 max]

      (ii)   Award [1] for each of three distinct points in an explanation of one way
             in which injection moulding contributes to cost-effectiveness for the
             chair manufacturer in relation to the manufacture of the chair in a range
             of sizes [3 max].
             moulds for the range of chair sizes are expensive to produce;
             one mould needed for each chair size but each mould can produce a very
             large number of chairs;
             one injection moulding machine can accommodate moulds of various sizes
             so different machines are not needed;

             fixed costs high;
             variable costs low;
             quickly reach break-even for each size in the range then maximise profit;

             injection moulding is a rapid process;
             with very little waste;
             and good quality control;                                                         [3 max]

(c)   (i)    Award [1] for identifying how percentile range data for school children
             would contribute to the design of the different chair sizes and [1] for a brief
             explanation [2 max].
             the chair is made in different sizes to respond to different age groups/sizes
             of children;
             the 50th percentile for each age group would be used to determine the seat
             height and width of the chair;                                                    [2 max]

(ii)   Award [1] for each of three distinct correct points in an explanation of how
       design for materials, process and assembly are dominating constraints on
       the design of the chair [3 max] per strategy [9 max].
       Design for materials:
       material properties have to be taken into account in the design of the
       product, e.g. strength, stiffness, melting point;
       the designer tries to use materials with the optimum required properties;
       but matched to the manufacturing process/cost;
       so does not have to invest in new machinery/tooling;

       Design for process:
       manufacturer need designs to be produced using equipment available;
       to reduce the fixed costs of the process;
       process determines a number of aspects of the design;

       injection moulding requires material flow in the mould;
       if the chair/mould were not appropriately designed for material flow then a
       lot of manufacturing errors would occur;
       this would push up manufacturing costs;

       Design for assembly:
       reducing the number of parts makes the product easier to assemble;
       making the chair so that it can be assembled from one direction;
       makes it easier for assembly-line production;

       designing so only correct assembly is possible;
       useful, especially when semi-skilled labour or user assembly is used;
       also when safety issues would result from incorrect assembly;

       consideration of the joining of the product is important in relation to design
       for assembly;
       permanent joining or temporary joining can be considered;
       temporary joining, e.g. by use of snap fittings can be cheap and easy;

       design for assembly requires communication between designer and the
       manufacturing team;
       ensures all aspects of the assembly of the product are considered in
       the design;
       ensures design can be manufactured cost-effectively;                             [9 max]

5.   (a)   (i)    Award [1] for identifying a target market for the Balanzza Digital Luggage
                  Scale and [1] for a brief explanation [2 max].
                  frequent travellers, especially ones who travel on different airlines;
                  they can keep a check on the weight of their luggage and avoid penalties;

                  families who travel together;
                  they can use the Balanzza to distribute their luggage and minimize
                  penalties incurred;                                                             [2 max]

           (ii)   Award [1] for each of three distinct correct points in an explanation of why
                  the price of the final product would be a major constraint in the design
                  brief [3 max].
                  the product is about saving money;
                  the price has to be less than/about the same as the cost of the penalties
                  on first usage so that is represents value for money to the consumer;
                  if it costs more than the penalties it would not achieve its goal;              [3 max]

     (b)   (i)    Award [1] for each point in an outline of one difficulty the manufacturers of
                  the Balanzza Digital Luggage Scale would have in getting their product to
                  diffuse into the marketplace [2 max].
                  it is a novel product;
                  there is no/low awareness of the product in the marketplace;

                  many people do not fly often enough to justify the purchase;
                  if flying occasionally they can use other scales so no need for the Balanzza;

                  there are no competing products;
                  have to develop awareness of the product from scratch so people become
                  interested in it and want one;
