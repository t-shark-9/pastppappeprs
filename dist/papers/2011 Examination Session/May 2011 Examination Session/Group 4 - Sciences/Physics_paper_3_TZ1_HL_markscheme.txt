General Marking Instructions

Subject Details: Physics HL Paper 3 Markscheme
Mark Allocation

Candidates are required to answer questions from TWO of the Options [2 × 30 marks].
Maximum total = [60 marks].

1.    A markscheme often has more marking points than the total allows. This is intentional. Do not award
      more than the maximum marks allowed for part of a question.

2.    Each marking point has a separate line and the end is signified by means of a semicolon (;).

3.    An alternative answer or wording is indicated in the markscheme by a slash (/). Either wording can
      be accepted.

4.    Words in brackets ( ) in the markscheme are not necessary to gain the mark.

5.    Words that are underlined are essential for the mark.

6.    The order of marking points does not have to be as in the markscheme, unless stated otherwise.

7.    If the candidate’s answer has the same “meaning” or can be clearly interpreted as being of
      equivalent significance, detail and validity as that in the markscheme then award the mark.
      Where this point is considered to be particularly relevant in a question it is emphasized by
      writing OWTTE (or words to that effect).

8.    Occasionally, a part of a question may require an answer that is required for subsequent
      marking points. If an error is made in the first marking point then it should be penalized.

9.    Only consider units at the end of a calculation.

10.   Significant digits should only be considered in the final answer. Deduct 1 mark in the paper for
      an error of 2 or more digits unless directed otherwise in the markscheme.

                                         e.g. if the answer is 1.63:
                                                       2     reject
                                                     1.6     accept
                                                   1.63      accept
                                                  1.631      accept

    (b)    star B has lower temperature;
           star B has (slightly) larger luminosity / stars have approximately same luminosity;
           surface area calculated from L=σAT 4, so star B has larger surface area/diameter /
           to give the same/similar luminosity at lower temperature, star B must have bigger

           Do not award a mark for the conversion from AU to pc.

    (d)    the parallax angle is too small to be measured accurately / the distance is greater
           than the limit for stellar parallax, which is 100 pc;                                 [1]

H3. (a)     light from two beams causes an interference pattern at the detector/telescope;
            due to the path difference/difference in speed of light relative to aether between
            two beams;
            if the apparatus were rotated (by 90 degrees) the interference pattern would
            change/shift (if the aether existed);
            the amount of shift/change would allow the speed of the Earth (relative to the
            aether) to be determined;                                                                      [4]


    (b)     the orientation of the apparatus had no effect on the interference pattern;
            hence the speed of light does not depend on the speed of the source/speed of
            observer / there is no absolute reference frame / aether does not exist;                       [2]
