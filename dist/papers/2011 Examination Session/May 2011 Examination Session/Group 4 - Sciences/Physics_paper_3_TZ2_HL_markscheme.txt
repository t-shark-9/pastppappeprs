General Marking Instructions
Subject Details: Physics HL Paper 3 Markscheme
Mark Allocation

Candidates are required to answer questions from TWO of the Options [2 × 30 marks].
Maximum total = [60 marks].

1.    A markscheme often has more marking points than the total allows. This is intentional. Do not award
      more than the maximum marks allowed for part of a question.

2.    Each marking point has a separate line and the end is signified by means of a semicolon (;).

3.    An alternative answer or wording is indicated in the markscheme by a slash (/). Either wording can
      be accepted.

4.    Words in brackets ( ) in the markscheme are not necessary to gain the mark.

5.    Words that are underlined are essential for the mark.
                     U          U




6.    The order of marking points does not have to be as in the markscheme, unless stated otherwise.

7.    If the candidate’s answer has the same “meaning” or can be clearly interpreted as being of
      equivalent significance, detail and validity as that in the markscheme then award the mark.
      Where this point is considered to be particularly relevant in a question it is emphasized by
      writing OWTTE (or words to that effect).

8.    Occasionally, a part of a question may require an answer that is required for subsequent
      marking points. If an error is made in the first marking point then it should be penalized.

9.    Only consider units at the end of a calculation.

10.   Significant digits should only be considered in the final answer. Deduct 1 mark in the paper for
      an error of 2 or more digits unless directed otherwise in the markscheme.

                                         e.g. if the answer is 1.63:
                                                       2     reject
                                                     1.6     accept
                                                   1.63      accept

     (d)    speed of light is independent of speed of source;

            (ii)     as quarks separate the force between them is constant;
                     (so) energy required to release single quark increases with distance;
                     these energies exceed the threshold for meson (pair) production;                  [3]

      (c)   individual machines are too expensive/complex for one nation to design/build;
            international co-operation leads to international understanding / historical example
            of co-operation / co-operation always allows science to proceed;
            large quantities of data are produced that are more than one institution/research
            group can handle;
            co-operation allows effective analysis;                                                [2 max]
