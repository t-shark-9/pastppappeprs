1.    Follow the markscheme provided, award only whole marks and mark only in RED.

2.    Where a mark is awarded, a tick/check () must be placed in the text at the precise point where it
      becomes clear that the candidate deserves the mark. One tick to be shown for each mark awarded.

3.    Sometimes, careful consideration is required to decide whether or not to award a mark. In these cases
      write a brief annotation to explain your decision. You are encouraged to write comments where it
      helps clarity, especially for moderation and re-marking. It should be remembered that the script may
      be returned to the candidate.

4.    Unexplained symbols or personal codes/notations are unacceptable.

5.    Record marks in the right-hand margin against each mark allocation shown in square brackets e.g. [2].
      The total mark for a question must equal the number of ticks for the question.

6.    Do not circle sub-totals. Circle the total mark for the question in the right-hand margin at the end of
      the question.

7.    Where an answer to a part question is worth no marks, put a zero in the right-hand margin next to the
      square bracket.

8.    Where work is submitted on additional sheets the marks awarded should be shown as ticks and a note
      made on both the additional sheet and in the right-hand margin of the corresponding question part in
      the body of the script.

9.    For each Option: Add the totals for each question in the Option and write it in the Examiner column
                       on the cover sheet.
      Total:           Add the marks awarded and enter this in the box marked TOTAL in the
                       Examiner column on the cover sheet.

10.   After entering the marks on the cover sheet check your addition to ensure that you have not made
      an error. Check also that you have transferred the marks correctly to the cover sheet. All scripts are
      checked and a note of all clerical errors will be given in feedback to examiners.

11.   If an answer extends over more than one page and no marks have been awarded on a section draw a
      diagonal line through that section to indicate that it has been marked.

12.   If a candidate has attempted more than the required number of questions within a paper or section of
      a paper, mark all the answers and use the marks of those answers that have the highest mark, even if
      the candidate has indicated the question(s) to be marked on the cover sheet.

13.   Mark positively. Give candidates credit for what they have achieved and for what they have
      got correct, rather than penalizing them for what they have got wrong. A mark should not be
      awarded where there is contradiction within an answer. Make a comment to this effect in the left
      hand margin.

Subject Details: Design Technology SL Paper 3 Markscheme
Mark Allocation

Candidates are required to answer questions from ONE of the Options [1 × 30 marks].
Maximum total = [30 marks]

1.    A markscheme often has more marking points than the total allows. This is intentional. Do not
      award more than the maximum marks allowed for part of a question.

2.    Each marking point has a separate line and the end is signified by means of a semicolon (;).

3.    An alternative answer or wording is indicated in the markscheme by a slash (/) – either wording
      can be accepted.

4.    Words in brackets (   ) in the markscheme are not necessary to gain the mark.

5.    Words that are underlined are essential for the mark.

6.    The order of marking points does not have to be as in the markscheme, unless stated otherwise.

7.    If the candidate’s answer has the same “meaning” or can be clearly interpreted as being of
      equivalent significance, detail and validity as that in the markscheme then award the mark.
      Where this point is considered to be particularly relevant in a question it is emphasized by
      writing OWTTE (or words to that effect).

8.    Remember that many candidates are writing in a second language. Effective communication is
      more important than grammatical accuracy.

9.    Occasionally, a part of a question may require an answer that is required for subsequent
      marking points. If an error is made in the first marking point then it should be penalized.
      However, if the incorrect answer is used correctly in subsequent marking points then follow
      through marks should be awarded. Indicate this with ECF (error carried forward).

10.   Only consider units at the end of a calculation. Unless directed otherwise in the markscheme,
      unit errors should only be penalized once in the paper. Indicate this by writing –1(U) at the first
      point it occurs and U on the cover page.

11.   Do not penalize candidates for errors in significant figures unless it is specifically referred to in
      the markscheme.

Option A — Food science and technology

A1. (a)    Award [1] for stating the percentage of the GDA for energy for an average adult
           woman provided by a cheeseburger, large fries and medium chocolate
           milkshake meal.
           15 + 23 + 21 = 59 %;
           1170/2000 = 58.5 %;                                                             [1 max]

     (b)   Award [1] for each point in an outline of one reason why a balanced diet should
           contain fat [2 max].
           fat acts as a vehicle to help the absorption of fat-soluble vitamins;
           these prevent fat-soluble vitamin deficiencies;

           fat provides energy;
           low fat diets may not provide enough energy;

           some fatty acids are essential;
           they cannot be produced by the body and must be provided by the diet for health;      [2 max]

     (c)   Award [1] for each of three distinct correct points in an explanation of one
           implication of excess fat intake for health [3 max].
           high dietary fat intakes, especially of saturated fat, can lead to increased levels
           of cholesterol;
           this can lead to coronary heart disease/obesity;
           resulting in poor health;                                                                 [3]
                                                  –7–               M11/4/DESTE/SP3/ENG/TZ0/XX/M


A2. (a)    Award [1] for stating the range of body mass index (BMI) that is considered to
           be overweight.
           25–29.9;                                                                               [1]

     (b)   Award [1] for each point in an outline of one limitation of using BMI as a health
           indicator [2 max].
           BMI measures total body weight not the amount of fat a person is carrying;
           fat may not be responsible for the weight they carry;

           athletes, e.g. rugby players and weight lifters, and people who are naturally stocky
           often have a BMI indicating they are overweight;
           their BMI is higher due to extra muscle/bone mass not because of excess body fat;

           some athletes, e.g. long distance runners, will be underweight according to
           their BMI;
           this is due to low body fat and aerobic slow twitch muscle fibres, which develop
           naturally as a result of their particular sport;

           elderly people and people who have been ill may have lost muscle mass;
           they will appear to be underweight although it is normal to lose muscle mass/body
           fat in old age/poor health;

           a BMI in the normal range does not necessarily indicate someone is in
           good health;
           they may also be carrying more body fat than is good for them;        [2 max]



A3. (a)    Award [1] for stating the type of spoilage and [1] for a brief explanation [2 max].
           microbiological spoilage;
           mould/fungus is growing on the tomato;                                                 [2]

     (b)   Award [1] for each point in an outline of how sun drying of tomatoes can be used
           to preserve them [2 max].
           lowers water activity/reduces water content;
           this prevents bacterial growth;                                                        [2]



A4. Award [1] for each point in an outline of one important consideration relating to the
    selection of the members of a taste panel [2 max].
    taste panel members must match the target market for the product, e.g. children
    or adults;
    foods designed for one target market may not suit the taste of other markets;                 [2]
                                                  –8–               M11/4/DESTE/SP3/ENG/TZ0/XX/M


A5. Award [1] for each of three distinct correct points in an explanation of each of two
    distinct lifestyle issues which have contributed to the growing market for organic
    products in some countries [3 max] per issue [6 max].
    increased health awareness and concerns about food scares, e.g. mad cow disease,
    salmonella in eggs;
    people are more interested/concerned about where food comes from;
    organic products often have a known provenance;

     fashion and media influences;
     it is “cool” to be organic;
     makes a statement (ideopleasure);

     ethical considerations;
     concerns about factory farming and animal rights issues;
     organic produce seen to be more appropriate;

     supermarkets have promoted organic produce;
     this gives it a higher consumer profile;
     although more expensive, people are prepared to pay a premium for organic products as
     they are perceived to be better;

     increase in leisure time;
     more people have the opportunity to grow produce;
     and guidance is readily available;

     taste/flavour;
     many consumers think that organic produce tastes better;
     because they grow under natural conditions;

     marketing of “grow your own” kits by DIY stores etc.;
     encourages consumers to produce their own food;
     by providing seeds/plants in containers with nutrients/instructions;                    [6 max]

A6. Award [1] for each of three distinct points in an explanation of each of three reasons for
    the increased incidence of food allergies and food intolerance in developed countries
    [3 max] for each factor [9 max].
    better diagnosis of food intolerance;
    provides better data on food intolerance;
    although still may be underestimating extent of food intolerance;

     people eat a wider range of foods than they may have done previously;
     travel, the media, availability of different foods has increased;
     foods introduced later in life may cause more problems than those introduced early
     in life;

     increased use of food additives/more exposure to environmental chemicals;
     trigger allergic reactions;
     results in increased food allergies/intolerance;

     increased sanitation;
     results in removal of helpful bacteria from environment and gut;
     probiotic bacteria, e.g. from probiotic yogurt, may improve food/lactose tolerance;

     genetics;
     allergies handed down from generation to generation;
     creates an on-going problem;

     increase in manufacture of processed foods;
     with traces/ingredients of trigger foods;
     e.g. nuts/dairy;                                                                            [9 max]

C6. Award [1] for each of three distinct correct points in a discussion of the use of
    computer-integrated manufacture (CIM) for a car manufacturer [3 max] for each of
    three advantages/disadvantages [9 max].
    Advantages:
    can operate just-in-time (JIT) system;
    raw materials/third part components ordered to requirements;
    no need for storage facilities (parts/products);

     vehicle produced to customer order and specification;
     keeps costs down;
     makes car manufacturer more competitive in the market-place;

     assembly checked for quality throughout;
     removes errors;
     reduces wastage;

     complete process controlled by machines;
     reduces labour costs;
     makes car manufacturer more competitive in the market-place;

     customer satisfaction;
     more opportunities for customization;
     reduces lead time and distribution to customer;

     Disadvantages:
     set-up costs are high;
     redundancy costs high;
     (re)training costs are high;
     has to be seen as a long-term investment;

     integration of machines from different suppliers into CIM system can be problematic;
     different machines (such as CNC, conveyors and robots) use different communication
     protocols;
     different machines may have different maintenance requirements, e.g. lengths of time
     for charging/changing the batteries;

     staff morale;
     data integrity for machine control is critical;
     needs highly-skilled people to ensure proper safeguards for system;
     jobs are very different;
     causes redundancy/(re)training;

     reliability;
     CIM is a highly complex system;
     failure of any part of the system undermines consumer confidence/the whole process;    [9 max]
