General Marking Instructions

   Assistant Examiners (AEs) will be contacted by their team leader (TL) through Scoris™, by e-mail
   or telephone – if through Scoris™ or by e-mail, please reply to confirm that you have downloaded
   the markscheme from IBIS. The purpose of this initial contact is to allow AEs to raise any queries
   they have regarding the markscheme and its interpretation. AEs should contact their team leader
   through Scoris™ or by e-mail at any time if they have any problems/queries during the marking
   process.



If you have any queries on administration please contact:

1.   Follow the markscheme provided, award only whole marks and mark only in RED.

2.   Where a mark is awarded, a tick/check () must be placed in the text at the precise point where it
     becomes clear that the candidate deserves the mark. One tick to be shown for each mark
     awarded.

3.   Sometimes, careful consideration is required to decide whether or not to award a mark. In these
     cases write a brief annotation to explain your decision. You are encouraged to write comments
     where it helps clarity, especially for re-marking purposes. Use a text box for these additional
     comments. It should be remembered that the script may be returned to the candidate.

4.   Personal codes/notations are unacceptable.

5.   Make sure that the question you are about to mark is highlighted in the right hand window.

6.   Where an answer to a part question is worth no marks, put a zero in the right hand window.

7.   Check every page carefully.

8.   Mark positively. Give candidates credit for what they have achieved and for what they have got
     correct, rather than penalizing them for what they have got wrong. However, a mark should not be
     awarded where there is contradiction within an answer. Make a comment to this effect using a text
     box or the “CON” stamp.

9.   “NR” should only be used once a script is completely marked and for complete questions not
     attempted.

Subject Details: Environmental Systems and Societies SLP1 Markscheme
General

A markscheme often has more marking points than the total allows. This is intentional. Do not award
more than the maximum marks allowed for part of a question.

When deciding upon alternative answers by candidates to those given in the markscheme, consider the
following points:

         Each marking point has a separate line and the end is signified by means of a semicolon (;).

         An alternative answer or wording is indicated in the markscheme by a “/”. Either wording can
          be accepted.

         Words in ( … ) in the markscheme are not necessary to gain the mark.

         Words that are underlined are essential for the mark.

         The order of points does not have to be as written (unless stated otherwise).

         If the candidate’s answer has the same meaning or can be clearly interpreted as being the same
          as that in the markscheme, then award the mark. Where this point is considered to be
          particularly relevant in a question it is emphasized by writing OWTTE (or words to that effect).

         Mark positively. Give candidates credit for what they have achieved, and for what they have got
          correct, rather than penalizing them for what they have got wrong.

         Remember that many candidates are writing in a second language. Effective communication is
          more important than grammatical accuracy.

         Occasionally, a part of a question may require a calculation whose answer is required for
          subsequent parts. If an error is made in the first part then it should be penalized. However, if the
          incorrect answer is used correctly in subsequent parts then follow through marks should
          be awarded. Indicate this with “ECF”, error carried forward.

         Units should always be given where appropriate. Omission of units should only be penalized
          once. Indicate this by “–1(U)” at the first point it occurs. Ignore this, if marks for units are
          already specified in the markscheme.

         Do not penalize candidates for errors in significant figures, unless it is specifically referred to in
          the markscheme.

           greater amounts of transport/travel by individuals in stage 4, so more carbon
           emissions;
           more imported goods in stage 4, so more pollutants/food miles;
           greater production of domestic waste in stage 4 so more area needed to absorb it;
           greater levels of industrialization in stage 4 lead to more pollutants;               [3 max]

           increases producer bar / decreases higher trophic levels;
           e.g. livestock farming
           increases primary consumer bar / decreases secondary and tertiary consumers;
           e.g. trophy hunting / hunting
           removes top carnivores;

     (e)   loss to respiration by primary consumers means there is less energy for the next
           trophic level;

           less available for the next trophic level;
           most primary consumers/herbivores are not eaten in this ecosystem;

           aquatic food production systems;
           sunlight is absorbed/reflected by the water / less solar radiation reaches aquatic
           plants/phytoplankton;
           most aquatic animals are poikilotherms so lose less heat to stay alive so more can
           be passed on to the next trophic level;

                  Highest CO2 emissions from land use change: Indonesia;                          [1 max]
                  Both required for [1].

           (ii)   these countries (Brazil, Indonesia, Malaysia) all have high rates of
                  deforestation of tropical rainforest;
                  burning rainforests releases CO2;
                  loss of rainforests means that these trees cannot absorb excess CO2;
                  these countries (Brazil, Indonesia, Malaysia) are relatively under-developed/
                  have low industrialization/low car use/low use of fossil fuels;
                  these countries (Brazil, Indonesia, Malaysia) have high initial forest
                  coverage (compared with others);                                                [2 max]

           (iii) there is a net afforestation/tree planting in the USA / forested land area may
                 increase due to plantations/secondary forest/succession;                             [1]

     (b)
                                                      Method of reducing
                  Human activity
                                                 emissions of greenhouse gases

                                          use carbon capture and storage / replace
            Generating electricity by     fossil fuels with renewable energy sources
              burning fossil fuels        for electricity generation / reduce energy
                                          consumption / reduce energy wastage;


                                          fewer ruminants (so less methane released) /
                  Livestock farming       change diet of ruminants (to reduce methane
                                          production) / convert land to arable farming;


                                          using public transport/car pools/electric
                    Driving a car         cars/energy efficient cars / walking / cycling
                                          / taxes on four-wheel drive vehicles/SUVs;
                                                                                                     [3]
           Allow any other reasonable suggestions.

6.   (a)   solar / wind / tidal;                                                                    [1]
           Award [1] for any two of the above.

     (b)   sees nuclear as a risky alternative to other sources;
           oil economy/fossil fuels seen as finite/polluting and need for alternatives;
           sees nuclear as a clean alternative/only source that is big enough to meet
           energy needs;
           implies cars will not continue to run on fossil fuels;
           suggests that neither renewable sources nor nuclear are viable alternatives to oil
           for cars;
           general public confused over which energy source should be developed;
           political message of nuclear being unsafe;                                           [2 max]
           Accept any other reasonable interpretation.

     (c)   the maximum number of a species/load that can be sustainably supported by a
           given environment / the maximum number of a species/load that a given
           environment can sustain;                                                                 [1]

     (d)   because carrying capacity is not just about the population density but also about
           the resources available;
           because the current rates of resource usage may not be sustainable;
           Australia’s water supply is limited (because of low precipitation in some areas);
           large parts of Australia cannot support many people;
           parts of Australia’s deserts have very low (net) productivity;
           Australia is mostly desert in the centre;                                            [1 max]
