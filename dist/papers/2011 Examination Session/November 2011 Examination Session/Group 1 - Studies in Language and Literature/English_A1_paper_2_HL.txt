Answer one essay question only. You must base your answer on at least two of the Part 3 works you

Drama

1.    How do playwrights advance their purposes by using comic elements which are either verbal
      or physical? Consider with respect to at least two plays you have studied.


2.    “A play is about one thing and that thing is what the hero is trying to get.” How far can you
      agree that this statement is a valid analysis of the actions of the protagonist in at least two plays
      you have studied?



Poetry

3.    The full meaning of poems can be said to arise not only from the words and the sounds but also from
      pauses and spaces and other ways of connecting and separating words and lines. These different
      techniques can be either heard or seen. How far have at least two poets in your study made use of
      such aspects in conjunction with words and sounds?


4.    “Poetry sets out to de-familiarize words.” How have at least two poets in your study used
      particular words in ways that have made them stand out and achieve particular effects?



Prose: The Novel and Short Story

5.    “Every work of fiction needs an element of ‘good old-fashioned storytelling’.” With reference to
      at least two works you have studied, show how different writers have made use of the techniques
      of storytelling and to what effect.


6.    Writers must usually provide reasons for how characters behave, what they say, and their decisions.
      By what means, and how effectively, have both obvious and/or secret motivations been made
      convincing in at least two works you have studied?

Prose: Other than the Novel and Short Story

7.    Sometimes writers of autobiographies, travel narratives, letters and essays will adopt an ironic
      view of the material. Either through tone or the inclusion of particular anecdotes, they treat their
      subject in a satirical way. What use have at least two writers in your study made of irony and
      what is its effect?


8.    In a single storyline, such as appear in travel narratives and autobiographies, and even letters and
      essays, writers often find ways to avoid the limitations of a chronological account. In what ways
      have at least two writers in your study varied their works?



General Questions on Literature

9.    Sometimes literary works proceed in slow and measured ways and sometimes their pace is
      accelerated, almost leaving the reader puzzled or frustrated. How have at least two writers in
      your study used pace to produce interesting effects in their works?


10.   Sometimes works of literature succeed because they present vivid portraits of interdependence,
      whether it be between people and places, or with other people or the natural world. In what ways
      have at least two works you have studied portrayed such interdependence?


11.   “Any literary work that aspires to the condition of art must forget politics.” Deciding what is meant
      by this statement, consider how well it does or does not measure up as a description of works by
      at least two writers you have studied.


12.   Myths defined in various ways enliven works of their own era and sometimes appear in some form
      in works written much later. In the works of at least two writers you have studied, explore the use
      and the impact of myths and mythmaking.
