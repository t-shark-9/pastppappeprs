Write a commentary on one of the following:

1.

                    The room was full of people, young black men and women, even a few children. As her
            apprehension grew into a sudden shyness, Devi reassured herself that this was just like India—
            the throng of voices competing with the loud, blaring music, the high-pitched voices of excited
            children in the background.
      5             They spoke to each other, over the music, in a shorthand that fascinated Devi, but she
            could not bring herself to play impostor and speak like them.
                    The more serious conversations, carried out in little huddles in various corners of the room,
            were about being black in white America. Devi leaned forward to listen to an intense young
            woman with a spectacular head of a hundred little plaits. Her frizzy, snake-like braids were held
     10     in place with blue and green beads at regular intervals.
                    “So this nurse—all polite and freezing cold—I had paid for the hospital room, see—said,
            ‘I’ll take the baby to the nursery for the night, you get some rest alone.’ She didn’t want me to be
            disturbed by my baby. ‘Disturbed!’ I screamed into her icy face. ‘When are you people going to
            learn that black love is black wealth?’”
     15             Devi saw the principle of the thing, she admired this beautiful spitfire1 who was so sure
            of her rights, and of the inevitable chorus of confirmation she would draw out of her audience.
            But Devi also found she had less and less to say, and she spent the entire evening quiet, watching.
            The music throbbed in her head, and she listened to snatches of conversation, words that drifted
            by and that she recognized, but separate, fragmented, like words in a foreign language she had
     20     recently learnt, but still could not put together to make sense.
                    Devi sat surrounded by people, in increasing isolation, terrified of drawing attention
            to herself, but aching for any means to do just that.
                    Hours later, her eyes watering in the smoke-filled room, she remembered she had
            brought the host an Indian gift, a wall hanging of cotton cloth, hand-printed with vegetable dye.
     25     The host held it up for them all to see, and they looked at the blue, baby-faced man on the cloth,
            bare-chested and crowned with a peacock feather, dancing as he played the flute. For the
            first time, the image struck Devi as almost grotesque: a grown man, practically naked, wearing a
            perpetual2 baby-mask.
                    “That’s Krishna, the dark god who loved milk, butter and women,” said Devi.
     30             “They couldn’t bear to have a black god, so they made him blue, huh?” said the intent young
            woman Devi had earlier admired. She smiled, but her voice was edged with contempt.
                    Devi laughed with the rest of them, but she knew she had brought the wrong gift. A brass
            goddess holding a lamp could have been used as an ethnic ashtray. Or safer still, a bottle of
            wine. It would have been less original, but it would not have set her apart from the others with
     35     such finality.

                                                             The Express

                                   After the first powerful, plain manifesto
                                   The black statement of pistons1, without more fuss
                                   But gliding like a queen, she leaves the station.
                                   Without bowing and with restrained unconcern
                              5    She passes the houses which humbly crowd outside,
                                   The gasworks, and at last the heavy page
                                   Of death, printed by gravestones in the cemetery.
                                   Beyond the town, there lies the open country
                                   Where, gathering speed, she acquires mystery,
                            10     The luminous self-possession of ships on ocean.
                                   It is now she begins to sing—at first quite low
                                   Then loud, and at last with a jazzy madness—
                                   The song of her whistle screaming at curves,
                                   Of deafening tunnels, brakes, innumerable bolts.
                            15     And always light, aerial, underneath,
                                   Retreats the elate2 metre of her wheels.
                                   Steaming through metal landscape on her lines,
                                   She plunges new eras of white happiness,
                                   Where speed throws up strange shapes, broad curves
                            20     And parallels clean like trajectories3 from guns.
                                   At last, further than Edinburgh or Rome,
                                   Beyond the crest of the world, she reaches night
                                   Where only a low stream-line brightness
                                   Of phosphorus on the tossing hills is light.
                            25     Ah, like a comet through flame, she moves entranced,
                                   Wrapt in her music no bird song, no, nor bough
                                   Breaking with honey buds, shall ever equal.
