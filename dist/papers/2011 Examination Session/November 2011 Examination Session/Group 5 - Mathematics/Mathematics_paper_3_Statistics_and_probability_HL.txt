Please start each question on a new page. Full marks are not necessarily awarded for a correct answer
with no working. Answers must be supported by working and/or explanations. In particular, solutions
found from a graphic display calculator should be supported by suitable working, e.g. if graphs are used to
find a solution, you should sketch these as part of your answer. Where an answer is incorrect, some marks
may be given for a correct method, provided this is shown by written working. You are therefore advised
to show all working.

      The weight of tea in Supermug tea bags has a normal distribution with mean 4.2 g
      and standard deviation 0.15 g. The weight of tea in Megamug tea bags has a normal
      distribution with mean 5.6 g and standard deviation 0.17 g.

      (a)   Find the probability that a randomly chosen Supermug tea bag contains more
            than 3.9 g of tea.                                                                  [2 marks]

      (b)   Find the probability that, of two randomly chosen Megamug tea bags,
            one contains more than 5.4 g of tea and one contains less than 5.4 g of tea.        [4 marks]

      (c)   Find the probability that five randomly chosen Supermug tea bags contain a total
            of less than 20.5 g of tea.                                                         [4 marks]

      (d)   Find the probability that the total weight of tea in seven randomly chosen
            Supermug tea bags is more than the total weight in five randomly chosen
            Megamug tea bags.                                                                   [5 marks]

      Neil wants the opinion of teachers on a proposal to change the Mathematics HL
      curriculum. A questionnaire is sent to a large number of teachers asking for their
      opinions on the proposal. Of the 200 replies he receives, 160 are in favour of
      the proposal. Assume that these teachers are a random sample from the population.

      (a)   Test, at the 5 % level, the hypothesis that the proportion of the population in
            favour of the proposal is 0.75 against the alternative that it is more than 0.75.   [4 marks]

      (b)   Find a 95 % confidence interval for the proportion of the population in favour of
            the proposal.                                                                       [3 marks]

      The random variable X represents the lifetime in hours of a battery. The lifetime may
      be assumed to be a continuous random variable X with a probability density function
      given by f ( x) = λ e − λ x , where x ≥ 0 .

      (a)   Name this distribution and state its mean.                                           [1 mark]

      The continuous random variable U has a uniform distribution on [0 , 1] . The random
      variable X is defined as follows:
