Answer all the questions.

1.    Consider the two-dimensional array  Data and program fragment shown below.

      public void amazing(int[][] a, int N)
      {
        int t;

            for (int i = 0; i < N; i = i + 1)
            {
              for (int j = i; j < N; j = j + 1)
              {
                t = a[i][j];
                a[i][j] = a[j][i];
                a[j][i] = t;
              }
            }
      }

      (a)     (i)    Copy and complete the trace table started below for the call
                     amazing(Data, 3).                                                               [3 marks]

                                                        i         j
                                                        0         0




              (ii)   State the contents of the array  Data after each pass through the outer loop.   [3 marks]

      (b)     As written, the method also performs its basic operation on the diagonal elements,
              which are the elements  Data[0][0],  Data[1][1],  Data[2][2].

              (i)    Outline why the operation on the diagonal elements is unnecessary.              [1 mark]

              (ii)   Outline the changes needed to eliminate the problem in part (i).                [2 marks]

      (c)     Construct a method that accepts a two-dimensional array with an equal number
              of rows and columns and returns the product (multiplication) of the values in the
              diagonal elements of the array.                                                        [4 marks]

      (d)     Construct a method that accepts a two-dimensional array with an equal number
              of rows and columns and returns an array in which each element contains the
              sum of the corresponding row in the two-dimensional array.                             [7 marks]

2.    CW Express is a parcel delivery service.  Customers who send a parcel are not charged
      until their parcel has been delivered. The amount charged depends on the weight of
      the parcel.  A computer system is used to keep track of the parcels and to charge
      the customers.

      (a)   Construct a class for  Parcel objects (you do not need to write methods).  
            The class contains the following variables:

            •   parcel ID number (parcelID)
            •   weight of the parcel (parcelWeight)
            •   customer address (customerAddr)
            •   delivery address (deliveryAddr)
            •   the parcel has been delivered (isDelivered)
            •   the customer has paid (isPaid).                                                    [4 marks]

      When a driver returns from delivering a parcel, they update the data in the computer
      to show that delivery was completed successfully.

      An accountant uses a computer to get a list of all the parcels that have been successfully
      delivered and not yet paid for.

      (b)   Describe two types of users who use the CW Express computer system and the
            type of data access that each needs.                                                   [4 marks]

      (c)   Outline why access to some parts of the data should be restricted to
            particular users.                                                                      [2 marks]

      (d)   Describe two procedures that CW Express employees can follow to prevent
            unauthorized access to the data.                                                       [4 marks]

      An array  allParcels is used to store the  Parcel objects.

      (e)   Construct a method that outputs a list of parcel ID numbers for all the parcels
            that have been delivered but not yet paid for.                                         [6 marks]

3.    This question requires the use of the case study.

      (a)   Each component system in Heathrow Terminal 5 (T5) was tested before the
            terminal was opened to the public.  A variety of testing methods were used.

            (i)    Define the term  parallel running.                                             [2 marks]

            (ii)   Explain why simulations were used in testing the new baggage handling
                   system.                                                                        [4 marks]

            (iii) Identify two factors that should be considered when selecting a
                  testing method.                                                                 [2 marks]

      (b)   Ground services in T5 include a fleet of electric carts that help disabled
            passengers to move between different parts of the airport.   Each cart has an
            onboard computer that connects with the airport computer system to indicate its
            location and to receive instructions.

            (i)    Outline a suitable method of data communication between carts and the
                   airport system.                                                                [2 marks]

            (ii)   Describe two potential problems that could arise from this method of
                   implementation.                                                                [4 marks]

            (iii) Describe two ways in which the data communication between the carts
                  and the airport computer system could be made secure.                           [4 marks]

      (c)   Air traffic controllers continue to resist efforts to replace the current method of
            paper strips for each flight.

            (i)    With specific reference to the case study, identify two features of the
                   paper strips method that air traffic controllers like.                         [2 marks]

            (ii)   Suggest a way in which a computer-based system could provide the two
                   features you identified in part (i).                                           [4 marks]

            (iii) Discuss whether the safety concerns associated with replacing the
                  paper strips method with a computer-based system can be overcome.               [6 marks]
