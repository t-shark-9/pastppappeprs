Paper 3 markbands: The following bands provide a précis of the full markbands for paper 3 published in
the History guide (2008) on pages 77–81. They are intended to assist marking but must be used in
conjunction with the full markbands found in the guide. For the attention of all examiners: if you are
uncertain about the content/accuracy of a candidate’s work please contact your team leader.


 0:   Answers not meeting the requirements of descriptors should be awarded no marks.
 1–2: Answers do not meet the demands of the question and show little or no evidence of appropriate
      structure. There is little more than unsupported generalization.
 3–4: There is little understanding of the question. Historical knowledge is present but the detail is
      insufficient. Historical context or processes are barely understood and there are little more than
      poorly substantiated assertions.
 5–6: Answers indicate some understanding of the question but historical knowledge is limited in
      quality and quantity. Understanding of historical processes may be present but underdeveloped.
      The question is only partially addressed.
 7–8: The demands of the question are generally understood. Relevant, historical knowledge is present
      but is unevenly applied. Knowledge is narrative or descriptive in nature. There may be limited
      argument that requires further substantiation. Critical commentary may be present. An attempt
      to place events in historical context and show an understanding of historical processes. An
      attempt at a structured approach, either chronological or thematic has been made.
 9–11: Answers indicate that the question is understood but not all implications considered.
      Knowledge is largely accurate. Critical commentary may be present. Events are generally
      placed in context, and historical processes, such as comparison and contrast, are understood.
      There is a clear attempt at a structured approach. Focus on AO1, AO2 and AO4. Responses that
      simply summarize the views of historians cannot reach the top of this markband.
 12–14: Answers are clearly focused on the demands of the question. Relevant in-depth knowledge is
      applied as evidence, and analysis or critical commentary are used to indicate some in-depth
      understanding but is not consistent throughout. Events are placed in context and there is sound
      understanding of historical processes and comparison and contrast. Evaluation of different
      approaches may be used to substantiate arguments presented. Synthesis is present but not always
      consistently integrated. Focus on AO3 and AO4.
 15–17: Answers are clearly structured and focused, have full awareness of the demands of the
      question, and if appropriate may challenge it. Accurate and detailed historical knowledge is used
      convincingly to support critical commentary. Historical processes such as comparison and
      contrast, placing events in context and evaluating different interpretations are used appropriately
      and effectively. Answers are well structured and balanced and synthesis is well developed and
      supported with knowledge and critical commentary.
 18–20: Answers are clearly focused with a high degree of the awareness of the question and may
      challenge it successfully. Knowledge is extensive, accurately applied and there may be a high
      level of conceptual ability. Evaluation of different approaches may be present as may be
      understanding of historical processes as well as comparison and contrast where relevant.
      Evaluation is integrated into the answer. The answer is well structured and well-focused.
      Synthesis is highly developed.

1.   Examine the political, economic and social causes for one independence movement in the
     Americas between 1763 and 1825.

     While the United States may be the most popular choice, any independence movement in the region
     is acceptable.

     Political causes might include representation, sovereignty, taxation, weakness of colonial powers;
     Economic causes might include taxation and trade, restrictions on mercantile system;
     Social causes might include class and ethnic conflict (Creoles and Peninsulars).

     Narratives will achieve no more than [12 marks]. Higher marks will be gained by more explicit
     analysis of the three types of causes and their interrelation. Allow for some imbalance in the
     analysis of those causes, and reward candidates who recognise the particularities of Brazil.


2.   Compare and contrast the military contributions of two leaders, each chosen from a different
     country, to the process of independence.

     Answers will vary depending upon the specific leaders chosen. The leaders’ contributions in areas
     such as tactics and strategy, organizational abilities and the ability to engender support for the
     movement from different levels of the military could be addressed. The ability to gain and maintain
     the support of the political leadership of the movement may also be considered as it relates to the
     process of independence.

     In answering the question both similarities and differences of specific leaders should be addressed
     and the best answers will do so in a running comparison with direct linkage.

     If only one leader is addressed, mark out of a maximum of [7 marks].


3.   “The Articles of Confederation were totally unsuccessful.” To what extent do you agree with
     this view?

     Answers in support of the quote may address the numerous perceived weaknesses of the
     Articles of Confederation, or national government, with an explanation as to why the policies
     were weaknesses. Some examples that may be used include: lack of power to levy taxes;
     equal representation for all states; lack of congressional power over commerce; limited federal
     court system; unanimity needed to amend the document and the loose administration of
     laws by the Congress. Candidates challenging or disagreeing with the statement might refer to the
     more ‘positive’ aspects of the Articles’ era, such as the successful completion of the American
     Revolution; the establishment of a system of government; the development of a process to organize
     new territory, as shown by the Land Ordinance of 1785, and the Northwest Ordinance of 1787.

      Do not expect all of the above information but the answer must reflect a clear response to
     “what extent” in order to reach the upper markbands.
                                                  –5–                N11/3/HISTX/HP3/ENG/TZ0/AM/M

4.   In what ways, and with what results, were Native Americans affected by the establishment
     and expansion of the United States?

     Given the wording of this question and the absence of specific dates, allow responses which cover
     the period from the mid-eighteenth century in the colonial period to the reconstruction era
     (post- civil war expansion e.g. gold rush, land grants, the transcontinental railroad, the Sioux Wars).

     Native Americans were affected by the establishment and subsequent expansion of the United
     States in a variety of ways.

     Candidates could mention the Treaty of Paris, the ending of the Proclamation Line of 1763 and the
     new boundary at the Mississippi River; post-war treaties with the United States, in which Native
     Americans were forced to relinquish their ancestral lands and move to reservations; ongoing battles
     in the Ohio River Valley through to the War of 1812; the assimilation of some tribes in the
     southeast; and finally, the forced removal of Native Americans (The Trail of Tears) in 1837–1838.
     Candidates could also mention the United States’ refusal to recognize any union of Native
     Americans, preferring instead a divide and conquer mentality.

     Do not expect all of the above, and reward candidates for additional “ways” and “results”.
     Reference to the events after 1840 could be rewarded but the focus of the answer should be on the
     nation-building era.

     If only “ways” or “results” are addressed, mark out of a maximum of [12 marks].


5.   Assess the impact of the Abolitionist debate on the actions of US governments between 1845
     and 1860.

     This is not a question about the causes of the Civil War.

     The period to be addressed covers the era from the Mexican–American War through to Lincoln’s
     election. Hence candidates should focus on the Abolitionist debate in the time period from 1845 to
     1860.

     Candidates may organise their answers around the actions and policies of different US
     administrations or events that occurred during those administrations.

     The candidate may clarify the “Abolitionist argument”, addressing the positions taken by the
     Abolitionists and then make the connections between the movement and events occurring during
     this era. Events likely to be addressed include passage/defeat of the Wilmot Proviso, the
     Compromise of 1850, the passage of the Kansas–Nebraska Act (popular sovereignty) and the
     subsequent “Bleeding Kansas”, the creation of the Republican Party, the Dred Scott case, John
     Brown’s raid at Harper’s Ferry and Lincoln’s election. Better answers will not simply address a list
     of events but rather make the more sophisticated connections with the Abolitionists, addressing the
     actual influence they had on the events discussed.

     Do not expect all of the above and reward other relevant material.
                                                    –6–               N11/3/HISTX/HP3/ENG/TZ0/AM/M

6.   Discuss the impact of two major battles or campaigns of the United States Civil War.

     Candidates could choose any two of the major battles of the Civil War. Likely choices might
     be Antietam and Gettysburg, as they are named in the curriculum, but accept other battles such as
     First Bull Run/Manassas, Vicksburg, Sherman’s March to the Sea or the Wilderness Campaign.
     For Antietam, candidates could mention: death toll; Union victory; decreased chances of foreign
     involvement and Emancipation Proclamation. For Gettysburg, candidates could mention death toll;
     Union victory; last Confederate excursion into the North; and boost to the Union cause.

     While some description of the battles might be helpful, do not expect, nor reward, extensive
     description.

     If only one battle or campaign is addressed, mark out of a maximum of [12 marks].


7.   Discuss the role of women in one country in the Americas between 1865 and 1929.

     The content of candidates’ answers will depend on the country selected. Whilst the most popular
     issues for discussion are likely to be the struggle for political rights, legal equality, women’s’ role in
     the economy as a result of the First World War, the temperance movements, the flappers, etc., allow
     candidates to discuss less well known aspects of the issue, such as the role of women in education,
     the culture of immigrant communities, their role in revolutions, art, etc.

     Credit the use and discussion of specific examples as opposed to sweeping generalizations that do
     not demonstrate precise knowledge of the selected country.


8.   Compare and contrast the impact of immigration on two Latin American countries during the
     period 1865–1929.

     Latin America received a vast number of immigrants during the aforementioned period. They came
     from Europe and – to a lesser extent – Asia, searching for new possibilities. Immigrants, attracted
     by arable land and developing cities, solved the lack of manual labour in many countries including
     Brazil and Cuba, where they supplied the labour needed after the end of slavery. In many cases,
     immigration was also taken by Latin American nations as a way to elevate the cultural and
     intellectual level of the population and policies to encourage specific national groups to emigrate
     were implemented. European styles in art, clothing, housing, and literature became highly popular
     and defined the principles of the period. Some national groups tended to marry nationals from their
     host countries while others formed closed groups; these tendencies impacted differently on the
     countries. Some nations developed specific immigration policies – such as the promotion of
     colonies in less developed areas – but results were not always successful.

     Some of the areas which could be compared and contrasted for the selected countries are:
     nationalities, geographical distribution; demographic impact, social integration/assimilation or
     tensions/conflict; economic activities; cultural contributions.

     In answering the question, both similarities and differences should be addressed and the best
     answers will do so in a running comparison with direct linkage.

     If only one country is addressed, mark out of a maximum of [7 marks].
                                                  –7–              N11/3/HISTX/HP3/ENG/TZ0/AM/M

9.    Compare and contrast the Latin American policies of the United States between 1900
      and 1912.

      The question is about the policies towards Latin America of the two different US administrations of
      Roosevelt and Taft during the twelve year period from 1900–1912.

      For the Roosevelt era, candidates could mention the Roosevelt Corollary; the Big Stick philosophy;
      and actions in Cuba, Panama and the Dominican Republic. For the Taft era, candidates might
      discuss Dollar Diplomacy and actions in Nicaragua, Guatemala and Honduras.

      Better candidates will not simply describe their respective policies, but organise their knowledge
      around the notion of similarities (comparisons) and differences (contrasts).

      Wilson’s administration is not acceptable, though allow those candidates who make reference to
      McKinley.

      If only one policy is addressed, mark out of a maximum of [7 marks].


10.   Discuss the impact of the First World War on the internal politics of two countries in the
      Americas.

      Answers will vary depending upon the countries chosen. The United States and Canada will be
      likely options but any country in the region would be acceptable, as long as there are clear
      connections between the war and their internal political situation. Examples of this could include:
      internal political divisions over relations to and subsequent involvement in the First World War,
      political developments that arose during the First World War (e.g. debates about conscription), as
      well as short or long term impact of the First World War on internal politics such as, for example,
      the debate over joining the League of Nations.

      If only one country is addressed, mark out of a maximum of [12 marks].
                                                  –8–              N11/3/HISTX/HP3/ENG/TZ0/AM/M

11.   “The Porfiriato regime unleashed the Mexican Revolution.” To what extent do you agree
      with this statement?

      Most candidates are likely to agree with the statement, and are likely to include the following
      aspects in their argument:

      The stability experienced under Díaz and the unprecedented economic development (roads,
      railways, mining and commerce) were not shared by the majority of Mexicans, especially rural
      labourers. The hacendados, who supported Díaz, benefited from government legislation displacing
      the rural population from their lands, thus creating more problems and sources of grievance. Díaz’s
      policies attracted foreign investments which encouraged modernization and development but also
      contributed to deepening the gap between rich and poor. A brief recession in 1907–1908 brought
      unemployment and contributed to rural disorder. Díaz did not listen to the warnings of labour
      leaders, intellectuals, and even members of his government. Declining standards of living provoked
      workers’ strikes, most of which were put down violently. His declarations to the press in 1910 that
      Mexico was ready for democracy, and that he would retire, prompted opposition to organize and
      choose Francisco Madero as presidential candidate. Díaz’s imprisonment of Madero during the
      election caused anger in the population and in May 1911 Díaz fled the country.

      Allow for candidates to disagree with the statement, provided their argument is backed up by
      detailed material evidence (the role of ideology, particular individuals, etc.).
                                                   –9–                N11/3/HISTX/HP3/ENG/TZ0/AM/M

12.   To what extent were the aims of the Mexican Constitution of 1917 achieved by 1940?

      This question requires candidates to establish clear connections between the aims of the Mexican
      Constitution and the policies implemented up to 1940.

      The Mexican Constitution guaranteed civil liberties, the right to education, redistribution of land,
      the protection of labour, the establishment of a secular state and the protection of natural resources.

      Although it was an improvement for the rural population, the land reform that was implemented left
      the most profitable lands in the hands of the landowning classes who remained highly influential
      in politics.

      Policies of integration for the indigenous population had mixed results. Corporatist structures for
      trade unions and the nationalization of railways were established and the latter put under workers’
      administration. The introduction of a free and compulsory educational system for all Mexicans
      improved the literacy rates. The attempt to limit foreign influence in the country was partially
      successful. Under Cárdenas, the national control of foreign-owned enterprises was promoted and
      state management of oil production (PEMEX) was implemented. Mexico experienced economic
      development and introduced a more democratic political system, but remained dominated by one
      political party. The government did not end the inequality of Mexican society by 1940.


13.   Analyse the response to the Great Depression of one Latin American country between
      1929 and 1939.

      Candidates are likely to focus on Brazil, Mexico or Argentina, but accept any other relevant choice.
      Answers should demonstrate specific knowledge of the problems caused by the Depression in one
      country and of the programmes and policies created to resolve them. Relevant areas include:
      protectionist policies and other forms of government intervention in the economy; the substitution
      of the importation of industrialized products; measures adopted to create employment such as
      different public works programmes; and the development of non-traditional sectors in Latin
      America.


14.   With reference to one country in the Americas, explain the impact of the Great Depression on
      the arts.

      The Depression is associated with the development of a national identity through the arts. The
      implementation of government programmes to assist artists aimed at the formation of a “national
      culture” and of “national art” in many countries. There was growing interest for the arts to reflect
      the history of each nation. Social grievances, together with the need to think inclusively at a
      national level, were represented by the works of artists such as the Mexican muralists, and the
      “social novels”, as well as those written about indigenous or black characters. The influence of the
      Depression in the selection of topics in literature and sound films and the way these were used by
      people to either escape or portray the reality of the period could also be relevant areas of analysis.

      Candidates are expected to give a detailed account of the influence of the Depression in the visual
      arts, film industry, radio and literary currents in one country. Do not expect coverage of all of these
      areas but demand the use of specific examples as well as the analysis of the relation between the
      Depression and the artistic manifestations explained. Material will depend on the selected country.
                                                 – 10 –             N11/3/HISTX/HP3/ENG/TZ0/AM/M

15.   Compare and contrast the military role of two countries in the Americas during the Second
      World War.

      The United States and Canada may be popular choices but any country in the Americas with a
      military role in the Second World War would be appropriate. Answers will vary depending on the
      country selected. Examples of areas that may be discussed include: intelligence gathering;
      involvement in the development of tactics and strategy, the use of bases; production of war supplies
      and troop deployment/use.

      In answering the question, both similarities and differences should be addressed and the best
      answers will do so in a running comparison using direct linkage.

      If only one country is addressed, mark out of a maximum of [7 marks].


16.   Discuss the social impact of the Second World War on either women or minorities in one
      country of the Americas.

      Candidates will likely focus on Canada or the United States, but accept any other relevant choice.
      In most countries, women experienced increased job opportunities and an increased sense of
      equality. Candidates could also discuss the war’s impact on women’s rights movements.
      Minorities could include: native peoples; African Americans; Japanese Americans; Japanese
      Canadians; or any ethnic or religious minority. With the exception of the Japanese, nearly all
      minorities experienced economic and social gains. Japanese in the United States and in Canada
      faced discrimination and internment camps. Candidates could also discuss the post-war impact on
      the civil rights movements.


17.   To what extent could Harry Truman’s domestic policies (1945–1953) be considered successful?

      A discussion of the specifics of Truman’s domestic programmes, known as the Fair Deal, and
      whether or not they were successful is necessary. Truman attempted to preserve the social
      programmes of the New Deal. Candidates could focus on civil rights, workers’ rights, farmers,
      housing, education, Social Security and health care. Although Truman was able to integrate
      the Armed Forces by executive order, he accomplished little else for civil rights. He vetoed the
      anti-union Taft–Hartley bill, but was overridden by Congress. Policies on price supports
      for farmers, housing, education and national health care never made it through Congress. Two
      successes were increased minimum wage and an expansion of social security programmes.

18.   Analyse the impact of Castro’s social policies on Cuban society up until 1979.

      Candidates are expected to explore the essential aims and elements of Castro’s social policy
      between 1959 and 1979. Policy issues discussed may include: the baby boom which followed the
      revolution; increasing levels of urbanization; the emigration of opponents to the regime; increasing
      proportion of women in the workforce but not in politics; the formation of organizations such as the
      FMC (Federación de Mujeres Cubanas); the role of CDR (Comités de Defensa de la Revolución) to
      involve members of society with the defence of the revolution; Cuba’s educational transformation;
      successes in the area of health care and relations with the Church.

      Do not demand all of the above and credit any other relevant material. Allow for references to land
      redistribution and its social impact. To reach the upper levels of the markband candidates must
      address the impact of the policy and not simply describe the attributes contained in the policy itself.


19.   Analyse the reasons for the participation of one country in the Americas in the Korean War.

      The United States, Canada and Colombia are the nations in the Americas that were involved in the
      Korean War. Candidates may consider the range of reasons for participation, from political to
      diplomatic. The geopolitical situation may be taken into account either through the support of allies
      or the impact of the Cold War and the decisions emanating from the East–West struggle.

      Answers using the United States might address the concerns about the expansion of Communism,
      with the North Korean invasion coming shortly after the success of the Communists in China and
      the Soviet development of a nuclear bomb. The US feared a successful invasion could lead to a
      communist Asia. The administration’s belief that this was a continuation of expansion and that not
      to confront the move would encourage further attempts at expansion may be a direction taken in the
      essay. Other reasons might include Truman’s concern with re-election.

      Canada also feared communist expansion but there was concern, particularly expressed by Lester
      Pearson, that the United States was leading her allies too deeply into a foreign conflict. The
      Canadians clearly maintained the formal understanding that they were fighting in Korea under the
      auspices of the United Nations.

      The Colombians were the only Latin American nation to join the war effort. Reasons which may be
      discussed include fulfilment of their treaty obligations, the modernization of their armed forces and
      the belief that this action would lead to benefits from a closer relationship with the United States.

      The focus of the question should not be on the Korean War but on analysing the reasons behind the
      participation of the selected country in the conflict.
                                                 – 12 –            N11/3/HISTX/HP3/ENG/TZ0/AM/M

20.   “Jimmy Carter was the first president since John F Kennedy to actively pursue improved
      relations with Latin America.” To what extent do you agree with this statement?

      Jimmy Carter advocated for human rights as a fundamental principle of United States’ foreign
      policy. Carter’s accomplishments in Latin America included the Panama Canal Treaty, negotiations
      with Cuba for improved relations, an unwillingness to accept right-wing dictators and a push for
      human rights, especially in Nicaragua. Carter worked to improve hemispheric cooperation by
      utilizing the Organization of American States.

      Candidates need to mention some of Kennedy’s successes with the OAS, the Alliance for Progress
      and the Peace Corps and show awareness of the Latin American policies of Carter’s predecessors in
      order to establish a basis for agreement or disagreement with the statement.


21.   Analyse the impact of US Supreme Court decisions on ending segregation in education
      between 1955 and 1965.

      Most answers will use the Brown vs. Board of Education of Topeka case as a foundation for
      the discussion, but other court decisions may be used to supplement or expand on the impact
      of the court in this area. Examples of court cases that may be considered include: Brown II;
      Aaron vs. Cooper; Griffin vs. County School Board of Prince Edward County. Candidates need to
      clearly identify actions that can be connected to the decisions. Examples that could be discussed
      include: states’ attempts to either ignore the decisions or rewrite their laws to circumvent the
      decisions of the Court; the Southern Manifesto issued by members of Congress; attempts by state
      politicians to block African American students from attending previously all-white public schools.
      Candidates should be mindful of the question’s time frame and address events from within that
      period. Better candidates will avoid exaggerating the degree of immediate integration stemming
      from these landmark cases.


22.   “In the struggle for civil rights in the Americas the role of government is often less influential
      than the role of popular movements.” With reference to one country in the Americas,
      to what extent do you agree with this statement?

      This question gives candidates the opportunity to use any of the civil rights movements in the
      Americas to compare influence of the role of government to the role of a popular movement in
      achieving the aims and goals being sought by a particular group. Answers must address the
      “extent” to which they agree and should weigh actions taken by the government against actions
      taken by the popular movement to determine which was more successful in leading to the
      achievement of civil rights. The answers will vary based on the country chosen and the particular
      civil rights movement being addressed. Some candidates may select a country and then use more
      than one civil rights movement to support their position. This is acceptable with the mark level
      dependent upon the quality of their examples and the linkage created between achieving aims and
      the development of the roles being discussed.

23.   Describe the impact of changes in popular culture with reference to music and entertainment
      in one country in the Americas between 1980 and 2000.

      Allow candidates to interpret this question as either (1) referring to the way in which the various
      developments in popular culture impacted upon the political, economical and social aspects of any
      one country of the region during this period or (2) the extent to which the political, economic and
      social developments in any one country of the region during this period can be said to have effected
      or been expressed in the popular culture of the period. Either way, candidates should focus on
      music and entertainment. It should not simply be a description of, for example, the changes that
      took place in popular music (e.g. from industrial rock to hip hop). The response should include
      some form of analytical consideration of the inter-relationship between culture and society.
      Credit the use and discussion of specific examples as opposed to sweeping generalizations that do
      not demonstrate precise knowledge of the selected country.


24.   “Ronald Reagan’s domestic policies were responsible for US economic growth in the 1980s.”
      To what extent do you agree with this statement?

      Candidates should discuss the success of the policies Reagan implemented to stimulate the
      economy. High inflation, unemployment and a recession characterized Reagan’s early years.
      Reagan’s policies, often called “supply-side economics”, included tax cuts and tax reform, and a
      decrease in government spending for social programmes such as Medicaid and food stamps.
      Other domestic actions include stopping the air traffic controllers’ strike and the reappointment of
      Paul Volcker as chairman of the Federal Reserve Board. During his presidency, unemployment
      declined, tax receipts doubled and the economy improved.

      Candidates who disagree with the statement may do so by crediting other sources, such as Volcker
      and monetary policy for the economic recovery, or by questioning the notion of ‘economic growth’
      by reference to the widening gap between rich and poor, the subsequent high budget deficits and
      their long term impact on the US economy.
