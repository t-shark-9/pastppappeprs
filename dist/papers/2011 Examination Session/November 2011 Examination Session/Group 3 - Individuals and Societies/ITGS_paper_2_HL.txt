1.    The Wireless Waitress is a PDA-based system which allows waiters to take orders at the table in
      a restaurant. Orders are sent wirelessly to the server in the kitchen and a record of each order is printed.
      The bill is automatically calculated. As each meal item is ordered it is automatically deducted from the
      total quantity available. The diagram below shows an example of a wireless network in a restaurant.

      (a)   Identify two characteristics of a PDA.                                                         [2 marks]

      (b)   Using information from both diagrams, identify the steps involved in processing
            a customer’s order and payment.                                                                [4 marks]

      (c)   The PDA shown above allows waiters to select from options on the screen.
            Other PDAs allow users to input “handwritten” text directly on the screen.

            Explain how handwriting recognition works on a PDA.                                            [4 marks]

      (d)   The management of Maggie’s Meals restaurant is considering introducing the
            Wireless Waitress system.

            Evaluate the implications for both customers and restaurant staff.                            [10 marks]

2.      Simplified Alerts is an internet-based, mass SMS* alert notification system. It is designed for schools
        to send SMS advisory, weather, and emergency alerts to the cell (mobile) phones or e-mail addresses
        of parents and school staff. Administrators can customize a sign-up form, pre-set text messages,
        and send to user categories or entire lists. Parents need to sign up and opt in to receive messages.
        This ensures that messages will not be treated as spam.

*    SMS: a text message sent on a cell (mobile) phone




        (a)     Define the term spam.                                                                                         [2 marks]

        (b)     Many schools no longer print and post newsletters.

                Describe two ways schools can distribute newsletters electronically to parents
                and the school community.                                                                                     [4 marks]

        (c)     Many parents receive the SMS alerts on their smart phones. The latest smart
                phones come with up to 32 GB of storage.

                Explain the reasons why many people want this amount of storage on their
                smart phones.                                                                                                 [4 marks]

        (d)     Discuss the advantages and disadvantages of introducing Simplified Alerts for
                schools and parents.                                                                                        [10 marks]

3.    In the past, during a medical visit, it was common for the doctor to consult a textbook before prescribing
      drugs for a patient. This book listed prescribed doses, any side effects, interactions with other drugs
      the patient is taking and warnings for patients with certain conditions such as pregnancy.

      Today these textbooks are being replaced by electronic versions which use relational databases to
      store the information. A simplified version of a prescription database is shown in the diagram below.

                          DRUGS                                                   INTERACTIONS
               Drug_Name                              1                    Interaction_ID
               (e.g. Doxycycline_100)                                      (e.g. Int001)
               Description                                               ∞ Drug_Name
               (e.g. Antibiotic)                                           (e.g. Doxycycline_100)
               Dose (adult)                                                Reacts_With
               (e.g. One daily)                                            (e.g. Antacids)
               Side_Effects                                                Reaction
               (e.g. Nausea, Diarrhoea)                                    (e.g. Prevents drug absorbing)

      Using this relational database a doctor can search DRUGS to check the correct dose for the patient
      and warn the patient about side effects. By linking to INTERACTIONS the doctor can check if the
      prescribed drug has any adverse interactions with other drugs the patient is taking.

      By linking to another table, such as one containing information about drug warnings, the doctor is
      alerted to potential problems. For example, some drugs taken during pregnancy can harm the baby.

      The information is stored in a relational database such as the one illustrated above. The brackets
      contain examples of typical data for the antibiotic Doxycycline_100.

      (a)   With reference to the relational database diagram above, describe the nature of
            the relationship between the table DRUGS and the table INTERACTIONS.                               [2 marks]

      (b)   It is important that the database is accurate.

            Describe two design features that a database designer could use to prevent data
            input errors.                                                                                      [4 marks]

      (c)   This prescription database now comes in many electronic formats. Two possible
            formats are a CD-ROM version and an online version accessible through a
            web site.

            Compare the effectiveness of these two formats in providing a doctor with the
            necessary information.                                                                             [4 marks]

      (d)   Discuss how the use of the prescription database shown above can help a doctor
            to improve medical care.                                                                          [10 marks]

4.      Hundreds of thousands of wheelie bins (garbage cans/rubbish bins) are being fitted with special
        RFID tags* to monitor the amount of non-recyclable garbage discarded by householders. The tag’s
        microchip stores a serial number which identifies the household. The garbage trucks are fitted
        with RFID readers and sensors. They also contain special equipment which records the weight of
        the garbage. Garbage is collected twice a month.

        Once the truck returns to the depot, all information collected is downloaded to a relational database
        on a central computer. Householders can then be billed each month for the amount of non-recyclable
        garbage that has been collected.

        The aim is to encourage householders to recycle more and hence reduce their amount of non-recyclable
        garbage.

      (c)   Local governments want to create an advertising campaign that targets
            neighbourhoods where householders have large quantities of non-recyclable
            garbage.

            Explain how data mining can be used to identify these neighbourhoods without
            breaching householders’ privacy.                                                    [4 marks]

      (d)   Many householders have expressed concerns about having their garbage
            monitored in this way.

            To what extent are these concerns justified?                                       [10 marks]
