1.    Biometrics makes use of pattern recognition in order to identify individuals. It is no longer confined
      to major physical characteristics such as fingerprints. More subtle measures, such as a person’s gait
      (the way a person walks), are now being used to identify individuals through video matching.

      Recently, gait recognition using recorded video images was admitted as evidence in UK courts.
      One man was convicted of a burglary after experts used video matching to compare video images of
      him at the crime scene with images of him in custody.

Answer two questions.

                                                    Area of impact: Education

2.      Simplified Alerts is an internet-based, mass SMS* alert notification system. It is designed for schools
        to send SMS advisory, weather, and emergency alerts to the cell (mobile) phones or e-mail addresses
        of parents and school staff. Administrators can customize a sign-up form, pre-set text messages,
        and send to user categories or entire lists. Parents need to sign up and opt in to receive messages.
        This ensures that messages will not be treated as spam.

*    SMS: a text message sent on a cell (mobile) phone




        (a)     Define the term spam.                                                                                          [2 marks]

        (b)     Many schools no longer print and post newsletters.

                Describe two ways schools can distribute newsletters electronically to parents
                and the school community.                                                                                      [4 marks]

        (c)     Many parents receive the SMS alerts on their smart phones. The latest smart
                phones come with up to 32 GB of storage.

                Explain the reasons why many people want this amount of storage on their
                smart phones.                                                                                                  [4 marks]

        (d)     Discuss the advantages and disadvantages of introducing Simplified Alerts for
                schools and parents.                                                                                         [10 marks]

3.    In the past, during a medical visit, it was common for the doctor to consult a textbook before prescribing
      drugs for a patient. This book listed prescribed doses, any side effects, interactions with other drugs
      the patient is taking and warnings for patients with certain conditions such as pregnancy.

      Today these textbooks are being replaced by electronic versions which use relational databases to
      store the information. A simplified version of a prescription database is shown in the diagram below.

                          DRUGS                                                   INTERACTIONS
               Drug_Name                              1                    Interaction_ID
               (e.g. Doxycycline_100)                                      (e.g. Int001)
               Description                                               ∞ Drug_Name
               (e.g. Antibiotic)                                           (e.g. Doxycycline_100)
               Dose (adult)                                                Reacts_With
               (e.g. One daily)                                            (e.g. Antacids)
               Side_Effects                                                Reaction
               (e.g. Nausea, Diarrhoea)                                    (e.g. Prevents drug absorbing)

      Using this relational database a doctor can search DRUGS to check the correct dose for the patient
      and warn the patient about side effects. By linking to INTERACTIONS the doctor can check if the
      prescribed drug has any adverse interactions with other drugs the patient is taking.

      By linking to another table, such as one containing information about drug warnings, the doctor is
      alerted to potential problems. For example, some drugs taken during pregnancy can harm the baby.

      The information is stored in a relational database such as the one illustrated above. The brackets
      contain examples of typical data for the antibiotic Doxycycline_100.

      (a)   With reference to the relational database diagram above, describe the nature
            of the relationship between the table DRUGS and the table INTERACTIONS.                            [2 marks]

      (b)   It is important that the database is accurate.

            Describe two design features that a database designer could use to prevent data
            input errors.                                                                                      [4 marks]

      (c)   This prescription database now comes in many electronic formats. Two possible
            formats are a CD-ROM version and an online version accessible through a
            web site.

            Compare the effectiveness of these two formats in providing a doctor with the
            necessary information.                                                                             [4 marks]

      (d)   Discuss how the use of the prescription database shown above can help a doctor
            to improve medical care.                                                                          [10 marks]

5.    Robots that mimic the behaviour of fish that swim in groups have been developed by a Japanese
      car company. The purpose of this research is to develop anti-collision vehicles that can travel
      intelligently, avoiding each other and obstacles.

      They model the behaviour of fish by two simple rules. They must:
      • travel together as closely as possible but without touching
      • change travelling direction without colliding.

      A vehicle is being developed as a tiny robot called EPORO that can move in a group without touching
      its travelling companions. The new three-wheeled robot is designed to travel in groups. Each uses
      a laser sensor to measure the distance between obstacles. The data is constantly shared between
      the robots, allowing the group to travel together without bumping into each other. The technique
      allows the cars to travel side-by-side or quickly switch direction as a group.




      (a)   Describe one way in which a robot can distinguish between another robot and a
            different object.                                                                     [2 marks]

      (b)   Identify the step-by-step process that robots follow in order to remain within a
            certain distance of each other.                                                       [4 marks]

      (c)   Explain two real-life situations on a road that would make the model ineffective.     [4 marks]

      (d)   Discuss the issues that arise when putting total responsibility for driving in the
            hands of robots.                                                                     [10 marks]

6.    Highly sensitive details of a United States military missile air defence system were found on a
      second-hand hard drive bought on eBay, an online auction web site. The test launch procedures to
      shoot down missiles were found on the hard drive. The hard drive also contained security policies,
      details of the layout of the facilities and personal information on military employees.

      The government is keen to ensure that old computers are disposed of in a responsible way.

      (b)   Describe two ways to ensure that data cannot be retrieved when computer
            components are disposed of.                                                                 [4 marks]

      (c)   Compare two different methods used to dispose of computer hardware that is no
            longer required by an organization.                                                         [4 marks]

      (d)   A government has introduced two policies to prevent unauthorized access to
            sensitive data:
            • employees must have secure passwords that they do not share with anyone
            • no sensitive data can be downloaded from the main server to any other devices.

            To what extent will these two policies prevent unauthorized access to
            sensitive data?                                                                            [10 marks]
