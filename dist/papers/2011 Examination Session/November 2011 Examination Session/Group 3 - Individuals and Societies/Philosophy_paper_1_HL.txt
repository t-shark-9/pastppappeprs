                                                          SECTION A

Answer one question from this section. Each question in this section is worth [30 marks].

Core Theme: What is a human being?

1.       Read the following passage and develop your response as indicated below.

         In his recent bestseller The Tipping Point, the journalist Malcolm Gladwell applies [an] idea to recent
         social trends … In each case the conventional wisdom attributed the trend to external social forces
         such as advertising, government programmes, or role models. And in each case the trend was really
         driven by an internal dynamic of personal choices and influences and their feedback. The naming of
         babies, and of things in general, is another example in which a large-scale social phenomenon – the
         composition of a language – emerges unpredictably out of many individual choices that influence
         one another.

      action right should be judged by the consequences of that action.



Optional Theme 3: Philosophy of religion

7.    To what extent are religious experiences open to non-religious interpretations?


8.    “Since religious language makes assertions about things which can neither be verified nor falsified

      and discuss how the notion of the material and spiritual aspects of the self might be expressed
      and integrated.

15.   Evaluate the importance of philosophically analysing racial and multiracial awareness.


16.   “Some have maintained that one’s occupation should be a realm of freedom, in which work is freely
      chosen self-expression. Others have held that the freedom of self-expression is one good among
      others that work can provide, such as lucrative pay, friendly social contact and the satisfaction of the
      self-support norm, and that none of these various work-related goods necessarily should have priority
      over others.” Discuss and evaluate.
