Paper 3 markbands: The following bands provide a précis of the full markbands for paper 3 published in
the History guide (2008) on pages 77–81. They are intended to assist marking but must be used in
conjunction with the full markbands found in the guide. For the attention of all examiners: if you are
uncertain about the content/accuracy of a candidate’s work please contact your team leader.

 0:     Answers not meeting the requirements of descriptors should be awarded no marks.
 1–2:   Answers do not meet the demands of the question and show little or no evidence of
        appropriate structure. There is little more than unsupported generalization.
 3–4:   There is little understanding of the question. Historical knowledge is present but the detail is
        insufficient. Historical context or processes are barely understood and there are little more
        than poorly substantiated assertions.
 5–6:   Answers indicate some understanding of the question but historical knowledge is limited in
        quality and quantity.       Understanding of historical processes may be present but
        underdeveloped. The question is only partially addressed.
 7–8:   The demands of the question are generally understood. Relevant, historical knowledge is
        present but is unevenly applied. Knowledge is narrative or descriptive in nature. There may
        be limited argument that requires further substantiation. Critical commentary may be present.
        An attempt to place events in historical context and show an understanding of historical
        processes. An attempt at a structured approach, either chronological or thematic has been
        made.
 9–11: Answers indicate that the question is understood but not all implications considered.
        Knowledge is largely accurate. Critical commentary may be present. Events are generally
        placed in context, and historical processes, such as comparison and contrast, are understood.
        There is a clear attempt at a structured approach. Focus on AO1, AO2 and AO4. Responses
        that simply summarize the views of historians cannot reach the top of this markband.
 12–14: Answers are clearly focused on the demands of the question. Relevant in-depth knowledge is
        applied as evidence, and analysis or critical commentary are used to indicate some in-depth
        understanding but is not consistent throughout. Events are placed in context and there is
        sound understanding of historical processes and comparison and contrast. Evaluation of
        different approaches may be used to substantiate arguments presented. Synthesis is present
        but not always consistently integrated. Focus on AO3 and AO4.
 15–17: Answers are clearly structured and focused, have full awareness of the demands of the
        question, and if appropriate may challenge it. Accurate and detailed historical knowledge is
        used convincingly to support critical commentary. Historical processes such as comparison
        and contrast, placing events in context and evaluating different interpretations are used
        appropriately and effectively. Answers are well structured and balanced and synthesis is well
        developed and supported with knowledge and critical commentary.
 18–20: Answers are clearly focused with a high degree of the awareness of the question and may
        challenge it successfully. Knowledge is extensive, accurately applied and there may be a high
        level of conceptual ability. Evaluation of different approaches may be present as may be
        understanding of historical processes as well as comparison and contrast where relevant.
        Evaluation is integrated into the answer. The answer is well structured and well-focused.
        Synthesis is highly developed.

1.   Compare and contrast the effects of the political structures and the colonial systems of the
     Dutch and the French in Southeast Asia in the period from the late eighteenth century to the
     mid nineteenth century.

     Candidates should identify what they consider to be the main features of the political structure and
     the colonial systems of the states chosen. These named examples must be from both the French and
     Dutch colonies. The response should indicate: the nature of political structures established by the
     Dutch and French; the type of rule, direct or indirect; the structure of the bureaucracy including the
     economy and land distribution. The effects will include the relationships between the colonial
     rulers and the indigenous people, and the way both may have handled rebellions and resistance to
     colonial rule. Answers may focus on comparisons, but some contrasts should also be identified.
     Candidates who comment on the effects of French rule after 1850 should be given credit.

     If only the Dutch or the French are discussed, mark out of a maximum of [7 marks]. However, the
     response may not be balanced as French influence in the region was limited in this time period.


2.   Analyse the reasons for the increasing dominance of the British East India company in the
     late eighteenth century.

     The British East India Company had the distinction of becoming the effective ruler of a
     large country. Candidates may identify a number of reasons for this, which could include: the
     growing power of Britain, as well as domestic issues inside India such as the collapse of the
     Moghul Empire; the rivalry between the Rajputs, the Maharattas and the Sikhs. The eclipsing of
     Britain‟s rivals in India, such as the French, and the latter‟s defeats at Madras, Plessey and
     Pondicherry led to an end of their influence and the expansion and dominance of the East India
     Company. The Company, despite the increase in trade and the revenues coming in from various
     sources, faced massive military expenditure, but state intervention put the company back on its feet,
     and Lord North‟s India Bill, also known as the Regulating Act of 1773, provided for greater
     parliamentary control over the affairs of the Company, and placed India under the rule of a
     Governor-General. In addition, the vigorous leadership of Clive and Hastings are factors that will
     probably be mentioned by candidates. Reward balanced answers which look at both internal and
     external reasons for the growth and dominance of the company in the time period.

     Candidates should focus on the time frame in question. Although some credit can be given to
     candidates who include early 19th century events this is not a question about the 1857 Great Revolt
     (Indian Mutiny) and no credit should be given for details of this.

3.   “A collision of two planets … one celestial and lunar; the other with its feet firmly on the
     ground – mercantile, scientific and industrial.” To what extent do you agree with this
     assessment of Sino–British relations between 1793 and 1839?

     Candidates will probably deal with the situation in China at the turn of the century, describing the
     Chinese government, the role of the emperor and the face shown to the world by the Qing (Ch‟ing)
     government in Beijing (Peking), which was of wealth and power. Most candidates will probably
     agree with the interpretation of the quotation and refer to China‟s view of the world, in which they
     saw themselves as the Middle Kingdom. Candidates may also mention: Chinese institutions
     including the authority of the emperor, the mandarins, Confucianism and Buddhism; the Chinese
     “tribute system” of international relations, which contrasted with the British desire to establish
     diplomatic relations; the Guangzhou (Canton) system of trade versus the British view of free trade;
     the Chinese legal system, which emphasized collective responsibility versus the British view of
     individual innocence or guilt; differences in science and technology and how these may explain
     why the dynasty failed to deal with the challenges posed by the British. Candidates may identify
     what they consider to be the lack of understanding of the British challenge in the differences
     between China and the British and suggest that there was a lack of understanding between the two
     cultures. Candidates should address these issues up to the outbreak of the First Opium War in 1839.
     They may also refer to details such as the emperors who came after Qianlong (Ch‟ien-lung), Jiaqing
     (Chia-ch‟ing) and Daoguang (Tao-kuang); the trade missions, Macartney (1793), Amherst (1816)
     and Napier (1834), and the opium trade up until the First Opium War.

     Generic comments about other Western powers should be credited.

     For higher marks candidates should pay some attention to the quotation, however not all parts of the
     quotation need to be directly addressed.

4.   Explain why Commodore Perry’s arrival in Japan in 1853 created a crisis for the Bakumatsu
     and assess the consequences up until 1868.

     Candidates will probably discuss the nature of the Bakumatsu and the situation in the middle of the
     nineteenth century prior to Commodore Perry‟s arrival with a naval squadron in 1853. The crisis
     and the abandonment of the traditional exclusion policy has to be placed in the context of pressures
     upon the Tokugawa because of changing social and economic conditions within Japanese
     society and, more importantly, because of growing awareness that contact with the West could
     not be avoided. The Tokugawa Bakufu had contact with Europe only through the Dutch trading
     factory at Deshima in Nagasaki harbour. By the nineteenth century this contact had prompted the
     rise of the rangaku school of “Dutch Learning” and awareness that scientific and military
     developments in the West posed a challenge to Japan. At the same time, increasing pressure came
     from Western powers, particularly Russia and the United States, seeking to establish relations in
     order to protect their seamen if shipwrecked, and also to develop trade. In addition, there was a
     growing awareness amongst the Japanese of European activities in China. At the same time,
     social and economic changes had weakened the traditional feudal structures that supported
     the Shogunate, and the kokugaku national school of learning called for a restoration of the emperor.
     Candidates may then identify what they consider to be the reasons why Perry‟s arrival created a
     crisis for the Bakufu: the technological might of the US fleet; the indecision of the Shogun in the
     face of Perry‟s demands; the consultations with the Emperor and the daimyo which were seen as a
     sign of weakness; the Shogun‟s decision to agree to Perry‟s demands; opposition of many of the
     daimyo to this decision. Further consequences of the Bakumatsu crisis should be discussed: the
     unequal treaties, Treaty of Kanagawa 1854 and Treaty of Edo 1858 (Harris Treaty); the opening up
     of trade; the Sonno Joi movement, „Honour the Emperor and expel the barbarian‟; the weakening of
     the alternative attendance rule and the other ways in which the Shogun had maintained control over
     the daimyo; the Satsuma and Choshu wars against the West 1860–1864; the meeting of the Shogun
     and the Emperor in Kyoto in 1863 when the Shogun was ordered to expel the Westerners; the
     inability of the Shogun to withstand Western demands; the legal power of the Emperor and the
     Western negotiations with him; the tozama clans‟ challenge to the Shogun‟s power; the deaths of
     the Shogun Iemochi in 1866 and Emperor Komei in 1867; the surrender of Shogun Keiki and the
     fall of the Tokugawa Shogunate in 1867; the Meiji Restoration in 1868.

     Responses should be mainly focused on the period 1853 to 1868 however some relevant detail
     pre-1853 can be credited.

5.   Explain and analyse the nature of the relationship between New Zealand and Britain in the
     second half of the nineteenth century.

     The question covers the period following the landing of the first settlers in January 1840 and the
     signing of the Treaty of Waitangi in 1840 through the Maori wars, the depression of 1869–1870,
     the banking crisis in the late 1870s and early 1890s and the return to prosperity by the end of
     the century. The development of New Zealand depended largely on its relationship with Britain and
     its ability to attract settlers. The latter depended on the government‟s land policy and on its
     relations with the Maoris. Land policy (in particular the price at which land might be bought),
     was an area of dispute between the New Zealand Company, the colonial and home governments and
     the Maoris. The New Zealand Company was dissolved in 1851 but land policy continued to disturb
     relations between settlers and Maoris until the end of the Second Maori War in 1870.
     Meanwhile, settlement was extended in the South Island, where Maoris were less numerous and
     large areas were opened to sheep farming, the government issuing fourteen-year grazing leases
     from 1851. By 1871, ten million sheep were producing wool for export valued at £2 700 000. In
     1861 gold was discovered at Otago and a rush began, the population rising from 100 000 in 1861 to
     250 000 in 1871, the South Island thus becoming the more prosperous. Following the gold rush
     boom, there was a prolonged period of economic depression, which the government alleviated by
     heavy borrowing and expenditure on public works. Purchase of Maori land was made easier in
     1873 by individualizing Maori land ownership, and an assisted immigration scheme overseen by a
     New Zealand government agent in London saw white settlement rise to 772 000 in 1901.
     Improvements in communications enabled New Zealand to benefit from the development of
     refrigeration for the transport of meat by steamship in 1882. Sheep were now raised for meat rather
     than wool, and an export-oriented dairy industry developed to supply the English market. In the
     1890s the introduction of factory laws indicated a growth in industry. Candidates may consider the
     emerging sense of national identity in New Zealand by the end of the nineteenth century:
     involvement in the Boer War; the rugged and enterprising man alone against nature; egalitarianism;
     double patriotism; cultural nationalism. New Zealand made the decision not to ratify the Australian
     Constitution in 1901 and federate with the other British colonies. Independence in New Zealand
     came about as a result of her evolving constitutional status within the British Empire: gradually
     developing greater degrees of self-rule over the latter half of the nineteenth century, culminating in
     the granting of Dominion status in 1907. Candidates could consider the nature of the relationship
     between Britain and New Zealand from both countries‟ perspectives. Candidates will probably be
     familiar with the events but analysis must be present for a good mark.

6.   Explain how and why the Philippines resisted Spanish rule in the late nineteenth century but
     found themselves under American control by the early years of the twentieth century.

     The Philippine nationalist movement featured two key figures, Jose Rizal and Andres Bonifacio.
     Rizal, who was educated at the Jesuit College in Manila and studied medicine in Spain, gained a
     reputation as a writer and poet and became the symbol of the Philippine resistance movement to
     Spanish rule. In 1887 his novel, Noli Me Tangere, described Filipino suffering under Spanish rule
     and he became a dedicated reformer, writing articles for La Solidaridad, the journal published by
     the Propaganda Movement organized by Filipinos in Spain who wanted greater liberty for the
     Philippines. Rizal returned to Spain in 1892, founded the Filipino League, an organization
     advocating peaceful reform, and was arrested by the Spanish authorities and sent to Mindanao. The
     nationalist movement passed into extremist hands when Andres Bonifacio founded the Katipunan in
     1892, a secret society dedicated to rebellion. In 1896, the Spanish authorities ordered the arrest of
     the leaders of the Katipunan, sparking revolt. Although not involved in the revolt, Rizal was
     arrested, tried for treason and executed, making him a nationalist martyr.

     War between the United States and Spain over Cuba soon involved the Philippines and, in 1898,
     during the Spanish–American War, the United States navy destroyed a Spanish fleet in Manila Bay.
     The Americans brought back the exiled nationalist leader Aguinaldo, who established a government
     and, in 1899, declared independence from Spain. Meanwhile, American forces occupied Manila
     and Spain ceded the Philippines to the United States. When the United States refused to grant
     independence to the new republic, Aguinaldo declared war. Aguinaldo was captured in 1901 and
     resistance effectively ended in 1902. In 1901, the Americans established a civil government to
     replace the military government and promised they would guide the Philippines to full
     independence. In 1907, an Assembly was created and the vote given to those who had property and
     were literate in Spanish or English. The Upper House was composed of American officials. In the
     same year, the Nationalist Party was formed. In 1913, a Filipino majority was appointed to the
     Upper House, which, in 1916, was replaced with an elected Senate and voting was extended to all
     literate males. Political parties increased in number, although most power remained with the
     American Governor-General. Candidates will probably go as far as the capture of Aguinaldo and
     the establishment of US political rule, which began a process of creating a democracy on the
     American model. Many Filipinos saw it as the replacement of one form of imperialism with that
     of another.

     To score highly candidates should address both parts of the question.

7.   “Westerners bore some blame for China’s plight but the prime cause was the empire itself
     and its rulers.” To what extent do you agree with this statement with reference to the period
     1850 to 1901 in China?

     The contention of the Chinese has largely been that her problems were caused by the arrival of
     foreigners in the nineteenth century, but this can be challenged. Candidates will probably note the
     circumstances of the treaties after both Opium Wars and the problems China faced from the Taiping
     (Taip‟ing) Rebellion after 1850. The weaknesses of China should be identified, and also the
     introduction of the Self-Strengthening Movement in China, which helped to suppress rebellion,
     consolidate the dynasty and extend its life span by another fifty years. The Self-Strengthening
     movement was based on the idea that Western technology was the key to withstanding the West,
     but that traditional culture and values could be maintained. The conservative elements in Chinese
     society opposed change. Thus there was tension at court and amongst the mandarin class.
     The Self-Strengthening Movement may have prevented the collapse of the dynasty, but it did not
     solve the internal and external problems facing China. Candidates may consider the reasons for,
     and consequences of, the failure of the 100 Days Reform Movement. The causes of the Boxer
     Rebellion and the Qing (Ch‟ing) dynasty‟s failure to suppress it, which led to further foreign
     encroachment of China, could also be examined. Candidates may examine the role of the Empress
     Dowager Cixi (Tz‟u-hsi) in these reform movements and events. The influence of missionaries and
     the rise of the new classes in the treaty ports may also be discussed.

     Candidates will need to address the point regarding where blame could be directed; was the whole
     system rotten and were the rulers to blame for their own downfall or could other factors be held
     responsible? What was the role of foreigners in China‟s problems?

     Candidates may not have detailed knowledge pre-1861 and should not be penalised for this.

     Higher level marks should be reserved for candidates whose answers indicate understanding of
     problems or issues in the late nineteenth century.

8.   To what extent did the Sino–Japanese War (1894–1895) and the Russo–Japanese War
     (1904–1905) change the balance of power in East Asia?

     Candidates will need to remember that in 1894 the major powers in the region were deemed to
     be Britain, France, the United States and Russia. China was expected to win the war with Japan
     which began in 1894. Japanese modernization had been more thorough than China‟s, and its armed
     forces and their command more efficient. Even so, Japan was ready to make peace in 1895 because
     of the economic effects of the war. The balance of power changed in that China‟s traditional claim
     to superiority had been decisively discredited and the balance shifted towards Japan. This was
     manifested in the way that Britain saw Japan as a useful potential ally against her traditional rival,
     Russia. The Anglo–Japanese alliance of 1902 suited both Japan and Britain. However, Japan was
     not seen as an equal to the European powers. The war with Russia in 1904–1905 further upset
     the strategic balance and shifted the balance of power, leaving Japan as the dominant power in
     North East Asia. Britain, France and the United States were greater powers on the world stage, but
     none had military or naval bases of any importance in North East Asia. Although it was not fully
     recognized at the time, the balance of power in North East Asia had tilted in favour of the Japanese,
     especially as Russia was soon engulfed in revolution and, a decade later, the European powers and
     the United States became involved in the First World War. Better candidates may note that this war
     altered the balance of power in Japan‟s favour in East Asia as a whole. Candidates may consider
     the 1922 Washington Conferences as evidence of the Western powers desire to curb Japanese
     strength in the region. Some candidates may also have considered the consequences of Japan‟s
     increasing power on Korea (annexation of Korea in 1910) or China (the 21 Demands in 1915).
     The outcome of the Treaty of Versailles in Japan‟s favour may also be used as evidence of Japan‟s
     new status.

     If only the Sino–Japanese or the Russo–Japanese War is discussed, mark out of a maximum
     of [12 marks].

9.   Compare and contrast the roles of Nehru and Gandhi in the success of the Indian Nationalist
     Movement.

     Both Gandhi and Jawaharlal Nehru were charismatic leaders who attracted the masses to the Indian
     Nationalist Movement and who played an important role in the achievement of Indian
     independence. Jawaharlal Nehru became recognized as Gandhi‟s political heir. Some candidates
     may be confuse Motilal Nehru (father) and Jawaharlal Nehru (son), as both were involved in the
     nationalist movement, and they may wrongly attribute the 1928 Nehru Report in response to Simon
     Commission to Jawaharlal Nehru. Given that the question is not specific enough, candidates should
     not be harshly penalised for this, but obviously to score highly the better candidates should be able
     to distinguish between the father and the son and focus on Jawaharlal Nehru.

     Answers could examine both Jawaharlal Nehru‟s and Gandhi‟s roles within the development of
     Indian nationalism – the situation in 1919 and by 1935, the emergence of a mass movement.
     Candidates may identify Gandhi‟s role in the Indian Nationalist Movement, which may include:
     Gandhi‟s ideas and philosophy; his return to India in 1915; first satyagraha campaign (1917);
     second and third satyagraha campaigns; Gandhi‟s support for the continuation of non-cooperation;
     boycott of foreign goods; the causes and consequences of the Salt March (1930) and the Civil
     Disobedience campaign; Jawaharlal Nehru became a follower of the ideas of Gandhi, so
     comparisons could be made regarding both men‟s support for the non-cooperation movement in the
     1920s and beyond. Both Jawaharlal Nehru and Gandhi were jailed for their opposition to British
     rule. Jawaharlal Nehru became the Indian National Congress President in 1929; in 1938, the rift in
     Congress between the more radical Bose and Gandhi was clear and Jawaharlal Nehru supported
     Gandhi‟s methods of non-violence. Both regretted the deterioration of relationships between
     Hindus and Muslims and the situation after the Second World War from 1945 to 1947. Both
     leaders embraced secularism, socialist economic policies and a non-aligned foreign policy, which
     helped them gain support in the Nationalist Movement. Both men‟s policies challenged the
     traditional caste system and religious discrimination and both leaders shared a common
     understanding regarding the social classes in India.

     Candidates may point out contrasts between the two men in their actions, although comparisons will
     be easier to find. Gandhi concentrated more on the spiritual development of his supporters and
     gradually distanced himself from direct political action, whereas Jawaharlal Nehru brought the
     Indian Nationalist Movement to power in 1947 and became India‟s first Prime Minister. In ruling
     from 1947 until 1964, Jawaharlal Nehru is India‟s longest serving Prime Minister so his
     contributions to the Indian Nationalist Movement after Gandhi‟s death in 1948 may be pointed out.
     The question is about the development of Indian nationalism and the contribution of both leaders so
     expect details from the lives of both men. Expect comparisons and contrasts, although candidates
     may reasonably conclude that both men contributed greatly to the success of the Indian Nationalist
     Movement.

     To score highly candidates should offer running comparisons throughout their response.

     If only Jawaharlal Nehru or Gandhi is discussed, mark out of a maximum of [7 marks].

10.   Analyse the role of Islam in the development of the Indonesian Nationalist Movement between
      1900 and 1942.

      Nationalism in the modern sense began to emerge in Indonesia in the early twentieth century with
      the moderate Budi Utomo, which was basically Javanese and formed in 1908. The vast majority of
      Indonesia‟s population is Muslim and, in 1911, Sarekat Islam was founded. Originally created to
      organize Javanese batik traders in opposition to Chinese competition, it was also opposed to
      Christian missionary activity. In 1912 a Dutch and Eurasian National Indies Party was formed but
      was banned the following year to be replaced by the more moderate Insulinde and the left-wing
      Social-Democratic Association of the Indies. The Dutch creation of the Volksraad did not satisfy
      Indonesian nationalism and nationalism was fanned by Russia‟s defeat by Japan in 1905, the effects
      of the First World War and the Russian Revolution of 1917. In 1918 Sarekat Islam adopted
      a socialist programme. In 1920 Semaun and Darsono formed the PKI or Communist Party of
      the Indies. PKI members were expelled from Sarekat Islam, which declined in importance as
      secular nationalism took over. Islam did play a part here however, as Sarekat Islam campaigned
      against the suppression of Indonesians, and Islamic ideology became the foundation of its
      political struggle.

      In 1926, a PKI revolt was crushed and nationalist support turned to the Indonesian National Party
      (PNI), founded by Sukarno in 1927. Sukarno and other leaders were arrested in 1929 and the party
      banned in 1931. On his release, Sukarno formed the Indonesia Party (Partindo) but was exiled to
      New Guinea in 1933, as were Hatta and Sjarir in 1934. In 1934 Sarekat Islam split between Muslim
      conservatives and socialists. Moderate nationalists attempted to work through the Volksraad but
      their calls for a transition to independence were rejected. In 1939 they formed the Gobongan
      Politek Indonesia (GAPI) which adopted a national flag, language and anthem. 1942 marks the
      time when the Japanese occupied Dutch Indonesia and began, on the surface, to give Sukarno and
      his associates symbolic political freedom. It is clear that Islam played a part in the development of
      nationalism in Indonesia. It is also clear that secular parties became increasingly important and
      Islam was only one factor in defining Indonesian identity. Candidates should be able to identify
      this in their responses but reward an analysis of the role of Islam together with other factors.

11.   “Neither the Chinese Communist Party nor the Guomindang (Kuomintang) entered the
      First United Front in 1924 believing that it would survive for very long.” To what extent do
      you agree with this statement?

      This should be a fairly popular topic and requires an analysis of the aims and policies of the
      Communist Party of China, created in 1921, and the Guomindang (Kuomintang), as reformed by
      Sun Yixian (Sun Yat-sen) in 1924. Both sought the reunification of China on their own terms, but
      had a common interest in defeating the warlords. The Chinese Communist Party (CCP) was formed
      in 1921 and this fledging party was supported by the Comintern. Sun Yixian (Sun Yat-sen) started
      to reorganise the Guomindang (Kuomintang) in 1923 and entered into negotiations with the Soviet
      Union for aid. The 1923 Sun-Joffe Declaration agreed that whilst Communism would not be
      substituted for Sun‟s Three Principles, there were certain shared aims for the GMD and the CCP.
      These included nationalism, ridding China of foreign domination, socialism, defeat of the warlords
      and the establishment of a unified government for China. Despite some objections the CCP
      members were ordered by Comintern to join with the GMD. Both parties differed about the
      ultimate form of government for China and they used the First United Front to further their own
      goals. The CCP members had to join the GMD as individuals and they could see the value of being
      part of a stronger party. The CCP and Comintern believed that the GMD could be subverted from
      within. Sun Yixian (Sun Yat-sen) was fairly idealistic and he wanted to utilise the CCP‟s support
      among the peasantry and workers to gain popular support. The GMD felt that this would give
      impetus to the military advance against the warlords in the North. The CCP saw the opportunities
      created by the Northern advance to spread their ideology among the people. Support for the GMD
      came largely from the urban areas and the commercial classes. After Sun‟s death in 1925, tensions
      between the left and right factions within the GMD developed and Jiang Jieshi (Chiang Kai-shek)
      became leader and military commander. Tensions were developing between the CCP members and
      the GMD over the issue of dual membership and the Communists‟ influence within the
      organisation. Jiang‟s ambitions and aims were not those of the CCP. Cooperation during the
      Northern Expedition brought success, which meant that Jiang could safely turn on the Communists
      in 1927. Reference to the reasons for the formation of the First United Front in 1924; analysis of
      the tensions between the partners over the period are needed to indicate why the viability of the
      partnership in the United Front was always tenuous. Once the some aims had been achieved, the
      relationship began to fall apart and, following the Shanghai massacre, the First United Front was
      dead. Candidates may consider the extent to which each party entered the First United Front in good
      faith, and whether one was more genuine than the other.

      Some credit may be given for reasons why the First United Front collapsed but to score highly
      candidates should focus on the aims of both the GMD (KMT) and the CCP.

12.   “Mao’s leadership was the crucial factor in leading the Communists to victory in the Chinese
      Civil War (1946–1949).” Discuss the validity of this claim.

      Prior to the outbreak of the Sino–Japanese War in 1937, the Communists were on the verge of
      military defeat. However, during the Second World War, the Nationalists bore the brunt of the
      Japanese offensive and suffered enormous losses whilst the Communists expanded and consolidated
      their position in northern China so that in August 1945, when the war finished, they were in a much
      better position than before. However, the Nationalists were still superior on paper and should have
      been able to win the civil war that followed. The eventual victory of the Communists in the civil
      war was a consequence of Communist strengths and Nationalist weaknesses. Candidates will need
      to identify what these factors were in the light of the quotation regarding Mao‟s leadership, and how
      crucial that was as a factor in determining their eventual success. The nature of Mao‟s leadership,
      his decisions and actions will need to be taken into account along with factors such as Communist
      strengths in policy, propaganda, strategy and morale. These may be balanced by Nationalist
      weaknesses including errors of judgment, corruption, incompetence, economic mismanagement,
      low morale, strategic blunders and a loss of the people‟s confidence. How much the Communists‟
      victory was a consequence of Mao‟s leadership, versus other factors and the mistakes made by the
      Nationalists is for the candidates to decide.

      Credit should be given for relevant details about Mao or the Nationalists in the 1930s; however
      responses that are solely based on the events of the 1930s cannot be awarded the highest marks.
      There should also be details and analysis of Mao‟s leadership during the Civil War.


13.   Why did the Japanese “decade of good behaviour” (1921–1931) come to an end?

      The years after the First World War saw the Hara government in Japan follow a period of
      cooperation between themselves and the Western powers. In 1922 Japan signed the Washington
      Naval Agreement, although their failure to secure an agreement on racial equality fuelled some
      discontent at home. But the period was a difficult one domestically, and economic troubles caused
      political problems. Candidates should acknowledge the existing conflict between liberalism and
      democracy on the one hand, and authoritarianism and militarism on the other. Candidates will need
      to show awareness that there was a strengthening of liberal values in Japan in the 1920s, but that
      they were strongly challenged by conservative values and institutions which undermined them.
      The result was, by the end of the decade, the rise of a new militant nationalism, which began to see
      the older institutions of the state and army as embodying the spirit of Japan. This partially helps to
      explain why Japanese democracy was weak, and encouraged the upsurge of militarism in Japan
      later in the period. The onset of the Depression, in 1929 threatened Japanese industries and
      livelihoods as countries closed their markets to Japanese manufacturers. The failure of the political
      parties to handle the effects of the Depression, and to withstand the extreme nationalists and
      militarists, discredited democracy and paved the way for militaristic solutions such as the invasion
      of Manchuria in September 1931. Candidates will also recognize that Japan at the beginning of the
      1930s faced severe economic and social problems, which brought the decade of good behaviour
      to an end.

      Better candidates may challenge the assumption in the question.
                                                 – 15 –             N11/3/HISTX/HP3/ENG/TZ0/AO/M


14.   “The Japanese expected a cruel and harsh occupation but found a benevolent one.
      They feared vindictive rule but found a constructive one.” How accurate is this assessment of
      US Occupation between 1945 and 1952?

      Candidates will probably be familiar with the reforms of the US in Japan in the decade after the
      Second World War. The reforms under the US Occupation should be identified. These may
      include: demilitarization, changing the role of the emperor; the constitution of 1947; land reform;
      dismantling the power of the zaibatsu and the trade unions and widening the availability
      of education. The issue of how constructive the reforms under the US Occupation were may
      be addressed. The question concerns the expectations of the Japanese regarding their conquerors
      and the positive light in which occupation was received. This was achieved because the democratic
      powers had triumphed, and the Japanese were prepared to defer to what was seen as a superior
      system of government: militarism had been discredited by defeat; the emperor cooperated in
      presenting himself as an ordinary individual and the people accepted the change, partly because
      they still respected the emperor‟s wishes. The Occupation authorities however, relied greatly on
      Japanese leaders to carry out their programme of reform. In the process, the Japanese were able to
      adapt the reforms to their own advantage.

      This became easier when the Cold War broke out and the “reverse course” was adopted, preventing
      fundamental social change. With the outbreak of war in Korea, Japan became an important base for
      US and UN forces and a supplier of military material. Conservative elements in Japan benefited
      and left-wing and socialist elements were suppressed, the trade union movement controlled,
      self-defence forces created and the zaibatsu revived in the guise of the keiretsu. The Security Pact
      with the United States linked Japan to the US and the defence arrangements enabled Japan to
      develop its economy without committing large sums to military expenditure. Candidates may refer
      to the Yoshida Doctrine, named after Yoshida Shigeru, prime minister five times between 1946 and
      1954 and a key conservative figure. Yoshida did much to temper reform and took full advantage of
      the opportunities offered by the Korean War and the US alliance. For high marks, expect a clear
      assessment of the quotation and a sophisticated analysis of Japanese involvement in the Occupation
      period in both working for reform, or attempting to dilute it, and in using American preoccupations
      for Japan‟s own ends.

15.   Evaluate how immigration between 1945 and 1995 has changed the nature of society in either
      Australia or New Zealand.

      This is a popular theme for this section and the material ought to be well known. Candidates may
      first identify the nature of society in Australia or New Zealand in 1945. Both were conservative
      societies which were strongly influenced by a British political, legal, economic and cultural
      heritage. The majority of the population was of British ancestry. Both countries had restricted
      immigration policies, although there had been some immigration from other European countries
      prior to 1945. Australia received a higher proportion of non-British immigrants than did New
      Zealand. For Australia, Calwell as minister for immigration in 1945 said that Australia must
      “populate or perish”; he wanted ten British for every non-English speaking immigrant, but this was
      unattainable, so immigrants from Europe were encouraged; 1945–1951, displaced persons including
      Jewish immigrants; 1950s and 1960s, southern European immigration; mid 1960s, some relaxation
      of the White Australia Policy for skilled workers. In 1972, the White Australia Policy was formally
      ended; 1970s, boat people from Indo–China and other Asian immigration; 1980s, people from the
      Middle East. These provided a labour force and were partly responsible for the rapid economic
      development which began in the 1950s. They also introduced new elements into what had been
      a population largely of British origin. Assisted immigration from Britain continued to boost
      migration into both countries. Asian and Pacific Islander immigration rose with the lifting of
      restrictions in the 1970s. When racial barriers were lowered in both countries, New Zealand
      received more immigrants from the Pacific Islands than from Asia, whilst Australia attracted
      more Asians.

      The question asks though, how did this immigration impact the society of the chosen country?
      People in both countries initially saw immigration as a perceived threat to their large but sparsely
      populated country from the densely populated countries to the north. Expect candidates to
      consider social, economic, political and cultural impacts.             Both countries became more
      cosmopolitan, particularly in the larger cities; cultural diversity created social and ethnic tensions,
      some of these due to the continuation of old feuds from immigrants who carried them to their new
      countries. Later immigrants competed with earlier immigrants; white conservative backlash as
      immigrants entered the work force. In Australia the gradual abandonment of the White Australia
      Policy in the 1960s brought firstly a growing number of Asian immigrants but also selected
      immigrants based on wealth and skills. Politically, this reduced sentimental links with the British
      and encouraged a growth in republicanism. Ultimately, the immigrations have encouraged
      multicultural and multiracial societies in both countries and assimilation has been largely peaceful
      and positive. Social and cultural change to the Australian and New Zealand way of life was
      apparent by the 1990s: in food and in eating out in cafes and restaurants; in liquor licensing laws;
      in the diversity of sports played; in the variety and the appreciation of all forms of the arts; in
      religious composition. Both countries became more open and tolerant societies, although there
      were still instances of racism and discrimination. Reserve higher marks for candidates who
      acknowledge the impact of change on a number of areas of national life in the country chosen.

16.   What effect did the rivalry between the Labour party and the National party in New Zealand
      after 1945 have on the conduct of domestic policies?

      Between 1945 and 1975 Labour could count on all the inner-city electorates. Conversely, until the
      1980s, the National Party could rely on its richer city constituencies. Candidates should recognize
      that key dates were 1949 and 1972. A revitalized Labour Party defeated the National Party, and this
      was seen as a watershed in New Zealand‟s political history. When in power, the National Party
      proved to be rather conservative, leading to criticism by the Labour Party which took power
      in 1957. However, their economic policies were criticized, and they lost power back to the National
      Party in the next election and were out of power until 1972. In terms of the impact, a major effect
      of the Labour/National rivalry was the general dissatisfaction of the electorate with both parties in
      the 1970s and the 1980s. The differing ideologies have tended to converge in an effort to win
      support during recent elections. The end result has been a coalescence of many policies and the
      electorate has been left with little real choice. The key question has been the resolution of New
      Zealand‟s economic difficulties based on an import/export imbalance and high unemployment has
      replaced the prosperity of the 1950s/1960s. Accounts of domestic policies should receive a
      satisfactory mark but for higher marks, expect candidates to show the relationship between the
      rivalry of the political parties and a clear understanding of the impact on the domestic
      policies themselves.

17.   To what extent were the domestic policies pursued by Indira Gandhi a continuation of those
      of her father?

      Indira Gandhi was the prime minister of the Republic of India for three consecutive terms
      from 1966 to 1977 and for a fourth term from 1980 until her assassination in 1984, and the
      dominant figure in India for almost two decades. She was India‟s first and, to date, only female
      Prime Minister. Indira Gandhi was autocratic and determined to govern an almost ungovernable
      nation that seemed always in domestic turmoil. She was born to politics and power, the
      granddaughter of Motilal Nehru, an early leader of the Indian independence movement, and
      daughter of Jawaharlal Nehru, who led India as prime minister in its first 17 years of independence
      from Britain. Jawaharlal Nehru‟s social policies/programmes included “Untouchability” (Offences)
      Act of 1955, quotas for harijans in civil service, state assemblies, the universities, Hindu Marriage
      Acts removing barriers to intercaste marriage, raising minimum age of marriage to 18 for males and
      15 for females and giving Hindu women right of divorce. Economic programmes and policies
      under Jawaharlal Nehru included emphasis on centralized economic planning – First Five Year Plan
      (1951) with its attempts to deal with agricultural and, to a lesser extent, industrial growth, the
      Second Five Year Plan (1956 to 1961) with emphasis on heavy industry, mining, power and textiles
      and the Third Five Year Plan (1961 to 1966), which led to India‟s ranking of seventh in the world‟s
      most advanced industrial nations.

      Candidates will probably refer to areas such as the economy, Five Year Plans, industrial
      development and the pursuit of socialist goals in addition to social policies such as dealing with the
      caste system, social equality, the rights of women, population control and education. As Prime
      Minister, Indira Gandhi presided over the world‟s most populous democracy, with the population
      rising from just under 500 million to over 730 million people by the time of her death in 1984.
      During her tenure the government made limited headway against such age-old Indian problems as
      overpopulation, hunger, caste, inadequate sanitation and chronic religious strife among the majority
      Hindus, Muslims and other sects. Indira Gandhi was found guilty of electoral malpractice in the
      1975 elections and from 1975 to 1977, she ruled India under a state of emergency. Analysis from
      candidates could consider the extent to which Indira Gandhi used undemocratic methods in contrast
      to Jawaharlal Nehru‟s commitment to democracy. Better candidates will be able to go beyond
      recounting the domestic policies and should look for the methods of implementation such as
      Jawaharlal Nehru‟s encouragement of social change and domestic improvements, whereas Indira
      Gandhi was more willing to use forceful methods for change.

      Candidates should identify the key policies and aims of both leaders; however the focus of the
      question is Indira Gandhi. Candidates who have misunderstood who Indira Gandhi‟s father was
      cannot score highly.

18.   Consider the view that Ayub Khan provided stability in Pakistan in the years between 1958
      and 1969.

      Candidates will need to set Ayub Khan‟s accession to power in context and should examine
      the problems experienced in Pakistan since 1947 (death of Jinnah, death of Liaquat Ali Khan,
      political instability, economic problems including refugees, food shortages etc., tensions between
      East and West Pakistan, dominance of landlords). An examination of his policies such as land
      reform, implementation of the Second Five Year Plan leading to increased food production,
      hydroelectric power projects, sacking of corrupt civil servants should be expected. Candidates may
      argue that this represented stability. Stability could also be represented by securing electoral
      victory in 1965 providing continuity, but plans “to return to democracy” led to the emergence of
      opposition groups led by Bhutto (often representing landowners). Ultimately Ayub Khan lost the
      support of the military and was deposed in 1969 by Yahya Khan.

      Candidates may comment that Ayub Khan provided a measure of economic stability but political
      stability was only possible with fairly authoritarian methods. Some may argue that Ayub Khan
      provided as much stability as was possible in a nation that was so divided culturally and
      geographically, and also economically. Candidates may look at subsequent events (1971 war, etc.)
      to sustain argument on Ayub Khan‟s relatively stable regime which was considered by many to be
      beneficial to Pakistan.


19.   How successful were Mao Zedong (Mao Tse-tung) and the Chinese Communist Party (CCP)
      in creating a socialist state in the period 1949 to 1961?

      This should be a popular question and requires a thorough knowledge and analysis of domestic
      events and the consolidation of Communist power over the period. Candidates may attempt to
      define what they consider socialism to be and in particular socialism in the Chinese context. This
      may involve a discussion of Mao Zedong‟s (Mao Tse-tung‟s) adaptation of Marxism to suit the
      Chinese situation: land redistribution; peasant participation; class struggle, downwards flow of
      Chinese Communist Party (CCP) workers and ideas to the people and upwards flow of ideas and
      needs to the CCP; gender equality; right thinking, rectification; continuous revolution and Chinese
      nationalism. The success of Mao Zedong (Mao Tse-tung) and the CCP in creating a socialist state in
      the period 1949–1961 may then be assessed in light of the definition. Domestic events and policies
      that candidates may include are: Agrarian Reform 1950 and the “speak bitterness” sessions with the
      landlords; CCP organisation and structure; Marriage Act 1950; Three and Five Antis campaigns
      1952–1953; 1st Five Year Plan 1952–1957; Constitution 1954; 100 Flowers Campaign 1956 and
      the Anti-Rightist Campaign 1957; Great Leap Forward 1958; Sino-Soviet split 1959; Three Bitter
      Years and the Famine 1959-61; Peng Dehuai‟s (P‟eng Te-huai‟s) criticism of Mao and the Lushan
      Conference 1959.

      The material used needs to be relevant to the attempts to build a socialist state, and so expect
      answers to evaluate the attempts made by Mao in applying socialist measures to deal with the
      economy, the government and social reforms and their success. A balanced judgment should be
      arrived at in the context of the situation in which China found herself in 1961, more than a decade
      after the Communists came to power.

      To score highly candidates should address the question by demonstrating an understanding of a
      socialist state/Communism in the context of China.

20.   Analyse the changing relationship between mainland China and Taiwan between 1949 and 1995.

      This question requires candidates to consider the position since the flight of the Guomindang
      (Kuomintang) to Taiwan in 1949. Each regime on the mainland continued to regard Taiwan as a
      province of China and to represent itself as the legitimate government. The Communists did not
      have the naval forces required to invade Taiwan, and the opportunity was lost with the outbreak of
      the Korean War in 1950 and the American decision to protect Taiwan with its fleet. The United
      States refused to recognize the Beijing (Peking) government and its allies followed suit.
      Taiwan retained the Chinese seat in the United Nations and on the Security Council until improved
      relations with mainland China caused the United States to withdraw its opposition to entry in 1971.
      Candidates may show an awareness of the growing complexity of the relationship between the
      mainland and Taiwan, particularly after Jiang Jieshi‟s (Chiang Kai-shek‟s) death in 1975.
      In addition, candidates ought to demonstrate an awareness of the changing relations caused by
      changes in Cold War tensions and attitudes, and the improved relations between the United States
      and China after 1970. The United States continued to protect Taiwan, and attempts by the Chinese
      and Taiwanese governments to find a compromise solution have failed. China‟s economic growth
      since the 1980s has been largely fuelled by Taiwanese investment and expertise channelled mainly
      through Hong Kong. Taiwan continues to represent itself as an independent state, a situation which
      China opposes. Some better responses will incorporate economic and social links and relations, as
      well as the political and international relationships, and also consider the various suggestions
      for incorporating Taiwan into China, perhaps with reference to the Hong Kong model.
      Reward answers that offer a detailed and balanced analysis giving weight to the factors affecting
      and changing attitudes on both sides over time.

21.   Explain the impact of the conflict that began in 1950 between North and South Korea on the
      region in the decade that followed.

      This is not a question simply about the causes of the Korean War and candidates should focus on
      the impact of the conflict on the region. The division of the peninsula was originally a military
      accident in that Japan surrendered before the Soviets could complete their conquest of Korea and
      the country was divided into two occupation zones, which became separate as the Cold War
      developed. Korea was divided between a Communist north and a non-Communist south, both of
      which wanted reunification on their own terms. In June 1950, the north struck first, invading the
      south, which in turn caused the United Nations to react and the conflict to become an international
      crisis when major powers became involved. Candidates should be aware that the outbreak of the
      Korean War in June 1950 had important consequences on the region and the world. The United
      States was still formulating its policy towards the Communist regime in China and the defeated
      Nationalists in Taiwan. President Truman had already announced his policy of “containing”
      Communism; a vote in the Security Council of the United Nations in the absence of the Soviet
      Union authorized UN intervention, and US forces, joined by those of other non-Communist powers,
      entered the conflict. The North Koreans were forced back to the Yalu River, on the border with
      China. Chinese “volunteers” crossed the border and drove the UN forces back to the 38th parallel.
      A ceasefire was agreed in 1953. Candidates should concentrate on the international dimension
      within the context of the developing Cold War, Communist success in China, American perceptions
      of the intentions of the Soviet Union and the role of the United Nations.

      The war had a great impact in the region and beyond. US policy to Japan changed and it became a
      base for the US effort in Korea. Industry was revived, and the “reverse course” restored
      conservatives to power; the Occupation was ended in 1951, the Security Agreement signed and
      Japan became tied to the United States. The war impacted the US‟s relations with China for the
      immediate future and beyond; diplomatic contacts with the Communist government were
      not pursued and China‟s seat on the UN remained with the Nationalists. China and the USSR
      closed ranks. China‟s success in the war raised their international prestige among non-aligned
      countries and indicated to the world that China was a significant power. The Communist regime
      was unrecognized by the US and its allies for the next twenty years. US policy became the
      containment of China, hence US involvement in Vietnam and elsewhere in Southeast Asia.

22.   To what extent did globalization play a key role in the development of one country of the
      region in the second half of the twentieth century?

      Globalization is a term that came into popular usage in the 1980s to describe the increased
      movement of people, knowledge, ideas, goods and money across national borders, which has led to
      increasing interconnectedness among the world‟s populations. It is the tendency for markets to
      become global rather than national as barriers to international trade (e.g. tariffs) are reduced and
      international transport and communications improve, and the tendency for large multinational
      companies to grow to service global markets.

      Candidates may use Japan as the country of the region; Japan is a special case and globalization has
      played a key role in its development. After the war, Japan‟s major trading partner was the US in the
      early stages of its international trade. With the advantageous tariff and quota Japan faced after the
      Second World War, Japanese imports flooded into the US. To maintain their price advantage with
      the West, Japan moved production facilities to other Asian countries as costs rose domestically in
      the latter part of the twentieth century. Since Japan was already comfortable with moving raw
      materials to its own shores and adding value to it before shipping to Western markets, it was a
      relatively easy transition to move production facilities to other Asian countries with lower costs.
      Japan effectively expanded its available labour force to include those of other Asian countries as
      well and has diversified economic production to sell their products to foreign markets, ranging from
      children‟s toys to electronics and automobiles. Whichever country the candidate selects, they need
      to discuss its development in the context of globalization, and assess the extent to which it has
      played a key role.

      Candidates should offer some definition or show understanding of globalization in the context of
      the question.


23.   Assess the impact of economic development since 1945 on the living standards of any one
      nation of the region.

      This is an intentionally broad question and candidates may choose any state within the region.
      All countries (including Australia and New Zealand) have in common the changes that have
      occurred in living standards since 1950. Candidates will probably argue that living standards
      have improved, and will cite examples ranging from personal wealth and possessions to improved
      social services, civil order and security, communications, leisure and entertainment. More
      perceptive candidates will realize that there are pockets of poverty in even the most affluent
      societies, that economic development may degrade regions and peoples, that development may
      be uneven, that rural areas may be drained of population and investment, that certain nations,
      regions, provinces, ethnic minorities and others may not all benefit to the same extent, if at all.
      Some candidates may be tempted to write a criticism on the evils of development and
      other candidates, to over-emphasize its blessings. For high marks, expect reasoned, balanced
      discussion based on evidence, knowledge and awareness that political and social factors play an
      important role.

      The chosen country should be assessed to the end of the twentieth century.

24.   Which has had the most significant effect on East and Southeast Asia in the second half of the
      twentieth century, Western ideas or Western technology?

      There is room for debate on both ideas and technology, so reward candidates who argue
      convincingly and use supporting evidence. Some may comment on the role of the media, including
      the international influence of satellite television and the worldwide web, for bringing ideas or as
      representing Western technology. Some may condemn the influence of both ideas and technology
      on traditional cultures and values in various forms. Other candidates may argue that both Western
      ideas and technology have brought about the development of democratic institutions albeit with an
      Asian stamp. There may be wide-ranging views, but expect them to be supported by knowledge
      and evidence. Candidates may argue that by the end of the century, technology and its development
      was no longer a preserve of the West.

      If only ideas or technology is addressed, mark out of a maximum of [12 marks].
