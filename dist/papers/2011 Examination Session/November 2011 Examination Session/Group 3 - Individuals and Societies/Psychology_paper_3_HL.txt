The stimulus material below is based on a research article that describes an observational study to
investigate the efficacy of a parent training programme for parents with children with emotional and
behavioural difficulties (EBD).

            Research suggests that negative parenting, for example, inconsistent discipline and/or lack
            of reinforcement for appropriate behaviour, could contribute to emotional and behavioural
            difficulties (EBD) in children. Since such a disorder can be difficult for children and parents,
            and may have devastating consequences for the child’s life, psychologists have developed
     5      intervention programmes to teach parenting skills to parents.

            A group of psychologists working at a centre for children with behavioural problems performed
            a non-participant overt observation to study the effectiveness of a particular parent training
            programme. The programme was a group-based intervention programme for five single parents
            who had children with behaviour problems. The parents were fully informed about the purpose
   10       of the observational study and they signed an informed consent form before the start of the study.

            The aim of the study was to investigate how parents responded to the parent training programme,
            which consisted of teaching new parenting skills such as:
            • how to establish a positive relationship with the child through play and child-centred activities
            • how to reward and encourage the child for positive behaviour
   15       • how to set effective and consistent limits.

            The parents came to a centre to participate in training twice a week over a period of three weeks.
            The training consisted of interactions between the parents and a facilitator who was not part
            of the research team. All sessions were videotaped for further analysis. The session typically
            started with the parents watching a video showing one example of a parent–child interaction.
   20       The purpose of showing the videos was to start group discussions with the facilitator, to encourage
            role play and to help parents share possible solutions to the problem they had watched on the video.
            At the end of each session, the parents were encouraged to employ the new techniques at home.
            In the following session, they would discuss the effectiveness of the techniques with the other
            single parents in the group.

   25       For the duration of the programme the parents expressed increasing satisfaction with the
            development of their relationship with their child. They said they felt more confident and secure
            in their role as parent. The overall findings were that group interactions with a facilitator helped
            parents to establish a different and better relationship with their child. However, there were times
            when they found it difficult to be consistent in using the new techniques. They also expressed
   30       satisfaction with the social support and understanding from other parents and the facilitator.
