1.   (a)   Explain how one multi-governmental organization has led to a loss of
           sovereignty.                                                                      [10 marks]

           Candidates would be expected to define their chosen multi-governmental
           organization as a grouping of nations, providing as their example the EU,
           NAFTA, MERCOSUR, ASEAN or others.

           The example chosen will influence the answer, as some MGOs are merely free
           trade areas while others have a common external tariff; in the case of the EU a
           common market and fuller economic union with shared currency and freedom
           of movement for workers. Thus an answer based around the EU will most
           likely assert that sovereignty has indeed been lost, while one based around
           NAFTA may address the phrase “loss of sovereignty” more reservedly.

           Accept a wide interpretation of MGO to include the IMF, UN, G20, NATO etc.
           However, such answers may be self-limiting and unlikely to gain the higher
           bands as it may be hard to display a loss of sovereignty.

           Marks should be allocated according to the markbands.

(b)   Discuss the interrelationships between global interactions and changes in
      technology.                                                                           [15 marks]

      Credit all content in line with the markbands. Credit unexpected approaches
      wherever relevant.

      One view is that technology drives global interactions. Historically, improved
      transport and communications networks have enabled the flows that allow
      global interactions to occur [Guide 2]. Expect details about cheap air flights
      driving global tourism [Guide 5]; the internet driving the growth of virtual
      communities (Facebook); spatial diffusion into new markets (e.g. mobile
      uptake in Africa and Asia. Various forms of technology are a key factor
      explaining the growth in power and influence of TNCs (with their ability to
      “knit” places together as part of a productive division of labour, out-sourcing
      or through their attempts to build markets around the world) [Guide 3]. Also
      credit references to “technology transfer” by TNCs and application of the
      shrinking world concept / time-space compression [Guide 2].

      Another reciprocal view exists, which is that globalization drives technology.
      It is global consumerism [Guide 5] which drives innovation, outsourcing and
      the technologies needed to make it all possible. Demand from people for faster
      internet (HD TV on demand etc.) leads to large TNCs re-investing profits into
      R & D hubs. Some answers might even touch on the role of international
      conflict in driving military technologies (roots of internet lie here). Or the need
      for diasporas to maintain communication [Guide 5].

      To attain band E, there must be some acknowledgement or suggestion of an
      “interrelationship” rather than just “relationship” – and the reciprocal relation
      should be mentioned or strongly implied.

      Other approaches may be equally valid. Accept a wide interpretation of
      “technology” (e.g. global diffusion of medicare, farming techniques etc.)

2.   (a)   Explain how global core areas (hubs) can be distinguished from peripheral
           areas.                                                                             [10 marks]

           Candidates would be expected to define “global core areas / hubs” as
           significant places that provide a focal point for global flows and activities.
           They are places where major diaspora groups may be found or may be
           identified as source regions either for contemporary cultural diffusion
           (e.g. Seattle’s computer industries) or economic imperialism (e.g.
           Washington). The scale at which hubs can be identified is open to
           interpretation. Small cities like Cambridge (UK) are hubs; but so too are
           megacities such as Sao Paulo and small states including Monaco and
           Luxemburg.

           Arguably, entire nations such as Singapore and South Korea could be described
           as hubs at which point the term hub is almost synonymous with “core” in world
           systems analysis. But an appropriate “core and periphery” analysis in 2011
           should not simply echo 1970s World Systems theory. Responses that do not
           acknowledge this and do not examine more than a simple “MEDC-LEDC”
           worldview (e.g. by at least acknowledging a semi-periphery of emerging
           economies / NICs) should not progress beyond band C (within bands D and E,
           a good explanation of a fuller range of characteristics could compensate for a
           more limited description of the hub / periphery pattern).

           At bands D and E, answers need to be focused on how such places can be
           distinguished from other places and should not just assert that they exist.
           People and organizations in hubs will display high levels of global
           participation which could be measured using KOF or AT Kearney indices.
           They may also host major diasporas or can be mapped as source regions for
           key “globalized” cultural traits including language (such as English or
           Spanish). Mapping the head offices of large TNCs is another route of
           enquiry. Other routes could include a ranking of the competitiveness of
           financial centres, airports; ports; internet bandwidth availability; reliance on
           agriculture.

           Other approaches may be equally valid.

           Marks should be allocated according to the markbands.

(b)   Examine the geographical consequences of international outsourcing.                 [15 marks]

      Credit all content in line with the markbands. Credit unexpected approaches
      wherever relevant.

      Outsourcing should be clearly defined as the concept of taking internal
      company functions and paying an outside firm to handle them [Guide 3].
      “Geographical consequences” of outsourcing can encompass economic,
      political, social, cultural, environmental, geopolitical and demographic themes
      at varying scales, for both host and source regions. Outsourcing occurs across
      all sectors of industry from agriculture to high-tech research. It can be a
      complex affair when strings of sub-contractors (both up-stream and down-
      stream linkages) are part of the picture.

      Improvements in ICT are an important consequence (due to the need for
      enhanced video-conferencing capability, etc.) and not merely a cause of out-
      sourcing [Guide 2, Guide 3]. So too are trade blocs (MGOs), insofar as
      businesses will lobby for expanded tariff-free trade areas within which they
      may out-source at lower cost to themselves [Guide 6].

      At a national and local (city region) scale, a key theme must be the reaction to
      loss of jobs in “source” economies [Guide 7], but growth for emerging “host”
      economies. Sweat shop workers may be cast as “victims” or beneficiaries of
      global capitalism in this account according to the case studies used
      (outsourcing includes “white-collar” work in Bangalore, for instance) or the
      candidate’s political convictions (though exploitation needs to be evidenced
      and not simply asserted). TNC shareholders may be recognized as being
      amongst the real winners of outsourcing [Guide 3].

      Environmental aspects are likely to be a popular theme, notably in relation to
      pollution [Guide 4]. However, high band answers should make it clear that the
      problems result from outsourcing (so unreliable sub-contractors are the issue) –
      and not simply the internationalization of trade.

      It may not always be clear whether genuine outsourcing or a firm’s own
      division of labour is being discussed (e.g. as a cause of de-industrialization in
      developed countries). The benefit of the doubt should be given and a band D
      mark could be awarded to answers that are insecure on the precise meaning of
      out-sourcing but are strong on the varied geography of global shift.

      There are many possible approaches and these should be assessed on their
      merits. Depth might compensate for lack of breadth.

      Marks should be allocated according to the markbands.

3.   (a)   Analyse the consequences of one specific transboundary pollution event.               [10 marks]

           A transboundary pollution event is one which has damaging effects for more
           than one country. It is most likely that candidates will analyse a major oil spill
           or air pollution event. “Event” strongly suggests a single dated occurrence but
           some credit should still be given to an account of a more pervasive problem
           (such as acid rain). Thus, for band E, the account must clearly relate to
           transboundary pollution (thus the pollution type is named, e.g. sulphur dioxide
           or crude oil; affected states are clearly identified). Further, the temporal aspect
           should be addressed: if not a single event (e.g. an oil spill) then a period (year
           or decade) must be identified (giving us a broad interpretation of “event”). An
           account of acid rain that is not geographically or historically specific should
           not move beyond band C. If both are there, band E is possible.

           It should be made explicit who is affected and why the event is
           “transboundary”. The consequences may include: immediate ecological and
           environmental harm; longer clear-up operations; subsequent changes in
           national and/or international legislature; implications for the polluter (such as
           poor publicity and “PR nightmare” for TNCs).

           The best answers may have a range of varied consequences (such as political /
           governance response) and will not simply focus on ecological damage.

           Pollution events such as the Bhopal incident are not transboundary but may
           achieve band C if the concept of transnational has been well-explored (idea of
           TNCs moving their pollution / unsafe operations overseas). The movement of
           recycling wastes to China may be marked in the same way (it’s hardly an
           event, but some limited credit for the transboundary / transnational aspects of
           the case study could be given idea if it has been well-written).

           Marks should be allocated according to the markbands.
                                             –8–               N11/3/GEOGR/HP3/ENG/TZ0/XX/M



(b)   “The negative effects of globalization on cultural traits have been
      overstated.” Discuss this statement.                                                 [15 marks]

      Credit all content in line with the markbands. Credit unexpected approaches
      wherever relevant.

      The negative effects candidates should be familiar with includes the threat of
      cultural homogenization associated with the diffusion of western and latterly
      Japanese cultural traits and branded commodities. In extreme cases this can be
      described as cultural imperialism. [Guide 5]. The cultural production of
      homogenised landscapes may be commented on [Guide 4].

      The question invites discussion of whether this first viewpoint has been
      overstated. The strongest responses will recognize alternative responses
      exist and globalization can be challenged / contested. They may suggest a
      variety of alternative outcomes e.g. hybridization / glocalization of branded
      products [Guide 7]; or growth of diaspora music and art that draws on
      global influences [Guide 5]. More extreme forms of rejection also exist,
      such as throwing out TNCs and the IMF [Guide 3] or the resistance of
      nationalist parties to MGO membership [Guide 6]; at a local level, people
      may “opt-out” and pursue strategies such as local sourcing of food (food
      preferences being a cultural trait) [Guide 7].

      The persistence of diaspora traits is also clear evidence of cultural resilience
      (i.e. the idea that cultural traits can easily survive) [Guide 5]. Equally, it may
      be argued that some cultures have remained free of global influences by choice
      e.g. Bhutan [Guide 7].

      The process of cultural homogenization – if it exists – can be very complex and
      alternative viewpoints should be credited on their merits.

      At bands D and E, both sides of the argument should be addressed, although
      balance need not be expected if the candidate has a strong evidenced argument
      that mostly agrees or disagrees with the title.

      A wide variety of cultural traits can be accepted including any that are not
      specifically mentioned in the syllabus. Answers that rely heavily on just one or
      two case studies (especially if their relevance to contemporary globalization is
      spurious, such as early encounters between westerners and the Dani tribe) are
      likely to be too narrow to receive much AO3 credit – and are unlikely to
      progress beyond band C.

      Marks should be allocated according to the markbands.
