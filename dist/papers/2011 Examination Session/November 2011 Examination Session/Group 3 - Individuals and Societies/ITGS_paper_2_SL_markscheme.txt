Examiners should be aware that in some cases, candidates may take a different approach, which if
appropriate should be rewarded. If in doubt, check with your Team Leader.

In the case of an “identify” question read all answers and mark positively up to the maximum marks.
Disregard incorrect answers. In the case of a “describe” question, which asks for a certain number of
facts e.g. “describe two kinds”, mark the first two correct answers. This could include two descriptions,
one description and one identification, or two identifications. In the case of an “explain” question,
which asks for a specified number of explanations e.g. “explain two reasons”, mark the first two
correct answers. This could include two full explanations, one explanation, one partial explanation, etc.

“ITGS terminology refers to both the IT technical terminology and to the terminology related to social
and ethical impacts.”

                                             SECTION A

                              Area of impact: Business and employment

1.   (a)   Define the term pattern recognition.                                                [2 marks]

           Answers may include:
           • the identification of objects and images by their characteristics (e.g. shape,
             form, outline, colour, movement, etc.)
           • automatic matching against stored data
           • uses artificial intelligence
           • classifies data (patterns) based on prior knowledge.

           Award [1 mark] for any of the above points up to a maximum of [2 marks].

     (b)   In addition to fingerprints, describe two other methods of biometric
           recognition.                                                         [4 marks]

            Answers may include:
           • facial recognition – facial characteristics captured by a camera/numerical data
              associated with facial features/”faceprint” is compared to a database of
              “faceprints”
           • retinal scanning – using a low intensity light source to capture the pattern of
              blood vessels in the retina
           • iris scanning – captures the unique random patterns of the iris using a camera
           • voice recognition – compares voice patterns
           • hand geometry – measures the physical characteristics of the user’s hand and
              fingers.

           The description may include the biometric recognition method used or the details
           of the comparison of the data collected with the data stored in a database.
           N.B. Do not accept “gait recognition”.

           Award [1 mark] for each method identified up to a maximum of [2 marks].
           Award an additional [1 mark] for the description of each method up to a
           maximum of [2 marks].
                                              –4–                 N11/3/ITGSX/SP2/ENG/TZ0/XX/M


(c)   Explain why biometrics is increasingly used to authenticate employees
      entering a building.                                                  [4 marks]

      Answers may include:
      • extremely difficult to falsify – biometrics are unique to each individual person
        and therefore are a reliable method of identifying an individual
      • they don’t need to have an ID card – it is part of the person (finger, eyes, face,
        voice, etc.), so there is nothing that has to be brought with them to gain access,
        can’t lose it like you can an ID card
      • can’t be stolen – it isn’t a portable object hence no one can steal it, it is part of
        the person’s anatomy
      • can’t be easily manipulated – can’t alter oneself easily to impersonate an
        employee and gain access to a building.

      [1 mark]
      A limited response that indicates very little understanding of the topic.

      [2–3 marks]
      A reasonable description of why biometrics is increasingly used to authenticate
      employees entering a building, although the answer may lack appropriate
      reasoning at the lower end of the band.

      [4 marks]
      A clear, detailed and balanced explanation of why biometrics is increasingly used
      to authenticate employees entering a building.
                                              –5–                N11/3/ITGSX/SP2/ENG/TZ0/XX/M


(d)   Discuss the advantages and disadvantages of using the way a person walks
      (video gait pattern recognition) to verify the person’s identity.        [10 marks]

      Answers may include:
      Advantages
      • unobtrusive – the gait of a person walking can be extracted without the user
        knowing they are being analysed and without any cooperation from the user in
        the information gathering stage, unlike fingerprinting or retina scans.
      • distance recognition – the gait of an individual can be captured at a distance,
        unlike other biometrics such as fingerprint recognition
      • reduced detail – gait recognition does not require captured images to be of a
        very high quality, unlike other biometrics such as face recognition, which can
        be easily affected by low resolution images
      • difficult to conceal – the gait of an individual is difficult to disguise, by trying
        to do so the individual will probably appear more suspicious. With other
        biometric techniques, such as face recognition, the individual’s face can easily
        be altered or hidden
      • video footage is readily available – cameras are inexpensive to install
      • difficult to imitate – many parameters involved (i.e. step length, step width,
        step speed, joint movement, height).

      Disadvantages
      • stimulants/depressants – drugs and alcohol will affect the way in which a
         person walks. Reliability of data collected is in question as the video may have
         been taken when they were under the influence
      • physical changes – pregnancy, accident/disease affecting the leg, or severe
         weight gain/loss can all affect the movement characteristic of an individual
      • privacy of the individual being videotaped may be compromised as they are
         unaware they are being recorded
      • psychological – a person’s mood can also affect an individual’s gait signature
         which may vary from the time the data was collected
      • clothing – the same person wearing different clothing may cause an automatic
         signature extraction method to create a widely varying signature for
         an individual
      • camera positioning – person must walk perpendicular to camera.

      In part (d) of this question it is acceptable if there is more emphasis on the
      ITGS terminology related to social and ethical impacts and less on IT technical
      terminology.

                                            SECTION B

                                      Area of impact: Education

2.   (a)   Define the term spam.                                                                [2 marks]

           Answers may include:
           • unsolicited e-mail
           • e-mail sent in bulk to lists of recipients
           • e-mail that is often irrelevant and contains inappropriate material.

           Award [1 mark] for any of the above points up to a maximum of [2 marks].

           Award [1 mark] for any one of the points below if a student has not already
           reached the maximum marks. (A student may not gain [2 marks] by only
           mentioning the points below as alone these do not define spam).

           • e-mail that is often irrelevant and contains inappropriate material/often
              advertising products
           • generally comes from an unknown source
           • is automatically generated
           • may contain a virus.

     (b)   Many schools no longer print and post newsletters.

           Describe two ways schools can distribute newsletters electronically to parents
           and the school community.                                                      [4 marks]

           Answers may include:
           • via a listserv – subscribers join the listserv which automatically sends e-mails
             to all names on a mailing list
           • via a web site/intranet – the newsletter file (in PDF format) is uploaded to the
             school’s web site and parents can log in and download it
           • via a web site – the newsletter is copied and pasted onto the web page
           • via e-mail – parents’ names are on a distribution list and the school secretary
             sends the newsletter by e-mail/parents subscribe or choose to opt in/sent as an
             attachment which can be downloaded and saved to parents’ computer/sent as a
             pdf so it cannot be edited/can be accessed by laptop or PC or smart phone
           • via a school portal/intranet using push technology
           • via a blog – parents can subscribe to receive updates e.g. via RSS.

           Award [1 mark] for identifying each way up to a maximum of [2 marks].
           Award an additional [1 mark] for the description of each way up to a maximum of
           [2 marks].

(c)   Many parents receive the SMS alerts on their smart phones. The latest smart
      phones come with up to 32 GB of storage.

      Explain the reasons why many people want this amount of storage on their
      smart phones.                                                            [4 marks]

      Answers may include:
      • users can download and store “apps” – apps add functionality but require
        storage space
      • the smart phone stores an operating system – if this is updated, the operating
        system requires additional memory
      • storage for podcasts – these may be long and hence require large amounts
        of storage space
      • movies and TV shows can be downloaded and stored – multimedia files
        are large
      • storage of digital photos taken with the inbuilt camera – high resolution photos
        are large
      • storage of music files – takes up a large space
      • users often wish to store files so they can be shared with friends
      • smart phones can be used as eReaders – therefore storage space is needed to
        store eBooks
      • smart phones need storage space to store documents that can be edited with
        Docs to Go applications, or sent by email and need to be stored to work on
        them, read or share.

(d)   Discuss the advantages and disadvantages of introducing Simplified Alerts for
      schools and parents.                                                          [10 marks]

      Answers may include:
      Advantages for schools
      • a cheap way of contacting a large group of people
      • fast/convenient – one message can be sent to all relevant school staff and
        parents
      • easy to reach parents in cases of emergency
      • easy to use – little staff training is required
      • convenient as standard messages can be prewritten and stored
      • allows the school to keep records of past messages.

      Disadvantages for schools
      • the school does not know if the message is received – who is responsible in an
        emergency if parents don’t check their cell (mobile) phones or e-mail?
      • if the system fails an alternative method must be put in place
      • the system relies on up-to-date parental information / notification of alternative
        contact details if parents are away
      • training costs
      • cost of purchase and maintenance of the system
      • if parents enter incorrect details/data entry error then messages will not
        be received
      • there will be a time lag at the start whilst parents sign up and enter details.

      Advantages for parents
      • parents can be alerted to sports cancellations – saves time travelling to a
        cancelled practice
      • it is a fast way of making contact in an emergency
      • many parents have cell (mobile) phones/e-mail – no additional services are
        needed
      • parents can be alerted anywhere they have their cell (mobile) phones
      • more reliable than a note sent home after school – e.g. to inform of changed
        location of sport practice.

      Disadvantages for parents
      • if the system fails messages may not arrive/may arrive too late
      • parents who do not have cell (mobile) phones or e-mails cannot participate –
        alternative methods would need to be used in this case as parents may feel
        excluded
      • parents may not check e-mails regularly and therefore they will not receive the
        information or will receive it too late
      • size limit on SMS messages means they will be cryptic and may not be fully
        understood
      • overuse of the system could become annoying
      • the school must ensure that personal details (name, email address, mobile
        phone number) are secure
      • if parents are not in the country messages may have a high cost to send
        (some phone carriers may even charge parents when receiving them)

• alerts may arrive at inconvenient times and interrupt parents activities at work
  (e.g.: during an office meeting) and parents may switch it off or opt out if these
  become too frequent.

Award up to a maximum of [7 marks] for only discussing implications to either
schools or parents.

In part (d) of this question it is acceptable if there is more emphasis on the
ITGS terminology related to social and ethical impacts and less on
IT technical terminology.

3.   (a)   With reference to the relational database diagram above, describe the
           nature of the relationship between the table DRUGS and the table
           INTERACTIONS.                                                         [2 marks]

           Answers may include:
           • one to many
           • one drug can have many different interactions
           • one record in the DRUGS table may have many corresponding records in the
             INTERACTIONS table
           • The field Drug_Name links the two tables.

           Award [1 mark] for any of the above points up to a maximum of [2 marks].

     (b)   It is important that the database is accurate.

           Describe two design features that a database designer could use to prevent
           data input errors.                                                         [4 marks]

           Answers may include:
           • setting field types – e.g. a field set to “numeric” only allows numbers to be
             entered / a field set to “date format” only allows dates to be entered
           • using input masks – the number of characters and their type can be specified
           • creating drop down lists – this limits the input to a set list
           • adding validation rules – this allows a range check on the data
           • creating user input forms – limits data input to information specified by the
             database designer.

           Award [1 mark] for identifying each feature up to a maximum of [2 marks].
           Award an additional [1 mark] for the description of each feature up to a
           maximum of [2 marks].

(c)   This prescription database now comes in many electronic formats.
      Two possible formats are a CD-ROM version and an online version
      accessible through a web site.

      Compare the effectiveness of these two formats in providing a doctor with the
      necessary information.                                                        [4 marks]

      Answers may include:
      • the CD may only be updated a couple of times a year – the online version can
        be updated as new drugs/conditions appear
      • the information on the CD is limited – the online version can provide
        hyperlinks to further medical information/contacts
      • multimedia files, e.g. for training, are readily accessible on a CD – access to
        multimedia will depend on bandwidth in the online version
      • the CD runs on a local computer with no internet requirements – the online
        version requires internet connection
      • if the internet connection is lost then the database is not accessible throughout
        the doctor’s consultation with the patient – if a single computer breaks down
        another computer can be used to access the CD
      • the online version could be slower than the CD if there is a slow internet
        connection – this might increase the time of the consultation
      • CD content cannot be changed – the online version is susceptible to hacking
      • CDs have limited storage (more than one CD may be needed) – more can be
        stored using an online version
      • CDs can become damaged or lost – the online version is less susceptible to
        damage/lost data (provided it is secured/backed up).
      • technical issues could arise when installing a CD
      • online versions available on mobile devices and netbooks, CD-ROM is not
        accessible on these devices

(d)   Discuss how the use of the prescription database shown above can help a
      doctor to improve medical care.                                         [10 marks]

      Answers may include:
      • a database contains comprehensive information – a textbook can be more
        limited due to size/updates and/or the doctor’s own knowledge is limited
      • search techniques/complex queries allow fast access to information – whereas
        doctors may take time consulting textbooks / doctors may have more time for
        other patients
      • provided data is entered correctly, information will be accurate – textbooks
        become out of date quickly and may not include details of the latest drugs –
        and/or a doctor’s memory may not be reliable
      • information can be easily updated – a text book becomes out of date quickly
        and needs to be reprinted – and/or a busy doctor may not have time to keep up
        to date with the latest medical journals
      • complex queries/reports can be generated and provide a more detailed
        explanation of drug effects – whereas manual searching is limited
      • by alerting doctors to interactions with other drugs/conditions, serious side
        effects can be avoided – side effects could be flagged in a database – and/or
        doctors can’t remember all interactions/side effects
      • a database can include a user-friendly interface – books are sometimes difficult
        to navigate
      • electronic formats enable printing of prescriptions and these could possibly be
        copied to a patient’s electronic file
      • results displayed on a screen will be easier to read (may be enlarged) – small
        print in textbooks can be difficult to read and may result in incorrect doses.

      CONCERNS
      • doctors cannot use the system and training may be required
      • doctors cannot apply their findings to a particular patient
      • the database is not up-to-date – new drugs/interactions are not included
      • the design of the database is faulty/queries are not accurate.

      In part (d) of this question it is expected there will be a balance in the ITGS
      terminology between IT technical terminology and the terminology related to
      social and ethical impacts.

             with different opponents in different sessions online, can play when no one is
             physically present
           • more realistic – uses online maps that represent real places
           • constantly updated – changes represent new cities and streets in the world
           • not defined to local area – can play with others around the world

(d)   Discuss the agreements that need to be in place between Google and Hasbro
      to retain the integrity of the Google Maps database and to ensure the
      accuracy of the game data.                                                [10 marks]

      Answers may be accepted for either of the following scenarios.

      Scenario 1: Assuming the Monopoly database is not updated during the duration
      of the game.

      Answers may include:
      • Hasbro must have an understanding of the formats used by Google – standard
        formats – reason
      • Google must be prepared to give certain details of data structure – reason
      • Google has the right to view and use data collected in the Hasbro database,
        impact may be that popular streets are identified – reason
      • Google must not have access to personal details of players of Hasbro – reason
      • Google logo must be displayed on all pages of the map – reason
      • Hasbro must not change the design of the page without agreement with Google
        – reason
      • Google Maps database has to be read only – so the data can be imported but
        not changed – reason.

      Scenario 2: Assuming the Monopoly database is updated frequently during the
      game to reflect current real life changes in streets, the additional responses are
      also acceptable.

      Answers may include:
      • Google has to let Hasbro know of updates and the frequency of these updates
        – reason
      • Google has to carry out updates at a reasonable price – reason
      • Hasbro must have a contingency method implemented to deal with deleted/
        changed streets so that players’ rights are not overwritten – reason.

      In part (d) of this question it is acceptable if there is more emphasis on the
      ITGS terminology related to social and ethical impacts and less on IT technical
      terminology.

           Answers may include:
           • roadworks – construction on the route may cause problems
           • bridge – the distance below the bridge could be a factor
           • accidents – unpredictable circumstances will need to be accounted for
           • roundabout – could make the proximity of other robots appear closer than
             they are
           • traffic lights – this would need to be incorporated into the model
           • queuing traffic – these vehicles are stopped temporarily, which is different to
             immobile objects such as a parked car. Are they programmed to deal
             differently with different scenarios?

      Answers may include:
      • human decision-making versus robot’s – is a robot more or less reliable than a
        human in various driving situations?
      • robot malfunction – what would happen if the robot malfunctions (override
        option, backup system, etc.)
      • robot expertise – they can learn from previous mistakes
      • data collection (speed, braking, steering, etc.) – privacy issues for its users.
        Who has access to this information?
      • responsibility – who is responsible if system fails?
      • system failure – if the system fails an alternative method must be put in place
      • robots could be instructed to drive at a maximum speed within the law and
        abide by other traffic laws
      • environmental factors – robots could be programmed to drive for maximum
        efficiency (time, fuel emissions, etc.)

           Answers may include:
           • overwriting media for sanitization – replacing previously stored data on a drive
             or disk with a random pattern of meaningless information which effectively
             renders the data unrecoverable
           • using commercial software designed to permanently erase the data from
             computer components
           • destruction of media – the process of physically damaging a medium so that it
             is not usable by any device that may normally be used to read electronic
             information.

(c)   Compare two different methods used to dispose of computer hardware that is
      no longer required by an organization.                                     [4 marks]

      Answers may include:
      • recycle/sell – giving it to another person or organization who may need it,
        hardware remains in use and not in the garbage/landfills. This could have
        security issues if data is not properly removed from hardware
      • re-use – environmentally friendly, take parts and use them for other purposes
      • landfill – cheaper, minimal costs to dispose at a landfill
      • trade-in – trade older hardware for newer hardware, saves money.

      [1–2 marks]
      The candidate conveys some understanding of the similarities between the two
      different methods used to dispose of computer hardware, but the two ways would
      have been described in isolation.

(d)   A government has introduced two policies to prevent unauthorized access to
      sensitive data:
      • employees must have secure passwords that they do not share with anyone
      • no sensitive data can be downloaded from the main server to any other
         devices.

      To what extent will these two policies prevent unauthorized access to
      sensitive data?                                                       [10 marks]

      Answers may include:
      • employees are accountable for their actions from their accounts, but it will be
        very difficult to prevent people from sharing passwords if they wish to do so
      • secure passwords will be difficult to crack
      • if data can only be accessed on the server, it is harder to carelessly lose
        sensitive data
      • data isn’t allowed to be transferred to other devices that can be lost or stolen
      • data transfer cannot be intercepted since transferring of data is prohibited
      • these policies are limited if data can be copied from a screen display and
        recorded electronically or by hand (could have legal implications)
      • policies – will not prevent human failing such as leaving a client computer
        logged on while they are absent for a period of time
      • how can/will this policy be enforced to prevent unauthorized access (policies
        and procedures)?
