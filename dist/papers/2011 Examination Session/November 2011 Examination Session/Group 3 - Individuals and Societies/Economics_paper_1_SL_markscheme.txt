                 unrelated goods.

(b)   Discuss the usefulness of price elasticity of demand (PED) and
      cross-elasticity of demand (XED) to businesses trying to increase their
      sales revenue.                                                                     [15 marks]

        the price of goods with PED

        between products to increase sales by cutting the price of one product to sell
        more of a complement

        demand for a complementary product

        a substitute product
       examples of businesses responding to price changes in complements and
        substitute products
       evaluation of the usefulness of PED and cross-elasticity of demand (XED)
        by considering the problems of measuring PED/XED e.g. PED and XED are
        constantly changing
       evaluation of how the factors affecting the demand for a product are all
        changing at the same time
       evaluation of how PED/XED changes over time.

      Effective evaluation may be to:
       consider short-term versus long-term consequences
       examine the impact on different stakeholders
       discuss advantages and disadvantages
       prioritize the arguments.

2.   (a)   Explain three factors that could cause an economy to go into recession.            [10 marks]

           Answers should include:
            a definition of recession
            how a fall in any one of the components of AD could lead to a recession:
             – consumption
             – investment
             – government expenditure
             – net exports
            an AD/AS diagram to illustrate a recession.

           Answers may include:
            how a rise in costs could cause a recession on the supply-side, e.g. a rise in
             the price of oil
            any factor explained on the demand-side or supply-side can be treated as a
             separate cause of a recession
            recessions are often global in nature; a recession in one country can lead to
             recessions in other countries.

           Where a candidate considers one factor the maximum level awarded is level 2;
           for two factors, maximum level 3.

                and absolute advantage not required)
             – lower prices to consumers and producers from increased competition
             – greater variety of goods and services available to consumers and
                producers.

           Answers may include:
            other benefits:
             – opportunity for businesses to benefit from larger markets
             – domestic producers learn better production techniques from foreign
                competitors
             – increased competition and greater efficiency in production
             – increased political cooperation

(b)   Evaluate the reasons why countries try to restrict free trade through
      protectionism.                                                             [15 marks]

      Answers may include:
       a definition of protectionism
       a definition of trade barriers
       methods of protectionism
       examples of protectionism
       reasons for protectionism:
        – infant industries
        – declining industries
        – domestic employment
        – assist domestic diversification
        – strategic factors
        – protect national culture
        – maintain product standards
        – raise revenue through tariffs
        – political pressure from interest and pressure groups
        – to prevent dumping
        – to correct balance of payments problems
       limitations of the reasons for protectionism:
        – infant industries may not become efficient
        – maintaining inefficient declining industries
        – retaliation from other countries causes unemployment in export
           industries
        – reasons for protectionism are often used as an excuse to protect the
           interests of domestic businesses
        – problems of protectionism for economic efficiency, higher prices and
           reduced consumer choice
       appropriate diagram(s) to illustrate trade barriers.

      Effective evaluation may be to:
       consider short-term versus long-term consequences
       examine the impact on different stakeholders
       discuss advantages and disadvantages
       prioritize the arguments.

      Examiners should be aware that candidates may take a different approach
      which if appropriate, should be rewarded.
