1.    (a)   What does Source D suggest about the economy of the Soviet Union
            during the Brezhnev era (1964–1982)?                             [3 marks]

             The approach to reform was piecemeal;
             Better sectors were held back by poorer sectors, lack of communication, poor roads,
              corruption and mismanagement;
             Consumers were not benefitted;
             The military began to produce consumer goods such as refrigerators and vacuum
              cleaners.

     Award [1 mark] for each relevant point up to a maximum of [3 marks].

     (b)    What is the message conveyed by Source E?                                    [2 marks]

             It shows Brezhnev’s desire to control the satellite states;
             The expression on Brezhnev’s face is fearful and reflects the struggle to keep these
              countries under his (Soviet) control while Yugoslavia is flourishing;
             The sickle refers to the implementation of Communism.

     Award [1 mark] for each relevant point up to a maximum of [2 marks].

Do not enter half marks or + and – but compensate between (a) and (b) if necessary for a final
mark out of [5 marks].

2.   Compare and contrast the views expressed in Sources A and C about the
     foreign policy of the Soviet Union during the Brezhnev era (1964–1982).           [6 marks]

     For “compare”
      Both sources refer to the Soviet need to ensure the survival of Communism;
      Both sources refer to the use of force;
      Sources A and C show that the USSR is not prepared to tolerate dissent in its sphere of
       influence;
      Both sources agree that other forces would be reluctant to fight against the USSR;
      Both sources refer to international treaties which justify Soviet intervention; Source A
       mentions the Warsaw Treaty and Source C the Afghan–Soviet Treaty of 1921.

     For “contrast”
      Source A refers to the opposition as being the imperialists, whereas the opposition in
       Source C is an Islamic regime;
      Source C mentions the need for a request to be made by the legitimate government before
       Soviet troops go in, whereas Source A does not;
      Only Source A makes reference to the lessons learnt from World War II and the Civil War;
      Source C is primarily concerned with Afghanistan while Source A refers to the Warsaw
       Treaty Organisation;
      Source A refers to the unity within the Warsaw Pact whereas Source C is concerned with
       the unity of Afghanistan.

     End-on description of both sources would be worth up to [3 marks] if the comparative
     element is only implicit, and [4 marks] with excellent explicit linkage. If both sources are
     used with a good running linkage of both comparison and contrast award a maximum of
     [4-5 marks]. For the maximum of [6 marks] expect a detailed, comprehensive, running,
     comparison and contrast. If there is only either comparison or contrast award a maximum of
     [4 marks].

3.   With reference to their origin and purpose, assess the value and limitations
     of Source A and Source B for historians studying the domestic and foreign
     problems of the Brezhnev era (1964–1982).                                          [6 marks]

     Source A
     Origin:        An official document quoting Leonid Brezhnev’s remarks made at a meeting of
                    top Czech Communist Party officials in Prague in December 1967.

     Purpose:       To remind the Czechs and others that unity is essential and that
                    non-compliance is costly. Also to act as a threat that disunity could lead to
                    military action.

     Value:         An official archive document showing how Brezhnev treated satellite states,
                    how he justified expenditure on defence and how Warsaw Pact countries were
                    reminded not to trust the West.

     Limitations:   Deliberately anti-imperialist and threatening in order to keep the satellites
                    states under under Soviet control.

     Source B
     Origin:        Britannica Online Encyclopedia as at 2009.

     Purpose:       To inform/educate.

     Value:         Well-researched; based on up-to-date archive information/sources; balanced

     Limitations:   As a general encyclopedia which is unlikely to contain as much detail as
                    a specialized source

     Do not expect all of the above. Ideally there will be a balance between the two sources, and
     each one can be marked out of [3 marks], but allow a [4/2 marks] split. If only one source is
     assessed, mark out of [4 marks]. For a maximum of [6 marks] candidates must refer to both
     origin and purpose, and value and limitations.

4.    Using the sources and your own knowledge, analyse the reasons for
      economic and political problems (or stagnation) in the Soviet Union during
      the Brezhnev era (1964–1982).                                                      [8 marks]

     Source material
     Source A:    This source states that too much money has been spent on defence Brezhnev
                  perceives the USSR to be under threats from the imperialists and demands
                  unity between the USSR and the satellites states.

     Source B:     This source gives the following reasons: the Brezhnev leadership had stopped
                   progress; cushioned by the sale of natural resources there was a (false) sense of
                   security; there was a lack of technological advances; poor quality products
                   restricted demand; there was low productivity; factories were inefficient;
                   numerous problems faced agriculture. Kosygin and Brezhnev had different
                   views and this created friction.

     Source C:     This source refers to a need to intervene in other states/nations in order to
                   preserve communism. The invasion was decided upon mistaken judgements,
                   i.e that the population would be friendly and that intervention would be brief

     Source D:     This source gives the following reasons: the approach to reform was piecemeal;
                   better sectors were held back by poorer ones; there was a lack of
                   communication, including poor roads; there was widespread corruption and
                   mismanagement: consumers were not benefitted

     Source E:     The source shows the political challenge it was for Brezhnev to maintain the
                   Soviet sphere of influence together. In contrast, it shows that Yugoslavia is
                   thriving, although not in the Soviet bloc.

     Own knowledge
     Own knowledge may include: more detailed information with regard to the Brezhnev policies,
     together with any examples of their implementation; more information regarding the
     piecemeal approach, such as logistics systems (distribution. the difficulty of transporting food
     across the USSR); further information regarding the problems facing agriculture; any relevant
     information regarding the impact of the war in Afghanistan on the USSR: the ways in which
     the rise of the international price of oil gave the USSR a false feeling of economic wellbeing:
     the use of state subsidies which had an huge economic cost for the State; the inefficiency of
     collective farms vs private plots; agricultural machinery being obsolete

     Do not expecting a balance between economic and political: just that they are both addressed.
     Do not expect all the above and accept other relevant material. If only source material or own
     knowledge is used the maximum mark that can be obtained is [5 marks]. For maximum
     [8 marks] expect argument, synthesis of source material and own knowledge, as well as
     references to the sources used.
