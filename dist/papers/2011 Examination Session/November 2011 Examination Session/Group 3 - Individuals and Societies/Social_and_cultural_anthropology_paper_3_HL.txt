Answer one question. The answer must refer to theoretical perspectives in anthropology and their application
to specific and clearly identified ethnographic illustrations. Each question is worth [20 marks].

1.    Why do some anthropologists adopt a diachronic perspective?


2.    Examine why a school of thought has emphasized one of the following:

      • idealist perspective
      • materialist perspective.


3.    How does one of the following shed light on a contemporary issue?

      • agency-centred perspective
      • particularistic perspective
      • structure-centred perspective


4.    Evaluate the contribution of either a cohesion-centred perspective or a conflict-centred perspective
      to the anthropological study of the social world.


5.    Evaluate the work of an anthropologist or school of thought which exemplifies a universalistic
      perspective.
