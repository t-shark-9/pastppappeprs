These sources and questions relate to domestic and foreign problems of the Brezhnev era: economic and
political stagnation; Afghanistan.

SOURCE A                Extract from the Communist Party of Czechoslovakia: remarks by Leonid Brezhnev
                        at a meeting of top officials in Prague, 9 December 1967. This is a national security
                        archive document.

The Soviet Union is forced to allocate vast resources to defence. Although the budget officially refers
to 22 %, much more than that actually must be spent … Soviet comrades are aware that concern for
the defence of the USSR and the entire socialist camp must at all times have pride of place. …
That is why we are continuously working to consolidate the Warsaw Treaty Organization and to ensure that
unity on this question will prevail [be accepted] among all its members. Experience from the time of the
civil war and the [Second] World War teaches us that we must have a powerful army. The reason that the
imperialists do not dare attack Czechoslovakia, Poland or the other socialist countries is that they are aware
of the immense military strength of the Soviet Union.



SOURCE B                Extract from Britannica Online Encyclopedia, 2009.

Under Brezhnev, Russia dominated the USSR. Three-quarters of the defence industries, the priority sector,
were in Russia, and the Russian republic accounted for about three-quarters of the Soviet gross national
product. The rapid expansion of the chemical, oil, and gas industries boosted exports so that Russia earned
most of the union’s hard-currency income. Ownership of consumer goods, such as refrigerators and cars,
became a realistic expectation for a growing part of the population. The availability of medical care, higher
education and decent accommodation reached levels unprecedented in the Soviet context. But the income
from the sale of Russia’s natural resources also allowed the Soviet regime to evade undertaking necessary
but potentially politically dangerous structural economic reforms.

Kosygin, the Soviet premier, recognized the seriousness of the problems more than Brezhnev and attempted
to implement reforms in 1965 and 1968, but the Brezhnev leadership stopped them. By the mid 1970s,
growth in the non-natural resource sector of the economy had slowed greatly. The Soviet economy suffered
from a lack of technological advances, poor-quality products unsatisfactory to both Soviet and foreign
consumers, low worker productivity and highly inefficient factories. At the same time, the agricultural
sector of the economy was in crisis.

SOURCE C                Extract from Modern Afghanistan: a history of struggle and survival by
                        Amin Saikal, Professor of Political Science at the Australian National University,
                        London, 2006.

The PDPA (People’s Democratic Party of Afghanistan) regime’s growing reliance on the USSR found
reflection in the Treaty of Friendship and Cooperation, signed by Brezhnev and Taraki [the leader of
the PDPA] on 5 December 1978.

This document was conceived to complement the Afghan–Soviet Treaty of 1921. A clause in Article 4
paved the way for the Soviets to intervene, militarily if necessary, “to guarantee security, independence and
territorial unity” of Afghanistan on request and after consultations with its legitimate government.

… this confronted the Soviet leadership essentially with two policy options: either to send troops into
Afghanistan to salvage the Communist regime, and therefore the mechanisms of Soviet control and
foundations of influence in the country; or to let an Islamic regime take over Afghanistan. It opted for
the former.

… There is a point of dispute among scholars as to whether the Soviet action amounted to an invasion
or intervention. Bodansky, an American scholar, argued that initially the direct involvement of Soviet
troops in Afghanistan was an escalation of Moscow’s previous policies rather than an invasion with the aim
of achieving direct and complete control over the country.

At the time the Soviets considered the invasion to be merely a further development of a predetermined policy.
They expected the Afghan army to go over to the offensive, while the insurgents [rebels] would be reluctant
to take on such a force. Soviet troops were supposed only to provide the initial stiffener [support] and were,
therefore, organized for a brief stay of a few months among a friendly and safe population which would
welcome the new leadership brought in.



SOURCE D                Extract from The Collins History of the World in the Twentieth Century by
                        J A S Grenville, Professor Emeritus of Modern History at the University of
                        Birmingham, UK, 1994.

In the Soviet Union the approach to economic reform was piecemeal [lacked any overview], and good results
were achieved in only a few sectors of the economy, which were held back from making faster progress by
the backward sectors, the lack of communication, poor roads, widespread corruption, mismanagement and
an overall lack of coordination with each ministry seeking to achieve the best results statistically in its own
sphere without regard to the whole. This “sectional” approach rarely brought any benefits to the consumer,
unless a particularly efficient section actually produced what consumers required. Sometimes this had
bizarre consequences. The Strategic Rocket Forces began to produce the best refrigerator, and the Ministry
of Aviation manufactured an excellent vacuum cleaner.
