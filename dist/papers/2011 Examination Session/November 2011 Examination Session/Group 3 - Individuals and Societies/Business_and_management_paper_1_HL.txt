Answer two questions from this section.

1.    (a)   Describe Andrew Grandin’s:

		          (i)    chain of command at Reach Out                                            [2 marks]

		          (ii)   span of control at Reach Out.                                            [2 marks]

      (b)   Using the case study, comment on two sources of income (current or potential)
            for Reach Out other than the therapist scheme.                                  [4 marks]

      (c)   Analyse the social and economic impacts of the actions of the non-profit
            organization Reach Out.                                                         [7 marks]


2.    (a)   Describe Laura Chan’s desired pricing strategy for Reach Out’s PECS cards.      [4 marks]

      (c)   Neil Johnson wanted to “outsource the therapist scheme management role to

                                                              SECTION C

Answer the compulsory question from this section.

5.     Neil Johnson and Laura Chan knew they had to resolve their differences. They asked a management
       consultant, Raj Gupta, for arbitration of their conflicting views over the future strategic direction of
       Reach Out. Raj had a meeting with both of them. Reluctantly, Laura accepted Raj’s recommendation
       that they pursue only Option 2, developing a family brand.

       After conducting a survey of the parents who use Reach Out’s therapists (Items 1.1 and 1.2),
       Raj further recommended organizing Reach Out into two distinct profit centres*:
       • Laura will run the “Service Centre”, training Andrew Grandin and working with the therapists
         and families. Laura’s target is to achieve qualitative improvements to the therapist scheme.
         This will be measured by feedback from both parents and therapists.
       • Neil will run the “Marketing Centre”, developing a family brand for Reach Out. Neil’s target is to
         raise $120 000 annually by selling merchandise with the Reach Out name and logo (Item 2).

       Laura was relieved that by implementing Option 2, Option 1 would be rejected and the pricing would
       remain the same. Also Reach Out would not have to rely on sponsorship (Option 3) from N-Pharma.

       However, she was still concerned that by allowing Neil to focus on developing marketing
       opportunities Reach Out would be changing its strategic direction away from the core business and
       from their mission to introduce subsidized PECS cards. Laura was also unsure about merchandising
       for a small business such as Reach Out (Item 3). Neil argued that subsidized PECS cards could only
       be introduced once Reach Out had the sufficient finance. He hoped that Option 2 would enable this.
       He recognized that branding of a charity would be difficult (Item 4), but he was convinced that if they
       could gain greater recognition then this was the way forward. He was also still concerned that Laura
       did not fully address his worries about Andrew.



* profit centres: in the case of Reach Out, these are centres that generate surplus revenue minus costs



                                                                               (This question continues on the following page)

(Question 5 continued)

      (a)   Identify one type of on-the-job training and one type of off-the-job training that
            Laura Chan could use with Andrew Grandin.                                             [2 marks]

      (b)   (i)    Using Item 2, calculate the quantity of merchandise that Reach Out must
                   sell in order to meet Neil Johnson’s target (show all your working).           [2 marks]

		          (ii)   Using the case study and Items 1.1 and 1.2, identify two areas of concern
                   with the therapist scheme and explain how Laura Chan can make
                   qualitative improvements to these concerns.                                    [5 marks]

      (c)   Analyse the value to Reach Out of organizing it into two distinct profit centres.     [9 marks]

      (d)   Using Lewin’s force field analysis and the information contained in the
            case study and Items 1– 4, evaluate Raj Gupta’s recommendation to pursue
            Option 2 and to reorganize Reach Out.                                                [12 marks]

Item 1.2: Survey results (extracts from parents interviews) summarized by Raj Gupta continued …

• “For me, the most difficult thing is to get in touch with someone at Reach Out – I had to rearrange our
  appointment and it took six phone calls before I finally managed to speak to someone.”
• “The therapists are great, young, enthusiastic and very caring but what I would really like is more
  educational materials that we can use at home with my son.”
• “The service is very cheap compared to other private clinics. I would like to have more sessions but
  this has been difficult to organize. Either the therapist is busy or no others seem to be available.”
• “I wish we had some T-shirts with the Reach Out logo on them to give to my friends.”
• “I first heard about Reach Out from my friend and it sounded like just what we needed. I kept phoning
  and e-mailing and at last after three weeks we managed to arrange our first session – and at the last
  minute the therapist e-mailed me to say they would have to rearrange – it was most inconvenient.”
• “Who is in charge at Reach Out? It is difficult having the same conversation with three different
  people who don’t seem to talk to each other!”

Item 3: Merchandising for small businesses

 According to the Centre for Business Excellence, 60 % of businesses that turn to merchandising to generate
 funds do not succeed in the long run. The successful businesses were already well-established ones with a
 strong brand identity operating in the mass-market*. Their sales tended to be impulse buying by visitors
 to a fixed attraction, for instance a museum or a theme park shop. Businesses that relied too heavily on
 merchandising for long-term financing usually experienced cash-flow fluctuation and uncertainty.


* mass-market: wide ranging demand from undifferentiated consumer segments


Item 4: Branding – is it worth it?

                       50 charities were asked – has branding increased your income?

                                                                                   Key:
                                                                                       Yes
                                                                                       No




        500 businesses from all sectors of the economy were asked – reasons for brand failure?

                                                                    Key:
