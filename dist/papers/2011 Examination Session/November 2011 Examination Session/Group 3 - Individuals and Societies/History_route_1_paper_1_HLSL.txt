These sources relate to the reign of Emperor Frederick II as King of Sicily (1198–1250).

SOURCE A                 Extract from The Sicilian Vespers, A History of the Mediterranean World in The
                         Later Thirteenth Century by Steven Runciman, 1958. Steven Runciman was an
                         eminent British historian who specialized in the Middle Ages.

Frederick II provided Sicily with a just and orderly government. He reformed its laws so as to stamp out
corruption in public and private affairs. He expelled the Genoese who had been exploiting the island
from their colony of Syracuse. But he was obliged to use force to establish his rule. He was not popular.
There was a terrible famine in 1212. The Saracens in the island, under the leadership of a Brigand soldier,
Moabit, rose in revolt; and ten years passed before the revolt was crushed and Moabit hanged at Palermo.
The whole Muslim population was then rounded up and transplanted to the mainland … The reformed
laws he issued were just, but they were imposed autocratically [by his will alone]. He encouraged trade
and industry. He founded new cities; he welcomed useful immigrants. He issued a stable coinage;
he lowered import duties. He saw that justice was in reach of all of his subjects, and he provided for their
education at the great new university which he founded at Naples. His rule provided the island with peace
and prosperity, in spite of the high taxation and drain on manpower.


SOURCE B                 Extract from A History of Islamic Sicily by Aziz Ahmad, 1975. Aziz Ahmad was a
                         professor at the University of Toronto, Canada, and an eminent scholar of Islam.

Frederick II’s domestic policy was firmly committed to ending all trace of the Muslim presence on
the island. The sending of exiles to Lucera in 1223–1225 had not meant the total banishment of all
Muslims from the Sicilian population. Until 1242 Muslims still formed a substantial percentage of the
population of Cefalu. There were still Muslim shepherds in the Val di Mazara. In 1243 the very small
Muslim remnant which had remained in Sicily rose up once again in a rebellion, rooted probably in
economic problems, and resisted the imperial forces for three years; but they were finally starved into
submission and deported back to join their co-religionists in Lucera. Islam and the Islamic presence in
Sicily came to an end. It is an irony that this end was brought about by an emperor who was a great
admirer of Islamic intellectual and material culture, and was in many ways involved in it personally.

SOURCE C                Extract from The Constitutions of Melfi (also known as the Liber Augustalis),
                        1231, a series of laws passed by Frederick II for Sicily.

We desire that butchers and fishmongers, who administer the necessities of life and from whose frauds
[dishonesty] loss can be inflicted, not merely on property but also on persons, should be trustworthy in their
merchandise and their marketing. They should not dare to sell breeding sows for pigs, or diseased flesh,
or what has been kept from one day to another, or anything corrupt or infected which might harm buyers,
unless they tell the buyers beforehand.
Also we order that fishmongers should keep trust by not selling corrupt fish and by not keeping it from one
day to another without announcing it beforehand, as we said above.
Candle sellers should also make the candles carefully and should not mix anything with them at the expense
of the buyers and should not include anything in them except cotton paper, or if they do, they should be sure
to inform the buyers at that time.
Moreover, we forbid tavern-keepers and wine sellers of any kind to dare to sell watered wine
as pure.
No one may work gold that contains less than 8 oz pure gold per pound. Likewise, no one may work silver
that is known to contain less than 11 oz per pound.


SOURCE D                Extract from The Chronicle of Salimbene by Salimbene, an Italian
                        Franciscan friar. He wrote the chronicle in the later thirteenth century. This extract
                        was translated into English and paraphrased by G C Coulton in 1906.

Frederick II knew how to read, write, and sing, to make songs and music. Moreover, he knew how to speak
with many and varied tongues, and, to be brief, if he had been rightly Catholic, and had loved God and
His Church, he would have had few emperors as his equal in the world. …
He made experiments on infants, asking foster mothers and nurses to suckle and bathe and wash the
children, but not to speak to them; for he wanted to know whether they could speak the Hebrew language
(which had been the first), or Greek, or Latin, or Arabic, or the tongue of their parents. But he laboured
in vain, for the children could not live without clapping of the hands, and gestures, and smiling faces.
Frederick cut off the thumb of a notary who had spelt his name Fredericus instead of Fridericus. …
Again, when he saw the Holy Land (which God had so often commended as a land flowing with milk and
honey and most excellent above all lands), it pleased him not, and he said that if the God of the Jews had
seen his land of Terra di Lavoro, Calabria, Sicily, and Apulia, then He would not so have commended the
land which He promised to the Jews.

SOURCE E                An “Augustalis” coin, minted in Messina in 1231.    One side reads
                        “CAESVG IMPROM” an abbreviation for “CAESAR AUGUSTUS IMPERATOR
                        ROMANORUM” (Caesar Augustus, Emperor of the Romans). The reverse side
                        reads “FRIDERICUS”. The coin is 20.5 carat gold.
