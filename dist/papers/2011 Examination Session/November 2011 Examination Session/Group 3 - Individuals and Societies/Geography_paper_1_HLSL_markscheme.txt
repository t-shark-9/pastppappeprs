                                 Core Theme – Patterns and Change

                                            SECTION A

1.   Populations in transition

     (a)   Describe the predicted population structure of this country in 2025.             [3 marks]

           The pyramid exhibits a broad base / youthful structure [1 mark]. Concave
           shape / rapidly tapering / chimney effect [1 mark]. A further [1 mark] for
           quantification or further observation e.g. a comment on the uneven sex ratio /
           identification of a high (youthful) dependency ratio.

           Do not credit explanatory answers.

     (b)   Distinguish between a population projection and population momentum.             [2 marks]

           Population projection is an estimate/prediction of a future population
           [1 mark].
           Population momentum refers to population growth/decline which continues
           despite fertility rates falling/increasing [1 mark].


     (c)   Explain the economic impacts of an ageing population on a named
           country.                                                                         [5 marks]

           A valid country should be chosen as an example [1 mark].

           Award [1+1 marks] for each valid economic impact, provided that it is
           developed by means of explanation or detail.

           Possible impacts could be: increased dependency ratio; potential shortage of
           labour; reduced revenue from taxation; reduced savings/investment; increased
           demand on state pensions; increased demand on services/welfare for the
           elderly; increased insurance premiums; lower economic growth; introduction
           of mandatory pension schemes; issues of younger family members having to
           care for the elderly.
                                                 –4–              N11/3/GEOGR/BP1/ENG/TZ0/XX/M


2.   Disparities in wealth and development

     (a)   With reference to the graph, describe the regional trends in the progress
           made towards meeting the 2015 target.                                             [3 marks]

           Developed regions have experienced a very slight decrease over the 15 year
           period [1 mark]. Developing regions have experienced an increase over the
           15 year period but are further from the targeted 100 % [1 mark]. Other valid
           trends should be credited. Some quantification is needed for the final
           [1 mark].

     (b)   Suggest two reasons why developing regions have made good progress
           towards meeting this MDG.                                          [2+2 marks]

           Two reasons should be identified and explained for [2+2 marks].

           For example:
           “Increased government investment in education [1 mark] increases the number
           of schools so the percentage enrolled in education has risen [1 mark].”

           Other reasons could be: more schools being built using international aid
           money; the work of civil society and governments in increasing the number of
           girls attending school which will impact on overall numbers; rapid urbanization
           is making schools more accessible to the children of former rural populations;
           debt relief allowing governments to spend more money on education.

     (c)   Explain how progress in education can help regions advance towards
           meeting one other MDG.                                                            [5 marks]

           Award [1 mark] for identifying a valid MDG (eradicate poverty and hunger;
           promote gender equality; reduce child mortality; improve maternal health;
           combat disease; environmental sustainability; develop a global partnership).

           The rest of the response should look at how progress towards increased
           primary education will help a country/region progress towards meeting that
           MDG. Award [1 mark] for each basic explanation, with additional [1 mark]
           for extension and/or exemplification. Possible [4×1 marks] or [2×2 marks].

           Possible explanations will be determined by the MDG chosen.

           For example:
           MDG reduced child mortality [1 mark].
           As female literacy rates increase through primary education, infant and child
           mortality rates tend to fall [2 marks].
           Literate women are more knowledgeable about primary health care e.g. Kerala
           India [2 marks].

3.   Patterns in environmental quality and sustainability

     (a)   State one physical factor and one human factor not shown on the diagram
           that contribute to a loss of biodiversity.                                           [2 marks]

           Award [1 mark] for each factor.

           Possible physical factors include: natural hazards such as floods, disease,
           droughts, volcanic eruptions, fires.
           Possible human factors include: deforestation, mining, expansion of
           agricultural areas, expansion of settlements, overexploitation of susceptible
           species leading to their extinction.

     (b)   Explain how any one of the factors given on the diagram contributes to a
           loss of biodiversity in tropical rainforests.                                        [4 marks]

           The explanation will depend on the factor chosen, but should provide details of
           precisely how the factor can contribute to a loss of biodiversity, as opposed to
           simply causing or leading to deforestation. Award up to [2 marks] for
           explanations of the factor e.g. causes of deforestation, reserving the final
           [2 marks] for comments which show a clear understanding of how this reduces
           biodiversity.

           No credit may be given for explanations of a second factor, or for explanation
           of any factor not shown on the diagram.

     (c)   Explain three reasons why biodiversity in tropical rainforests should be
           preserved.                                                               [3×2 marks]

           Award [1 mark] for each basic explanation, with additional [1 mark] for
           extension and or exemplification.

           The reason for preservation MUST be linked to biodiversity.

           Possible reasons include: the economic value of plant and animal species found
           therein; the importance of biodiversity in maintaining a healthy forest structure,
           with its implications for watershed protection; the importance of a healthy
           ground cover for soil protection; enhancing the value of rainforests for
           ecotourism;     conserving     global     genetic   diversity;    concepts      of
           stewardship/environmental ethics.
                                                  –6–              N11/3/GEOGR/BP1/ENG/TZ0/XX/M


4.   Patterns in resource consumption

     (a)   Identify and rank the top three renewable sources of energy shown on the
           graph from highest to lowest.                                                       [2 marks]

           The top three are: Biomass, Hydro and Geothermal, in that order [2 marks].
           Award [1 mark] if all three are identified, but not ranked correctly, or if any
           one of the three are incorrectly identified. No credit may be given if only one
           of the three is correct.

     (b)   Suggest two reasons why some areas of the world are unlikely to depend
           entirely on renewable energy sources.                                  [2×2 marks]

           Award [1 mark] for each basic reason, with additional [1 mark] for extension
           and/or exemplification.

           Answers can suggest reasons with validity at any scale: local, regional or
           national.    Possible reasons include: abundant reserves of fossil fuels;
           insufficient capital to develop alternative energies; conscious decision to rely
           on nuclear power; need for portable, emergency sources of power; lack of
           sufficient opportunities for renewable energy; lack of political will; lack of
           local conditions for any renewable energy.


     (c)   Analyse how the global pattern of oil production has changed in recent
           decades.                                                                            [5 marks]

           Answers may focus on spatial and/or temporal changes.

           Answers should refer to sub-global regions in terms of how production is
           changing over time, and/or how it is changing as a proportion of the world
           total. Many responses will focus on the “peak oil” scenario. There should be
           some comment on how demand and price is driving the exploitation of oil in
           remote and/or previously uneconomic sources e.g. further off shore or tar sands
           in Alberta, Canada. Award up to [2 marks] for valid descriptions of changes
           [2 marks] for related analysis with the final [1 mark] being reserved for either.
                                                    –7–              N11/3/GEOGR/BP1/ENG/TZ0/XX/M


                                               SECTION B

5.   Discuss the ways in which the consumption of one or more resources can be
     reduced.                                                                                     [15 marks]

     The main ways in which the consumption of resources can be reduced are by
     reducing demand (by changing pricing, access or availability), by changes in habits
     of recycling, reuse (government policy, civil society demand, education, fiscal
     incentives, legislation, change in societal values), by resource substitution,
     and conservation. The relative importance of these will depend on the resource
     (and location/s) discussed.

     Responses that arrive at a clear conclusion, after a sound discussion with a specific
     resource/resources referred to, are likely to be awarded band E or above.

     Marks should be allocated according to the markbands.


6.   “It is impossible to eliminate disparities in wealth and development.” Discuss
     this statement.                                                                              [15 marks]

     This question may be considered from any scale: global, regional or national. It is
     possible to gain full marks looking at a single scale (it is also possible to score highly
     with a mainly social rather than spatial analysis).

     Candidates are expected to demonstrate a clear understanding of the three key
     terms – disparities, wealth and development – in their answers, though they may
     choose to take as wide a view as they like of such concepts by including, for
     example, non-economic wealth, or social rather than economic development.

     It is expected that answers will include a variety of different strategies designed to
     help reduce disparities, both in favour of, and against, the statement and will offer
     substantiation by means of detail or examples for the ideas presented.

     Responses that arrive at a clear conclusion either agreeing or disagreeing with the
     statement, after a sound discussion including both sides of the issues, are likely to be
     awarded band E or above.

     Marks should be allocated according to the markbands.
                                                –8–              N11/3/GEOGR/BP1/ENG/TZ0/XX/M



7.   Examine the view that gender inequalities are a major obstacle to development.         [15 marks]

     There are many possible approaches to this question.

     Responses could explain what development is and successfully link the concept to
     increased gender equality.

     Responses are likely to identify and discuss the relative importance of all the MDGs
     that in some way relate to gender empowerment (Goals 1, 3, and 5 especially).

     The answer should examine either how not addressing gender issues will hinder
     development or explain how addressing them will help nations and communities
     develop. Allow for broad interpretations of development. Candidates could also
     identify other factors (other than gender inequality) which are also obstacles to
     development – this would be a valid approach as long as gender inequality is
     examined and their reasoning is justified.

     Responses that arrive at a clear conclusion either agreeing or disagreeing with the
     viewpoint, after a sound discussion, are likely to be awarded band E or above.

     Marks should be allocated according to the markbands.
