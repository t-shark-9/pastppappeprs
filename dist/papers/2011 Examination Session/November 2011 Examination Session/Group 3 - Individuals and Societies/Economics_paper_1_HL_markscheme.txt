1.   (a)   Explain the different objectives that a firm in an oligopolistic market
           structure might try to achieve.                                         [10 marks]

           Answers should include:
           • a definition of an oligopolistic market structure
           • an explanation of the characteristics of an oligopolistic market structure
           • an explanation of profit maximization
           • additional objectives other than profit maximization.

           Answers may include:
           • an explanation of alternative objectives such as:
             – sales revenue maximization
             – sales volume maximization
             – the goals of other stakeholders in the organization such as managers,
                 workers and trade unions
             – to respond to pressure groups, e.g. environmental concerns
             – to comply with legal directives and policies of government
             – to collude
             – to maintain price stability
           • an explanation of collusion: formal (e.g. cartel formation) and/or informal
             (e.g. price leadership)
           • illustrating objectives through examples of imperfect competition
           • a diagram to illustrate profit or sales revenue maximization.

           Examiners should be aware that candidates may take a different approach which
           if appropriate, should be rewarded.

(b)   Evaluate the view that an oligopolistic market is an inefficient market
      structure.                                                              [15 marks]

      Answers may include:
      • a definition of oligopolistic market structure
      • a definition of allocative efficiency
      • a definition of productive efficiency
      • an explanation of oligopolistic market structure
      • an explanation of collusive and non-collusive oligopoly
      • examples of oligopolistic markets
      • advantages of oligopoly:
        – economies of scale
        – supernormal (abnormal) profits allow research and development to be
           carried out
        – price stability
        – benefits of non-price competition, e.g. quality of product, wide
           distribution
        – competition in oligopoly gives it an efficiency advantage over monopoly
      • disadvantages of oligopoly:
        – fails to achieve productive efficiency
        – fails to achieve allocative efficiency
        – higher prices and lower output to consumers
        – barriers to entry reduce competition
        – collusive behaviour
        – price rigidity reduces the effectiveness of the price mechanism
      • a diagram to show that efficiency is not achieved.

      Effective evaluation may be to:
      • consider short-term versus long-term consequences
      • examine the impact on different stakeholders
      • discuss advantages and disadvantages
      • prioritize the arguments.

      Examiners should be aware that candidates may take a different approach which
      if appropriate, should be rewarded.
