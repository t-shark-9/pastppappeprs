Foreword

The ITGS case study, Developing and Running an Online Business, is the stimulus material for the research
investigation required for May and November 2011 higher level paper 3.  All of the work related to the
case study should reflect the integrated approach explained on page 8 of the ITGS guide.

Candidates should consider Developing and Running an Online Business with respect to:
• web content management systems (Web CMSs) and providers
• businesses that sell online
• companies that provide services for businesses that sell online
• web sites that sell similar products online.

Candidates are expected to research real-life situations similar to Developing and Running an Online Business
and relate their findings to first-hand experiences wherever possible.   Information should be collected
through secondary research and primary investigations, such as field trips, guest speakers,
personal interviews, e-mail correspondence, hands-on activities and other appropriate methods.

Candidates are expected to research the vocabulary and concepts that are related to the IT technologies
in the case study.

Responses to examination questions must reflect the synthesis of knowledge and experiences that
the candidates have gained from their investigations.   In some instances, additional information may
be provided in examination questions to allow candidates to generate new ideas.

     Overview

     Carmen Machado owns a business, Foto Creativa, specializing in providing memorabilia
     for families.  She is based in Santander, northern Spain, and runs the business from a shop in the
     centre of the city.

     Carmen studied in England for several years and was awarded a university degree
 5   in Creative Digital Media.   When she returned to Spain she set up a simple web site to help
     advertise her business.  Over the three years that the business has operated it has increased its range
     of services to include the following:
     • digitizing photos, modifying and improving images/photos from customers
     • editing video, converting video and home movies to digital media
10   • creating and selling digital photo albums
     • “stitching” photos together to form one image
     • creating multimedia presentations combining text, images, videos, animation and other
        digital elements
     • selling posters, mugs, t-shirts and other products with customer images and photographs.

15   Carmen has found that as her business has grown, she has had less time to provide a good service
     to all of her customers.




                                                                                                Turn over
                                             –4–          M&N11/3/ITGSX/HP3/ENG/TZ0/XX/CS

     Current IT systems

     Carmen’s shop, Foto Creativa, has the following IT resources:
     • two computers, each with a large, high resolution monitor suitable for professional
       photography and video
20   • a scanner
     • a photo-quality printer
     • a “high-end” digital camera and digital video camera
     • a laptop suitable for demonstrating and displaying work to customers
     • professional software for photography and video work
25   • desktop publishing software
     • web development software
     • a small network with a server, including a RAID backup system
     • broadband Internet access
     • a spreadsheet for keeping all financial and customer records.

30   Carmen is currently using almost all of the free 50 MB web space provided by her
     Internet service provider (ISP).  This only allows her to have HTML pages, with images and text
     in English and Spanish.

     She realizes that to improve her web site, which will include completely redesigning it,
     she is going to need to make major decisions.

35   Carmen carried out some initial research into developing the improved web site herself,
     but soon realized that researching, designing, building and testing, hosting and marketing
     an online business would take more time than she could afford.  Also, she knew she did not
     have the technical knowledge to do this and therefore sought the advice of Sergio Martinez,
     an e-commerce consultant.


     Web content management system (Web CMS) and applications

40   To run an e-commerce business successfully, Carmen needs a web content management system
     (Web CMS) to:
     • organize and present information about her products and services through a consistent
       user interface
     • provide e-marketing
45   • interface data from the central database
     • provide secure access to customers to view and upload files
     • provide an e-commerce facility (with a shopping cart service).
                                              –5–          M&N11/3/ITGSX/HP3/ENG/TZ0/XX/CS

     However, there are technical requirements that Carmen must meet whether she chooses
     a free or commercial Web CMS.  She will need:
50   • a domain name
     • a hosting account – one of the more popular configurations includes:
         - MySQL database management system (DBMS)
         - PHP / other scripting language
         - Linux operating system
55       - Apache web server
     • a shopping cart system – purchased or open source
     • a payment merchant account
     • SSL-encrypted web site pages.


     User interface

     Successful businesses use a standard appearance and structure for their web sites and documents.
60   Carmen must ensure that all the web pages have a consistent appearance.   She is considering
     whether to use commercial or open source software to develop the web site.


     E-marketing

     Carmen wishes to expand the marketing of her products and services over the Internet.  
     She is considering implementing some of the following:
     • an opt-in e-newsletter
65   • ad banners
     • a blog on her web site
     • RSS feeds
     • bulk e-mails
     • site traffic analysis / web-counters
70   • multimedia content.

     Also search engine optimization can increase the likelihood of Carmen generating more business.  
     There are many ways to enable her company to appear higher up on a search result list.  
     Some methods are paid for and others will require knowledge of how search engines work.


     Database and applications

     Underpinning any e-business there is always a database.   In this case, it holds details
75   of customers, products and orders.  As with any other database, it is best managed with a DBMS,
     which provides applications with an interface to the underlying data.  A DBMS will also prevent
     unintentional data corruption.   MySQL is a widely used DBMS that can be accessed by many
     programming languages such as PHP.   Many shopping cart services and other web-based
     applications are written in PHP interfacing with MySQL.




                                                                                          Turn over
                                                 –6–           M&N11/3/ITGSX/HP3/ENG/TZ0/XX/CS

      Providing security

 80   In addition to the security measures required for running an e-commerce web site with
      a shopping cart, it is necessary to provide secure methods for ensuring the protection of customer
      data and the files that they upload for processing by Foto Creativa.

      Consideration has to be given to the installation of anti-virus and anti-spyware software, in addition
      to firewall and Internet security tools to protect the web site and its underlying data.


      E-commerce with shopping cart

 85   In order to sell products or services from a web site, Carmen will need to set up a shopping cart.  
      This can be implemented through a third party web site or run from her own web site.

      Hosting your own shopping cart is generally seen as a much more affordable solution and involves
      a number of challenges.  However, running a shopping cart through a third party web site will also
      have its share of challenges.


      Challenges faced

 90   Carmen has decided that she needs further information on how to develop the business
      in the future.   Sergio identified issues that would require further investigation before any final
      decision could be made about how to develop the business further:
      • how customers and potential customers can be informed of new products and offers through the
         web site or other e-marketing techniques
 95   • different project management techniques to develop the new web site
      • how a range of multimedia features can be effectively integrated on the web site
      • how products are purchased through the use of an appropriate shopping cart service
      • a range of open source and commercial Web CMSs
      • methods of payment for goods (and delivery) purchased using the shopping cart,
100      such as PayPal, credit card payments and direct deposit to account
      • appropriate privacy and other policies for the web site
      • search engine optimization so that the web site appears on the first page of results
      • the role of web site traffic analysis
      • techniques that can be used to secure a web site
105   • policies that could lead to a secure web site
      • the relationships between the data, the DBMS and applications
      • the features offered by a range of web-hosting services.
