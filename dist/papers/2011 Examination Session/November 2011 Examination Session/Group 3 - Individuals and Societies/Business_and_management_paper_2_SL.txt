                                                             SECTION A

Answer one question from this section.

1.    Fang Kwong and XIAN Technology

      Fang Kwong lives in a village in the mountains of western China. A major problem for the residents
      of that region is that they must transport large amounts of firewood for their kitchen ovens. Fang was
      told of a solution by XIAN Technology, which created a new type of kitchen oven that burns straw and
      other farm waste products instead of firewood.

      Both XIAN Technology and the Chinese government wish to help small entrepreneurs* set up
      franchises to provide distribution channels for these new kitchen ovens. Fang is very keen to
      take advantage of this opportunity. She has identified a small local warehouse with sufficient
      storage space. In order to receive a US$10 000 small-business loan from the government at the start
      of September 2012, she must complete a cash-flow forecast. She has estimated the following figures
      for the first six months of operation, to begin in September 2012:

      (Assume one month is 30 days)
       Sales                                      20 kitchen ovens per month at US$50 for the first
                                                  three months. From the fourth month Fang forecasts
                                                  an increase in sales of two kitchen ovens each month.
       Monthly rent                               US$400
       Monthly salary                             US$200
       Monthly supplies (e.g. stationery)         US$50
       Monthly interest on government loan to set US$42
       up business
       Overhead costs                             US$200, payable every other month, starting in
                                                  October 2012.
       Fang’s purchases from XIAN Technology      • First month purchase of 60 kitchen ovens at
                                                     US$25 each and payable at the end of the second
                                                     month.
                                                  • From the second month purchase of 20 kitchen
                                                     ovens per month, at US$25 each and payable at
                                                     the end of the following month.

      Fang will need to purchase a lorry to deliver the XIAN Technology kitchen ovens to customers who
      live in remote villages. She will charge a delivery fee, but it will be insufficient to cover the cost of
      the purchase. Fang will need an additional source of finance for the lorry.



      * entrepreneur: a person who starts up and runs a new business, which typically requires creative thinking
            on the part of the entrepreneur and considerable risk in the business environment (because it is a new
            venture, often a new idea)




                                                                             (This question continues on the following page)

(Question 1 continued)

      As a franchisee, she will be the only distributor of these new kitchen ovens in a 500 square kilometre
      area. However, Fang must submit financial accounts to XIAN Technology every three months.
      Despite the agreement, Fang fears that other distributors will soon start supplying similar products,
      resulting in increased competition and lower gross profit margins.


      (a)   (i)    Identify two appropriate sources of finance for Fang to purchase a lorry.     [2 marks]

		          (ii)   Define the term overhead costs.                                               [2 marks]

            Fang’s business.                                                                     [6 marks]

      (c)   Explain XIAN Technology’s requirement that Fang present them with financial
            accounts every three months.                                                         [5 marks]

      (d)   Analyse the impact on Fang’s business if new competition leads to a decrease in
            her gross profit margin.                                                             [5 marks]

2.    Ashrafuzzman Manufacturing (AM)

      Aaliyah Ashrafuzzman owns Ashrafuzzman Manufacturing (AM), which produces wheelchairs in
      an industrial park in Dhaka, Bangladesh. One-third of the company’s revenue comes from sales in
      Bangladesh, and two-thirds of its revenue comes from sales in two southern European countries,
      where national medical insurance pays for wheelchairs for patients. In these southern European
      countries, AM is on the “approved” list of manufacturers.

      Because AM’s factory is small and the complexities of producing and marketing two or
      more models of wheelchairs would be significant, the company produces only one model of
      wheelchair. The company uses a competition-based pricing strategy in the two markets in which
      it sells. Because of differences in the two markets, an AM wheelchair is considered high-priced and
      high-quality in Bangladesh and low-priced and low-quality in Europe.

      In 2010, fixed costs at the company were US$1 500 000. In its current facility, AM can produce no
      more than 44 000 wheelchairs per year.

      Recently, the European Union (EU) altered regulations regarding the minimum quality standards for
      wheelchairs paid for by national medical insurance. To meet the new standards, AM must:
      • use higher quality materials costing 20 % more per wheelchair
      • hire four quality experts on a salary of US$22 000 per year each
      • lease new equipment at US$132 000 per year.

      With the higher quality, AM can increase the sales price of its wheelchairs in Europe from US$200 to
      US$212. In Bangladesh the sales price will remain the same.

      Aaliyah has two growth options:

      Option 1 To improve the quality of all AM’s wheelchairs (whether for sale in Europe or elsewhere),
               accept the lower profitability, and continue to sell in Europe.

      or

      Option 2 Not to improve the quality of the wheelchairs, stop selling in Europe, and enter the
               market in India, where AM can sell wheelchairs for US$125.



                                                          (This question continues on the following page)

      (a)   (i)    Define the term competition-based pricing.                                  [2 marks]

		          (ii)   Identify two increases in fixed costs that AM would incur to meet the new
                   EU quality standards.                                                       [2 marks]

      (b)   Calculate for 2010 (show all your working):

		          (ii)   AM’s overall net profit for both markets.                                   [3 marks]

      (c)   Using an appropriate layout, prepare a report showing the increase in costs and
            the impacts on profitability for AM if Aaliyah decides to proceed with Option 1.   [7 marks]

      (d)   Analyse the two growth options facing AM by applying the Ansoff matrix.            [5 marks]

Answer two questions from this section.

3.    Bauli’s panettone1

                                    The large Italian company Bauli produces a variety of baked products
                                    such as croissants and biscuits, but it is most famous for its panettone,
                                    a specialty at Christmas. The original producers of panettoni were
                                    small luxury bakeries, which could bake a few expensive panettoni
                                    relatively easily. Michele Bauli claims that the quality of his product is
                                    what explains the company’s success: “High investment in research and
                                    technology allows us to guarantee a uniform quality that small luxury
                                    bakeries find hard to achieve”. It could be argued, however, that Bauli’s
                                    success is mainly based on its low price. A panettone produced by a
      luxury bakery typically costs €30. A Bauli panettone costs €8.

      Bauli produces on an industrial scale. Baking 12 million panettoni per year for sales across Italy
      and in European and American markets is a major challenge of workforce planning. Bauli meets
      the seasonal demand2 for panettoni by hiring 1200 temporary workers for four months each year
      (from August to November). The company has also made significant technological innovations.
      According to Michele, “Attention to ingredients and the use of new technologies in production
      give the panettone a shelf-life of five months”. Bauli has also developed a broader product mix,
      including the Colombo cake, which is popular at a different time of the year. The broader product mix
      reduces the need for temporary workers.

      Bauli has not relied only on internal growth. In 2009, the company purchased two subsidiaries of
      the multinational food group Nestlé. As both subsidiaries produce panettoni, these acquisitions have
      increased Bauli’s market share. They will also help Bauli meet the growing demand for panettoni in
      American markets.

4.    Liturgi

      Liturgi is an agricultural partnership that owns six farms located in Jaen in the south of Spain.
      The company produces good-quality olive oil, which is sold directly to consumers. The olive oil
      is distributed in 1 litre plastic bottles and larger orders are delivered in 5 litre containers. Sale of
      the olive oil is currently only in Spain. Most sales occur at the partnership’s farm shop, with the
      remaining sales via telephone and Internet orders. Current promotion is mainly by “word of mouth”
      and a web page.

      In addition to the current production of good-quality olive oil, some partners want to produce a
      second type of olive oil: a high-quality, organic olive oil produced in small batches. This would
      have a retail price of €15 per litre with a gross profit margin of 60 % compared to €3 per litre for the
      current olive oil with a gross profit margin of 40 %. However, two farm managers think that their
      olive trees are not of the quality required to produce the organic olive oil.

      The partners realize that finding a new market for this organic olive oil will involve significant
      changes to current marketing practices and strategies, including new forms of distribution.
      The new organic olive oil will be targeted at expensive restaurants throughout Europe. Liturgi will
      need to hire a salesperson, who will be paid a salary plus commission.


      (a)   Define the term partnership.                                                           [2 marks]

      (b)   (i)    Explain why quality control may become more important for Liturgi.              [4 marks]

		          (ii)   Calculate the gross profit per litre for the two types of olive oil.            [2 marks]

      (c)   Using two elements of the marketing mix other than place, analyse Liturgi’s
            challenge to produce the new organic olive oil.                                        [5 marks]

      (d)   Discuss the effectiveness of the two types of distribution channels for Liturgi.       [7 marks]

5.    Four-day working week in Utah

      In 2008, in an effort to reduce costs, the government of the state of Utah in the United States (US)
      considered adopting several contemporary workforce practices. Some of these, however, seemed
      impractical for offices in the public sector. After further investigation, the government realized that
      energy costs were among the fastest rising of its costs. As a result, in 2009 the government imposed
      a four-day working week for most state employees; most public sector offices are now closed
      on Fridays. Monday to Thursday, offices are open for 10 hours.

      A social and environmental audit revealed the following advantages as a result of the shorter
      working week:
      • There is a 13 % reduction in energy use in public sector buildings; Utah’s greenhouse gas emissions
        are reduced.
      • With three-day weekends, employees have reported improved quality of life.
      • Commuting costs for employees are reduced; there is less traffic congestion.
      • Longer working days by state employees mean that their offices are more accessible to the public
        in the evening (Monday to Thursday).

      However, the audit also revealed the following disadvantages:
      • The working day is longer (10 hours versus 8 hours per day). As a consequence, some employees
        with young children have found it difficult to organize child care.
      • The Friday closures have inconvenienced some members of the public.

      After 12 months, Utah’s experience with the four-day working week is considered a success. 82 % of
      state employees prefer the new schedule. In experiments with the four-day working week in other
      American states, approval rates have not been as high as in Utah. Some experts claim that the high
      approval rate of the new working week is because employees like change to their routine, rather than
      actually preferring the new working week itself.

      Public sector and private sector managers from around the world have contacted Utah officials to
      learn more about their new working week. Some managers in the private sector question whether the
      four-day working week would be appropriate for their companies.
                                 [Source: adapted from http://www.time.com/, 7 September 2009]


      (a)   Identify two examples of contemporary changes in work patterns and practices
            other than the adoption of the four-day working week.                                   [2 marks]

      (b)   (i)    Explain one impact that the four-day working week in the public sector
                   may have on the private sector in Utah.                                          [2 marks]

		          (ii)   Distinguish between the public sector and the private sector.                    [4 marks]

      (c)   Analyse the value of the social and environmental audit to two different
            stakeholders of the government of the state of Utah.                                    [5 marks]

      (d)   Discuss two possible areas of conflict between two stakeholders when the
            government of the state of Utah imposed a four-day working week for most
            state employees.                                                                        [7 marks]
