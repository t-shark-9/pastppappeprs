             SOME HEALTH MYTHS EXPOSED
                                                                  James Bowler, Health Editor

       “Times have changed!” Professor Hillman of the University of Edinburgh declared.
       “Take the belief that, to reduce back pain, you need a hard mattress. This is absolutely
       untrue! Researchers in Spain found that medium-firm mattresses reduced not only
       back pain but also the need for pain-killing drugs.”

 5     Professor Hillman patted his stomach – there’s not much fat there. “Eating more
       than necessary, eating more than three meals a day, makes people fat. Swedish
       research found that obese women ate not only at bedtime, but also too much during
       the day.”

       “Existing studies suggest that adequate fluid intake is usually met through typical
10     daily consumption of juice, milk and even caffeinated drinks. There is no reason to
       drink ten glasses of water a day!”

       Another fairy tale that just isn’t true, Professor Hillman informed us, is that hair and
       nails continue to grow after death. “This is useful for ghost stories and suchlike,
       but the scientific fact is that hair and nails require a complex hormonal mechanism
15     to grow and this mechanism simply cannot happen after death.”

       Lastly, Professor Hillman destroyed the belief that carrots, as your grandmothers
       assured you, help you see in the dark. “What you need is Vitamin A,” he explained,
       “and this is also found in many other vegetables. In fact, what older people need to
       eat to maintain their sight are bright yellow or green-coloured vegetables.”

20     We now know a lot more than the old myths, but please don’t tell your grannies!

                      SAY “SORRY” THE RIGHT WAY
                     AND GIVE THE LEFT EAR A MISS!
            Researchers have found the secret of getting your regret across is to direct it
            quietly at someone’s right ear.

            To study what happens when we become angry, the researchers
            made 30 young men work themselves up into a rage by reading
  5         a folder of aggressive statements. As they became angrier,
            their heart rate and blood pressure went up. University of
            Valencia researchers carried out hearing tests on both left and
            right ears before and after giving the men the “anger” folders.

            The right ear’s ability to pick up sounds increased significantly when the men
10          were angry but there was no change in the left ear, the researchers found.
            It is thought this is because the left side of the brain processes sounds that
            come in through the right ear. If anger activates it, noise from the right, but
            not the left, will be heard more clearly.

            Investigations have shown that if you want to persuade someone to do something,
15          you should also speak into their right ear. When Italian researchers asked almost
            200 night-clubbers for a cigarette, they found the smokers were almost twice as
            likely to comply when the request was directed to their right ear.

            In a British study, sales teams used one of three headsets – left, right, both ears – for
            a day’s selling of insurance by telephone. Those who wore the headset on their
20          left ear outsold the others. One theory for this suggests that sales staff who use
            their right ear may be more likely to use logic for selling, while those who use the
            left may have a more intuitive and responsive relationship with clients.

            It’s not just [ – X – ] that are affected by the brain’s criss-cross [ – 12 – ] of
            controlling the body. Studies show that the right foot is more [ – 13 – ] to tickling
25          than the left, the left cheek the more [ – 14 – ] one to kiss and the left side is
            the favoured [ – 15 – ] for holding babies.

DOES WINNING A HUGE AMOUNT OF MONEY
          MAKE YOU HAPPY?
        [–X–]

Call it jealousy, but there’s no doubt that many of us have a problem with what we consider to be
unearned wealth. Lottery wins seem to provoke heated discussion at the office and in the back of taxis.
Do people enjoy their winnings? Or does their good fortune have the capacity to make them miserable,
leaving them directionless in luxury? There have certainly been many winners who had their lives turned
upside down by a big win. Relationships can break down under the strain and friendships can come
under pressure. The newspapers love nothing more than winners who have wasted away all their money.

       [ – 20 – ]

From a mental well-being viewpoint, there are clearly dangers.
Researcher Charles Master says a big win can upset people in
much the same way as any other major, life-changing event.
“It really can be disruptive. The first thing is the shock, not
expecting this sudden win. It is the speed and rate of change
that tends to cause people trouble.”

  Research findings

The results of Master’s study of lottery winners are clear. “There is no doubt there is a very strong initial
delight, then the evidence suggests people don’t enjoy the money for the first year or two.”

       [ – 21 – ]

It’s not clear why there is this gap before lottery winners start to really enjoy themselves. “We have
proposed that, after the joy wears off, in their subconscious they realise they don’t deserve the money and
it takes a while for this non-deservedness to wear off,” says Master.

       [ – 22 – ]

However, there are some bad effects of a win, notably in some winners’ health. “They start to smoke
more and drink more,” he says. “We think that may be bad for their health and hold back their happiness
for a while.”

       [ – 23 – ]

Maggie Grantham, a social psychologist, has some advice for winners of large amounts on a lottery:
“Try and get a holiday away from everything so you can try and come to terms with what’s happened,”
she says. “Friends and family will have their own ideas of what you should be doing. Don’t rush into
anything. True friends are always there for you.”

                                                                     http://news.bbc.co.uk (February 2010)

            TIMETABLE FOR CHANGE
“Imagine a school where a design technology lesson lasts a week, not 50 minutes,
and when the bell rings they go somewhere else.” Gareth Mills, Head of Programme
Innovation at the Ministry of Education, has been asking schools to think about the way the
school day is structured. Gareth points out that traditionally time is allocated in rigid blocks
even though in the case of musical skills, the teaching might only require a 10-minute input
whereas something like a drama production might require days.

Janet Huscroft illustrates that point. Modern Primary School in Goole, where she is
Headmistress, does not have a traditional timetable. Janet believes that a timetable is
restrictive when teachers are working creatively. The teachers set out clearly what skills should
be taught in each year and ensure that they reach their goals. It seems to Janet and her staff
a more natural way of working – if a topic is going well, then the teacher has the freedom to
develop that idea at length. Janet sees the children “motivated, challenged, excited and most
are able to work independently”.

Deputy Head Jonathan Boyle outlines the timetable in use. “The day is divided into
three sections: morning, afternoon and after school. The morning and afternoon programmes
last for approximately three hours. The advantages for a teacher are that they are with
students for a period of time that allows them to monitor progress. The advantage for a
student is that they can engage in a range of activities in that time period – they don’t just
work on one topic for three hours. Students who feel the need for more individual attention
do not receive it, though.”
