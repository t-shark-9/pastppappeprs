   NEW YORK’S OTHER CHINATOWN:
   FLUSHING, QUEENS
                  [–X–]

     For many visitors to New York, a trip to Chinatown means heading to Lower Manhattan.
     But the city has another Chinatown in Flushing, Queens, not as well-known, but just as
     vibrant. It’s a fun place to spend a day exploring, shopping and, above all, eating.

            Things to do and see

     “If you come on a weekend, there’s barely space to walk,” said Shawn Choi, external
     affairs associate at Flushing Town Hall, a cultural centre that sponsors performances,
     exhibits and educational programs. Events at Flushing Town Hall in honor of Lunar
     New Year include “Tigers in the House”, an exhibit of tiger-inspired arts and crafts.

                 [ – 18 – ]

     Flushing’s largest ethnic group is Chinese, with Koreans next. The first Asian-American
     elected to citywide office, John Liu, grew up in Flushing after coming from Taiwan as
     a child with his family. Liu represented the neighborhood as a city councilman before
     winning a race for city accountant in November.

                 [ – 19 – ]

     Flushing’s contemporary diversity is an appropriate legacy for a neighborhood that
     has been preaching tolerance for more than 350 years. In 1657, a group of residents
     sent a letter called the Flushing Remonstrance to Peter Stuyvesant, the governor of
     what was then the Dutch colony of New Netherlands. The letter demanded freedom
     of religion, and today there are signs welcoming visitors in many languages marking the
     Flushing Freedom Mile. The trail includes historic landmarks like the Bowne House
     where, in 1662, John Bowne invited Quakers to meet in defiance of an order from
     Stuyvesant.

               [ – 20 – ]

     As you stroll Flushing’s busy streets, the mix of East and West
     is striking. The Sheraton LaGuardia East Hotel advertizes
     its “distinctly Asian flair” at 135-20 39th Avenue, where a
     pair of lion statues guards the hotel entrance. Around the
     corner, St George’s Church, on Main Street between 38th and
     39th avenues, offers services in English, Chinese and Spanish.
     Low-flying planes headed to LaGuardia Airport create a
     startling image as they roar over the spire of the church’s
     mid-nineteenth century stone building.

       Hair care for every pocket

     Carpenter Tan is part of a global chain of 853 stores, based in mainland China, that sells
     combs and brushes. Manager David Ho says different types of hair require different
     types of combs; the combs range from $6 to $200, with the most expensive items
     handmade from sandalwood and mother-of-pearl. Traditionally, suitors offered the
     most elaborate combs to prospective brides. “If the lady accepts, that means yes,”
     said Ho.

            Traditional food

     In the food court of Flushing Mall, wide, hand-pulled noodles are made on the premises
     at Xi’an Famous Foods. Celebrity chef Anthony Bourdain featured Xi’an on his show
     for good reason: the noodle dishes are delicious. Just be forewarned: order something
     a “little spicy” here and it may well be the hottest dish you’ve ever eaten. A mall
     ice cream vendor can cool your taste buds with flavors like mango and green tea.

                         THE LECTURE
       The university clock strikes eleven, its chimes overlapping with the chimes of other clocks,
        near and far. All over Rummidge and its environs, people are at work – or not, as the case
        may be.

       Robyn Penrose is making her way to Lecture Room A, along corridors and down staircases
5x      thronged with students changing classes. They part before her, like waves before the bow of
        a stately ship. She smiles at those she recognizes. Some fall in behind her, and follow her to
        the lecture theatre, so that she appears to be leading a little procession, a female Pied Piper*.
        She carries under one arm her folder of lecture notes, and under the other a bundle of books
        from which to read illustrative quotations. No young man offers to carry this burden for her.
10      Such gallantry is out of fashion. Robyn herself would disapprove of it on ideological grounds,
        and it might be interpreted by other students as “creeping”.

       Robyn arranges her notes on the lectern, waiting for latecomers to settle in their seats.
        The lecture theatre resonates like a drum with the chatter of a hundred students, all talking
        at once, as if they have just been released from solitary confinement. She taps on the desk
15      with an inverted pencil and clears her throat. A sudden hush falls, and a hundred faces tilt
        towards her – curious, expectant, sullen, apathetic – like empty dishes waiting to be filled.

       “In the 1840s and the 1850s,” says Robyn, “a number of novels were published in England,
        which have a certain family resemblance. Raymond Williams has called them ‘Industrial
        Novels’ because they dealt with social and economic problems arising out of the Industrial
20      Revolution, and in some cases the nature of factory work. They are novels in which the main
        characters debate social and economic issues as well as fall in and out of love, marry and
        have children, pursue careers, make or lose their fortunes, and do all the other things that
        characters do in more conventional novels.”

       Robyn glances up from her notes and sweeps the [ – X – ] with her eyes. Some are busily
25      scribbling down every word she [ – 26 – ], others are watching her quizzically, chewing the
        end of their ballpoints, and [ – 27 – ] who looked bored at the outset are now [ – 28 – ]
        vacantly out of the window or diligently cutting [ – 29 – ] initials into the lecture-room
        furniture.

       “The Industrial Novel contributed a distinctive strain to English fiction which persists
30      into the modern period, but it first arose in what history has called ‘the Hungry Forties’.
        At this time there was a call for universal male suffrage. Not even those far-out radicals
        could apparently contemplate the possibility of universal female suffrage.” All the students,
        even those who had been gazing out of the window, react to this. They smile and nod, or,
        in a friendly sort of way, groan and hiss. It is what they expect from Robyn Penrose, and even
35      the rugby-playing boys in the back row would be mildly disappointed if she didn’t produce
        this kind of observation from time to time. She smiles at her audience in appreciation.

BACK TO SLEEP, BACK TO SCHOOL
The best way to keep your mind sharp might be to go back to elementary school and help out in class:
this will help the children to achieve more. Grown-ups can strengthen parts of their brains in ways
that could protect them from Alzheimer’s disease.

Numerous studies have found that staying physically active, socially connected or mentally stimulated
helps keep ageing brains sharp.

24 women (aged 60+) volunteered for 15 hours a week in Baltimore elementary school classrooms.
After six months, researchers scanned their brains to find that they had increased activity in the parts
that often decline with age.

Doctor James Wilson of McGill University has found, however, that too much activity causes older
people to tire easily. This results in a lack of concentration.

Associating with other people also helps give meaning and purpose to life, which benefits mood and
memory. Another bonus: being in a room full of children gives no choice but to be physically active.
However, there is a risk of catching any cold or childhood disease that any of the children may have:
these are harder to combat at an older age.

There are many simple strategies to slip a bit of activity into your life. For example, if you have
a stationary exercise bike, why not move it in front of your TV? Find an excuse to move wherever
you are: stand up and walk in circles when you’re on the phone. Of course, you need to consult
your doctor to find out what static exercises will suit you as you need to take great care not to
strain your muscles because the healing process takes much longer as you become older.

Getting a good night’s sleep is one of the best things you can do for your body. Too little of it makes
you mentally foggy, causes you to eat more and places you at a higher risk of accidents. Seven or
eight hours of sleep a night should be sufficient: a study found that 75 % of those people who sleep
more risk dying earlier than their peers.

So, older people should go back to school and remember to sleep well!
