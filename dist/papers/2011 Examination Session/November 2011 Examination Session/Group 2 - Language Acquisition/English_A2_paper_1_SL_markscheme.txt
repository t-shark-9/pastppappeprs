These notes to examiners are intended only as guidelines to assist marking. They are not offered as
an exhaustive and fixed set of responses or approaches to which all answers must rigidly adhere.
Good ideas or angles not offered here should be acknowledged and rewarded as appropriate.
Similarly, answers which do not include all the ideas or approaches suggested here should not be so
heavily penalized as to distort appreciation of individuality.

                                            SECTION A

This question invites candidates to compare two texts about lawns, one from the opinion pages of a
Sunday newspaper, the other an extract from an essay about gardening.

A barely satisfactory comparative commentary may:

 note that both texts give opinions about lawns
 observe that text 1 deals with the environmental drawbacks of lawns and that the author of text 2
  has a preference for plants and flowers
 notice a few of the differences in diction and language choice between the texts.


A better comparative commentary may:

 observe that both texts are not in favour of lawns
 summarize the different reasons why they are not in favour of lawns
 note that text 2 offers alternatives to the lawn whereas text 1 concentrates only on the
  disadvantages
 observe that text 1 is from a general point of view, text 2 from a personal point of view
 make a comment on tone in text 2
 give specific examples of the contrast between the factual, ecological and scientific language in
  text 1 and the botanical vocabulary in text 2
 identify one or two of the cultural allusions in the texts.


The best comparative commentary may:

   comment on the collective focus of text 1 and the more individual focus of text 2
   comment on the didactic purposes of the texts, observing that text 1 warns while text 2 advises
   give examples of the use of hyperbole in the two texts
   discuss tone in the two texts giving examples of irony in both
   comment on some of the cultural allusions in the texts.

                                             SECTION B

This question invites candidates to compare two dialogues between anxious mothers and their
adult children, one from a play, the other from a novel.

A barely satisfactory comparative commentary may:

 note that text 4 is a telephone conversation between mother and daughter, text 3 a face-to-face
  exchange between mother and son
 notice a few more of the ways in which the situations are both similar and different
 make a few observations about the attitudes of the mothers and/or of their children
 notice a few of the differences and similarities in structure, language and style.


A better comparative commentary may:

 give more detailed observations about the ways in which the situations are both similar and
  different (for example, that the mothers do most of the talking, that the mother in text 3
  disapproves of her son seeing girls, the mother in text 4 of her daughter’s aspirations)
 give more detailed observations about the ways in which particularly the children respond to
  the criticisms of their mothers (for example, the girl does not oppose her mother, the son
  opposes his)
 illustrate the way in which both texts refer to fathers
 give more detailed observations about the differences and similarities in structure, language
  and style.


The best comparative commentary may:

 notice that the pressure put on the child in text 4 is not only parental, as in text 3, but also that of
  a society
 comment on the reference to death of parents in both texts. Note that they have being made to
  feel guilty in common
 give examples of the girl’s silent strength and the irony in the narrative style and show that she is
  better able to resist maternal pressure than the boy
 make more detailed comments about the similarities and differences between the way the
  mothers express their emotions
 make some comments about differences and similarities in the dialogues due to the difference in
  literary genre.
