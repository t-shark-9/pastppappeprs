TEXT A

The most popular movies filmed in the United Kingdom

A. Nanny McPhee

              Cedric Brown cannot look after his seven noisy children. Since his wife’s death he has
              employed seventeen nannies who could not manage either. Then the very odd Nanny
              McPhee arrives and, with a little magic, changes the Brown children into a well-behaved
              family.

B. Kes

This impressive but very sad film centres on Billy Casper. Billy’s teachers and classmates
treat him badly. He is teased by his older brother and he is ignored by his mother. Then,
all alone in the world, Billy finds a bird – a kestrel – which becomes his friend.

C. Skellig

                    This film, based on a much loved novel, tells the story of young Michael. His parents
                    spend most of their time with his sick sister. Michael becomes a friend of a man
                    called Skellig who lives at the end of his garden. But who, or what, is Skellig?



D. The Railway Children

In 1904, an innocent man who has three children is sent to prison. His children have to
leave London and move to the country where they are forced to live in poverty.

E. Sense and Sensibility


                       This film is a modern adaptation of Jane Austin’s classic novel. It is the story
                       of two sisters, Elinor and Marianne Dashwood. Their life becomes very difficult
                       when their father dies and their half-brother gets most of the money from the
                       inheritance.



F. Whistle down the Wind

A dramatic adventure begins when three children find a man hiding in a barn on their
family’s farm. They do not know that this stranger is running away from the police …

                    Become someone's friend!
Make a difference

 We are a national charity working in Scotland and England and we create opportunities
for adults with special needs. You can make a real difference in the life of someone with a
learning disability or learning problem by becoming a volunteer friend or “befriender” in
Newton Dee Village.

 “Befrienders” are men and women of all ages and from all professions and backgrounds.
We ask that you give a little of your time on a regular basis and have an open mind. You do not
need previous experience or special qualifications – just be yourself.

 You can help these adults with special needs just by doing what friends do: for example, you
can meet up regularly for a [ – X – ] and a cup of coffee. You can spend some time together with
a shared [ – 11 – ]. You can also accompany them on a trip to the [ – 12 – ], a visit to the cinema
or an afternoon of [ – 13 – ].

 The person you befriend is sharing some regular time with someone who shows
understanding and who has experience outside his or her daily life. This can bring enormous
benefits. It increases his or her confidence and self-esteem and builds a trusting friendship.

What we offer

 By becoming a volunteer “befriender”, you will gain a lot too. There will be fresh and different
experiences and you will make new friends as well.

 When you work with us, you will see a different way of life. You will meet people from
very varying backgrounds and many different places around the world. We hope that you will
gain just as much from being a “befriender” as the person you befriend. We will welcome your
participation in our community.

 Naturally, we give the support that our volunteer “ befrienders” need. We offer:
• Training
• Regular contact
• Costs
• The opportunity to be involved in an active community
• And lots of fun.

So we hope you will consider becoming one of our volunteer “befrienders”. We will be happy
to answer any questions either on the phone or we can arrange for you to come and meet us at
Newton Dee. All our contact details are on the back of this leaflet.

                     Adventures in the Arctic



            Pen Hadow, Ann Daniels and Martin Hartley have been in the Arctic for two months, living in
            extremely cold temperatures to find out about the effects of climate change. Pen talks to our
            journalist.

                “The main reason we are here is to take lots of measurements of the ice for scientists who
                 are analysing how climate change is affecting the Arctic. Most of the measurements are
                 done by me with the help of Martin.

                At the beginning of the trip the temperatures and the weather were horrible – sometimes
     5           because of the wind the temperature was as low as –70°C. It was so cold that we had
                 problems getting anything to work – cookers, cameras – nothing likes this level of cold.

                At first it was almost constantly dark – only two hours of daytime, but now it is summer
                 and we have daylight 24 hours a day! It is a lot warmer too – only about –14°C at the
                 moment. In fact, if it gets much warmer we will be picked up earlier than planned
   10            because the ice will be too dangerous.

                There is animal life everywhere in the Arctic – but we usually cannot see it. We know
                 that there have been one, if not two, polar bears in the vicinity because we have seen
                 their marks a few times now.

                When we were on our way to the place where we are camping now, we had to do
   15            our first swim of the expedition. It is something we were all afraid of. We put our
                 special “immersion suits” on. It took us 20 minutes to swim across the water with all our
                 equipment. I hope we do not have to do that too much more!

                Ann Daniels is our navigator and she also does all the cooking. This is a very important
                 job because she has to calculate the amount of calories that we need to give us the energy
   20            to survive. Most meals can be “drunk” from thermal mugs. If they were not in thermal
                 mugs, they would freeze solid.

                Before our plane finally arrived with supplies we only had emergency rations left.
                 We had not had a hot meal for several days. I did not have the energy to work. We were
                 so pleased when the plane arrived and we could eat a good meal!”

       WHAT TO DO IF YOU ARE IN A CAR ACCIDENT
       Being in a car accident can happen to anyone.
       Accidents happen quickly and unexpectedly and
       often you are unprepared for what happens after
       the accident.

5      Car accidents can be stressful and upsetting
       but people should know how to behave in this
       situation in case it happens to them. Whether
       you caused the accident or not, you have to
       act quickly.

10     The first step is to stay calm. Do not panic and do not lose control of yourself. It is important
       to behave normally because this will help you to stay in control of the situation.

       Next, you must make sure that you and your passengers are unharmed. Do not help others in
       the accident if you are not sure you can do so without making your own injuries worse. Be sure
       to move as far away from the roadway as possible, but stay at the scene of the accident. Warn
15     approaching traffic by putting on your lights.

       After you have done that, call the police. Ring 911. When you report the accident, the operator
       will ask you if you need the fire, ambulance or police departments. Ask for the police and for
       an ambulance if someone is injured.

       Exchange vital information (name, address, telephone numbers …) with the other driver
20     involved in the car accident. Finally contact your insurance company to report the accident.
