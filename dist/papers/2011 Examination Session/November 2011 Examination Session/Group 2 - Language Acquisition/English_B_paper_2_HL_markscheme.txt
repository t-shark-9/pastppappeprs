These notes are not intended to replace the published criteria but to supplement them in some instances.

These notes are intended to define the top mark of the scale in this examination. The phrase,
“a good answer”, is intended to refer to scripts that are likely to be placed in the 9 to 10 band
of descriptors. Scripts should be marked proportionately lower to the degree to which they fail to
meet these requirements.

In each case, good answers will meet most, though not necessarily all, of the following
requirements.

1.    Your teacher has set this as the topic of your next essay: “Is it morally acceptable to
      download music and films from the Internet illegally?” Write an essay discussing the positive
      and negative aspects of this issue.

      Argument/balanced – semi-formal to formal – essay

      A good answer
      • will consider clear arguments both for and against downloading music and films illegally,
        at least a third on each side of the argument; failure to do so would result in a maximum
        mark of 6 for Criterion C
      • may address in depth the moral aspects of the topic; this should be rewarded
      • will have a title
      • will contain the elements of an essay: introduction, body, conclusion
      • will contain supporting facts for points made
      • will adopt a semi-formal to formal register
      • will contain a personal viewpoint
      • may cite examples of illegal downloading; this should be rewarded.


2.    If the main character in a book that you have read had been of the opposite gender, how do
      you think this might have affected the story? Write a letter to the literary critic of the
      local newspaper explaining what changes might have occurred. Remember to identify the
      character and the book.

      Written interaction – formal – letter

      A good answer
      • will adopt the elements of a formal letter format
      • will indicate the title of the book
      • will indicate the character in the book
      • will not merely re-tell the plot
      • will state the original gender of the character
      • will explain how a change in the main character’s gender might affect the nature of
        the story
      • will explain how a change in the main character’s gender would/would not alter the plot
      • will adopt an appropriate style and register (formal to fairly formal)
      • may contain flashes of humour; this should be rewarded.

3.   You are unhappy with some of your school rules. Write a proposal to your principal,
     explaining why you think these rules need to be changed and suggesting alternatives.

     Argumentative/explanation – formal – proposal

     A good answer
     • will adopt the format of a proposal (whether in the context of a report or a letter), such as
       use of headings, short clear paragraphs, sections identified by numbers/letters,
       insetting, etc.
     • will adopt a formal register
     • will clearly state which rules are causing concern
     • will state why these rules are causing concern
     • will offer alternatives
     • may mention the benefits of alternative rules; this should be rewarded
     • may mention why the rules were originally put into place; this should be rewarded.


4.   You are participating in a class debate on whether it is better to attend a university in the
     town in which you live or in another place. Write your speech, either agreeing or disagreeing
     with this motion.

     Argument/controversial – formal to semi-formal – text of a speech

     A good answer
     • will make absolutely clear the writer’s viewpoint, of either agreement or disagreement with
       the motion; failure to take a clear position should result in a maximum mark of 6 for
       Criterion C
     • will focus mainly on either agreement or disagreement with the motion
     • will provide support for the reasons for agreement/disagreement
     • will adopt a fairly formal register, perhaps with flashes of informality
     • will use appropriate rhetorical devices, etc.
     • will address the audience and keep contact with them throughout the speech; this should
       be rewarded
     • may devote some space to the opposing viewpoint for rebuttal purposes; this should
       be rewarded.

5.   As you were looking out of the window, you witnessed something happening to a car that
     was parked in front of your home. Write a statement for the insurance company, describing
     what happened.

     Narration/factual – formal – statement

     A good answer
     • will adopt a formal register
     • will provide a clear context, and a description of the car
     • will describe sequentially what occurred in some detail, including descriptions of
       people involved
     • will not, however, get lost in excessive detail
     • will not contain too many personal emotional responses.


6.   A classmate comes from a region that was recently affected by a serious natural disaster.
     To gain support from fellow students, interview him or her and write the report of
     your interview for your school newspaper. Do not simply write the exact words (transcript)
     of the interview.

     Reported spoken interaction – semi-formal – article

     A good answer
     • will adopt a semi-formal register with possible flashes of informality; the approach should
       be appropriate to dealing with a “serious natural disaster”
     • will explain clearly where the natural disaster was
     • will have a title and the name of the author
     • will explain clearly the nature of the natural disaster
     • may give details of the current situation
     • may contain suggestions of how the school could support this cause
     • will refer to the interview but not be a verbatim transcript; verbatim transcript would result
       in a maximum mark of 4 for Criterion B
     • may incorporate direct quotations; this should be rewarded.
