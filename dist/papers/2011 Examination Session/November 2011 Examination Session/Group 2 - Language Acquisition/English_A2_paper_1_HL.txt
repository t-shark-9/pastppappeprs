                                                               The river as fact

                   It has a length of 215 miles, and is navigable for 191 miles. It is the longest river in England
            but not in Britain, where the Severn is longer by approximately 5 miles. Nevertheless it must be
            the shortest river in the world to acquire such a famous history. The Amazon and the Mississippi
            cover almost 4,000 miles and the Yangtze almost 3,500 miles; but none of them has arrested the
      5     attention of the world in the manner of the Thames.
                   There are 134 bridges along the length of the Thames, and forty-four locks1 above Teddington.
            There are approximately twenty major tributaries still flowing into the main river, while others
            such as the Fleet have now disappeared under the ground. Its ‘basin’, the area from which it
            derives its water from rain and other natural forces, covers an area of some 5,264 square miles.
    10      And then there are the springs, many of them in the woods or close to the streams beside
            the Thames. There is one in the wood below Sinodun Hills in Oxfordshire, for example,
            which has been described as an ‘everlasting spring’ always fresh and always renewed.
                   The average flow of the river at Teddington, chosen because it marks the place where the
            tidal and non-tidal waters touch, has been calculated at 1,145 millions of gallons (5,205 millions
    15      of litres) each day or approximately 2,000 cubic feet (56.6 cubic metres) per second. The current
            moves at a velocity of between ½ and 2¾ miles per hour. The main thrust of the river flow
            is known to hydrologists as the “thalweg”; it does not move in a straight and forward line but,
            mingling with the inner flow and variegated2 flow of the surface and bottom waters, takes the form
            of a spiral or helix. More than 95 % of the river’s energy is lost in turbulence and friction.
    20             The direction of the flow of the Thames is therefore quixotic3. It might be assumed that it
            would move eastwards, but it defies any simple prediction. It does not meander like the Euphrates,
            where according to Herodotus4 the voyager came upon the same village three times on three
            separate days, but it is circuitous. It specialises in loops. It will take the riparian traveller5 two or
            three times as long to cover the same distance as a companion on the high road. So the Thames
    25      teaches you to take time, and to view the world from a different vantage.

                                          Extract from Hawksmoor by Peter Ackroyd, published by Penguin.

                       Paddlesteamer Cruises from Adelaide on Australia’s Murray River

            8-day cruises by paddlesteamer along Australia’s greatest river including transfers
            from Adelaide. 3-night weekend or 4-night midweek cruises available.

            The mighty Murray, the world’s fifth largest river, courses more than 3,000 kilometres across
            one third of the Australian continent. From its source in the Snowy Mountains of New South
      5     Wales it travels to the Southern Ocean near Adelaide, the Murray/Darling Basin. The scenery is
            some of the most ancient on earth – a place where all the colours of Australia converge.

            Cruise through miles of gorges, millions of years old. Discover golden sandstone cliffs towering
            over blue-green lagoons, majestic red gum forests under endless blue skies and green irrigated
            farmlands against red desert plains.

    10      The Murray is a haven for over 350 species of birds. It’s an outback oasis for a myriad of
            fascinating wildlife including majestic sulphur crested cockatoos, kangaroos, goannas, black swans,
            gentle pelicans and the legendary Murray Cod.

            A fundamental part of Australia’s heritage was founded in the proud paddlesteamer tradition.
            The Murray was the lifeline to pioneers who lived on the driest continent on earth. Over 200
    15      paddlesteamers plied the river day and night, negotiating hidden reefs, massive sandbars and
            treacherous passages.

            Murray Princess is Australia’s largest and most luxuriously appointed paddlewheeler.
            She represents a new age in inland cruising and an elegant recreation of a bygone era1.
            She was purpose built to offer an indulgent outback river experience. Her graceful
    20      stern paddlewheel, antique mahogany furnishings and spiral staircases, reflect the elegance of the
            grand era of Murray River cruising.

            The lounges are spectacular meeting areas, with floor to ceiling windows affording panoramic
            views of the massive stern paddlewheel. The spacious upper decks offer plenty of sunny and
            shady retreats to escape with a cool drink and a good book. And for a total river adventure
    25      Murray Princess also carries an onboard tender2 for exhilarating speed boat rides through the
            “big bends”.

            Onboard facilities include two spas, two saunas, two bars, two lounges, single sitting
            dining saloon, sun deck, speed boat, lift, library, video, guest laundry, gift shop and 24 hour tea
            and coffee facilities.
