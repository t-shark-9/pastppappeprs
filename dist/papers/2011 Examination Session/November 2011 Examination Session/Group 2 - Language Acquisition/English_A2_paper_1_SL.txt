                                               Keep off the Grass

                  Every weekend, up and down the country, enormous efforts go into keeping our green and
            pleasant land that way – or at least that is how it appears. Vast tracts of ground are put down
            to lawn1. Maintaining it is big business. Figures attributed to lawn care in America reveal that each
            weekend about 54 million Americans mow their lawns, using 800 million gallons of petrol in the
      5     process of doing so over a year. With the associated noise pollution put to one side, it is important
            to remember that until very recently garden mowers went unregulated and the emissions attributed
            to lawn mowing have been proven to generate up to 5 % of the country’s annual pollutants. I do
            not know the equivalent figures here in the UK, but it is a sobering thought that something we
            take for granted as a means of maintaining open ground could have such a significant cost to
    10      the environment.
                  Lawns are high maintenance and if you choose to aspire to a weed- and moss-free sward2,
            you will have to employ a considerable gambit3 of chemicals to keep them that way.
            Most homeowners have no idea how much nitrogen they use when fertilising, and the nitrates are
            finding their way into our water table and watercourses to alter the ecology there. As amateur
    15      lawnkeepers, we also have access to a complex cocktail of herbicides, which have been proven to
            linger in the soil and to be freely tracked into the home on feet – and paws, if you have pets that
            use the garden too. Even in a country famed for its rolling green pastures, enormous quantities of
            water are used to keep our domestic lawns green.

                                                          Living without a Lawn

                  A lawn 17 by 20 feet is just fine, if you think a lawnless life is not worth living, but I hate
            to see anybody badgered1 and shamed by unholy pressures into growing grass simply because
            everybody else does.
                  Often we may see tiny lots overhung with enormous trees, beneath which the poor humans
      5     (far more industrious than the ant or the honey bee, which only stirs because life itself is at
            stake) dart fitfully about2 with large machines and later creep on all fours to trim here and there.
            From time to time they may be seen sprinkling grass seed, fertilizer, and other gold out of sacks,
            and they continue this for as long as God grants them energy to move around. If this provides
            pleasure – it certainly keeps them off the streets – then all to the good, but reason would dictate
    10      something other than a lawn in such a site. Why not azaleas and camellias, with a little clearing
            sprinkled about with Virginia bluebells, lilies of the valley, Solomon’s seal, veratrums (if it were
            damp), and grand little bulbous things like anemones, crocuses, and the like? The number of
            shrubs3 that enjoy light woodland conditions is vast and, while nothing is labourproof, still it is
            more satisfying to care for camellias, viburnums and so on, grown to perfection, than to work like
    15      the devil for a scraggly patch of lawn.
                  Obviously, if you want the effect of a million blades of grass shorn4 uniformly, only shorn
            grass will produce that effect. But I suspect many gardeners would do well to think of something
            besides grass and the little noisy juggernauts5 you cut with.
