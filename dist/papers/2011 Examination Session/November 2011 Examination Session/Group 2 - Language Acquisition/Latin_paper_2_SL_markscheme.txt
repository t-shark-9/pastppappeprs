Elegiac and Lyric poetry

1.   (a)   His hendecasyllables lines, hendecasyllabi [1 mark]; lines composed of eleven syllables,
           the meter fit for abuse and sarcasm [1 mark].

     (b)   A young woman, whom Catullus describes as a moecha putida [1 mark], took his
           writing-tablets, pugillaria [1 mark] and refuses to return them [1 mark].

     (c)   Any four of: rhetorical question to introduce the caricature of the woman: quae sit, quaeritis?
           [1 mark]; series of negative descriptions, usually applied to a little woman: turpe incedere
           [1 mark], mimice ac moleste ridentem [1 mark], further emphasised through catuli ore
           Gallicani [1 mark] (N.B.: ore framed); repetition with reversed order of an abusive
           expression: moecha putida, putida moecha [1 mark] (N.B.: the second time the phrase is
           framed); colloquial language in an imaginary dialogue which makes the passage vivid:
           non assis facis? [1 mark]; tricolon of abusive language in a theatrically indignant
           exclamation: o lutum, lupanar, aut si perditius potes quid esse [1 mark].

     (d)   New-style poetry, influenced by Hellenistic poetry, opposed to long, serious poems,
           in traditional meters [1 mark]; any three of: addressing his verses in lines 1–2 [1 mark];
           hyperbole in l.2 [1 mark]; abusive language [1 mark]; colloquial language [1 mark]; the
           sudden change in the end, when the woman is called pudica et proba [1 mark].

     (e)   [3 marks] for a correct answer or with no more than one minor error (tense, number, etc.).
           Answers with two or three minor errors or one major error should be awarded [2 marks].

2.   (a)   These names are used to describe the beginning of Autumn, when the sea becomes rough:
           Arcturus = star setting (cadentis) at the end of October [1 mark]; orientis Haedi = at the
           beginning of October [1 mark].

     (b)   A list of worries which a modest person has not to fear: grandine = framed [1 mark];
           verberatae vinea – fundusque mendax = chiasmus [1 mark]; fundus mendax = personification
           [1 mark]; culpante and sidera = enjambment [1 mark each]; all these create a graphic image
           of disasters that ruin one’s happiness [1 mark].

           Answers with two or three minor errors or one major error should be awarded [2 marks].
           Answers with two major errors (or four minor errors) award [1 mark]; otherwise, no mark.

     (d)   A hyperbolic description of large houses partially built in the sea [1 mark]; it is another
           example of human vanity [1 mark], similar to the merchant who takes risks in his quest for
           profit and to the farmer animated by the same reason [1 mark]; all three form a tricolon
           [1 mark].

     (e)   The extract ends in strong contrast with the previous part: whatever we try we cannot escape
           anxiety [1 mark], who follows us up in tall houses, or ships made of bronze or when we fly
           on horseback [1 mark]. Better to wish only what is enough (quod satis est), nothing more
           than that [1 mark].
                                                                                             [15 marks]

             strictamque aciem venientibus offert [1 mark]; he has to be warned by the Sibyl not to attack
             ghosts: ni docta comes … admoneat … inruat [1 mark].

                                                                                                 [15 marks]

6.   (a)   A good politician/diplomat: Tarquinius pacem cum Aequorum gente fecit [1 mark];

Letters

           publications [1 mark].

     (b)   It seems that Pliny wrote books after coming to know various places and/or people [1 mark]
           for example: cum praefectus alae militaret [1 mark]; a quo singulariter amatus [1 mark];
           cum in Germania militaret [1 mark].

     (c)   His friend appeared in his dreams [1 mark] asking Pliny to save his name from oblivion
           [1 mark]; obviously Pliny obeyed the dreams which show his piety and religious character
           [1 mark].

     (e)   First, Pliny introduces the list by mentioning Baebius’ request [1 mark]; he then adds various
           qualifications to the verb, for example: pari ingenio curaque composuit [1 mark], hoc
           memoriae amici quasi debitum munus exsolvit [1 mark]; opus diffusum eruditum, nec minus
           varium quam ipsa natura [1 mark]; occasionally he introduces more unusual information:
           somnio monitus [1 mark].
                                                                                              [15 marks]

           and denser than any ordinary night [1 mark]; the sea was wild and dangerous [1 mark].

     (b)   Pliny the Elder [1 mark]; the flames drove the others to take flight and roused him to stand
           up: flammae … alios in fugam vertunt, excitant illum, Pliny is a brave man and also is
           interested in studying and understanding the phenomenon [1 mark].

     (c)   [3 marks] for a correct answer or with no more than one minor error (tense, number, etc.).
           Answers with two or three minor errors or one major error should be awarded [2 marks].

     (d)   Sentence left unfinished (aposiopesis – technical name not needed) [1 mark]; sudden change
           of narrative [1 mark], used to draw attention upon the author of the letter [1 mark], as the
           expression unum adiciam and the following verbs are in first person [1 mark].

     (e)   Alternating short phrases with longer ones, for example finem ergo faciam and tu potissima
           excerpes, against the rest of them [1 mark]; insistence on him being an eye witness: verbs in
           first person, and interfueram [1 mark] and on the accuracy of his description: quaeque statim,
           cum maxime vera memorantur, audieram, persecutum [1 mark]; final (double) contrast
           epistulam vs historiam, echoed in amico vs omnibus scribere [1 mark].
                                                                                              [15 marks]

      (b)   Judge only for length of syllables. [1 mark] for each error-free line.

      (c)   Pegasus was the winged-horse [1 mark] born from the Gorgon’s blood [1 mark]; one of his
            feathers (pinna) fell over a place in Cilicia [1 mark], where later on the city of Tarsus, famous
            for its schools, was founded [1 mark]; philosophers came from those areas to Rome [1 mark].

      (d)   [3 marks] for a correct answer or with no more than one minor error (tense, number, etc.).
            Answers with two or three minor errors or one major error should be awarded [2 marks].
            Answers with two major errors (or four minor errors) award [1 mark]; otherwise, no mark.

      (e)   Bareas the Stoic philosopher illustrates that Greek people do not have friends, unlike the
            Romans, non est Romano cuiquam locus hic [1 mark]; caballus is a pejorative word for
            “horse” and as such is in contrast with Pegasus, the Gorgon’s steed [1 mark]; line 120
            contains three Greek names [1 mark] and is spondaic to add emphasis on them [1 mark];
            insistence on the idea of genetic vice: gentis vitio, and de naturae patriaeque veneno
            [1 mark]; use of first person, as Juvenal becomes the Roman par excellence: limine
            summoveor [1 mark].
                                                                                           [15 marks]

            comic imagery: quas recto vertice portat servulus infelix et cursu ventilat ignem [1 mark];
            comic personification: nutant alte populoque minantur [1 mark].

      (c)   [3 marks] for a correct answer or with no more than one minor error (tense, number, etc.).

            Answers with two major errors (or four minor errors) award [1 mark]; otherwise, no mark.

      (d)   The contrast is between the man who has died and the preparations being made at home for
            his return [1 mark]; not only the soul has disappeared, but also the corpse: omne cadaver
            more animae [1 mark]; meanwhile at home the whole house (domus = metonymy), is busy in
            preparing dinner [1 mark]; graphic imagery of the cheeks blowing up the fire: bucca foculum
            excitat [1 mark]; back to the dead, who is waiting to cross the River: at ille iam sedet in ripa
            [1 mark].

      (e)   Charon [1 mark], the ferryman: porthmea [1 mark]; does not have a copper coin to pay for
            his fare: nec habet quem porrigat ore trientem [1 mark].

                                                                                                 [15 marks]
