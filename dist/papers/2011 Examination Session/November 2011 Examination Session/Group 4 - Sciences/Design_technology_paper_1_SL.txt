Questions 27–30 relate to the following case study. Please read the case study carefully and answer
the questions.

Figure 9 and Figure 10 show devices called “cat’s eyes” which are fixed into road surfaces to improve safety.
A cat’s eye comprises four self-cleaning glass and metal reflective beads (see Figure 11) mounted in a
rubber stud (see Figure 12).  Most cat’s eyes are white and found in the centre of roads.  Other colours
are now available, e.g. red cat’s eyes are used to indicate hard shoulders, amber ones to indicate central
reservations and green ones to indicate junctions.  As part of the design development process, 50 cat’s eyes
were installed in a stretch of road where previously a number of accidents had occurred.
