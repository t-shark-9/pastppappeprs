Subject Details: Physics SL Paper 3 Markscheme
Mark Allocation

Candidates are required to answer questions from TWO of the Options [2 % 20 marks].
Maximum total = [40 marks]

1.    A markscheme often has more marking points than the total allows. This is intentional. Do not award
      more than the maximum marks allowed for part of a question.

2.    Each marking point has a separate line and the end is signified by means of a semicolon (;).

3.    An alternative answer or wording is indicated in the markscheme by a slash (/). Either wording can
      be accepted.

4.    Words in brackets ( ) in the markscheme are not necessary to gain the mark.

5.    Words that are underlined are essential for the mark.

6.    The order of marking points does not have to be as in the markscheme, unless stated otherwise.

7.    If the candidate’s answer has the same “meaning” or can be clearly interpreted as being of
      equivalent significance, detail and validity as that in the markscheme then award the mark.
      Where this point is considered to be particularly relevant in a question it is emphasized by
      writing OWTTE (or words to that effect).

8.    Remember that many candidates are writing in a second language. Effective communication is
      more important than grammatical accuracy.

9.    Occasionally, a part of a question may require an answer that is required for subsequent
      marking points. If an error is made in the first marking point then it should be penalized.
      However, if the incorrect answer is used correctly in subsequent marking points then
      follow through marks should be awarded. Indicate this with ECF (error carried forward).

10.   Only consider units at the end of a calculation. Unless directed otherwise in the markscheme,
      unit errors should only be penalized once in the paper. Indicate this by writing –1(U) at the
      first point it occurs and U on the cover sheet.


11.   Significant digits should only be considered in the final answer. Deduct 1 mark in the paper for
      an error of 2 or more digits unless directed otherwise in the markscheme.

                                         e.g. if the answer is 1.63:
                                                      2      reject
                                                    1.6      accept
                                                   1.63      accept
                                                  1.631      accept
                                                1.6314       reject

      Indicate the mark deduction by writing –1(SD) at the first point it occurs and SD on the cover sheet.

Option A — Sight and wave phenomena

A1. (a)   photopic vision is vision (of the eye) in well-lit/bright conditions and scotopic
          vision is vision in low level/dim lighting conditions;                              [1]

    (b)   Look for these main points:
          cone cells are primarily concerned with colour vision;
          they do not respond under low light conditions whereas the rod cells do;
          rod cells are more responsive to green light than to red light / OWTTE;             [3]

Option B — Quantum physics and nuclear physics

B1. (a)    the potential difference is varied (using the potential divider);
           until the current registered by the ammeter is zero;
           the maximum kinetic energy of the (ejected) electrons is this potential times the
           electron charge;                                                                               [3]

Option C — Digital technology

C1. (a)    information is encoded on the surface as a series of lands and pits/bumps and
           flats;
           laser light reflected from a pit is read as a binary 1;
           the depth of the pit is such that light will be reflected from the edge of the pit and
           the pit will interfere destructively and be read as binary 0;                                 [3]
           If the second marking point states 1 then the third must state 0 and vice versa.

           Award [2] for bald correct answer.



C2. (a)    the ratio of length of image on the CCD to the length of object;                              [1]

     (b)   Look for these main points:
           magnification:
           the greater the magnification the greater the length of image on the CCD therefore
           the greater the number of pixels activated by light from object;
           image is therefore more detailed;
           resolution:
           the greater the resolution the more pixels in a given length;
           so again image is more detailed;                                                              [4]



                                                                                 V      
C3. (a)    (i)    the amplifier has a very high open loop gain  defined from A = OUT  ;
                                                                                V+ − V− 
                  this means that V+ ≈ V− ;
                  since in the circuit V+ = 0 then V− = 0 ;
                  because of the very high input resistance no current will flow into the
                  amplifier at V− input so P remains at 0 V / OWTTE;                                     [4]

           (ii)   let I be the current at input then VIN = IR 1 and VOUT = − IR 2 ;
                                  V          IR         R
                  therefore G = OUT = − 2 = (−) 2 ;                                                      [2]
                                   VIN       IR 1       R1

     (b)   look for these main points:
           (when the thermistor is cold) the variable resistor is used to set the potential at the
           inverting input (to some fixed value less than the potential at P);
           the output of the amplifier is saturated at –15 V and so the LED is unlit;
           as the thermistor warms up its resistance decreases;
           the potential at P will increase until at a particular temperature, the potential at P
           is just greater than the potential at the inverting input;
           the output now goes high (saturates) to +15 V and the LED will light;                     [4 max]

Option D — Relativity and particle physics

D1. (a)    (i)    (a reference frame) in which Newton’s first law holds true/that is not
                  accelerating/that is moving with constant velocity;                                    [1]

           (ii)   the speed of light in a vacuum/free space is the same for all inertial observers;      [1]

     (b)   Look for these main points:
           signal from switch travels at same speed c to each lamp;
           but during signal transfer C1 moves closer to/C2 moves away from source of signal;
           since speed of light is independent of speed of source, signal reaches C1 before C2
           /C2 after C1;
           according to Vladamir C1 registers arrival of signal before C2/C2 registers arrival of
           signal after C1;                                                                              [4]
