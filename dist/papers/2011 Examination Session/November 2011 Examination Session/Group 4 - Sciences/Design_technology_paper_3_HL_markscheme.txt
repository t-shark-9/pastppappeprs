Subject Details:                    Design Technology HL Paper 3 Markscheme
Mark Allocation

Candidates are required to answer questions from ONE of the Options [1  40 marks].
Maximum total = [40 marks]

1.    A markscheme often has more marking points than the total allows. This is intentional. Do not
      award more than the maximum marks allowed for part of a question.

2.    Each marking point has a separate line and the end is shown by means of a semicolon (;).

3.    An alternative answer or wording is indicated in the markscheme by a slash (/). Either wording can
      be accepted.

4.    Words in brackets ( ) in the markscheme are not necessary to gain the mark.

5.    Words that are underlined are essential for the mark.

6.    The order of marking points does not have to be as in the markscheme, unless stated otherwise.

7.    If the candidate’s answer has the same “meaning” or can be clearly interpreted as being of
      equivalent significance, detail and validity as that in the markscheme then award the mark.
      Where this point is considered to be particularly relevant in a question it is emphasized by
      OWTTE (or words to that effect).

8.    Remember that many candidates are writing in a second language. Effective communication is
      more important than grammatical accuracy.

9.    Occasionally, a part of a question may require an answer that is required for subsequent
      marking points. If an error is made in the first marking point then it should be penalized. However,
      if the incorrect answer is used correctly in subsequent marking points then follow through marks
      should be awarded. When marking, indicate this by adding ECF (error carried forward) on
      the script.

10.   Do not penalize candidates for errors in units or significant figures, unless it is specifically referred
      to in the markscheme.

A4. Award [1] for each of three distinct correct points in an explanation of each of two
    distinct reasons why farmers’ markets have become popular in urban areas in many
    countries [3 max] per issue [6 max].
    provenance / knowing where food has come from is increasingly important
    to consumers;
    food scares have contributed to people being wary of supermarket and mass
    produced foods;
    buying food at farmers’ markets promotes consumer confidence;

     sustainability;
     farmers’ markets enable farmers to command a larger share of the food dollar and make
     their farms more sustainable;
     farmers will get less for their products if they sell food to supermarkets and food
     wholesalers than if they sell directly to consumers;

     economic reasons;
     food will be cheaper and fresher at farmers’ markets than in supermarkets;
     this is good for consumers;                                                               [6 max]

A6. (a)   Award [1] for each of three distinct correct points in an explanation of why
          producers would be reluctant to label genetically-modified crops [3 max].
          many people will not purchase GM products knowingly;
          thus the value of the product is reduced;
          economic viability of crop destroyed;

          image;
          in some countries GM crops have a poor image;
          because of media representation/scaremongering;                                      [3 max]

    (b)   Award [1] for each of three distinct correct points in a discussion of an
          issue concerning GM crops as an inappropriate technology for a developing
          country [3 max].
          GM seeds are more expensive than normal seeds;
          if a farmer uses GM seed he cannot harvest the seed to sow the following year
          under the conditions of the license;
          he ties himself into a cycle of having to continuously pay for seed for the
          following year;

          GM technology itself does not create jobs using local skills and labour;
          farming jobs may remain the same or may even be reduced;
          GM crops are often developed to make farming less labour-intensive;

          GM technology is not understood by the people who use it;
          GM technology is complex technology;
          where education levels are low it is unlikely to be understood by the people who
          use it;

          GM crops may be detrimental to quality of life;
          there are concerns about the appropriateness of GM crops and their impact on
          humans in the longer term;
          until longer term research has been conducted it is probably unethical to use them
          in developing countries;

          could be detrimental to the environment;
          there are concerns about gene transfer to other species and the implications
          of these;
          many GM crops are about resistance to pesticides and if gene transfer were to
          occur then the “weeds” to which transfer takes place would be resistant to
          pesticides which could prove problematic;                                            [3 max]

          craftsman might give the best value for money;
          but if the ring is produced for selling to a large number of people/different people
          CAD/CAM is likely to be better value for money;

           which can be used sitting normally in the wheelchair;
           to activate the door without having to stretch;                                         [3 max]

     (b)   Award [1] for each point in an explanation of one disadvantage of the ramp
           system to able-bodied users of the building.
           slip hazard;
           ramps may become slippery when wet/icy;
           unless a non-slip material/surface is used;                                             [3 max]



E7. Award [1] for each distinct point in a suitable discussion of how human factor data
    relating to clearance, reach and comfort can be used in the design of an aircraft cabin
    [3 max] for each consideration [9 max].
    Reach:
    overhead lockers need to be accessible to the majority of users;
    so the 5th percentile would be used to decide the height;
    meaning that 95% of the user population would be able to reach the lockers;

     Comfort:
     the size of the seats needs to be suitable for people in the 5th–95th percentile range for
     seat width;
     and the shape of the seats needs to aid comfort/give back support;
     adjustability, most aircraft seats allow limited adjustability (rake);

     Clearance:
     the arrangement of seats need to ensure that there is sufficient clearance for legs when
     users are seated in the aircraft;
     aircraft use different leg space for different seat class (economy, business class);
     in economy class, the leg space is designed for people in the 75th percentile;

     clearance for height of users;
     so they do not hit their heads on the overhead luggage compartments when getting in
     and out of their seats;
     passengers could sue the airline if they bang their heads on the lockers;

     sufficient clearance in the aisles for cabin crew and trolleys;
     the trolley needs to move down the aisle without disturbing passengers;
     there is a direct relationship between the width of the trolley and the width of the aisle;   [9 max]
