examiners in this examination session.

Subject Details: Physics SL Paper 2 Markscheme
Mark Allocation

Candidates are required to answer ALL questions in Section A [25 marks] and ONE question in
Section B [25 marks]. Maximum total=[50 marks].

1.    A markscheme often has more marking points than the total allows. This is intentional. Do not award
      more than the maximum marks allowed for part of a question.

2.    Each marking point has a separate line and the end is shown by means of a semicolon (;).

3.    An alternative answer or wording is indicated in the markscheme by a slash (/). Either wording can
      be accepted.

4.    Words, numbers, or units in brackets ( ) in the markscheme are not necessary to gain the mark.

5.    Words that are underlined are essential for the mark.

6.    The order of marking points does not have to be as in the markscheme, unless stated otherwise.

7.    If the candidate’s answer has the same “meaning” or can be clearly interpreted as being of
      equivalent significance, detail and validity as that in the markscheme then award the mark.
      Where this point is considered to be particularly relevant in a question it is emphasized by
      OWTTE (or words to that effect).

8.    Remember that many candidates are writing in a second language. Effective communication is
      more important than grammatical accuracy.

9.    Occasionally, a part of a question may require an answer that is required for subsequent
      marking points. If an error is made in the first marking point then it should be penalized. However, if
      the incorrect answer is used correctly in subsequent marking points then follow through marks
      should be awarded when marking. Indicate this by adding ECF (error carried forward) on the script.

10.   Only penalize candidates for errors in units or significant figures, when a penalty is specifically
      referred to in the markscheme.

B3. Part 1       Greenhouse effect

    (a)   effect caused by gas such as H 2 O/ NH3 /CH 4 /CO 2 /greenhouse gas in the atmosphere;
          gas absorbs outgoing (long wave) radiation from Earth;
          gas re-radiates some of the energy back to Earth;                                             [3]

                 3.0 × 108
    (b)   (i)               = 4.6 (µm) ;
                 6.5 × 1013
                 ≈ 5 (µm)                                                                               [1]

          (ii)   water vapour molecules have a natural frequency of oscillation;
                 if this frequency of oscillation is 6.5 × 1013 / reference to frequency at X;
                 due to resonance this radiation is readily absorbed by the molecules / the radiation
                 matches the natural frequency of oscillation;                                          [3]
                 or
                 X is a natural frequency (of oscillation) of water molecule;
                 so resonance effects mean that molecules are excited at this frequency;
                 and energy is removed/less energy transmitted from electromagnetic waves at
                 this (particular) frequency;

          (iii) energy gained by absorption needs to be re-emitted (as molecules de-excite);
                in other directions / some returns to Earth;                                            [2]

          (iv) more greenhouse gases means that there is more absorption of outgoing
               radiation;
               therefore more energy returns to Earth;
               leading to a further/greater increase in the temperature of the surface (of Earth);      [3]

          change in water level =                                    (= 1× 10 –3 m) ;
