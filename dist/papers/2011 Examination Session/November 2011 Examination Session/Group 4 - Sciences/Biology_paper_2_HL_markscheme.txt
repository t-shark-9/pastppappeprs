Subject Details: Biology HL Paper 2 Markscheme

Mark Allocation

Candidates are required to answer ALL questions in Section A [32 marks] and TWO questions in
Section B [2 % 20 marks]. Maximum total = [72 marks]

1.    A markscheme often has more marking points than the total allows. This is intentional. Do not award
      more than the maximum marks allowed for part of a question.

2.    Each marking point has a separate line and the end is shown by means of a semicolon (;).

3.    An alternative answer or wording is indicated in the markscheme by a slash (/). Either wording can
      be accepted.

4.    Words in brackets ( ) in the markscheme are not necessary to gain the mark.

5.    Words that are underlined are essential for the mark.

6.    The order of marking points does not have to be as in the markscheme, unless stated otherwise.

7.    If the candidate’s answer has the same “meaning” or can be clearly interpreted as being of
      equivalent significance, detail and validity as that in the markscheme then award the mark.
      Where this point is considered to be particularly relevant in a question it is emphasized by
      OWTTE (or words to that effect).

8.    Remember that many candidates are writing in a second language. Effective communication is
      more important than grammatical accuracy.

9.    Occasionally, a part of a question may require an answer that is required for subsequent
      marking points. If an error is made in the first marking point then it should be penalized. However, if
      the incorrect answer is used correctly in subsequent marking points then follow through marks
      should be awarded. When marking indicate this by adding ECF (error carried forward) on the script.

10.   Do not penalize candidates for errors in units or significant figures, unless it is specifically referred
      to in the markscheme.

                                          Section B
Extended response questions - quality of construction

      Extended response questions for HL P2 carry a mark total of [20]. Of these marks, [18] are
       awarded for content and [2] for the quality of construction of the answer.

      Two aspects are considered:
           expression of relevant ideas with clarity
           structure of the answers.

      [1] quality mark is to be awarded when the candidate satisfies EACH of the following criteria.
       Thus [2] quality marks are awarded when a candidate satisfies BOTH criteria.

     Clarity of expression:
        The candidate has made a serious and full attempt to answer all parts of the question and the
        answers are expressed clearly enough to be understood with little or no re-reading.

     Structure of answer:
        The candidate has linked relevant ideas to form a logical sequence within at least two parts of
        the same question (e.g. within part a and within part b, or within part a and within part c etc.
        but not between part a and part b or between part a and part c etc.).

      It is important to judge this on the overall answer, taking into account the answers to all parts
       of the question. Although, the part with the largest number of marks is likely to provide the
       most evidence.

      Candidates that score very highly on the content marks need not necessarily automatically
       gain [2] marks for the quality of construction (and vice versa). The important point is to be
       consistent in the awarding of the quality points.

      Indicate the award of quality marks by stamping Qcl or Qst or both in red at the end of the
       answer and enter a mark for each in the mark panel.

                  Do not allow answers with two different numbers.

     (b)   more stem cells are formed in control / jet lag reduces the release of stem cells into
           blood stream / greater range in control;
           graph is rhythmic in control / control has more regular pattern;
           greater number of stem cells produced in light period in control, whereas greater
           number in dark period in jet lag;
           graph is shifted to the right in jet lag / stem cells are released later in time in jet lag;   [2 max]

     (c)   (hypothesis supported in control) if stem cells are harvested towards the end
           of the dark period / (hypothesis supported) as stem cells start increasing in
           dark period;
           (hypothesis not supported) in control as peak of stem cells occurs during light
           period/lowest number during dark period;
           (hypothesis supported) if patient is jet-lagged as more stem cells are produced in
           dark period;                                                                                   [2 max]

     (e)   clenbuterol and isoprenaline both produce more stem cells than control;
           clenbuterol releases fewer stem cells than isoprenaline / isoprenaline releases the
           most stem cells;
           isoprenaline produces the least mRNA for CXCL12;
           clenbuterol produces the same amount of mRNA for CXCL12 as control;                            [3 max]

                  in the first 25 / up to 26/27/28 weeks;
                  CXCL12 inhibition does not prevent occurrence of diabetes (just delays it) /
                  eventually the same level of diabetes;                                                      [2]

           (ii)   CXCL12 breakdown allows stem cell mobilization reducing incidence
                  of diabetes / stem cells from the bone marrow can regenerate the islets
                  (in pancreas)                                                                               [1]

     (g)   isoprenaline is an inhibitor of CXCL12 / inhibits synthesis of CXCL12 mRNA;
           delays onset of diabetes / allows stem cell mobilization / allows islet regeneration;
           does not cure the disease;                                                                     [2 max]
