Figure 2    Fact file on the Gulf of Fonseca


   • A gulf is a large body of water usually surrounded on three sides by land; the Gulf of Fonseca is
     surrounded by El Salvador, Honduras, and Nicaragua.
   • The gulf covers an area of approximately 3200 km2 and has a coastline of 261 km.
   • The coastal ecosystem is dominated by various species of mangrove.  Mangroves are evergreen
     trees found in the inter-tidal zone in tropical and subtropical latitudes.
   • Bananas, coffee and beef are three of the main exports from the Gulf of Fonseca countries.
   • Shrimp farming is an important area of economic growth in the countries enclosing the Gulf of Fonseca.

Figure 3       The mangrove ecosystem


   • Mangrove trees are found in estuaries where fresh water enters the sea; they are therefore able to
     survive in varying levels of salinity and nutrient availability.
   • Mangrove trees have specialized aerial roots that are adapted to low oxygen concentration and
     varying water levels.
   • Mangrove ecosystems are important nursery grounds for fish and crustaceans (shrimp and crabs)
     e.g. Blue Striped Grunt and Mangrove Crab.
   • Mangrove ecosystems provide habitats for many creatures, including migratory and non-migratory
     birds e.g. Mangrove Warbler and Jabiru Stork.
   • Mangrove ecosystems provide important resources for local people in the form of wood, plant
     extracts, and subsistence harvesting of crabs and snails.
   • Removal of mangroves impacts on soil erosion rates and nutrient cycles affecting the shoreline,
     seagrass beds and coral reef.

Figure 8       Shrimp consumption and farming


   • 28 % of shrimp consumed worldwide are commercially farmed.
   • Most shrimp produced by commercial farms are Tiger Shrimp (Penaeus monodon).

   • In extensive shrimp farming, mangrove ecosystems are cleared to set up shrimp ponds.
   • The loss of 50 % of Ecuador’s mangrove ecosystems, and 33 % of those in Honduras are thought
     to be caused by extensive shrimp farming.
   • Extensive shrimp farming prevents local communities from accessing the coastline for subsistence
     activities.
   • Nursery grounds of marine aquatic species are also displaced by extensive shrimp farming.

Figure 9    Commercial shrimp farming techniques

                                   (a)      Semi-intensive shrimp farming




                         River                   Estuary
                                                                                   Ocean




               Shrimp Ponds =

   •   Located along the shore above the high tide line
   •   Sea water is pumped into constructed ponds using mechanized pumps
   •   Ponds are fertilized (nitrogen, phosphorus and silicate) to encourage a natural food chain
   •   Shrimp density is high because farmers increase production with manufactured shrimp feeds
   •   Yields range from 500 to 5000 kg ha–1.

                                      (b)     Extensive shrimp farming




                           River                  Estuary
                                                                                  Ocean




                 Shrimp Ponds =


   • Located along the shore below the high tide line
   • Sea water flows in naturally with the tides
   • Shrimp feed on naturally occurring organisms, which may be encouraged with organic or chemical
     fertilizer
   • Construction and operating costs are low
   • Yields range up to 500 kg ha–1.
