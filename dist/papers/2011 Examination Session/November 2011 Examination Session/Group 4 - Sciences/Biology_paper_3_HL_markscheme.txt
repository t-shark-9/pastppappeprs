Subject Details: Biology HL Paper 3 Markscheme
Mark Allocation

Candidates are required to answer questions from TWO of the Options [2 % 20 marks].
Maximum total = [40 marks]

1.    A markscheme often has more marking points than the total allows. This is intentional. Do not award
      more than the maximum marks allowed for part of a question.

2.    Each marking point has a separate line and the end is shown by means of a semicolon (;).

3.    An alternative answer or wording is indicated in the markscheme by a slash (/). Either wording can
      be accepted.

4.    Words in brackets ( ) in the markscheme are not necessary to gain the mark.

5.    Words that are underlined are essential for the mark.

6.    The order of marking points does not have to be as in the markscheme, unless stated otherwise.

7.    If the candidate’s answer has the same “meaning” or can be clearly interpreted as being of
      equivalent significance, detail and validity as that in the markscheme then award the mark.
      Where this point is considered to be particularly relevant in a question it is emphasized by
      OWTTE (or words to that effect).

8.    Remember that many candidates are writing in a second language. Effective communication is more
      important than grammatical accuracy.

9.    Occasionally, a part of a question may require an answer that is required for subsequent
      marking points. If an error is made in the first marking point then it should be penalized.
      However, if the incorrect answer is used correctly in subsequent marking points then follow through
      marks should be awarded. When marking indicate this by adding ECF (error carried forward) on
      the script.

10.   Do not penalize candidates for errors in units or significant figures, unless it is specifically referred
      to in the markscheme.

D3.   classification traditionally based on morphology;
      cladistics (strength) based on molecular differences/base sequences/amino acid sequences;
      cladistics (weakness) is based on probability but improbable events do occur, so
      relationships can be wrong;
      clade includes ancestral species/descendants from that species;
      members of clade share set of features not found in more distant relatives;
      cladogram is a tree-like diagram where nodes/branches represent the splitting of (two) new
      groups from a common ancestor;
      different cladograms can represent same relationships in a group;
      cladogram timescale not necessary;
      classification based on cladograms is often same as traditional classification;
      in some groups cladograms have led to revised classification;                              [6 max]

           Konza has greater increases than Kruger when a single (large) herbivore species/
           buffalo/bison is present;                                                           [2 max]
           Accept specific correct numerical comparison.

     (c)   single (large) herbivore species/buffalo/bison appears to be better for plant
           community due to higher abundance and diversity;
           although multiple herbivore species/buffalo/bison result in less non-grass
           abundance than single species, it is higher than when no herbivore species are
           present;
           the numbers of single and multiple herbivore species/buffalo/bison are not given
           (so not enough information);
           no multiple herbivore species/buffalo/bison in Konza/only Kruger (so not enough
           information);                                                                       [2 max]

G2. (a)    secondary succession as some plants/organic components were present before fire           [1]

     (b)   moderate rainfall, hot/warm summers and cold/cool winters and trees drop their
           leaves                                                                                    [1]
           To award [1] all three aspects are needed.

     (c)   describe method for ensuring random placement of quadrats in (do not accept
           a grid;                                                      transect)

           different species present in quadrat identified and counted;
           used to estimate species density/frequency/abundance/cover;                           [2 max]

     (d)   size:
           large nature reserves usually promote conservation better than small ones;
           large areas needed for far-ranging animals (e.g. grizzly bear);
           larger areas have proportionally smaller perimeters/less affected by edges;
           edge effect:
           ecology of edges of ecosystems is different from central areas due to edge effects;
           fragmentation (of forests) leads to increase in edges which will favour some
           species over others;
           habitat corridor:
           habitat/movement/wildlife corridors allow organisms to move between different
           parts of fragmented habitat;                                                          [3 max]
           To award [3] responses must refer to size, edge effect and habitat corridor.



G3. large areas of ocean under no government control therefore need for international
    agreement/legislation;
    fish stocks are a renewable resource if managed properly/should not be overexploited;
    total allowable catches/quotas to limit maximum catch;
    regulation of mesh sizes/selective fishing gear/limit size of fish caught/ban drift nets;

                  pinocytotic vesicles formed by endocytosis/uptake of fluid with products of

     (b)   bile contains bile salts (and pigments);
           bile salt molecules have both a hydrophilic and hydrophobic end;
           reduces size of fat/lipid globules / emulsifies fats;
           causes increase in total surface area so acted on more effectively by enzyme (lipase);   [2 max]

     (c)   trypsin is protein-digesting enzyme/protease;
           trypsinogen is inactive form produced by pancreas;

H3. receptors in hypothalamus detect decrease in blood solute potential/increase in blood
    concentration;
    occurs when excessive sweating/too little water intake/excessive salt intake;
    nerve impulses pass to posterior pituitary gland where ADH is released;
    ADH secreted by neurosecretory cells;
    ADH makes epithelium of convoluted tubule /collecting duct more permeable to water;
    water reabsorption results in more concentrated urine;
    when high intake of water/solute potential of blood increases/blood more dilute ADH
    release is inhibited;
    walls of convoluted tubule and collecting duct become less permeable to water;
    less water is reabsorbed creating dilute urine;
    is example of negative feedback;                                                                [6 max]
