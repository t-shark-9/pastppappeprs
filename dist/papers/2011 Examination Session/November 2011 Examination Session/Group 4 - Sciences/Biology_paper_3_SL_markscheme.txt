Subject Details: Biology SL Paper 3 Markscheme
Mark Allocation

Candidates are required to answer questions from TWO of the Options [2 % 18 marks].
Maximum total = [36 marks].

1.    A markscheme often has more marking points than the total allows. This is intentional. Do not award
      more than the maximum marks allowed for part of a question.

2.    Each marking point has a separate line and the end is shown by means of a semicolon (;).

3.    An alternative answer or wording is indicated in the markscheme by a slash (/). Either wording can
      be accepted.

4.    Words in brackets ( ) in the markscheme are not necessary to gain the mark.

5.    Words that are underlined are essential for the mark.

6.    The order of marking points does not have to be as in the markscheme, unless stated otherwise.

7.    If the candidate’s answer has the same “meaning” or can be clearly interpreted as being of
      equivalent significance, detail and validity as that in the markscheme then award the mark.
      Where this point is considered to be particularly relevant in a question it is emphasized by
      OWTTE (or words to that effect).

8.    Remember that many candidates are writing in a second language. Effective communication is
      more important than grammatical accuracy.

9.    Occasionally, a part of a question may require an answer that is required for subsequent
      marking points. If an error is made in the first marking point then it should be penalized.
      However, if the incorrect answer is used correctly in subsequent marking points then follow through
      marks should be awarded. When marking indicate this by adding ECF (error carried forward) on
      the script.

10.   Do not penalize candidates for errors in units or significant figures, unless it is specifically referred
      to in the markscheme.

          maximum (swimming) velocity is same (12 cm s–1) at all velocities (of water
          flow)/going with or against current;
          as velocity (of water flow) increases fewer larvae swim (accept correct numerical
          against current;                                        comparisons)
          at higher velocity (of water flow)/6.3 cm s–1 more larvae swim at faster net speeds;   [2 max]

    (d)   (data supports hypothesis as) some larvae able to swim against current at all
          (water flow) velocities;
          (data supports hypothesis) since few larvae have net velocity of 0 cm s–1 most of
          them are actively swimming /not just moving with the current;
          (data inconclusive) as more larvae swim along with the current at both velocities;     [2 max]

          vibrations of ear drum cause the bones of the middle ear/ossicles/malleus, incus
          and stapes/hammer, anvil and stirrup to move;
          lever system of middle ear bones increases pressure on the oval window;
          vibrations are transmitted from oval window through (fluid-filled) cochlea;
          stimulation of hair cells/mechanoreceptors in cochlea;

           (ii)   trend is similar but differences/values at Konza are always higher;
                  both show greater increase in non-grass abundance than grass abundance
                  when single (large) herbivore species/buffalo/bison present;
                  both have lower abundance when no (large) herbivore species/buffalo/ bison
                  present than when single (large) herbivore species/buffalo/bison present;    [1 max]

           (iii) grasses eaten by herbivore so increase less than non-grass abundance;
                 herbivores spread seeds of different species between locations;
                 herbivores change the habitat (e.g. by trampling/manure);
                 herbivores prevent woody plants from growing and maintain grassland;          [1 max]

     (b)   Konza always has higher species diversity than Kruger;
           both increase in species diversity when a single (large) herbivore species/
           buffalo/bison is present;
           Konza has greater increases than Kruger when a single (large) herbivore species/
           buffalo/bison is present;                                                           [2 max]
           Accept specific correct numerical comparison.

     (c)   single (large) herbivore species/buffalo/bison appears to be better for plant
           community due to higher abundance and diversity;
           although multiple herbivore species/buffalo/bison result in less non-grass
           abundance than single species, it is higher than when no herbivore species are
           present;
           the numbers of single and multiple herbivore species/buffalo/bison are not given
           (so not enough information);
           no multiple herbivore species/buffalo/bison in Konza/only Kruger (so not enough
           information);                                                                       [2 max]

     (c)   fundamental niche is the potential mode of existence and realized niche is the
           actual mode of existence;
           fundamental niche depends on the adaptation of a species;
           competition/predation prevents a species from occupying its entire fundamental
           niche;
           realized niche is usually smaller than fundamental niche;                           [2 max]

     (d)   organisms may fit into more than one trophic level;
           omnivores consume organisms from all levels of the food chain;
           there may be seasonal changes in trophic levels depending on food supply;
           some organisms alter diet with their life cycle (e.g. some amphibians);             [2 max]

          improved with alleles from wild plants;
          ecotourism improves local economy/potential source of income/encourages local
          conservation;
          interdependency of species may be disrupted / negative effects on food chains /
          native species adapted to local conditions whereas invasive species less likely to
          be in balance;
          rainforest trees act as a carbon sink which is beneficial for global warming;
          erosion/flooding/ silting of rivers occur with deforestation/removal of plants;
          human indigenous population’s ability to live sustainably within ecosystem might
          be affected / maintenance of rainforest preserves human cultural diversity;
          loss of beauty of the system / artists are inspired by the images/flowers/animals of
          rainforests;                                                                           [3 max]
