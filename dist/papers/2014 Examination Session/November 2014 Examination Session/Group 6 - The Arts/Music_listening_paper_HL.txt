      Prokofiev acknowledged that this symphony was inspired by Haydn (1732–1809). With

      model (form) of most classical symphonies of that time.                                       [20 marks]

      the movements of The Yellow River Piano Concerto has a programmatic title.
      Referring to the score, choose at least one movement and discuss the ways in which
      the music illustrates its title.                                                   [20 marks]
