Answer all questions.

9.    A customer buys an item in a small local shop and pays with a credit card. The sales transaction
      data is input to a computer at the point of sale. Prices are downloaded every morning from
      a central computer at the company headquarters.   The credit card is verified with the card
      authorization centre and then the receipt is printed.

      (a)   Draw and label a system flow chart to represent this process in the shop.                    [5]

      At the end of the day the sales transaction data is sent to the central computer at the
      company headquarters.

      (b)   Describe the processing that should be carried out at the company headquarters.              [2]

      All programs and data should be protected from theft, destruction, manipulation and alteration
      in this process.

            for a sales company.                                                                         [3]

10.   Three IB students are working on a programming project. They have 10 days to complete
      the work. To plan the project activities and timeline they produce the following Gantt chart.

      (a)   State two tasks students should perform to define a problem.                                [2]

      (b)   Identify two tools or techniques that students could use to represent algorithms.           [1]

      (c)   Discuss whether beta testing would be appropriate in this scenario.                         [3]

      (d)   Outline three criteria that could be used when deciding which programming language is
            to be used for coding.                                                                      [3]

      (e)   From the Gantt chart above

            (i)    identify two tasks that could be done concurrently;                                  [1]

            (ii)   identify two tasks that should be done sequentially.                                 [1]

11.   Consider the array NUMBERS.

                       NUMBERS

      (a)   (i)    Identify the consequence of attempting to output NUMBERS[6].                        [1]

            (ii)   Describe a method of preventing the problem in part (a)(i).                         [2]

      (b)   Construct the algorithm that will output the average of all values in the array NUMBERS.   [4]

      The method minPos() determines the index of the smallest value in an array.
      The method maxPos()determines the index of the largest value in an array. For example,
      NUMBERS.maxPos() is 3.

      Consider the following algorithm fragment.

      S=NUMBERS.minPos()
      L=NUMBERS.maxPos()
      T=NUMBERS[S]
      NUMBERS[S]=NUMBERS[L]
      NUMBERS[L]=T

            (ii)   Deduce the purpose of the algorithm.                                                [2]

      (d)   Construct the algorithm for the method maxPos().                                           [4]
