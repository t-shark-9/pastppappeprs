Answer one essay question only. You must base your answer on at least two of the Part 3 works you have
studied and compare and contrast these works in response to the question. Answers which are not based
on a discussion of at least two Part 3 works will not score high marks.

Drama

1.    Opposing motivations, such as selfishness versus generosity, are often used by playwrights.  In at least
      two plays you have studied, discuss the ways in which playwrights have used such driving forces to
      shape their material.


2.    A famous playwright based his theories on the notion that “human beings are infinitely perfectible,
      and always strive to do good.”  To what degree does your study of at least two plays lead you to
      believe that such a notion governs their plays?


3.    The turning point of a play may sometimes arise from various unexpected causes, such as mistakes,
      misunderstandings or accidents.  Consider the presentation and impact of such turning points in at
      least two plays you have studied.



Poetry

4.    “Poetry is invented chiefly for the pleasure of both the poet and the reader.”  Using the work of at
      least two poets you have studied, show in a detailed way how your reading leads you to respond to
      this proposal.


5.    Elegiac poetry, in which things remembered or lost are evoked by the poet, is often deeply moving.  
      Discuss the way at least two poets you have studied have represented such experiences and with
      what effect.


6.    The title of a poem almost always offers the audience something significant to their reading and
      understanding.  In the work of at least two poets you have studied, show how titles have affected your
      interpretations of the poems.

Prose: novel and short story

7.    In order to broaden the time span covered by the narrative, writers often include such techniques as
      flashback and/or foreshadowing.  In the works of at least two writers you have studied, show how
      writers have used one or both of these techniques effectively.


8.    A writer may at times seek to mislead a reader about the true nature of characters or situations.  
      With reference to the works of at least two writers you have studied, consider how and to what effect
      they have made good use of such ambiguities.


9.    Characters who violate social norms are often elements used to generate suspense in novels or
      short stories.  In the works of at least two writers you have studied, consider the roles played by such
      characters in generating suspense.



Prose other than fiction

10.   In works of prose other than fiction, portraits of individual people can be used for interest and
      entertainment.  In the works of at least two writers you have studied, discuss the use of such portrayals
      to enhance their works.  


11.   Writers of prose other than fiction often include what appear to be digressions from the ongoing line
      of thought or argument.  In the works of at least two writers you have studied, examine how such
      digressions have been used and to what effect.


12.   In some works of prose other than fiction the writer seems to let the reader know of personal flaws
      and mistakes.  In the works of at least two writers you have studied, examine the appearance and the
      effect of such personal revelations on your response to the work.
