TEXT A



                                        i s taking           off
                       an’s c a r e e r
            A wom

       Meet Isabelle de Montet-Guerin, the ﬁrst British female test pilot at Airbus.

       What inspired you to become a test pilot?
       I grew up with ﬂying. My Dad was in the Royal Air Force and he always encouraged my interest.
       After he died, I had my ﬁrst ﬂying lesson. I was 12 at the time, and I did it as a tribute to him.
 5     After this ﬁrst lesson, I was determined to become a pilot.

       One obstacle early on was the cost of the training. My mum said: “Fine, if you want the licence
       you’re going to have to pay for it yourself because I just can’t aﬀord it”. So I started washing
       cars and doing all sorts of odd-jobs to raise the money, and eventually I managed to secure two
       scholarships from the Air Force to make my dream come true.

10     What is your working day like?
       My working day begins around 7 am with a “rejected
       take-oﬀ ”, which is like driving your car at a speed of
       115 mph to make sure the brakes work. After that
       we may ﬂy up to twice a day. If we’re conducting
15     a “ﬁrst ﬂight proﬁle”, which is the very ﬁrst time a
       new aeroplane takes oﬀ, every system needs to be
       tested very thoroughly. The crew can consist of up to
       11 people if we are testing the Airbus A380.
       When we’re testing the A320, there are four of us,
20     two of whom are pilots. We ﬁnish around 7 pm each day.

       How did your career progress?
       I’ve been with Airbus for 18 months now. When I started I was based in Toulouse in France,
       and then I moved to Hamburg in Germany. Previously, I had spent 10 years with British Airways,
       and just under two years with a company called Cobham FRA before that.

25     Are there any disadvantages to being a test pilot?
       For someone thinking about this career, I would caution them that it is very hard to have a
       social life. We work long and irregular hours. But, personally, I love my job and would never want
       to do anything else. Even when I was at test pilot school and worked six days a week, 16 hours a
       day, the only thing I can remember from that time was how happy I was. I had to work extremely
30     hard during the entire training, but the rewards at the end of it are really worth it.

                                                                 Extract: ©Telegraph Media Group

                                                                       Photo removed for copyright
       Don't be an online store sample                                          reasons




       Let’s face it: social media stalking has pretty much become normal.

       One simply needs a few spare minutes, a mild curiosity, and a reasonable excuse to browse
       through someone’s photos, favourite quotations, and personal info. In less than two minutes
       one can know all about what Sally Somebody has been doing in the last six months.

 5     This topic is the beginning of a lecture we’ve all heard before from our parents and teachers.
       It’s the one about “privacy” and “real friends” and “wasting time”. Do they understand what it’s
       like to be a kid growing up in the 21st century? How could they possibly realize the popularity
       and love that lie waiting at the ﬁngertips of a social media user?

       They don’t get that we young people need to post pictures of ourselves in the bathroom mirror
10     pursing our lips, or showing off our muscles to friends. They don’t understand that if we go too
       long without writing a status update, we’ll become irrelevant and fade into obscurity.

       We post attractive pictures of ourselves as if we’re preparing a TV commercial. “Look at me,”
       we cry out inside, “I’m worth it. Don’t you think I’m worth it?”

       Unfortunately, using social networking as a way to feel valued can’t give us what we want.
15     By laying ourselves bare (literally and otherwise), we give others a substitute for the real us.

       It’s like free samples in stores; people take those and eat them because they’re free,
       and they’re there. If our pictures are there, people will look; not necessarily because they
       care, but because they’re bored and it’s entertaining to peek into someone else’s life.
       We look, judge, and move on.

20     We young people are SO much more than an album of photos, and a collection of statuses.
       We are worth more than 50 “likes” or 20 comments. When we give away pieces of ourselves
       online, we just look needy. I think anyone of us who can uphold some mystery and be secure
       without frequent peer approval has depth and conﬁdence. But I guess this is all just a part of
       growing up in the 21st century.

                                                           Anna Toth, www.richmond-news.com (2012)

            Is it worth the risk?
            Energy consumption is rising and so countries try to find new methods to become
            more independent, using their own resources. Some countries already use fracking to
            extract natural gas, many others are exploring this method.

            Fracking is the process of extracting natural gas
 5          from shale rock layers deep within the earth. It
            makes it possible to extract natural gas from
            shale rocks that were once unreachable with
            conventional technologies.

            It is a relatively new method of gas exploration
10          and raises many environmental questions
            worldwide.        Piers Verstegen, the director
            of the Conservation Council of Western
            Australia says: “Fracking cannot occur without causing massive and irreversible
            environmental damage.” Mr Verstegen claims it has devastated large areas and
15          poisoned communities in the United States and says: “After seeing this, I vowed I
            would do whatever I could to stop this happening in Western Australia.”

            Michael Lynch, of Forbes Magazine, in an article on how the Australian government
            tries to deal with public concerns over the use of fracking, reports: “As in the US and
            elsewhere, it has been a contentious practice, with serious questions being raised
20          about the possible contamination of groundwater. Many have urged that the practice
            be banned as a precaution to eliminate any possibility of pollution.”

            He continues: “The Australian authorities have  [ – X – ]  to satisfy the public that the
            risk can be minimized. This has been  [ – 28 – ] , in part, by listening carefully to their
            concerns, rather than dismissing their worries as uninformed. Although comments at
25          a meeting I  [ – 29 – ]  suggested that this had not been completely successful, it does
            seem to have  [ – 30 – ]  to ease fears.”

            A major obstacle in Australia to public acceptance of any mineral exploitation is
            the government ownership of all mineral rights, meaning that the payments and
            other benefits which the landowners receive are limited to the small amounts that
30          drillers offer. Not surprisingly, those whose land is used for gas production are less
            than thrilled at the disruption to their lives, which doesn’t provide them with significant
            benefits.

            Is fracking worth the risk? At this point, the jury is still out.

       Doctors
       Without
       Borders
      Every day, we hear in the news of people suffering in war zones, being devastated by
       natural disasters and outbreaks of infectious diseases. Help from other countries is often
       difficult and stopped at borders for many reasons.

      In these situations, the organization “Doctors Without
       Borders” is essential. Doctors and journalists in
       France originally created this international medical
       humanitarian organization in 1971. It is often referred
       to as MSF after the French name “Médecins Sans
       Frontières”. Today, it includes organizations from
       19 countries around the world.

      MSF provides independent, impartial assistance in more than 60 countries to people
       whose survival is threatened by violence, neglect, or catastrophe. These are primarily due
       to armed conflict, epidemics, malnutrition, exclusion from health care, or natural disasters.

      The organization aims first and foremost to provide high-quality medical care to the people
       who need it the most. It does not promote the agenda of any country, political party,
       or religious faith.

      At its core, the purpose of humanitarian action is to save the lives and ease the suffering
       of people caught in acute crises, thereby restoring their ability to rebuild their lives and
       communities.

      On any given day, more than 27 000 committed individuals, representing dozens of
       nationalities, can be found providing assistance to people around the world. They are
       doctors, nurses, epidemiologists, laboratory technicians, mental health professionals,
       and others working together.

      “Doctors Without Borders” staff are supported by their colleagues in offices around
       the world. The vast majority of aid workers are from the communities where the crises
       are occurring although ten percent of each team are international staff.

                                                                 www.doctorswithoutborders.org (2014)
