General notes:
• The following are to be considered suggestions rather than prescriptions, that is, all points made by
  candidates to be marked on their merits.
• Any attempt to answer should be acknowledged as such; that should be followed especially in
  translation, when some candidates depart from literal in favour of a more poetic rendition, faithful,
  of course, to the original idea.
• The second use of the same figure of speech to answer a style question should be penalized, by not
  being taken into account: for example, double mention of alliteration.
• When Latin quotations are required, award no mark if the candidate fails to provide them.


Elegiac and Lyric poetry

1.   (a)   Mark only for length of syllables. Award [1 mark] per line if all correct; no mark otherwise.

     (b)   Award [1 mark] up to three for each example supported by quotations from the Latin text.
           Examples may include:
           • hopelessness, sense of desertion: nulla fugae ratio; nulla spes; omnia muta; omnia deserta
           • exhaustion, weariness: languescent; a fesso corpore
           • desire for justice/revenge: prodita; fidem
           • derangement: inops; ardens; amenti caeca furore.

     (c)   Award [1 mark] for any correct answer connecting the Eumenides (lit. “the well-disposed
           ones” or similar) with the Furies or Erinyes, avengers of crimes, in particular the breaking
           of oaths. Ariadne is asking for vengeance for being abandoned by Theseus [1 mark].

     (d)   Award [3 marks] for a correct answer, or for an answer with no more than one minor error
           (tense, number, etc); [2 marks] for answers with two or three minor errors or one major error;
           [1 mark] for answers with two major errors (or the equivalent). Otherwise, award no mark.
                                                                                             [10 marks]
                                                  –4–               N14/2/LATIN/HP2/ENG/TZ0/XX/M


2.   (a)   The Scythians are (nomadic) populations of northern Europe and Asia [1 mark]; the Getans
           are a (Thracian) tribe on the Danube [1 mark].

     (b)   Award [1 mark] each up to two for answers such as: their lands are not measured (inmetata),
           so they are common property or they are vast; and produce “free” crops (liberas fruges, with
           any appropriate remark or interpretation); cultivation of the same field does not last more than
           one year; when a person is exhausted their place is taken by another one or when the field
           is exhausted, another field is cultivated in its place.

     (c)   Horace touches various themes such as living a simple natural life or following a moral code
           in private as well as social life. Award [1 mark] each up to six for examples of how his views
           are supported by his poetic style. Examples may include:
           • symmetric structure of first four couplets with juxtaposition of material riches and
              ineluctability of death
           • also caementis versus adamantinos clavos
           • hyperbole omne terrenum et mare publicum
           • personification of diras Necessitas
           • remote, exotic people: Arabum, Indiae, Scythae, Getae
           • (metalepsis) rigidi Getae (= Getae qui in rigidis locis vivunt)
           • juxtaposition of exploitation of land (tuis caementis) and “natural life” (inmetata iugera,
              liberas fruges, etc)
           • juxtaposition of immoral and moral life, introduced by melius and illic, etc
           • in detail: mulier innocens and dotata coniunx
           • insistence on traditional virtues: virtus, castitas versus peccare.

           Award up to two marks for the coherence and clarity of the argument; ([2 marks] if very
           coherent and well-argued; [1 mark] if coherent and well-argued; no marks if incoherent and
           poorly argued or if no details from the text are given).
                                                                                           [12 marks]
                                                     –5–               N14/2/LATIN/HP2/ENG/TZ0/XX/M


Epic

3.     (a)   Award [1 mark] each up to three for accurate answers supported by examples such as:
             • Dido should not consume her youth in mourning: solane perpetua maerens carpere iuventa
             • she should enjoy the sweetness of love and having children: nec dulcis natos, Veneris nec
               praemia noris
             • the dead do not care for this: id cinerem aut Manis credis curare sepultos
             • she should not refuse a dear love: placitone etiam pugnabis amori
             • she is surrounded by hostile people: quorum consederis arvis, etc
             • this is the gods’ design: dis equidem auspicibus, etc
             • a future of glory is awaiting Dido’s people: quam tu urbem, etc.

       (b)   Mark only for length of syllables. Award [1 mark] per line if all correct; no mark otherwise.

       (c)   The following two points should be highlighted: Dido’s brother Pygmalion became king of
             Tyre [1 mark] after killing her husband Sychaeus out of greed [1 mark]. Other answers to be
             marked on their merits.

       (d)   Award [3 marks] for a correct answer, or for an answer with no more than one minor error
             (tense, number, etc); [2 marks] for answers with two or three minor errors or one major error;

4.     (a)   Award [1 mark] each up to two for any correct detail referring to Dido’s reception of the
             Trojans such as their being stranded, Dido’s invitation to settle there or her offer of help, her
             infatuation with Aeneas, etc.
       (b)   Laomedon, king of Troy [1 mark]; taken here as a symbol of perjury (for his refusal to fulfill
             the promise made to Poseidon and Apollo) [1 mark].
       (c)   The passage is built on the contrast between the quiet of the night and the restlessness of Dido
             with the different options, none of which are feasible except death, that come to her mind.
             Award [1 mark] each up to six for examples such as:
             • nocturnal setting, with various implications (quiet, solitude, etc) stressed by nox at the
                beginning of verse
             • lexicon denotating quiet: placidum, soporem, quierant
             • frequent alliterations to stress emotionally intense passages: silvaeque et saeva (the latter in
                enjambement with aequora); pecudes pictaeque; lacus late liquidos, etc
             • figures of repetition (anaphora): quaeque … quaeque
             • or assonance: rursusque resurgens
             • insistence on rursus to indicate a choice that can no longer be made after having already
                been rejected: see also procos priores; totiens iam dedignata
             • contrast between the night’s quiet and Dido’s anguish, abruptly introduced by at
             • she cannot find physical nor spiritual quiet: oculisve aut pectore noctem accipit
             • abrupt resolution, stressed by the use of the imperative: quin morere … ferroque averte
                dolorem.

             Award up to [2 marks] for the coherence and clarity of the argument; ([2 marks] if very
             coherent and well-argued; [1 mark] if coherent and well-argued; no marks if incoherent and
             poorly argued or if no details from the text are given).
                                                                                             [12 marks]
                                                  –6–               N14/2/LATIN/HP2/ENG/TZ0/XX/M


Historiography

5.   (a)   Performing songs (ludicrae artes) [1 mark] and writing poetry (carminum studium) [1 mark].

     (b)   Philosophers, representatives, etc of the philosophical sects (or similar) [1 mark]; they are
           required by their own doctrines to despise vices and sensual pleasure (or similar); and/or but
           behave in this way because of hypocrisy [1 mark].

     (c)   Answers should focus on the significant aspects, awarding [1 mark] each up to three for any
           of the following points: the number of fatalities; the case being examined in Rome/by the
           Senate/by the highest authorities; the gravity of the sanctions imposed.

     (d)   Award [3 marks] for a correct answer, or for an answer with no more than one minor error
           (tense, number, etc); [2 marks] for answers with two or three minor errors or one major error;
           [1 mark] for answers with two major errors (or the equivalent). Otherwise, award no mark.

6.   (a)   Award [1 mark] for each up to two for details correctly referring to the situation described in

           fashion, etc.

     (b)   Pantomimes or ballet-dancers (without words) [1 mark]; they are not allowed to take part in
           the sacred contests [1 mark].

     (c)   The extract presents a long list of specious arguments aimed at “screening this licence under
           respectable names”, whereas in the last lines the historian’s perspective emerges through a
           marked change in syntax. Award [1 mark] each up to six for examples such as:
           • the hypocrisy of the arguments is attributed to the pluribus: the multitude, the majority
           • juxtaposition of ipsa licentia and honesta nomina, underlined by the adversative tamen
           • the indirect speech (oratio obliqua) clearly refers these as somebody else’s opinions:
              abhorruisse, accitos, editos, etc
           • the juxtaposition (with assonance): laetitiae magis quam lasciviae may refer to implicit or
              explicit critics of the turn things had taken
           • the specious arguments appealing to traditional Roman values of the maiores such as
              parsimonia (opposed to sumptus)
           • the historian’s perspective is clearly introduced by the adverb sane
           • and is in the indicative mood: transiit, exarsere, etc.

           Award up to [2 marks] for the coherence and clarity of the argument; ([2 marks] if very
           coherent and well-argued; [1 mark] if coherent and well-argued; no marks if incoherent and
           poorly argued or if no details from the text are given).
                                                                                           [12 marks]
                                                  –7–                N14/2/LATIN/HP2/ENG/TZ0/XX/M


Letters

           (tense, number, etc); [2 marks] for answers with two or three minor errors or one major error;
           [1 mark] for answers with two major errors (or the equivalent). Otherwise, award no mark.

     (b)   Claudius joins the recital suddenly (subitum) while Pliny’s contemporaries take their time
           [1 mark]; he is unexpected (inopitatum) while they have to be reminded well in advance and
           pushed (rogatus et identidem admonitus) [1 mark]. Accept references to the fact that
           Claudius found out by chance, whereas Pliny’s contemporaries are invited explicitly.

     (c)   Award [1 mark] each up to two for any reason such as: the abundance of recitals (nullus fere
           dies); the delight Pliny takes in such recitals (iuvat me); the readers being mostly his personal
           friends (erant sane plerique amici).

     (d)   Pliny does not want to give the impression (ne videar) [1 mark] of attending others’ lectures
           [1 mark] just to make them attend his owns in return [1 mark].
                                                                                            [10 marks]


8.   (a)   legatus (ambassador) [1 mark] to the province af Achaea (Greece) [1 mark].

     (b)   Award [1 mark] each up to two for any detail such as: he must keep up with the reputation he
           earned as quaestor in Bithynia; with the tribute he had been paid by the emperor; with having
           been given this position almost as a reward; with having already been put to the test; and with
           having one’s reputation ruined being worse than not gaining it.

     (c)   This letter is intended as a piece of advice to a friend who is going to take up administrative
           responsibilities in Achaia. As an exhortation, it makes use of vivid language supported by
           numerous figures of speech. Award [1 mark] each up to six for examples such as:
           • repetition (polyptoton): contemnitur … contemptum … contemnit; tui … tibi; tibi … tecum
              … te … tuae
           • rhetorical questions: an contemnitur?
           • asyndeton: qui imperium qui fasces habet
           • anaphora (repetition): male … male; quid … quid; onerat … onerat; ne … ne
           • juxtapositions: valentior amor … quam timor; timor abit … manet amor (with chiasmus);
              ille in odium hic in reverentiam (with asyndeton); ordinatione civilius … libertate
              pretiosius; ordinatio eversione, libertas servitute
           • tricolon: tribunatus, praetura … legatio

           Award up to [2 marks] for the coherence and clarity of the argument; ([2 marks] if very
           coherent and well-argued; [1 mark] if coherent and well-argued; no marks if incoherent and
           poorly argued or if no details from the text are given).
                                                                                           [12 marks]

Philosophy

9.    (a)    A wide range of answers can be given, but they should include the following: the argument is
             about the mortality of the soul [1 mark]; the soul is affected by the alterations of the body
             (example of wine might be given) [1 mark]; illnesses (such as epilepsy) affect both body and
             soul (and therefore are a proof of its mortality) [1 mark]. Do not accept generic mentions
             (ie without any specific reference) of Lucretius’s Epicureanism and atomistic theory.

      (b)    Award [3 marks] for a correct answer, or for an answer with no more than one minor error
             (tense, number, etc); [2 marks] for answers with two or three minor errors or one major error;
             [1 mark] for answers with two major errors (or the equivalent). Otherwise, award no mark.

      (c)    The violence of the disease agitates the soul [1 mark] as the waves boil up because of the
             strength of the winds [1 mark].

      (d)    The presence of a sharp (acer) [1 mark] humour/fluid (umor) [1 mark].
                                                                                                [10 marks]


10.   (a)    Accept any accurate remark, but answers should substantially highlight that: the gods exist
             [1 mark]; but they do not get involved with us [1 mark].

      (b)    Mark only for length of syllables. Award [1 mark] per line if all correct; no mark otherwise.

      (c)    The passage describes the bright abodes of the gods, opposed to the opacity of the
             representations of the Underworld. Award [1 mark] each up to six for any correct reference
             to the poetic features of the composition, which include elements such as:
             • vocabulary of vision: apparet (at beginning of verse) divum numen; contrasted with
                 apparent Acherusia templa; dispiciantur
             • visual juxtapositions: nubila … innubilus aether
             • visual characterisation of the snow as cana (in alliteration with cadens)
             • luminosity of sky: large diffuso lumine ridet
             • the earth as visual obstacle to the contemplation of truth: nec tellus obstat
             • truth is “uncovered”: manifesta patens … retecta est; natura claranda
             • fear of death characterised by opacity: suffundens mortis nigrore
             • other figures of speech such as alliteration, repetition, etc.
                                                                                              [12 marks]
