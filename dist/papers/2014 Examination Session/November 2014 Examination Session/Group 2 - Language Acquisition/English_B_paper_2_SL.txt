Complete one of the following tasks. Write 250 to 400 words.

1.    Cultural diversity

      You and your friends recently discussed how what the younger generation believes is important in
      life is different from what the older generation believes is important. You feel your ideas are of
      general interest. As the junior reporter for the local newspaper, write an article describing some of
      these differences and why they might exist.


2.    Customs and traditions

      Some people regard fashion as an expression of the individual, while others see it as conforming to
      a group. Your teacher has set as your next essay topic: “Is teen fashion just another type of uniform?”.
      Write your essay.


3.    Health

      Your local council recently decided to start actively supporting young people who would like to
      stop smoking. You have been set the task of writing a pamphlet which will include information on
      the dangers of smoking and tips on how to give up this habit. Write the pamphlet.


4.    Leisure

      Your local government has proposed to cut financial support to the only theatre in your town.
      The public is asked for feedback in a public hearing. You decide to go to this hearing to speak in
      support of ongoing government funding. Write the text for your speech.


5.    Science and technology

      You recently heard a news report that all scientific experiments in school laboratories might be
      replaced by virtual experiments. You decide to write a blog entry reflecting on how this might
      change your science classes and whether or not you think this would be a good development.
      Write the blog entry.
