These sources and questions relate to the last years of the British Mandate of Palestine (1945–1948).

SOURCE A                Winston Churchill, leader of the Conservative Party, which was at that time the
                        opposition party in the British Parliament, in a speech to the House of Commons
                        (January 1947).

This is a lamentable situation … it is one of the most unhappy, unpleasant situations into which we have got,
even in these troublous [troublesome] years. Here, we are expending hard earned money at an enormous
rate in Palestine. Everyone knows what our financial difficulties are – how heavy the weight of taxation.
We are spending a vast sum of money on this business. For 18 months we have been pouring out our wealth
on this unhappy, unfortunate business. Then there is the manpower of at least 100,000 men in Palestine,
who might well be at home strengthening our depleted [weakened] industry. What are they doing there?
What good are we getting out of it? We are told that there are a handful of terrorists on one side and
100,000 British troops on the other. How much does it cost? No doubt it is £300 a year per soldier in
Palestine. That is £30 million a year. It may be much more – between £30 million and £40 million a
year – which is being poured out and which would do much to help to find employment in these islands.
One hundred thousand men is a very definite proportion of our Army. How much longer are they to stay
there? And stay for what?

SOURCE B    Leslie Illingworth, a political cartoonist, addresses the issue of Britain leaving
            Palestine in the cartoon “Nurse Gives Notice” from the British satirical magazine,
            Punch (1948).

SOURCE C                      Moshe Dayan, an Israeli military leader and politician, writing in his autobiography,
                              Story of My Life (1976).

On 29 November 1947, when news came through of the United Nations Partition Resolution, I was
in Nahalal*. It was night time. I took the children from their beds and we joined the rest of the village in
festive dancing in the community hall … I felt in my bones the victory of Judaism, which for two thousand
years of exile from the Land of Israel had withstood persecutions, the Spanish Inquisition, pogroms,
anti-Jewish decrees, restrictions and the mass slaughter by the Nazis in our own generation … We were
happy that night and we danced, and our hearts went out to every nation whose United Nations representative
had voted in favour of the resolution.

* Nahalal: Jewish settlement in what was still Palestine in 1947


SOURCE D                      Noah Lucas, a professor of History and a Jewish supporter of Zionism, writing in
                              an academic book, The Modern History of Israel (1975).

Arab and Zionist diplomacy now concentrated on the United Nations as the General Assembly prepared
to meet in mid-September 1947 to decide Palestine’s future … Zionist political pressure within America
in conjunction with Soviet determination to hasten the collapse of the British position in the Middle East
brought a momentary coming together of US and Russian policy in support of the partition of Palestine.
Diplomatic competition between the Zionist and the Arab supporters concentrated on persuading the
representatives of the small powers, especially those of Latin America. In view of the dependence of
many of these upon the United States the advantage lay with the Zionists … Therefore, when the issue
was brought to the vote in the United Nations Assembly on 29 November 1947 the Zionists secured the
necessary two-thirds majority in favour of partition …

There is no denying the importance of this United Nations decision as a factor in the creation of Israel as an
independent state, nor the importance of Zionist diplomacy in achieving this decision.


SOURCE E                      Mark Tessler, a professor of Political Science, writing in an academic history
                              book, A History of the Israeli–Palestinian Conflict (1994).

[The Arabs believed] that Palestine was an integral part of the Arab world and that from the beginning
its indigenous [local] inhabitants had opposed the creation in their country of a Jewish national home.
They also insisted that the United Nations, a body created and controlled by the United States and Europe,
had no right to grant the Zionists any portion of their territory. In what was to become a familiar Arab
charge they insisted that the Western world was seeking to salve [soothe] its conscience for the atrocities of
war and was paying its own debt to the Jewish people with someone else’s land.

1.        (a)        What, according to Source A, is the opinion expressed by Winston Churchill about
                     Britain’s presence in Palestine?                                                 [3 marks]

          (b)        What is the message conveyed by Source B?                                                                                                                    [2 marks]


2.        Compare and contrast the views expressed in Sources C and E about the UN General
          Assembly’s approval, in November 1947, of the partition of Palestine into two states. [6 marks]


3.        With reference to their origin and purpose, assess the value and limitations of Source A
          and Source D for historians studying the factors that led to the establishment of the state
          of Israel.                                                                                  [6 marks]


4.        Using the sources and your own knowledge, to what extent do you agree that Britain’s
          financial and economic weakness after the Second World War was the main reason for the
          establishment of the state of Israel in 1948?                                          [8 marks]
