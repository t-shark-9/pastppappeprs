Notes for examiners:

1. Whenever relevant, carry over marks must be awarded. If a candidate makes an error in calculation,
   but then uses the incorrect figure appropriately and accurately in later question parts,
   then the candidate may be fully rewarded. This is the “own-figure rule” and you should put OFR on
   the script where you are rewarding this. To do this you will need to use the on-page comment
   annotation tool (   ).

2. Alternative approaches may be taken in responses to the [4 mark] questions that use A02 command
   terms. If this is the case and the alternative approaches are valid, then full credit should be given.


1.   (a)   From the data provided, calculate

           (i)    the opportunity cost of producing each kilogram of wheat in
                  Country A;                                                                          [1]

           (ii)   the opportunity cost of producing each kilogram of rice in Country A;               [1]

                  100/80 = 1.25 kg wheat                                                              [1]
                  An answer of 1.25 kg wheat (without workings) is sufficient for [1 mark].

                 Country B;                                                                           [1]

           (iv) the opportunity cost of producing each kilogram of rice in Country B.                 [1]

                  200/100 = 2.0 kg wheat                                                              [1]
                  An answer of 2.0 kg wheat (without workings) is sufficient for [1 mark].

     (b)   From your answers to part (a), identify which country holds a comparative
           advantage

           (i)    in wheat;                                                                           [1]

           (ii)   in rice.                                                                            [1]

(d)   With reference to the diagram in part (c) and/or the data given, explain the
      theory of comparative advantage.                                                         [4]

       1     The written response is limited.                                                 1–2
             For the idea that a country has a comparative advantage in the production of
             a product for which it has the lower opportunity cost.

       2     The written response is clear.                                                   3–4
             For a clear explanation that the theory states a country should specialise in
             the production of those goods which can be produced at a lower opportunity
             cost. The data show that Country B has the comparative advantage in
             wheat, as its opportunity cost is lower (0.5 kg rice) than in Country A
             (0.8 kg rice), so Country B should specialise in the production of wheat and
             Country A has the comparative advantage in rice.

      A response which explains that Country B should specialize in wheat as its PPC is
      flatter than that of Country A should be fully rewarded.

      Candidates who do not refer to specialization may be awarded a maximum of
      [3 marks].

      A candidate who does not refer to the data and/or the diagram may be awarded a
      maximum of [2 marks].

      An answer of $600 000 is sufficient for [1 mark].

           manner may be awarded [1 mark].

      2    The written response is clear.                                               3–4

           A candidate who explains one disadvantage clearly and a second
           disadvantage is merely stated or expressed in a vague manner may be
           awarded [3 marks].

      Disadvantages may include:
       A subsidy must be financed by government spending ($600 000 in this case).
        There will thus be an opportunity cost involved.
       A subsidy to domestic firms may be seen as protection. This may give rise to
        retaliation from trading partners.
       A subsidy will distort the pattern of trade, allowing domestic producers to
        survive in the face of more efficient foreign competition. Thus gains from
        comparative advantage will be lost, leading to reduced efficiency.
       A subsidy to domestic firms may be seen as protection. This may give rise to
        sanctions from the World Trade Organization.

      Any other reasonable response which uses the response(s) to part (e).

           of the one and the quantity of the other move in opposite directions.

(g)   Good J and Good K are both produced in Zestria. The price elasticity of

           A candidate who explains one reason clearly and a second reason in a vague
           manner may be awarded [3 marks].

      Reasons may include:
       There tend to be fewer substitutes for primary products. Hence demand would
        be relatively price inelastic. However, manufactured products tend to have
        elastic demand because there are likely to be more substitutes owing to the
        greater opportunity for product differentiation.
       Spending on manufactured goods tends to represent a considerable part of
        consumer income. As a result, demand would be relatively price elastic.
        However, spending on primary commodities is likely to take a smaller
        proportion of consumer income. As a result, demand would be relatively price
        inelastic.
       Primary commodities are often necessities and hence demand would be price
        inelastic. However, manufactured goods are more likely to be luxuries – so
        demand would be more price elastic.

      Any reasonable response.

                  For a response which demonstrates clear understanding that the difference
                  between GDP and GNI is that GDP is a measure of the value of output
                  produced within the boundaries of an economy independently of the
                  nationality of the factors of production involved whereas GNI is a measure
                  of incomes received by the residents of a country independently of the
                  geographic location of the factors of production involved.

                  Green GDP focuses on the environmental cost of production by subtracting
                  the costs of environmental degradation from GDP.

                  Responses that clearly define GDP and then explain that GNI is GDP plus
                  incomes earned/received from abroad minus incomes paid/sent abroad
                  should be considered an accurate distinction of these two terms.

(c)   (i)    Using the data in Table 2 calculate the level of real GDP for Country X
             for 2014 to 2016. Enter your results in Table 2.                                       [3]

             Allocate [1 mark] for each correctly completed cell.                            [3 x 1]

      (ii)   Outline the difference between nominal GDP and real GDP.                               [2]

                   nominal GDP for changes in the average price level (for inflation).

(d)   Calculate the annual real growth rate for Country X for 2015 and 2016.
      Enter your results in Table 2.                                                                [2]

(f)   Identify which of the three letters (A, B or C) on the following business cycle
      diagram best describes the position of Country X in 2016.                            [1]

(g)   Explain two reasons why real GDP per capita may not be an accurate
      measure of living standards in Country X.                                            [4]

            For any two reasons expressed in a vague manner OR one reason explained
            clearly.

            A candidate who explains one reason in a vague manner may be
            awarded [1 mark].

            A candidate who explains one reason clearly and a second reason in a vague
            manner may be awarded [3 marks].

      Reasons which may be explained include:
       it ignores distributional issues as it is merely an average
       no consideration of environmental degradation
       no information provided on the composition of output
       the figures do not include the value of leisure
       no consideration of non-marketed output (eg parallel economy, DIY,
        subsistence farming).

      Any other valid reason should be rewarded.
