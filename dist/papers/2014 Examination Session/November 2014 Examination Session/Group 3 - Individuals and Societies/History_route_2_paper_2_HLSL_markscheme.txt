Paper 2 markbands: The following bands provide a précis of the full markbands for paper 2 published in
the History guide (2008) on pages 71–74. They are intended to assist marking but must be used in
conjunction with the full markbands found in the guide. For the attention of all examiners: if you are
uncertain about the content/accuracy of a candidate’s work please contact your team leader.

 16–20: Answers are clearly structured and focused, have full awareness of the demands of the
        question, and, if appropriate, may challenge it. Detailed specific knowledge is used as
        evidence to support assertions and arguments. Historical processes such as comparison and
        contrast, placing events in context and evaluating different interpretations are used
        appropriately and effectively.
 13–15: Answers are clearly focused on the demands of the question. Specific knowledge is applied as
        evidence, and analysis or critical commentary are used appropriately to produce a specific
        argument. Events are placed in context and there is sound understanding of historical
        processes and comparison and contrast. Evaluation of different approaches may be used to
        substantiate arguments presented.
 10–12: Answers indicate that the question is understood but not all implications considered.
        Knowledge is largely accurate. Critical commentary may be present. Events are generally
        placed in context and understanding of historical processes, such as comparison and contrast
        are present. There may be awareness of different approaches and interpretations but they are
        not based on relevant historical knowledge. There is a clear attempt at a structured approach.
 8–9:   The demands of the question are generally understood. Historical knowledge is present but is
        not fully or accurately detailed. Knowledge is narrative or descriptive in nature. There may
        be limited argument that requires further substantiation. Critical commentary may be present.
        There is an attempt to place events in historical context and show an understanding of
        historical processes. An attempt at a structured approach, either chronological or thematic has
        been made.
 6–7:   Answers indicate some understanding of the question but historical knowledge is limited in
        quality and quantity. Historical context may be present as will understanding of historical
        processes but underdeveloped. The question is only partially addressed.
 4–5:   There is little understanding of the question. Historical details are present but are mainly
        inaccurate and/or of marginal relevance. Historical context or processes are barely understood
        and there is minimal focus on the task.
 1–3:    Answers do not meet the demands of the question and show little or no evidence of
         appropriate structure. There are no more than vague, unsupported assertions.
 0:      Answers not meeting the requirements of descriptors should be awarded no marks.

 Examiners and moderators are reminded of the need to apply the markbands that provide the “best
 fit” to the responses given by candidates and to award credit wherever it is possible to do so. If an
 answer indicates that the demands of the question are understood and addressed but that not all
 implications are considered (eg, compare or contrast; reasons or significance; methods or success),
 then examiners should not be afraid of using the full range of marks allowed for by the markscheme:
 ie, responses that offer good coverage of some of the criteria should be rewarded accordingly.

Topic 1   Causes, practices and effects of wars

1.   With reference to one Allied power and one Central Power, examine the reasons for their
     involvement in the First World War in 1914.

     Note – candidates who choose Italy or the US as an Allied power cannot receive credit since
     these powers did not enter the war in 1914. Similarly, Bulgaria did not officially declare itself at
     war until October 1915.

     For Allied powers the most popular choices are likely to be Imperial Russia, Britain (and by
     association its empire), France (and by association its empire). Some candidates may choose
     Belgium or Serbia as legitimate examples – or even Japan, which declared war in August 1914.
     Whichever is chosen the task is to examine the motives, overt and covert, of the selected state.

     For Central Powers candidates may choose Imperial Germany, the Austro-Hungarian Empire or
     the Ottoman Empire.

     Many candidates will respond to the task by addressing each country separately but a thematic
     approach is also possible – for example by identifying themes such as economic rivalry, territorial
     ambitions, the pursuit of nationalist goals, the attempt to prevent movements for self-determination
     that threatened the integrity of the state, arms races, the pursuit of a war of distraction from
     domestic problems, attempts to honour alliance or treaty obligations, to defend borders against
     invasion – or to defend perceived national interests then and for the future.

     Some candidates may note that the justifications provided by the participants were often pretexts to
     disguise ulterior motives regarding their strategic needs etc. Whichever approach is chosen,
     candidates need to examine the factors that led states to enter the conflict in 1914 and make critical
     comment upon such factors.

     The above material is an indication of what candidates may elect to write about in their responses.
     However, it is not exhaustive and no set answer is required.

     Examiners and moderators are reminded of the need to apply the markbands that provide the
     “best fit” to the responses given by candidates and to award credit wherever it is possible to do so.

2.   Examine the reasons for, and significance of, foreign intervention in two 20th century civil
     wars, each chosen from a different region.

     Popular choices are likely to be the Russian Civil War (1917/18–1921), the Spanish Civil War
     (1936–1939) and the Chinese Civil War (1927–1949 or 1946–1949 depending on the candidate’s
     interpretation). Accept the war in Korea (1950–1953) or the Second Indo–Chinese War
     (later 1950s–1975) as legitimate examples – or other civil wars such as the Nigerian or Greek Civil
     War (1967–1970 and approximately 1946–1949 respectively). The conflict in Nicaragua
     (1979 – 1982) would also be an appropriate example.

     The treatment of the task could be to address each war separately or some candidates may choose to
     adopt a thematic approach – for example examining motives linked to economic, diplomatic,
     strategic, ideological aims that could be realized by the intervening power by supporting one
     particular side in the civil war. Whichever approach is taken, candidates are required to comment
     critically on the reasons for the decision to intervene in the fratricidal conflict.

     For significance, candidates could estimate the extent to which such intervention proved responsible
     for extending the duration of the war, causing human and material damage to the country and
     contributing to the outcome of the conflict. In some cases such involvement did prove decisive –
     in others, not – despite the provision of military personnel and materiel. Significance could also
     refer to the importance of such intervention for international relations at the time or for the future
     (alterations in the balance of power and a legacy of insecurity or ideological mistrust that influenced
     the subsequent policies and perceptions of the chosen states).

     The above material is an indication of what candidates may elect to write about in their responses.
     However, it is not exhaustive and no set answer is required.

     Examiners and moderators are reminded of the need to apply the markbands that provide the
     “best fit” to the responses given by candidates and to award credit wherever it is possible to do so.

3.   Compare and contrast the impact of naval and air power in two 20th century wars before
     1945 or two 20th century wars after 1945.

     “Naval power” can include consideration of surface and submarine vessels and the contribution
     they made in the chosen conflicts. The impact could be addressed by reference to the role played
     by: warships in terms of naval battles or in protecting coastlines or supply routes; cargo
     vessels/merchant navy vessels used to supply personnel and military materiel to theatres of war;
     aircraft carriers or modified vessels which permitted their use for aircraft launches; the significance
     of naval blockade upon the economies of enemy states; amphibious assaults that were enabled by
     landing craft etc.

     “Air power” can include the use of aircraft as reconnaissance, fighter, bomber, missile carrier or
     transport planes (for supplies and troop carrying). Accept also coverage of the use of rocketry or
     missiles in this category.

     Having identified the elements of naval and air power candidates are required to indicate the
     similarities and differences in the impact of such military power. In some cases it may be argued
     that the impact of such power proved decisive in determining the outcome of the conflict – in other
     cases it may be argued that neither was significant in ensuring victory. Whichever wars are
     selected, candidates should provide specific detail of the naval and air power impact upon
     the conflict. Answers may also consider the co-ordination of air and naval power.

     The above material is an indication of what candidates may elect to write about in their responses.
     However, it is not exhaustive and no set answer is required.

     Examiners and moderators are reminded of the need to apply the markbands that provide the
     “best fit” to the responses given by candidates and to award credit wherever it is possible to do so.

4.   Examine the successes and failures of collective security in the 10 years after either the First
     World War or the Second World War.

     The 10-year period after the First World War is taken to mean up to 1929 and for the Second World
     War up to 1955. Candidates are likely to focus on the League of Nations and the United Nations
     Organization but they could also deal with Locarno (1925) for the post-First World War period and
     NATO (1949) for the post-Second World War period. The Warsaw Pact may be mentioned (1955)
     but given the end date of the task for the post-Second World War, there is a fairly limited
     opportunity to develop this.

     For collective security following the First World War please note that the crises in Manchuria and
     Abyssinia are not relevant and cannot be credited. Candidates are required to identify when and
     where crises were tackled – and why the outcome was either a success or failure. For the League,
     popular areas for investigation are likely to be the Aaland Islands dispute (1920); the Vilna dispute
     (1920); the settlement of the issue of Upper Silesia (1921); the Corfu Crisis (1923); the Greek–
     Bulgarian clash (1925).

     Factors that explain the degree of success or failure attained may include: reference to the structure
     and Covenant provisions of the League; the willingness of states to accept League arbitration or in
     some cases weakness of aggrieved states to challenge League involvement; the predominance of
     national self-interest amongst leading League members; the growth of revisionist feelings following
     the peace settlements in Paris; the growth of aggressive and expansionist powers etc.

     For collective security following the Second World War areas for consideration are likely to be: the
     involvement of the UN in Palestine and the subsequent Arab-Israeli conflict; the Indian
     subcontinent and the problem of Kashmir, in particular; the war in Korea. The structure and
     provisions of the Charter could be discussed as well as the impact of Cold War rivalry in terms of
     the (in)effective functioning of the organization.

     The above material is an indication of what candidates may elect to write about in their responses.
     However, it is not exhaustive and no set answer is required.

     Examiners and moderators are reminded of the need to apply the markbands that provide the
     “best fit” to the responses given by candidates and to award credit wherever it is possible to do so.

5.   Evaluate the importance of religion and economic factors as causes of either the Indo–
     Pakistan wars (1947–1949; 1965; 1971) or the Nigerian Civil War (1967–1970).

     The Indo–Pakistan wars of 1947–1949, 1965 and 1971, while consisting of three separate conflicts,
     do have common themes regarding the origins of the wars as well as issues specific to each war.
     The focus should be on religious and economic factors in relation to the wars, though other factors
     such as the desire to acquire (or in India’s case retain) territory (Kashmir) and the pursuit of
     regional hegemony by 1971, for example, may be examined.

     The hasty partition of the subcontinent in 1947 left a legacy of hostility. The two successor states
     engaged in disputes over the economic division of the assets – economic and military – of British
     controlled India. The bulk of the subcontinent’s industrial infrastructure remained in India leaving
     the new Pakistani state heavily reliant on primary production and an inability to develop its
     economy as well as cope with the massive problems associated with refugee displacement.
     In particular the issue of control of the headwaters of the Indus was important for both new nations.

     Control of Kashmir was seen as crucial for both states because of its commanding position in
     relation to the Indus. Kashmir was also seen as important for India because its secession could
     encourage other regions of the newly-independent state to pursue separatist policies. For Pakistan,
     the inclusion of Kashmir (the “K” in Pakistan) was a matter of national pride as well as an
     economic necessity. Religion was used by propagandists, especially in Pakistan, to bolster their
     claims to the territory (the majority was Muslim though the Maharajah who agreed to accession to
     India was Hindu). Despite its being a secular state, accusations of Indian attempts to establish a
     Hindu Raj, which had partly led to the partition in the first place, continued to be uttered even after
     the establishment of Pakistan. The issue of Kashmir also acted as a form of “negative cohesion” for
     both states whose governments could use it as a means of establishing a sense of unity in the new
     states.

     The first war (1947–1949) witnessed the invasion of Kashmir by Pathan militants and eventually,
     after ceasefire, the existence of two Kashmirs – Pakistan controlling the smaller “Azad Kashmir”.
     Despite both sides agreeing to a plebiscite to determine the wishes of the people of Kashmir the
     Indian leader Nehru failed to honour this agreement. The second war (1965) was a matter of
     opportunism in terms of timing (though the Kashmir issue was still the focus) as India was still
     recovering after a dismal performance in the Sino–Indian clash in 1962. A peace agreement was
     made in 1966 though the situation remained tense. The third war (1971) was in a sense a matter of
     opportunism for India this time to take advantage of the breakdown of East–West Pakistani
     relations. India’s support of East Pakistan’s claims for self-determination was a major contribution
     to the emergence of Bangladesh, the demographic and economic strength of Pakistan and a sign of
     India’s growing regional power in South Asia.

     Civil war in Nigeria was precipitated by the breakaway of the Eastern Region in 1967 in an attempt
     to form the independent state of Biafra. The war’s origins lie in the discontent of the Igbo
     population of the Eastern Region (largely Christian) with the dominance of the largely Muslim
     populations of the Northern Region (Fulani) and the Western Region (Hausa). The demographics
     of the Nigerian federation ensured dominance of the politicians from the north and west of the state.
     An Igbo-led military coup in 1966 led to fears of an Igbo-dominated state and a backlash against the
     new military leader, General Aguiyi-Ironsi. Subsequent widespread persecution of Igbos living in
     the Northern Region acted as a catalyst in the declaration of independent Biafra in 1967. In
     economic terms the Eastern Region was the major source of Nigeria’s oil reserves – the loss of
     Biafra would not only destroy the political integrity of Nigeria but also deprive the Lagos-based
     government of General Gowon of vital economic resources.

     Whichever conflict is chosen candidates are required to identify and critically assess the stated
     factors as contributors to the war.

     The above material is an indication of what candidates may elect to write about in their responses.
     However, it is not exhaustive and no set answer is required.

     Examiners and moderators are reminded of the need to apply the markbands that provide the
     “best fit” to the responses given by candidates and to award credit wherever it is possible to do so.


6.   Examine the reasons for, and the consequences of, the war between Iran and Iraq
     (1980–1988).

     Reasons for. Candidates could identify a range of factors ranging from: largely unresolved border
     disputes between the two states (despite the Algiers agreement made with the Shah of Iran in 1975,
     tensions still remained over control of the Shatt-el-Arab waterway that provided an important outlet
     for the exporting of oil resources for both states); the attempt by the Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein to
     establish regional hegemony at a time when the Iranian Revolution temporarily weakened Iran’s
     capacity to wage an effective war; Iraqi resentment of the new Iranian government under Ayatollah
     Khomeini and its encouragement of Iraq’s Shiite majority to rise against Saddam Hussein’s regime;
     the desire of Iraq to seize Khuzestan’s oil resources etc.

     Consequences of. Candidates could examine the physical impact of the conflict on both parties –
     the effect on oil production, the human costs estimated at approximately 367,000 dead and 700,000
     wounded partly as a result of human wave tactics by Iran and the supply of military and financial
     support to Iraq by the US, the USSR, France, the Gulf States, Egypt, Saudi Arabia – and to Iran by
     Algeria, Syria, Libya and South Yemen. In July 1988 a UN ceasefire resolution came into force.
     Though grudgingly accepted by Iran, Iraq did not officially accept Iranian peace terms till 1990.
     Though Iraq claimed victory in this war of attrition and Saddam Hussein used it as an opportunity
     to further promote his cult of personality, both sides had suffered greatly.

     Apart from the economic and human losses for both states, (the estimated costs for Iran and Iraq
     were US$100 billion and US$150 billion respectively according to the Stockholm International
     Peace Research Institute) candidates may also examine the impact on Iraqi foreign policy and
     expansion for the future. Saddam Hussein’s invasion of Kuwait (1990–1991) was arguably an
     attempt to recoup the losses incurred by the Iran-Iraq War.

     The internationalization of the war led to superpower involvement in this economically sensitive
     area which much of the world relied upon for oil supplies. Egypt’s support for Iraq allowed it to
     regain some of the prestige it had lost in the Arab world after Sadat’s peace treaty with Israel
     in 1979.

     The above material is an indication of what candidates may elect to write about in their responses.
     However, it is not exhaustive and no set answer is required.

Topic 2   Democratic states — challenges and responses

7.   Examine the reasons for the establishment of democracy in Germany in 1919, and evaluate how
     effectively it dealt with the economic and political challenges it faced up to 1929.

     To determine why democracy was established, candidates could examine why Field Marshal von
     Hindenburg and General Ludendorff sponsored the establishment of a democratic system, despite
     their commitment to the previous authoritarian Kaiserreich – whether this was a genuine attempt to
     transform Germany or whether this was designed to limit the degree of punishment of Germany in a
     future peace settlement and absolve the military of responsibility for the possible punitive nature of
     any such settlement. Mention may also be made of the terms of the armistice as well as the popular
     support for a more democratic system of government.

     Candidates could identify the nature of the economic and political problems that the new Weimar
     Republic encountered and how it dealt with these. The economic problems associated with
     reparations repayments, the period of “currency delirium” or hyperinflation as a result of the
     invasion of the Ruhr in 1923 by French and Belgian forces, the impact of the Great Depression of
     1929 compounded by the heavy reliance on US financial support could be considered. Political
     problems faced in the first decade included early opposition to the democratic government from
     extremists (Spartacus Rising, Kapp Putsch, Beerhall/November Putsch); the instability produced by
     weak coalition governments. The unwillingness and/or inability of political parties to work together
     to form stable governments as well as the existence of political leaders, bureaucrats and vested
     interests that were not sufficiently committed to the democratic system partly as a result of its
     association with defeat and a peace settlement, may also be considered.

     The above material is an indication of what candidates may elect to write about in their responses.
     However, it is not exhaustive and no set answer is required.

     Examiners and moderators are reminded of the need to apply the markbands that provide the
     “best fit” to the responses given by candidates and to award credit wherever it is possible to do so.

8.   “The problems that arose from economic crises were the greatest challenge to democratic
     government in the first half of the 20th century.” With reference to two states, to what extent
     do you agree with this statement?

     There is no regional requirement but focus needs to be on the period up to and not beyond 1950.

     Economic crises or problems associated with the post-First World War or post-Second World War
     period could be considered – as could the crises linked with the onset of the Great Depression from
     1929 onwards. The nature and extent of the crises upon the selected states could be investigated
     (unemployment, collapse of export markets, reduced output etc) as well as an examination of how
     such economic crises had an impact upon the political and social structure of the selected states.
     The question also invites candidates to consider other factors that may have provided challenges to
     the democratic states chosen. These may include the rise of political extremism in the period –
     internal or external – that threatened the existence of the democracies or, for example, the
     constitutions of such states that were ill-equipped to deal with problems such as ineffective coalition
     governments or the lack of commitment to the democratic system by leading political figures or
     parties. In some cases democracy was a victim of vested interests that sought by force (civil war) to
     halt political, social and economic reforms that were opposed to the beliefs of traditional institutions
     (church, monarchy etc).

     Popular choices could be Weimar Germany, Italy, the US, Spain and the situation of western liberal
     democracies in the early years of the Cold War.

     The above material is an indication of what candidates may elect to write about in their responses.
     However, it is not exhaustive and no set answer is required.

9.   Evaluate the reasons for, and methods used in, the post-war reconstruction of Japan between
     1945 and 1952.

     Reasons for could refer to the desire of the occupying forces under General MacArthur and by
     1951, General Ridgeway, to render impossible the re-emergence of Japanese militarism by firstly
     eliminating what were seen as the causes of such militarism: the limiting of the armed forces, the
     holding of war crimes trials and executions, the purging of the civil service of those identified with
     Japanese aggression; the dissolution of the zaibatsu (industrial combines implicated in the growth of
     an expansionist “Japanism” in the 1930s and 1940s). Reconstruction was hastened in 1947–1948
     as Cold War tensions and the fear of Japan succumbing to communism. The “loss” of China in
     1949 and the Korean War (1950–1953) acted as catalysts for economic and military reconstruction
     policies that in a sense reversed the initial policies of the occupation that ended with the San
     Francisco Peace Treaty and Japan–US Security Treaty of 1951–1952.

     Methods used could refer to: the Anti-Monopoly Law of 1947 designed to eliminate the zaibatsu;
     the revival of pre-war political parties; the passing of legislation to legalise trade union activity
     (1945); the Labour Standards Law (1947), which mandated working hours, equal pay for males and
     females, annual holiday entitlement for workers; the imposition of a constitution establishing a
     bicameral system of government based on universal suffrage; the setting up of a Supreme Court;
     guarantees of freedom of speech, religion and assembly; land reform, which broke the power of
     absentee landlords and benefited tenant farmers; educational reforms, which expanded primary and
     secondary education as well as providing tertiary level opportunities.

     Policies of demobilization and disarmament as well as economic changes in the early part of the
     occupation were reversed in the light of the tensions generated by the Cold War. Limitations on the
     military were dropped as the US encouraged the formation of a maritime Safety Force (1948),
     which was essentially a navy; a National Police Reserve (1950), which by 1952 became a Self-
     Defence Force, designed also to protect Japan from the spread of communism in East Asia.

10.   Examine the extent to which South Africa was successful in addressing the political, social and
      economic challenges it faced between 1991 and 2000.

      Candidates should clearly identify the nature and extent of the challenges that faced the newly
      democratic South Africa upon its emergence from racially-based minority rule.

      Political challenges could be examined with reference to the attempts by Mandela and de Klerk to
      negotiate a new constitutional arrangement to end Apartheid and institute a multiparty state. This
      took place in the face of fierce opposition by some Afrikaners who resisted the end of a system that
      had been formally instituted in 1948 and that had benefited them materially, as well as hostility
      from the Inkatha movement of Chief Buthelezi, which was engaged in an armed struggle with the
      ANC (African National Congress) in Kwa-Zulu Natal. The emergence by 1993, of a power sharing
      agreement that satisfied the Inkatha, could be considered. The existence of extremist groups such
      as Eugene Terre’Blanche’s AWB (Afrikaner Weerstandsbeweging), with its calls for an
      independent Boerevolkstaat, threatened to undermine a peaceful transition to democratic rule.
      Armed resistance to the transition to majority rule was met partly by force but also by a policy of
      forgiveness as practised by the Truth and Reconciliation Commission which was set up as a way to
      express past and present grievances and to promote progress in South Africa.

      Social and economic challenges may include areas such as: income disparity; inequitable land
      distribution; the need for improvement in facilities for health care, education, housing, running
      water, employment etc. High expectations in terms of improvements in the standard of living
      proved difficult to realise. Under Mandela (president 1994–1999) and his successor Mbeki,
      attempts to tackle social and economic problems by policies of affirmative action in the civil
      service, universities and state controlled industries produced an outflow of whites not only from
      managerial positions but from the country itself. In some cases where training and experience was
      not complete, there was some disruption with the smooth running of institutions. Talk of
      establishing a socialist style economy diminished as it became increasingly obvious that in order to
      deal with the demands for improvements in living and employment conditions, foreign investment
      was needed. Privatization of previously state controlled industries and a focus on exports as well as
      financial inducements to attract foreign investment were emphasized. One particular area for
      concern during the period was the spread of AIDS in the country – a spread which Mbeki did little
      to combat in terms of funding for treatment and education.

      By 1999 South Africa witnessed worker unrest as noted in strikes organized by COSATU
      (Congress of South African Trade Unions) in response to lowered wages. Failure to deliver in
      terms of the provision of an improved standard of living for the majority led to dissatisfaction and
      an increase in crime.

11.   Examine the methods used, and the level of success achieved, by two 20th century democratic
      states in their efforts to address gender inequality.

      The nature of gender inequalities could be identified for the selected states. This could include
      reference to: suffrage; employment opportunities; equal pay; educational provision; contraception;
      abortion etc. Having identified the issues candidates are required to examine how such issues were
      dealt with by the state in order to reduce or eliminate discrimination and gender inequality and
      whether the measures adopted (specific measures of legislation) were able to remedy, with any
      degree of success, the problems faced by women.

12.   Examine the methods used, and the level of success achieved, by one civil rights movement in
      a 20th century democratic state.

      Popular choices may include: the civil rights movements in the US to deal with the plight of African
      Americans, Native Americans or Hispanic Americans; movements to promote the rights of
      indigenous peoples in Australia, New Zealand or Canada; movements to address inequalities
      between Catholic and Protestant communities in Northern Ireland. Other possible examples could
      be selected from democratic states such as India where the struggle for civil rights by the Scheduled
      Castes provides a legitimate example for investigation. Discontent over religious, ethnic, racial
      issues and the attempt to redress inequalities or discriminatory treatment should form the basis for
      investigation.

      Whichever movement is selected, candidates need to make critical comment upon the methods used
      by the movement (use of propaganda, passive resistance, force, recourse to judicial proceedings etc)
      and also make a judgement as to how successful the movement was in relation to attaining its goals
      to gain civil rights.

Topic 3    Origins and development of authoritarian and single-party states

13.   Examine the importance of each of the following in the rise to power of either Stalin or Hitler:
      popular support for their aims; underestimation by opponents; economic conditions.

      “Popular support for their aims”: candidates are required to identify the specific aims of the
      selected aspiring leader. Whether these aims were significant in garnering popular support – and
      why – needs to be addressed and supported by reference to specific evidence of how such support
      was manifested.
      Popular support can, in the case of Stalin, also be taken to mean popular support within the party,
      since Stalin’s rise occurred in a single-party state where, arguably, mass support was less important.
      The aims of the selected leader could be considered in relation to economic aims, attempts to
      address issues of political instability etc. In the case of Stalin, the proclaimed aim to continue the
      legacy of Lenin could be considered.
      For Hitler, the aims outlined in Mein Kampf may be discussed and the appeal of extreme
      nationalism in the wake of the First World War. Hitler directed his speeches towards all sections of
      German society with varying degrees of success.
      “Underestimation by opponents” requires candidates to identify those individuals, parties, and
      institutions within the state that were hostile to the aspiring leader and to explain what errors were
      made by them in building an effective barrier to the rise of the aspiring leader.
      For Stalin the succession dispute (already underway even before Lenin’s death) should be well
      known with reference to the Triumvirate, the lack of effective opposition from Trotsky and his
      supporters and the failure of party leaders such as Kamenev, Zinoviev, Bukharin, Tomsky, Rykov
      etc to appreciate the nature and extent of the threat posed.
      For Hitler underestimation could be addressed by reference to the lack of a united front by the
      Communist Party of Germany (KPD) and Social Democratic Party of Germany (SPD) to counter
      the rise of the Nazi Party (NSDAP) (and why) as well as the failure of parties such as the German
      National People’s Party (DNVP) and the Centre Party (Zentrum) to recognise the dangers posed by
      a regime led by Hitler. The collaboration and underestimation by leading figures such as von
      Hindenburg and von Papen by 1933 could also be examined.
      “Economic conditions” requires identification of specific problems faced by the state and the
      inability of the existing leaders to adequately deal with them. Such problems allowed aspiring
      leaders to put forward policies and/or promises that were appealing to a party or population that
      sought security and material benefits.

      For Stalin, the mixed reactions to the New Economic Policy (NEP) may be discussed, as well as his
      proposal for Socialism in One Country.
      For Hitler, the impact of high unemployment, the failure of banks and fears of a repetition of the
      inflationary crisis of 1923, would be relevant. Specific details are required to support arguments.

14.   Compare and contrast the economic and social policies of two of the following: Mao; Nasser;
      Castro.

      For economic policies candidates could examine areas such as land reform, policies of
      industrialization, increasing state control and nationalization of foreign and local businesses,
      measures taken to promote employment, the promotion of indigenous products over imports,
      taxation, wealth redistribution, etc.

      For social policies candidates could examine areas such as the treatment of youth and women,
      educational provision and literacy campaigns, health and social welfare provision, housing,
      measures taken in relation to religious institutions or groups that were seen as allies or as enemies
      of the state.

      The task requires candidates to identify and comment on the similarities and differences of such
      economic and social policies – either in terms of the nature or extent of the policies. The degree of
      success attained in fulfilling the aims of the policies could also be investigated and
      commented upon.

      Reference to specific policies/programmes is required to substantiate the claims made.

15.   With reference to two authoritarian or single-party states, each chosen from a different
      region, evaluate the effectiveness of the methods used to deal with opposition.

      The nature and extent of opposition (real or perceived) could be addressed at the outset. In some
      cases opposition could be seen as movements or institutions that actively challenged the existence
      of the regime – but it could also be taken to mean areas of society that the regime sought to
      pre-emptively deal with due to the potential for perceived resistance. Examples could include:
      inner-party opposition to the leadership of the single-party state; religious institutions and groups;
      youth movements; political parties or movements that rejected the ideology of the state and waged
      open or clandestine campaigns to subvert the single-party regime; elements of the military; victims
      of the economic and social policies of the state who sought to hinder the implementation of the aims
      of the state etc.

      For “methods” candidates could examine the use of force to eliminate opposition, purges of society
      the party and civil service/bureaucracy, the provision of programmes to win support from the
      population; the use of propaganda, media control and control of education etc.

      The above material is an indication of what candidates may elect to write about in their responses.
      However, it is not exhaustive and no set answer is required.

      “best fit” to the responses given by candidates and to award credit wherever it is possible to do so.


16.   With reference to two authoritarian or single-party states, each chosen from a different
      region, evaluate the impact of domestic policies on the status of women.

      Whichever states are selected, an appropriate starting point would be the identification of the
      treatment and status of women prior to the establishment of the authoritarian or single-party state.
      This could involve a consideration of: the treatment and status of women in terms of ownership of
      property, inheritance, suffrage etc; the employment opportunities available; educational provisions;
      the rights of women in relation to marriage, divorce, birth control and abortion.

      Candidates are required to examine how and why the regime implemented changes that affected the
      status of women by referring to specific details of the regime’s legislation and/or ideology. Popular
      choices for this question are likely to be Hitler’s Germany, Stalin’s Soviet Union, Mao’s China and
      Peron’s Argentina. In some cases the rights of women were curtailed, in others actively promoted –
      for ideological or practical considerations. Specific historical knowledge should be used to
      substantiate general claims as to the treatment/status of women.

17.   To what extent was Nyerere successful in achieving his domestic policy aims in Tanzania?

      Candidates are required to identify the specific aims of Nyerere upon his election as president of
      Tanzania in 1964 following Tanganyika’s union with Zanzibar. Candidates who deal with his aims
      from 1961 to 1964 when he was president of Tanganyika should not be penalized but good focus on
      the demands of the question would require that attention be paid to the period from 1964 up to
      1985.

      “Aims” for consideration over the period could be: the establishment of a one-party state with the
      claim that this would ensure political stability in an ethnically diverse country – thus avoiding the
      growth of divisive political parties that represented tribal rather than national interests; the drive for
      Africanization of the economy; the establishment of African socialism (ujamaa) in order to
      eliminate the gap between rich and poor as made clear in the Arusha Declaration of 1967 – this
      resulting in nationalization of foreign businesses and state control of banking and large scale
      businesses; collectivization of agriculture; the organization of self-sufficient villages; the
      implementation of educational policies focusing especially upon universal primary education;
      health care provision to reduce levels of infant mortality and increase life expectancy.

      Given the fact that the nation was limited in terms of resources and capital the ambitious
      programmes were often unable to achieve the targets set. Drought, the rise of oil prices in 1973 and
      the reliance of the state upon the export of primary products such as cotton, coffee and tea (the
      prices of which were subject to the vagaries of the world market) all contributed towards a
      lacklustre economic performance. The resettlement of peasants into ujamaa villages – at first
      voluntarily and then by coercion – caused not only disruption to production but also resentment by
      many of the 3 million people affected. Corruption, which had been identified in the Arusha
      Declaration as one of the enemies of the nation, was not successfully controlled but in terms of
      some of the more ambitious social policies Tanzania did witness improved literacy levels (85%) and
      the provision of an infrastructure for schooling at primary level that compared well with other
      African states.

      By 1985 Tanzania was obliged to appeal for aid to the International Monetary Fund (IMF) though
      such aid was provided only when state control was loosened following Nyerere’s resignation.

18.   “The use of force was the most important factor in the maintenance of power of the
      authoritarian or single-party leader.” With reference to two authoritarian or single-party
      leaders, to what extent do you agree with this statement?

      Note that there is no regional requirement.

       For “maintenance” of power candidates could examine the repressive measures adopted by the
      leader: the use of the purges (both within the party/ movement itself to ensure the paramount power
      of the leader as well as amongst the general population); control and censorship of the media; the
      establishment of a system of organized terror and intimidation by means of a secret police or the
      military etc.

      Other factors could also be considered such as: the appeal of policies or programmes that
      addressed grievances and produced employment opportunities and material rewards; the use of
      propaganda; the control of education and the creation of youth movements to bolster the leader and
      his movement.

Topic 4     Nationalist and independence movements in Africa and Asia and post-1945 Central and
            Eastern European states

19.   Compare and contrast the importance of leadership in the achievement of independence in
      either: two colonial states in Asia or Africa; or two Soviet-controlled states in Central/Eastern
      Europe.

      Whether choosing to discuss movements to achieve independence from colonial rule or from Soviet
      control, candidates will need to select two appropriate states and to structure their response
      appropriately. The question asks specifically about leadership and this must be addressed, although
      other factors may also be discussed.

      With regard to colonial states, leaders may have provided ideological instruction, military expertise
      and/or political representation. Also, violent or non-violent methods may have been promoted to
      good effect (or not). How significant such leadership proved to be can be measured in terms of: the
      relative popularity of the leaders; their access to colonial authorities; their ability to persuade, cajole
      or threaten; support that may (or may not) have been forthcoming from ideological allies.
      Other factors that could be included to compare and contrast importance of leadership may include:
      the readiness of colonial authorities to accede independence; the way in which war (such as the
      Second World War) may have loosened the grip of the metropolitan or encouraged opposition to
      arise; economic hardship engendering discontent or economic success making independence seem
      feasible; growing literacy and levels of education etc.

      With regard to independence from Soviet control, leaders may have provided ideological dissent by
      circulating samizdat or by forming underground movements; leadership for workers movements
      such as Solidarity; adherence to religious values that resonated with the population; the ability to
      voice popular concerns about the economy. Other factors that could be included to compare and
      contrast “relative importance” may include: latent nationalism; religion as a rallying point for
      opposition; economic hardship; past events (such as the Katyn Massacre or the Hungarian
      Revolution) that were censored but lay dormant in the collective memory; the weakness of the
      Party; fading adherence to ideology; the removal of Soviet force; the so-called “Sinatra Doctrine”.

20.   Evaluate the role of mass movements and economic factors in the growth of independence
      movements in either one colony in Africa or Asia or one sovietized state in Central/Eastern
      Europe or the Balkans.

      For mass movements, candidates may refer to methods used to achieve this such as: the distribution
      of illegal literature; the organization of strikes and demonstrations; the growth of pro-independence
      political structures that raised political consciousness; reaction to oppression.

      For economic factors, candidates may mention: the presence of valuable commodities, such as
      minerals as a spur to external assistance; the burden of economic problems as a reason for opposing
      the government; high unemployment might encourage membership of opposition movements.

      The above material is an indication of what candidates may elect to write about in their responses.
      However, it is not exhaustive and no set answer is required.

21.   With reference to one independence movement in either Asia or Africa, examine the impact of
      armed struggle on the overall success of that movement.

      Candidates are required to select one independence movement and to examine the impact
      (importance) of armed struggle on its success. It is likely that the Algerian War of Independence or
      the Indochina/Vietnam War (either will be acceptable) will be popular choices. The impact of
      armed struggle may include the following: the use of successful guerrilla tactics to fight a more
      powerful, better resourced enemy, and the support this may have garnered among the population;
      the use of armed struggle against the government resulting in harsh reprisals and increased
      opposition; armed struggle may have provided focus for a population that had no recourse to
      democratic methods for change; armed struggle may also have led to foreign involvement that could
      have either supported the movement, providing it with arms and resources or supported the
      government and so aroused feelings of resentment among the population etc.

22.   Evaluate the social and economic challenges faced by either one former Soviet satellite state in
      Central/Eastern Europe or one successor state of the former Yugoslavia.

      For social issues, there could be a discussion of minority languages and their recognition as
      symbols of ethnic diversity; the changes to education (and the revision of history textbooks, for
      example); the challenges posed by the free movement of people across borders; the discrimination
      practised against minorities such as the Roma people. The practice of different religious faiths may
      also be a challenge in Bosnia, for example, where Catholicism, Orthodox Christianity and Islam
      co-exist, albeit uneasily and where political institutions that accommodate these have had to
      be constructed. For economic issues, mention may be made of the difficulties of adjusting to a free
      market system; the incidence (often high) of unemployment; the absence of young people of
      working age who go abroad for education or work; the expense of having to modernize
      infrastructure and to clean up a polluted environment; the cost of recovery from conflict.

23.   Examine the impact of the Cold War on post-independence conflicts in either Angola or the
      Belgian Congo/Zaire.

      Patrice Lumumba was the first Prime Minister of an independent Republic of Congo and Joseph
      Kasavubu, its first President. Within days of independence, granted on 30 June 1960, there was a
      mutiny in the army. Belgium sent in soldiers to protect the Belgian citizens living, mostly, in the
      capital of Leopoldville. This presented a challenge to Congolese sovereignty but matters were
      made worse by the secession of Katanga, led by Moise Tshombe. The conflict was further fuelled
      by external aid given to Tshombe by companies (and countries) hoping to benefit from the potential
      wealth of this mineral-rich territory. The UN then became involved sending a mission to restore
      peace but refusing to use force to suppress Tshombe. Lumumba then appealed to the USSR for aid
      (adding a Cold War element to the conflict), launched an attack against Tshombe, failed, was
      dismissed by President Kasavubu and replaced by Mobutu. Lumumba attempted to set up his own
      break away government in Stanleyville but was assassinated. Different factions (with the exception
      of Tshombe) finally agreed to set up a new government. The competing ideologies of the US and
      USSR fuelled the conflict and candidates may focus on how this affected both the outcome and the
      duration of the war.

      For Angola, the focus of the response should be the Angolan Civil War and not the War of
      Independence fought against the Portuguese prior to independence. The civil war broke out soon
      after independence was granted by Portugal in 1975. The Marxist group, MPLA (People's
      Movement for the Liberation of Angola – Labour Party) led by Agostino Neto were prepared to
      take power but were challenged by the FNLA (National Liberation Front of Angola) led by Holden
      Roberto and UNITA (National Union for the Total Independence of Angola), led by Jonas Savimbi.
      External involvement played a major rule in fuelling the conflict with the US supporting both
      UNITA (also supported by China and South Africa) and FLNA (less so), and the USSR (and Cuba)
      supporting the MPLA. Some candidates may also mention the FLEC (Front for the Liberation of
      the Enclave of Cabinda) that led an attack on Mobutu’s regime in the neighbouring state of Zaire.
      This is quite acceptable, as it also played a part in the civil war and, to some extent, was a reaction
      to Mobutu’s support for UNITA. There was also a tribal/class division with UNITA claiming to be
      the party of “true Africans” meaning the rural, as opposed to the urban, population that was
      considered to be pro-MPLA. Specifically, candidates may structure their answers to include the
      following factors: the presence of competing ideologies represented by the MPLA, UNITA and
      FLNA; the support of the US and the USSR, Cuba (and others) that fuelled divisions by providing
      arms and soldiers; the legacy of the struggle against the Portuguese; the presence of oil and other
      mineral deposits that made this a potentially wealthy country and increased the likelihood of
      superpower involvement.

      The above material is an indication of what candidates may elect to write about in their responses.
      However, it is not exhaustive and no set answer is required.

      “best fit” to the responses given by candidates and to award credit wherever it is possible to do so.

24.   “Separatist movements were the main reason for the dissolution of Yugoslavia (1991–1992).”
      To what extent do you agree with this statement?

      Several factors may be cited as reasons for the dissolution of Yugoslavia but this question requires
      that separatist movements be discussed and their significance assessed. There is much to be
      discussed and candidates will probably analyse the resurgence of nationalism after the death of Tito
      and the threat this posed to the federation. The different motives for separatism may be analysed
      including economic, religious, linguistic and cultural factors. Also influential in the growth of
      separatism was the bitter legacy of the Second World War (or, indeed, the First World War and the
      creation of the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes); the financial assistance from emigre
      communities assisted in the resurgence and promotion of ethnic divisions; the nationalist aspirations
      of certain leaders, although, in some cases, the willingness to use force to prevent dissolution was
      itself a spur to independence elsewhere.

      Other factors that may be considered to be of greater or lesser importance could include the support
      given by the EU and US to the dissolution of the federation; the economic problems that deepened
      resentment in the wealthier regions that were subsidising the less wealthy; the collapse of
      communism in Central and Eastern Europe weakened the legacy of the League of Communists of
      Yugoslavia (YCP) and the uniting force of the ideology bequeathed by Tito.

      It is not expected that the war would be discussed here in any great detail but expect a
      well-supported analysis of factors that gave rise to the call for dissolution.

Topic 5    The Cold War

25.   To what extent did decisions about post-war Germany contribute to the breakdown of East–
      West relations between 1945 and 1949?

      With regard to decisions made about post-war Germany, candidates may begin with those discussed
      and finalized at the Yalta and Potsdam conferences. Following on from 1945, reference may be
      made to the following: the policies outlined in Secretary Byrnes’s speech at Stuttgart; the mutual
      support of the US and Chancellor Adenauer making reunification less likely; the pillaging of their
      zone by the USSR; the friction caused by the failure to support agreements on the exchange of food
      and goods; the Marshall Plan and its impact on currency reform; the breakdown of the Allied
      Control Council; the Berlin Blockade; the establishment of the FRG (Federal Republic of Germany)
      and the GDR (German Democratic Republic).

      Candidates may consider the following as reasons why such decisions affected East–West relations:
      post-war Germany had to be occupied and governed, at least temporarily, as the call for
      “unconditional surrender” had removed all vestiges of the Nazi regime. Furthermore, Germany’s
      geopolitical importance meant that all of the Allied Powers wanted to have influence over its post-
      war developments. The US and Britain rapidly came to support the economic revival of Germany
      whilst the USSR was concerned about the revival of Germany as a military power, as, indeed, was
      France. Both countries, but especially the USSR, were also concerned about security and feared
      another invasion. There was a growing divergence of views about the future of Germany and
      suspicion was reflected in the pragmatic union of British and American zones into Bizonia and the
      adoption of the Truman Doctrine by the US and, later the Marshall Plan.

      Along with the Marshall Plan (ERP or European Recovery Program), came the need for a stable
      currency and, with France now on board, the emergence of Trizonia. The adoption of the
      Deutschmark in the West was a major reason for the Berlin Blockade. Re-unification was now
      unlikely to happen and candidates may discuss Stalin’s argument that the Yalta agreement had been
      ignored by the US that moved ahead with plans for the establishment of the FRG, rather than the
      reunited, but neutral, Germany favoured by Stalin.

      “To what extent” invites candidates to consider other factors that may have contributed to the
      breakdown of East–West relations. These may include: ideology; mutual fear over expansion of
      influence; issues of security; the nuclear arms race etc.

      The above material is an indication of what candidates may elect to write about in their responses.
      However, it is not exhaustive and no set answer is required.

      “best fit” to the responses given by candidates and to award credit wherever it is possible to do so.

26.   Evaluate the reasons for the adoption by the Soviet Union of peaceful coexistence and the
      impact of this policy on Cold War relations between 1956 and 1964.

      The policy of “peaceful co-existence” is usually ascribed to Khrushchev and his de-Stalinization
      speech at the Twentieth Party Congress of February 1956. It established that the USSR, although
      confident of the eventual triumph of communism, could, nevertheless, co-exist with the US and that
      peaceful relations were possible. It would be expected that candidates will know this and so be able
      to contextualise this topic. It is also assumed that the dates, given as a guideline, will indicate a
      starting point of the twentieth party congress and an end point of Khrushchev’s enforced retirement.

      For “reasons”, candidates may refer to Khrushchev’s adoption of a policy originally promoted by
      Malenkov on his becoming Prime Minister in 1953 and so indicate that this initiative had been aired
      prior to Khrushchev’s emergence as the leader of the Soviet Union. Additionally, candidates may
      offer reasons such as Khrushchev’s policy of “New Thinking” in foreign relations whereby the
      USSR still maintained its ideological stance of achieving world revolution but that a violent
      confrontation with the capitalist states was not imperative. The USSR also wanted to cut back on
      spending on defence, as did the US and so warmer relations were in the interests of both sides.
      Another factor would be the fear of a Third World War. Candidates may also mention that relations
      between the two superpowers had already started to improve with the signing of the Austrian State
      Treaty in 1955 and the Geneva Summit. Other reasons may include the less cordial relations
      between China and the Soviet Union in the wake of the Korean War and the death of Stalin and so
      the USSR may have been more inclined to look for better relations with the US.
      Also, Khrushchev used “peaceful co-existence” as a way to challenge Molotov (soon to be removed
      as Foreign Minister) who supported the continuation of a hard-line, anti-capitalist policy.

      For “impact”, candidates may refer to events that demonstrated better relations with the US such as
      the exhibition of American products held in Moscow; Khrushchev’s visit to the US; the “peaceful”
      resolution of crises such as the confrontation by tanks at Checkpoint Charlie; the improved relations
      between Kennedy and Khrushchev after the Cuban Missile Crisis, including the commitment to
      “peaceful co-existence” of the US, the hot line and the Test Ban Treaty. To address the less
      peaceful consequences of the policy, candidates may mention the Suez crisis; the Polish and
      Hungarian Uprisings; Sputnik; the question of Berlin (1958 and 1961); the Eisenhower Doctrine;
      the U2 incident and the Paris Summit; the Cuban Missile Crisis. All of these could be said to have
      increased tension and worsened relations between the superpowers.

      In addition, candidates may refer to the ever-worsening relations with China as Mao disapproved of
      “peaceful co-existence”.

      There is much to discuss here so do not expect all of the above but the response should address both
      parts of the question.

      The above material is an indication of what candidates may elect to write about in their responses.
      However, it is not exhaustive and no set answer is required.

      Examiners and moderators are reminded of the need to apply the markbands that provide the
      “best fit” to the responses given by candidates and to award credit wherever it is possible to do so.

27.   Evaluate the successes and failures of the policy of containment up to 1973 in either the
      Middle East or Asia.

      The policy of containment is usually associated with the US Truman Doctrine of 1947 but also
      accept arguments that demonstrate the application of this policy by the USSR during this period.

      The Middle East
      Relevant events may include the removal of the Prime Minister of Iran in 1953 and firm alliance
      between the Shah and the US; the establishment of the Baghdad Pact in 1955, although the
      subsequent re-naming of this as CENTO (Central Treaty Organization) reflects the “loss” of Iraq
      and a partial failure for the US. Another event would be the Suez Crisis (Sinai War) of 1956 when
      the US responded to Egypt’s purchase of Soviet arms by withdrawing funding for the Aswan Dam.
      Given that, in its aftermath, Nasser proceeded to draw closer to the USSR, this could be seen as a
      failure for the US and a success for the USSR. The Eisenhower Doctrine and the subsequent US
      intervention in Lebanon in 1958 could be seen as a determination to uphold its sphere of influence
      in the Middle East. It is likely that most candidates will focus upon the 6-Day War of 1967 and the
      October War of 1973, both of which involved the superpowers, at least on the sidelines. Both
      conflicts ended with an enhanced presence of the US in the Middle East. In 1967, this was reflected
      in the resounding, US-backed victory for Israel and, in 1973, by the shift, by Sadat of Egypt away
      from Soviet influence. Candidates may offer differing points of view and interpretations of events
      that continue to be controversial so accept all well-supported arguments.

      Asia
      Candidates may choose to go back as far as the “loss of China” in 1949 as an example of the failure
      of containment for the US, although it could be argued that the US abandoned Jiang Jieshi (Chiang
      Kai-Shek) by 1948. The Korean War is likely to be included as this was, indeed, an example of US
      containment in action, albeit under the flag of the UN. This should not be an invitation to launch
      into a description of the war, however, but rather to analyse how far containment succeeded or
      failed. Certainly, the war ended where it began, on the 38th parallel and so demonstrated that
      communism had been “contained” but candidates may also argue that China came out stronger from
      this conflict and buoyed by its having confronted the US without losing. More in-depth answers
      may go on to discuss the Indochinese War, the Malayan Emergency and the conflict in Indonesia.
      The emergence of communist sympathizers in Laos, in particular was of concern to both
      Eisenhower and Kennedy but this looming crisis was quickly overshadowed by the Vietnam War.

      Some candidates may approach this period from the perspective of the USSR and its attempts to
      contain China etc.

      However, it is not exhaustive and no set answer is required.

28.   To what extent did the arms race influence the development of the Cold War after 1970?

      There are a number of treaties that signpost stages in the arms race. These might include the
      Strategic Arms Limitation Treaty (SALT) I and II, the Anti-Ballistic Missile (ABM) Treaty, the
      Intermediate Range Nuclear Forces Treaty (INF) and Strategic Arms Reduction (START) Treaty.
      Detailed statistical evidence is not necessary but a good understanding of the nature of the
      discussions and their implications would be expected for the higher mark bands.

      SALT began in Geneva in 1969, in tandem with the negotiations to limit the number and use of
      ABM sites. Candidates may argue that these talks that continued until 1972, were one of the main
      accelerators of detente and, despite the concurrent Vietnam War, offered opportunities for the US
      and USSR to sit around a negotiating table. The aim was to ensure that the principle of Mutually
      Assured Destruction (MAD) remained in force (by limiting the use of ABMs) and that
      intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs), submarine-launched ballistic missiles (SLBMs) etc
      could be discussed, inspected and limited. Candidates could argue that the success of SALT I was,
      in part, due to its having ignored more recent technology, such as multiple independently targetable
      re-entry vehicles (MIRVs). Furthermore, its impact upon the Cold War was positive in that the US
      and USSR were able to reach an agreement when the US was also seeking better relations with
      China. For the US, this was a win/win situation. For the USSR, it was useful to reach an accord
      with its old enemy at a time of deepening tension with China.

      SALT I was quickly followed by new negotiations that led to SALT II. These began in Vladivostok
      in 1974 when, following the resignation of Nixon, Ford became US President. He lost the election
      of 1976 and Carter upset the renewed negotiations by pushing for deeper cuts. This dramatic
      departure from the agreed script was not helped by Brezhnev’s worsening health. In this way,
      SALT II was almost a dead letter before it was signed in 1979 and its fate was sealed by its not
      being ratified by the US Senate. SALT II did not improve so much as worsen relations, especially
      as there was criticism in the US of a treaty that was seen to be all one-sided, in favour of the USSR.
      The placing of SS-20s in Eastern Europe by the USSR would be relevant as this led to retaliatory
      policies by the US (NATO) in the early 1980s and their significance for the period known as the
      “Second Cold War” when it seemed that a Third World War would start, not with an exchange of
      nuclear warheads between the USSR and US, but with land based conflict on the border between
      the FRG and the GDR.

      As there is no end date included, candidates may refer to Reagan’s support for the SDI (Strategic
      Defense Initiative) project and the very significant impact this had upon US–USSR relations from
      1985 onwards, when it dominated the Geneva and the Reykjavik Summits. The arms race played a
      very important role in the ending of the Cold War.

      The question does ask, “to what extent” and candidates may discuss other factors such as the
      expansion of conflict into Africa; tension in the Middle East; the Sino–Soviet split; the policy of
      detente and so on as being of greater or lesser significance. Expect an analysis of the arms race,
      however, and a sound assessment of its importance.

      The above material is an indication of what candidates may elect to write about in their responses.
      However, it is not exhaustive and no set answer is required.

      Examiners and moderators are reminded of the need to apply the markbands that provide the
      “best fit” to the responses given by candidates and to award credit wherever it is possible to do so.

29.   Compare and contrast the economic impact of the Cold War on two countries (excluding the
      USSR and the US), each chosen from a different region.

      Possible choices could be countries caught up in Cold War conflicts such as Vietnam, Korea,
      Angola and so on, or states that benefitted from the economic support of a superpower, such as
      countries in Western Europe (or Japan in Asia) that received aid from the US in the form of the
      Marshall Plan or the members of COMECON (Council for Mutual Economic Assistance) that had
      strong trade links with the USSR. Another example could be Cuba, as it shifted from economic
      dependence on one superpower to the other.

      For comparison/contrast, possible factors could include: the impact upon trade; the availability
      (or not) of loans and aid; membership in an alliance such as NATO or the Warsaw Pact and the
      necessary expenditure on defence that this entailed; employment opportunities in countries where
      the right to work was guaranteed; participation of women in the workforce as was often the case in
      socialist countries; membership (or not) of international organizations such as GATT (General
      Agreement on Tariffs and Trade) or the G7; expenditure on social policies that may be cut
      (or boosted) by Cold War concerns (an example could be the emergence of social systems in
      Western Europe that offered a degree of socialism to offset the attraction of communism).
      Where there was war (proxy Cold War conflicts), there can be comparison/contrast of factors such
      as: the destruction of infrastructure; reduced employment; the emergence of black market
      economies; the absence of trade; post-war aid to help recovery; the surge of economic refugees
      seeking asylum and so on.

30.   To what extent were Reagan’s policies responsible for ending the Cold War?

      The focus here needs to be on the policies of Reagan in relation to how they may have contributed
      to the end of the Cold War. Reagan began his first term as president in 1981, so expect some
      reference to the pre-Gorbachev era of the USSR.

      Policies to be discussed may include the following: the Reagan Doctrine; the increase in the US
      defence budget; SDI; hard-line anti-communist rhetoric (“the evil empire” and so on); support given
      to the mujahedeen in Afghanistan that helped tie down the USSR in this long-running conflict.

      This is a “to what extent” question so expect candidates to also consider other factors that would,
      most likely, include an analysis of Gorbachev’s policies. These may include the following:
      Chernobyl, which influenced Gorbachev’s determination to reduce nuclear weaponry; Glasnost,
      which opened up discussion of links with the West; the so-called “Sinatra Doctrine”; the
      abandonment of the Brezhnev Doctrine; the impression made by Gorbachev as a “new” kind of
      Soviet leader who was amenable to change and improved relations with the West.

      Other factors may also include: the growth of independence movements in Central and Eastern
      Europe; economic pressures on the Eastern Bloc that loosened ties with the USSR; the structure of
      the EU that provided post-Soviet possibilities of making the break from Moscow easier and
      possibly less threatening than a US-dominated Europe may have been; the rapid disintegration of
      Communist Parties in the satellite states that left little time for deliberation etc.

      The above material is an indication of what candidates may elect to write about in their responses.
      However, it is not exhaustive and no set answer is required.

      Examiners and moderators are reminded of the need to apply the markbands that provide the
