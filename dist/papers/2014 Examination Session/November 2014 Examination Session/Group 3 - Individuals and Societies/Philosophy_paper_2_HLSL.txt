       the nature of, and a possible solution to, conflict and war.


2.     “Meditation is a method to go beyond one’s reality, to gain greater wisdom of [the] self and a newer
       insight into who one is.” Discuss and evaluate.



Confucius: The Analects

3.     Explain and discuss the view that Confucius’s version of the Golden Rule consists of two notions,
       zhong (loyalty, truthfulness to oneself, self-regard) and shu (reciprocity), which form the “one thread”
       running through the Tao.


4.     Explain and discuss the view that Confucian ethics sees ren tao (the human way) in relation to tian
       tao (the way of heaven) through the practice of li (ritual).

Plato: The Republic, Books IV–IX

7.    Evaluate Plato’s claim that it is because those suited to be workers are ruled by their appetites rather

9.    Evaluate Descartes’s arguments for God’s existence.


10.   Explain and discuss the method of doubt which Descartes presents.



John Locke: Second Treatise on Government

11.   Evaluate Locke’s claim that since the main end of government is the preservation of the individual’s
      natural rights it cannot justify killing, enslaving, or plundering its citizens.


12.   Evaluate Locke’s claim that “Since [money] […] has its value only from the consent of men […] it is
      plain that men have agreed to disproportionate and unequal possession of the earth”.



John Stuart Mill: On Liberty

13.   Evaluate the claim that the principles outlined by Mill support the criminalization of acts motivated
      by hatred but not of hate speech.

Friedrich Nietzsche: The Genealogy of Morals

15.   Evaluate Nietzsche’s claim that genealogy is concerned with “a real history of morality” and not with
      mere “hypothesis-mongering”.


16.   Explain and discuss Nietzsche’s view that understanding slave morality as the creation of a particular
      type of people at a particular historical moment and for particular reasons “has been lost sight of
      because this morality [slave morality] was victorious”.



Bertrand Russell: The Problems of Philosophy

17.   Evaluate the claim that an essential characteristic of philosophical knowledge is criticism.


18.   Explain and discuss the nature of universals and their relationship to knowledge.

21.   Evaluate the claim that the human condition is ambiguous.


22.   Explain and discuss the extent to which de Beauvoir justifies an “ethic of violence”.



Charles Taylor: The Ethics of Authenticity

23.   “The ethics of authenticity holds the ethical imperative to be true to one’s own self. Each person
      is seen as having his or her own mode of being human and is encouraged to realize this rather than
      conform to a pre-existing model or a pattern imposed from outside.” Discuss and evaluate.


24.   Explain and discuss the idea of soft despotism as a way of losing freedom.
