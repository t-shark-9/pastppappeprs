      Command term
      “Evaluate” requires candidates to make an appraisal by weighing up the strengths
      and weaknesses.

      Responses may include:
      Effect(s) on:
       Inflation
         - the price of imports will increase, leading to a decrease in SRAS and
            creating cost-push inflationary pressure (paragraph )
         - prices of exports will fall, leading to an increase in AD and creating
            demand-pull inflationary pressure (paragraph )
         - consumers will suffer from higher prices
       Employment/unemployment
         - the price of imports will increase, making domestic goods more attractive
            and so increasing employment in domestic industries
         - the price of imports will increase causing problems for producers who use
            imported inputs and possibly damaging employment (paragraph )
         - the price of exports will fall, leading to an increase in net exports and thus
            an increase in AD and so an increase in employment in export industries
            (depending on PED)

 Economic growth
  - if net exports rise, this will result in an increase in AD and economic growth
  - the falling exchange rate and increasing inflation may cause the government
    to raise interest rates (paragraph ) leading to a contraction of the
    economy
  - it may encourage greater FDI (if the rupee remains low) as costs of
    investment fall, eventually leading to growth
 Balance of payments
  - improvement in the current account balance which is badly needed
    (paragraphs  and )
  - the effect on the current account depends on the price elasticity of demand
    for imports and exports.
  - In the SR, demand for exports and imports likely to be inelastic, thus
    leading to a worsening of the current account
  - In the LR, demand for imports and exports likely to become more elastic,
    thus leading to an improvement in the current account (Marshall-Lerner
    condition and J-curve).

Any reasonable evaluation.

   - it may raise the price to producers who buy the imported chicken as an input
     for their final product
   - competition may diminish and local producers may become inefficient
   - it may lead to retaliation from other countries

           explaining that a fiscal stimulus would increase AD through increased
           government spending and/or lower direct taxes (increased household
           consumption), thus leading to high inflation.

For AD/AS, the vertical axis may be price level, average price level, general price
level or any abbreviations of these. The horizontal axis may be output, real
output, national output, real national output, national income, or any abbreviations
of these. A title is not necessary.

(d)   Using information from the text/data and your knowledge of economics,
      discuss the extent to which economic development is likely to be achieved in
      Nigeria in comparison to Senegal.                                            [8 marks]

      Examiners should be aware that candidates may take a different approach which,
      if appropriate, should be rewarded.

      Do not award beyond Level 2 if the answer does not contain reference to the
      information provided.

           There is basic knowledge/understanding.

       2   Relevant concepts are recognized and developed in reasonable depth.             3–5
           There is clear knowledge/understanding.
           There is some attempt at application/analysis.

       3   Relevant concepts are recognized and developed in reasonable depth.             6–8
           There is clear knowledge/understanding.
           There is effective application/analysis.
           There is synthesis/evaluation, supported by appropriate theory and evidence.

      Command term
      “Discuss” requires candidates to offer a considered and balanced review that
      includes a range of arguments, factors or hypotheses. Opinions or conclusions
      should be presented clearly and supported by appropriate evidence.

      Responses may include:
       a definition of economic development
       a comparison of HDI values noting that the HDI value is the same in both
        countries
       GNI per capita is notably higher in Nigeria, so that the education and health
        indices for Nigeria must be lower than Senegal
       the difference in GNI per capita may be exaggerated as up to 60% of Senegal's
        economy is informal (Paragraph )
       Senegal’s larger public expenditure on health as a percentage of GDP may
        contribute to higher economic development and may be responsible for its
        higher life expectancy
       Senegal’s larger expenditure on education as a percentage of GDP may
        contribute to higher economic development (Figure 1)
       In the long run, greater expenditure on health care and education may result in
        a healthier and more productive work force, contributing to greater economic
        growth and development
       PPC curve or LRAS curve to show effect of improvement in quality of labour
       Senegal’s lower Gini coefficient suggests a more equal distribution of income
        (Figure 1); so even though Senegal’s GNI per capita income is lower than
        Nigeria, income is more equally distributed

 Nigeria has a much higher percentage of people living in absolute poverty
  (Figure 1)
 While Nigeria has large reserves of natural resources (Paragraph ), it may be
  over-reliant on oil revenues as a source of economic growth; non-oil growth
  needed (Paragraph )
 Senegal’s economy may be more diversified (Paragraph ), meaning that it
  may be able to withstand global fluctuations in commodity prices
 Concern about poor governance in Nigeria, such that any benefits of economic
  growth may not translate into economic development
 Concern about infrastructure in both countries
 Use of data to make predictions of future economic development.
