1.   Describe the way in which Igloolik Inuit wayfinding has changed as a result of the
     increasing use of technology.                                                      [6 marks]

     This question requires a primarily descriptive answer. Candidates are required to give an account of
     how the use of GPS units and other technologies (snowmobiles in particular) have changed the way
     in which Igloolik Inuit orient themselves on land and at sea.

     GPS use enables less experienced and knowledgeable Igloolik Inuit to travel with relative ease,
     even when the weather is inclement and more traditional wayfinding techniques are difficult
     to utilize. It makes walrus hunting safer and less expensive. For Inuit elders it represents a
     complement to the traditional forms of wayfinding. In addition snowmobiles make travelling faster
     and hunting less time-consuming, enabling some Inuit to hunt part-time. More successful answers
     will note that all of these changes go hand-in-hand with other structural changes, such as the
     introduction of formal education and wage labour.

     At the same time, the excessive reliance on GPS units creates situations in which travelling in fact
     becomes more dangerous for Inuit who do not have traditional wayfinding knowledge as a backup
     because GPS units do not take into account such factors as the topography or the thickness of
     the ice. They also break easily in Arctic conditions.

     Better answers will include a general statement about the fact that the introduction of new
     technologies has had both positive and negative consequences, which have been unevenly
     distributed across members of a society and increased differences between people.

2.   Using theoretical perspectives, explain the consequences of the increasing use of
     technology on social relations and culture among the Igloolik Inuit.              [6 marks]

     There are several points in the text which can be drawn on to answer this question, but stronger
     answers will incorporate concepts and knowledge from social and cultural anthropology that are
     relevant to the analysis and interpretation of the passage.

     The relationship between technological changes on the one hand and, on the other, social relations
     and culture can be explained in many ways. Candidates may approach this question from general
     anthropological concepts and terms related to different themes (individuals, groups and society;
     societies and cultures in contact; economic organization and the environment and systems of
     knowledge). Socialization has become less straightforward, the socialization of younger Inuit has
     become more difficult, for the simple reason that travelling has become noisy, curtailing
     conversation. The apparent simplicity of the use of GPS has led to the potential devaluation of local
     environmental knowledge by younger hunters. Better candidates may surmise that this devaluation
     may be extended to the guardians of this knowledge, ie the elders.

     Culture is also affected by the increased use of technology. More straight forwardly, GPS units are
     endangering an entire system of knowledge that continues to be indispensible in cases where
     technology fails. It modifies the relationship with the physical land and the symbolic environment.
     Better responses will point out that these changes are occurring in the context of changing
     relationships to learning and to forms of activities such as work and leisure. Better responses will
     also explain that not all Inuit are of the same mind, with some embracing the GPS as amplification
     of human ability, while others are seeing it as a catalyst for a rift between generations.
     New technologies thus increase the diversification of culture.

     Candidates may recognize the point of view of the anthropologists which does not take sides.
     The authors highlight the local categories and understand them not as a separate domain but in their
     relation to the social structure.

     The question can be approached from different theoretical perspectives. The social production of
     knowledge can be analysed taking a conflict-centred perspective that gives account of the potential
     differences that arise between people. Also, a diachronic perspective may inform the authors’
     argument that a historical dimension is key to understanding the dynamic between technology and
     changing relationships to the environment. The use of a particularistic perspective is also a possible
     choice of explanation, in that the authors shy away from a universalistic technological determinism.

3.   Compare and contrast how modernity and tradition co-exist among the
     Igloolik Inuit with how modernity and tradition co-exist in one society that you
     have studied in detail.                                                          [8 marks]

     The target societies for this comparative question are varied and many. The question requires
     candidates to demonstrate that they understand that modernity and tradition are always intertwined
     in any society. The relationship between modernity and tradition may take many forms, allowing
     candidates to make comparisons of different kinds. The answers need not revolve around
     technology, but may focus on modernity and tradition in systems of knowledge, generational
     differences, the environment, or other dynamics.

     The measure of this answer lies in the way in which candidates compare and contrast and harness
     ethnographic knowledge, rather than it being a test of knowledge of a similar case study.
