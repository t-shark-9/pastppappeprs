                                             SECTION A

1.   (a)   Describe two methods of recruitment that GP may have used to recruit a new
           manager for The Imperial.                                                  [4 marks]

           GP may have used the following methods:
            internal recruitment (recruiting only within the existing employees, specifically
             targeting the ones in supervisory or mid-management positions)
            external recruitment through job advertisement (in Mombasa, or nationally or
             even internationally)
            external recruitment through a recruitment agency (for example, specializing in
             hotel management)
            personal recommendation (“word-of-mouth”) for example, from the previous
             manager or from a GP representative who had visited The Imperial
            accept any other relevant method.


           Mark as 2 + 2.

           Award [1 mark] for each method identified, and [1 mark] for the description of
           the relevance of that method to The Imperial. Award up to a maximum of
           [2 marks] per method.
                                               –8–               N14/3/BUSMT/HP1/ENG/TZ0/XX/M

(b)   Construct an organization chart showing the levels of hierarchy at
      The Imperial.                                                      [4 marks]

      Overall, the organization chart is likely to look like this:




      The names of the postholders (eg Martin, Susan, Guthoni) are not necessary.
      Candidates will not be penalized if they do not mention those names; however the
      names of the posts themselves (eg “Manager”, “Head of Housekeeping”) are
      essential.


      Award [1 mark] for identifying the top level of the hierarchy (“manager”; accept
      “general manager” or “CEO”).

      Award [1 mark] for identifying the middle level of the hierarchy ie middle
      management (“Head of Reception”, “Head of Housekeeping”; both titles do not
      need to be present; candidates could also add others such as “Head of
      Restaurant”).

      Award [1 mark] for identifying a lower level of the hierarchy.

      Award [1 mark] for the overall shape of the organization chart.

      N.B. do not reward GP as a level as the question is about The Imperial.

      Award up to a maximum of [4 marks].
                                            –9–              N14/3/BUSMT/HP1/ENG/TZ0/XX/M

(c)   Analyse the advantages and disadvantages for GP of using a SWOT analysis.            [7 marks]

      A SWOT analysis has several advantages:
       the acronym is well-known (strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, threats)
       the framework is easy to understand (positive aspects: strengths and
         opportunities; negative aspects: weaknesses and threats)
       it is an expected element of the study of any organization
       a key advantage of the model is that it covers both internal and external
         aspects.
      This is good for GP, as it provides a simple and yet comprehensive overview of
      internal aspects (such as the internal tensions and conflicts around Susan’s
      leadership style, as a weakness) and external ones (such as the increasing
      competition from other high-quality local hotels, as one of the threats).

      A SWOT analysis however has several disadvantages:
       it would only give a snapshot of The Imperial at a particular time (for example,
        the liquidity problems, as a weakness, are only relevant during certain months
        of the year)
       it would also need to be revised regularly, following changes in the internal
        environment (for example if the quality of the hotel was deteriorating, as a new
        weakness) or in the external environment (for example, if tourism to Mombasa
        was suddenly decreasing or stopping, following an outburst of terrorist
        activity)
       it produces many ideas, but without any sense of priority nor solution or
        decision
       it is also likely to be based on opinions and therefore subject to bias.

      Accept any other relevant advantage and disadvantage with relevant analysis.


      N.B. candidates are not asked to do a SWOT analysis. The question is about the
      advantages and disadvantages of using the model.

      If an answer only consists of a SWOT analysis, award a maximum of [2 marks].

      If an answer is one-sided award a maximum of [5 marks].

      If an answer has no context award a maximum of [3 marks].

      Marks should be allocated according to the markbands on page 3.

2.   (a)   Martin constructed a position map (line 60). With reference to The Imperial,
           describe what this position map may look like.                               [4 marks]

           The position map is a diagram which shows a product (or in this case:
           an organization, The Imperial) in relation to its competitors (other local hotels).
           Martin will have chosen two key variables for the axes x and y (for example price
           and quality, or reputation and price), with scores ranging from low to high.
           Martin will have positioned The Imperial on that diagram (hence the name
           “position map”) as well as the other hotels it competes with.

           Accept any other relevant description.


           Award [1 mark] for each valid element of the answer, up to a maximum of
           [4 marks].

           N.B. candidates are not asked to draw a position map. They may do so if they
           wish, in order to illustrate their answer. Candidates will not be penalized if they
           do not draw the diagram. The command term is “describe” so candidates’
           answers could be textual. If a diagram has no reference to The Imperial, award a
           maximum of [2 marks]. For [4 marks] the diagram would need to be
           fully-labelled, as illustrated below. (The chosen axes and the position of
           The Imperial will vary.)
                                                    – 11 –                N14/3/BUSMT/HP1/ENG/TZ0/XX/M

(b)   Using Maslow’s motivation theory, explain two reasons why Martin had
      applied for the job of manager at The Imperial.                      [4 marks]

      Martin was working as a receptionist, then Head of Reception, at The Imperial.
      He had a full-time job, so to use Maslow’s motivation theory, his lower-order
      needs were fulfilled (physiological needs: food, shelter; safety needs: security,
      income).

      The case study also mentions the fact that he has a wife called Anima and two
      lovely daughters, so his love/belonging needs are fulfilled as well.

      For Martin, applying for the job of manager was an ideal way to fulfil his needs in
      terms of esteem (self-esteem, achievement, respect by others) and even
      self-actualization: pride to be “managing the hotel where his father had been a
      groundskeeper years earlier” (lines 46–47).

      Mark as 2 + 2.

      Award [1 mark] for each valid reason identified and [1 mark] for each
      explanation (with a direct link to Maslow). Award up to a maximum of

      N.B. candidates are not asked to draw Maslow’s pyramid of needs. They may do
      so if they wish. Candidates will not be penalized if they do not draw it. If an
      answer only consists of a diagram, award a maximum of [2 marks].

(c)   With reference to The Imperial and to one other business that you have
      studied, analyse the importance of leadership styles in an organization. [7 marks]

      Leadership styles: autocratic, laissez-faire and democratic are important in all
      organizations. They help understand and explain how managers (both senior
      managers and middle managers) relate to their employees.

      Leadership styles at The Imperial: Susan is rather autocratic (which explains the
      tensions with the cleaners that she manages, and even the threat of industrial
      action), whereas Martin appears as more conciliatory (which is typical of a
      laissez-faire or situational leadership style). In the case of Susan and Guthoni, the
      misunderstandings that have happened might be based more on a lack of
      communication (if Susan had known about Guthoni’s health problems, she might
      have reacted differently, not dismissing her) rather than on Susan’s leadership
      style alone.

      The same ideas about leadership can be observed in other organizations;
      leadership styles are largely due to the personality of the leader, though other
      factors may come into play, such as the organization’s culture (for example:
      employees’ expectations, or their experience with previous managers).
      Leadership styles are important to a certain extent, however they are often based
      on stereotypes. The reality of leadership is more complex.

      Accept any other relevant analysis.

      N.B. by contrasting leadership styles, candidates can implicitly develop ideas of
      importance.


      If only one leadership style is analysed award a maximum of [5 marks].

      If no application to The Imperial award a maximum of [3 marks].

      Marks should be allocated according to the markbands on page 3.
                                                 – 13 –           N14/3/BUSMT/HP1/ENG/TZ0/XX/M

3.   (a)   Describe the importance of monitoring the cash flow at The Imperial.                  [4 marks]

           Cash flow is the movement of money in and out of a business. It can refer to
           actual cash flows or forecast cash flows.

           Monitoring cash flow is important to avoid cash shortages which could lead to
           liquidity problems, ie a situation where the business does not have enough money
           to pay its bills and debtors. It is also useful in managing expenditure, planning
           and decision making.

           In the case of The Imperial, cash inflow mainly comes from the hotel operations
           (rooms), as well as other services (restaurant, special events); Martin calls them
           “profit centres” (line 67). Cash outflow will include all expenditure (staff wages,
           energy bills, maintenance etc).

           Cash-flow problems can happen at The Imperial in the short term because of the
           seasonality of hotel operations: in some months of the year, The Imperial has
           fewer customers (so less cash inflow) but still has substantial cash outflow – this
           imbalance is the reason why Martin needs to “implement strategies for dealing
           with those liquidity problems” (line 66).

           Accept any other relevant description.


           Award [1–2 marks] for a limited answer that conveys partial knowledge and
           understanding. Such an answer is likely to define cash flow [1 mark], and make
           reference to the factors influencing cash flow [1 mark], but without considering
           the importance of monitoring the cash flow.

           Award [3–4 marks] for a full, clear description that conveys knowledge and
           understanding of the importance of monitoring cash flow at The Imperial.
           For [4 marks] the answer will refer precisely to the case study.

(b)   With reference to Craig Chapman’s orphanage and to one other non-profit
      organization that you have studied, explain two objectives of non-profit
      organizations.                                                           [4 marks]

      Non-profit organizations may have different objectives (which, by definition, are
      not about making profit). It could be a humanitarian motivation, as in the case of
      Craig Chapman’s orphanage. It could also be for lobbying/campaigning purposes,
      either on a global scale (in the case of pressure groups such as Amnesty
      International and Greenpeace), or on a local scale (in the case of action groups
      protesting, for example, against the construction of a new airport or motorway).

      Accept any other relevant objectives and relevant explanation.


      Mark as 2 + 2.

      Award [1 mark] for each relevant objective identified, and [1 mark] for the
      development/exemplification of that objective. Award up to a maximum of
      [2 marks] per objective.

(c)   Examine how changes in the external environment may impact upon
      The Imperial’s operations.                                      [7 marks]

      Changes in the external environment may include a range of aspects, some that
      are identified through a PEST analysis (political changes, economic changes,
      socio-cultural changes, technological changes).

      Changes that are specific to the business environment in which The Imperial
      operates include:

      Political: Although Kenya is a stable country, political turmoil is always possible
      (as in the neighbouring countries, see lines 15–16), which could lead to a decrease
      in the number of foreign tourists going to Mombasa. This would negatively affect
      the operations of The Imperial (and the hotel’s profit levels); in turn, GP would
      have to review the target profits (line 24) and the objectives.

      Economic: Changes to the economy may have two dimensions: improved
      economic conditions in the countries from which customers originate could have a
      positive impact on The Imperial. Changing economic conditions in Kenya could
      have an impact on interest rates, exchange rates, wages. All of which have an
      impact on The Imperial’s operations costs and therefore profits.

      Sociocultural changes: All sorts of possibilities. For example, if The Imperial
      were featured in a very famous film, thousands of international tourists would
      want to go there (and Martin could then try to push for faster renovation and
      modernization of parts of the hotel, to cater for the sharp increase in demand, or
      he could raise The Imperial’s prices substantially).

      Technological changes: The Imperial’s competitors are already far more advanced
      technologically. Customers, too, use technology much more for finding hotels
      and booking them. If The Imperial does not keep up to date it will lose further
      market share.

      N.B. competitor’s behaviour can be considered as an impact.

      Accept any other relevant examination.


      N.B. to reach the highest markband, candidates must refer to more than one type
      of change.

      For an answer with no context award a maximum of [3 marks].

      For only one change award a maximum of [4 marks].

      Award a maximum of [2 marks] for internal factors.

      Marks should be allocated according to the markbands on page 3.

                                            SECTION B

4.   (a)   “They [the employees] decided to go on strike…” (line 114). Describe two
           methods, other than a strike or negotiations, that the employees at The
           Imperial could use in order to achieve their objectives.                 [4 marks]

           The employees could use methods such as go-slow, work-to-rule and overtime
           ban:
            “go-slow” (also called “slowdown”) is a form of industrial action
             (“job action”) whereby employees perform their duties but with a reduction in
             efficiency or productivity; for example in the hotel, the employees who clean
             the rooms would still do it, but could spend 30 minutes instead of 20 minutes
             for one room.
            “work-to-rule” (also called “Italian strike”) is a form of industrial action
             whereby employees strictly observe the rules and clauses of their contract, and
             may follow all regulations very closely, which may be disruptive for
             The Imperial – for example in the restaurant, all waiters could sit down and
             stop working for 15 minutes, in the middle of the service, saying “our contract
             states we are allowed 15 minutes break every 3 hours”.
            “overtime ban” is a form of industrial action whereby employees limit their
             working time to the contractual minimum, and refuse to do extra-work
             (overtime) even when they are asked to do so (and could be paid extra); for
             example the employees could refuse to work overtime to replace Guthoni who
             has been dismissed.

           Accept any other relevant method such as conciliation/arbitration (but not both),
           resigning on mass, but not forming a trade union.


           Mark as 2 + 2.

           Award [1 mark] for each relevant method identified and [1 mark] for the
           description of that method in the context of The Imperial. Award up to a
           maximum of [2 marks] per method.

           N.B. the second mark is for an application to the context of The Imperial
           (as opposed to a generic definition).
                                            – 17 –             N14/3/BUSMT/HP1/ENG/TZ0/XX/M

(b)   “Once a year, the manager and a representative from GP would meet to
      calculate the break-even quantity…” (lines 24–25). Explain two limitations of
      using a break-even analysis for GP and The Imperial.                          [4 marks]

      A break-even analysis has several limitations:
       Prices, revenues and costs are assumed to be constant, but in reality, this may
        not be the case.
       Break-even analysis assumes that fixed costs are constant, but for example the
        land taxes paid to the Kenyan government could change.
       Likewise, it assumes a linearity in variable costs, which may ignore economies
        of scale (or diseconomies of scale) which could happen in the restaurant
        (for example with bulk buying).
       The Imperial could also have a range of prices for the rooms, or offer discounts
        – price elasticity is not taken into account.
       Other factors may also impact upon the forecasts. Prices and costs are
        estimates/forecasts that may not be realistic.

      Accept any other relevant limitation with explanation.


      Mark as 2 + 2.

      Award [1 mark] for each relevant limitation and [1 mark] for each explanation.
      Award up to a maximum of [2 marks] per limitation.

      If there is no relevance to GP or The Imperial award a maximum of [2 marks].
                                            – 18 –            N14/3/BUSMT/HP1/ENG/TZ0/XX/M

(c)   Explain why The Imperial should develop and implement new strategies
      designed to change customer perceptions.                             [4 marks]

      The Imperial’s competitive position is in decline. New hotels with more modern
      images are growing rapidly. The Imperial’s market share is declining. Something
      needs to be done to attract customers. The current perception is one of being old
      and out of date.

      An entire paragraph explains that the hotel has long-term marketing challenges
      (lines 48 to 61). A key problem is the image of the hotel, with its “colonial
      charm” (line 52) looking “old-fashioned” (line 53). Martin’s three strategic
      options all imply some changes in the product itself, even with a new name
      (line 134) as the name The Imperial refers to a colonial past that may deter some
      potential customers (although some others may precisely seek this). It is not clear
      who the hotel is targeting; Martin could identify his precise target markets and
      communicate with them, which would help him change their perceptions: if there
      is a demand for an old-fashioned colonial charm, this is what he should
      emphasize, as its history gives The Imperial a USP that all the brand new,
      modern, high-tech hotels do not have.


      Award [1 mark] for each valid point and [1 mark] for each explanation up to a
      maximum of [2 marks] per point.

      N.B. candidates are not asked to explain four separate points.

      If there is no reference to The Imperial award a maximum of [2 marks].
                                             – 19 –            N14/3/BUSMT/HP1/ENG/TZ0/XX/M

(d)   Evaluate two alternative methods of non-financial rewards, other than
      empowerment, that Martin could use at The Imperial.                   [8 marks]

      Martin could use the following methods:
       job enrichment
       job enlargement
       teamwork
       delegation (although not on syllabus, it is acceptable if candidates suggest
          using this)
      (fringe benefit payments are regarded as “financial rewards”).

      Accept other relevant methods of non-financial reward.

      Job enrichment means that the employee would have a wider range and
      complexity of tasks – for example a cleaner could have the potential to manage
      their own workload, or carry out different duties and would gradually be given
      tasks to help the team of receptionists, widening his/her area of work and
      competence (literally “making their job richer”). The hotel would benefit, as this
      person is likely to be more motivated and loyal to the organization (and maybe
      less likely to go on strike, or act against the interests of Martin and The Imperial)
      – however they would also require some training.

      Job enlargement means that employees would have greater scope in their jobs, for
      example a room cleaner could clean the restaurant as well as rooms. This would
      not necessarily mean gaining extra experience so employees might feel exploited.
      It may be difficult in a hotel as the jobs are already being done and without
      growth there would not be more work to do.

      Teamwork can be beneficial all round. Most people enjoy being part of a team
      (Maslow, belonging) and it would be easier for managers to manage and
      implement change. Teamwork would suit a hotel, eg teams of cleaners, teams of
      receptionists etc. However, it might introduce non-productive competition and
      might not suit everyone.

      Accept any other relevant evaluation eg job rotation, staff development provided
      these are linked to the employee, not The Imperial, improved working conditions.


      N.B. if the candidate evaluates only one method of non-financial reward, award a
      maximum of [5 marks].

      For a one-sided discussion award a maximum of [5 marks].
      For unsupported judgment award a maximum of [6 marks].
      For non-contextualized answers award a maximum of [3 marks].
      For financial rewards only, award a maximum of [2 marks].

      Marks should be allocated according to the markbands on page 4.

                                               SECTION C

5.   (a)   Copy the network diagram from Item 1 and identify the critical path.                    [2 marks]




           N.B. no marks are awarded for just copying the critical path diagram.

           Award [1 mark] if a candidate marks some path, or indicates some sense of what
           is the critical path (eg the incorrect path is identified). For example, [1 mark] can
           be awarded for stating one correct activity on the critical path.

           Award [2 marks] if the candidate marks, or states the correct critical path. Award
           a maximum of [2 marks].

     (b)   With reference to Item 1:

           (i)    explain the purpose of the dummy activity X.                                     [2 marks]

                  X is a “dummy activity”.          Dummy activity nodes allow accurate
                  demonstration of task dependency when one task is dependent on an activity
                  (C is dependent only on the completion of A) while other activities are
                  dependent on the completion of more than one activity (both D and E are
                  dependent on the completion of both A and B). Without dummy nodes,
                  certain types of task dependency could not be shown.

                  Award [1 mark] if the candidate provides some limited explanation.
                  Award [2 marks] if the candidate clearly explains the purpose of the dummy
                  activity. Candidates may receive [2 marks] for a clear explanation even if
                  they do not use the term “dummy activity”.

           (ii)   calculate the free float and the total float for activity B.                     [2 marks]

                  Free float  EST(next activity)  duration  EST  7  4  0  3 months

                  Total float  LFT  duration  EST  8  4  0  4 months

                  Award [2 marks] if the candidate correctly calculates both floats. If a
                  candidate calculates only total float or only free float award a maximum of
                  [1 mark].

                  N.B. if the candidate demonstrates some understanding of calculating floats
                  award [1 mark].

(c)   Using the information from Item 3, calculate:

      (i)    the average rate of return for the six-year forecast for modified
             Option 1 (show all your working).                                 [2 marks]

             working with mistakes or partial working.

             Award [1 mark] for the correct answer (no working).

      (ii)   the payback period for modified Option 2.                            [1 mark]

(d)   Analyse NWF’s human resource plan for The Imperial.                                  [9 marks]

      N.B. candidates could use the HR information on page 4 and/or Item 2 in
      their response.

      NWF’s human resource plan has certain advantages and disadvantages for
      The Imperial or any other relevant stakeholder. The main advantages could
      include:
       The human resources policies at The Imperial would align exactly with policies
         at all other businesses owned by the NWF of Kumali. Such alignment makes
         for clear lines of communication as well as for alignment of aims, vision,
         strategy, tactics, and operational decisions throughout NWF businesses.
       The Imperial would have staff trained to the highest standards, with a “global
         face”, to advance the reputation of NWF of Kumali businesses, not just
         The Imperial.
       Dismissing all or some of the former staff (modified Option 1, 2) The Imperial
         would have very few legacy issues and could shape a new corporate culture
         consistent with its corporate culture at other NWF of Kumali businesses.
       The Imperial should have among the finest hotel staff in the world.
       Promoting Susan may help, Martin may keep his job.

      The disadvantages of the human resource plan could include:
       Its implementation is expensive at all stages: recruitment, induction, training,
        ongoing professional development.
       By having a “global” workforce, The Imperial will lose some of its character as
        a Kenyan “institution.”
       The old corporate culture, for all its problems, included great pride in working
        for the hotel and, in some cases (like Martin), pride that there was a family
        connection to The Imperial.
       The new, highly trained employees would be attractive to other hotels, who
        might try to recruit them away after The Imperial had spent so much money
        recruiting, inducting, training, etc, them.
       Dismissing all, or some of the staff would create problems with the people
        involved and create adverse publicity. Some may also regard this as unethical.

      Accept any other relevant analysis.

      N.B. in making an argument, most candidates will probably stress either the
      advantages or the disadvantages. “Balance” in the response should include some
      attention to both advantages and disadvantages as well as some attention to more
      than one kind of issue (cost, calibre of hotels, corporate culture, etc).

      For an answer without balance award a maximum of [6 marks].
      For an answer without reference to NWF’s plans award a maximum of [3 marks].

      Marks should be allocated according to the markbands on page 5.

(e)   Using information contained in the case study and Items 1 to 5, recommend to
      NWF which modified Option 1 or 2 should they implement.                      [12 marks]
      It should be recognized that, given time constraints, answers are likely to include a
      much narrower range of issues and concepts than identified below. There is no
      “correct” answer. Examiners must be prepared to award full marks to answers which
      synthesize and evaluate even if they do not examine all the stimulus materials. It is to
      be expected that the answer will include relevant information from the case study,
      extension material and Items 1 to 5 and employ a range of business concepts, tools
      and terminology.

      Modified Option 1 key issues:
       18 month closure, lost revenues and disruption.
       employees lose their jobs with no guarantee of being re-employed – would they
        want to go back?
       it would be difficult for employees to eventually meet NWF’s HR guidelines.
       brand new hotel, loses identity.
       Susan gets major role, taking Martin’s work. What would Martin think? Could he
        work with Susan?
       much bigger investment than modified Option 2.
       payback slightly longer than modified Option 2, ARR better.
       lots of scope for delay of project.
       data shows growing markets, increasing hotel revenues.
       what’s the market like for a top of the range hotel?

      Modified Option 2 key issues:
       at least it gives the existing staff a chance to find other jobs.
       the retained staff could improve their chances of retaining their jobs through
        working hard, proving themselves or retraining.
       much shorter disruption period (9 months) with less loss of revenue in years 1
        and 2.
       housing market very mixed:
        o positive aspects include a booming property market, rising prices, evidence of
            overseas investment.
        o negative aspects include: speculation which may not continue
        o possible downward pressure on property prices from interest rate rises,
            improvements in overseas markets.
       there is evidence of demand for apartments.
       the hotel side of the business would benefit from the golf course and developments
        making Kenya an attractive golfing destination.
       risk would be spread between two enterprises.
       less attractive financially, although smaller investment than modified Option 1.
      Award a maximum of [7–9 marks] where both the case study and Items 1 to 5 have
      not been used, ie only one set of data.
      Accept any recommendation as to which modified option to choose.
      Award a maximum of [10 marks] if there is no substantiated recommendation.
      Award a maximum of [7 marks] where there is no balanced discussion.
      Award a maximum of [6 marks] if only one option is considered.
      Award a maximum of [4 marks] if there is no use of relevant data.
