                                                      The Australian dollar

           The Australian dollar is very strong against the United States (US) dollar and has reached its
            highest value against the British pound and the euro since 1992.

           The world demand for coal, iron ore, and natural gas is rapidly increasing. Australia has these
            resources in abundance. This has led to an extraordinary boom in the construction of new
            mining facilities in Australia that is likely to run for at least 10 years. It has had a huge effect
            on domestic economic growth and has also threatened inflation.

           With its stable economic outlook and high interest rates, Australia has proved to be a magnet
            for foreign investors since 2002, and this has had a significant impact on the exchange rate.
            The global surge in foreign direct investment and portfolio investment is a sign of international
            confidence in the economy but it has come at a cost, and with risks. The rise of the exchange
            rate has created hardships for domestic exporters of goods and services other than resources,
            and the tourist industry.

           In the context of the resources boom, the high exchange rate helps to make the boom
            less inflationary. It also lowers the prices of imports for those consumers and businesses that
            buy them.

           Structural change is occurring in the Australian economy as domestic firms adjust to a
            high Australian dollar. It creates pressure for resources – capital and labour – to shift from
            manufacturing and service export industries to the expanding mining sector. The result is a
            change in Australia’s comparative advantage.

           Everything suggests that the Australian dollar will stay strong, even as export prices increase.
            The huge spending on mining construction over the years will require a lot of foreign financial
            capital to flow into Australia, helping keep upward pressure on the exchange rate.

                                       Increase tariff on foreign chicken

           In the country of Trinidad and Tobago, it has been reported that the price of domestic chicken
            (poultry) will not increase in the near future, even if the government introduces a higher tariff
            on imported whole chicken from the United States.

           The Poultry Association of Trinidad and Tobago (PATT) hosted a news conference to reduce
            public concerns about reports of an increase in poultry prices. The association says that
            there will be an increase in prices, but this will only be on imported chicken. However,
            economists know that this will not be the case.

           The association is insisting that the current 40 % tariff on imported chicken be increased
            to 80 % to make things fairer between domestic and imported chicken. They argue that
            Trinidad and Tobago’s poultry industry has been operating at a major disadvantage in
            comparison with other Caribbean nations. For instance, Barbados has a 180 % tariff on
            imported chicken, Jamaica 280 % and Guatemala 257 %.

           The President of PATT said imported chicken was hurting the local industry, with some firms
            in danger of shutting down. “Chickens are remaining longer on farms, and it’s not because we
            want to keep them as pets, it’s because they are not selling,” he said.

           A domestic poultry producer said the local industry had to compete with goods that came
            from the United States, the European Union and Brazil, which were heavily subsidized by
            their governments. “We don’t need subsidies and the government cannot afford to pay
            us any. We want the tariff. We don’t want to ban imported chicken; once the tariff is on,
            everything will be fine.”

           Trinidad and Tobago imports two types of chicken. The first type, “mechanically deboned
            meat (MDM)”, is used to make processed meat products, such as chicken sausages and chicken
            burgers. The second type is whole chickens. There is a quota on MDM chickens at 0 % tariff
            because domestic producers have accepted that they cannot meet the local demand by firms.

           However, there is a concern that the importers are abusing this tariff-free access to bring
            whole chicken into the domestic market. Data from customs show that 3.29 million kilograms
            of chicken was imported in August, but almost 75 % was brought in duty-free.

           Local chicken sells for approximately $4.50 per kilogram while imported chicken, according to
            PATT’s information from Customs, is about $1 to $2 per kilogram. “That just covers the cost
            of shipping the chicken. If these figures are correct, there is something very wrong,” said the
            domestic producer.

           The poultry industry makes up 60 % of the agriculture sector in Trinidad and Tobago and
            generates over 10 000 jobs and $1 billion in revenue.

		(ii)            List two reasons why the government might wish to protect the domestic

      (b)   Using an appropriate diagram, explain the likely effect that the suggested
            increase in the tariff (paragraph ) would have on the domestic production
            of poultry.                                                                    [4 marks]

            continue to damage the domestic poultry industry.                              [4 marks]

            market.                                                                        [8 marks]

3.       Study the extract and data below and answer the questions that follow.


                        Mozambique to produce its own antiretroviral (ARV) drugs

           Mozambique’s health minister announced that the first ARV drugs produced in Mozambique,
            in partnership with Brazil, will be ready by July 2012. In doing so, it will be the first
            African country – rather than private sector supplier – to produce its own supply of the drug,
            which can allow people who have HIV to live for many years.

           Until 2011, a handful of drug multinational corporations have battled to keep in place patents
            that give drug companies the exclusive right to manufacture and sell the ARV drugs. This has
            allowed them to control the highly profitable market. Although most African countries aim to
            provide free ARV drugs to their citizens, the high costs of importing them, along with a recent
            cut in funding from international foundations, means that many are struggling.

           A total of 10.6 million people in Sub-Saharan Africa are in need of ARV treatment but only
            37 % currently have it. In Mozambique, 15 % of people aged 15 to 49 have HIV. Brazil has
            been producing its own ARV drugs since 1993 and now provides free versions of the drugs
            to everyone in the country suffering from HIV.

           Mozambique is the biggest beneficiary of aid from Brazil, which has invested heavily in its
            infrastructure, mining, health, agriculture and educational sectors.

           The health minister signed an agreement with Brazil to co-produce ARV drugs in a factory in
            the southern city of Matola, Mozambique. Brazil will provide training for Mozambican staff
            in the production, management and quality control of the drugs. He was pleased because more
            people in Mozambique will soon have access to the ARV drugs.

           Other countries in Africa are also taking steps to produce their own drugs. As new
            international agreements on intellectual property are going to make drugs more expensive,
            countries are now trying to produce the ARV drugs themselves. This is a positive move
            for Mozambique.
