In your response you are expected to:

   • develop a response in an organized way using clear, precise language, which is appropriate
     to philosophy
   • identify pertinent issues regarding the philosophical activity raised in the text
   • take an independent position about the nature of philosophical activity in relation to the ideas
     developed in the text

Unseen text – exploring philosophical activity

Read the text below then write a response to it (of approximately 800 words).                 Your response is
worth [30 marks]. In your response include:

   • a concise description of philosophical activity as presented in the text
   • an exploration of the pertinent issues regarding philosophical activity raised in the text, relating this
     to your experience of doing philosophy throughout the whole course
   • appropriate references to the text that illustrate your understanding of philosophical activity
   • your personal evaluation of the issues regarding philosophical activity raised in the text.


              There are some things which we can do without understanding what we are doing; not only
      things which we do with our bodies, like locomotion and digestion, but even things which we do with
      our minds, like writing a poem or recognizing a face. But when that which we do is in the nature
      of thinking, it begins to be desirable, if we are to do it well, that we should understand what we are
 5    trying to do. Scientific and historical thought could never go very far unless scientists and historians
      reflected on their own work, tried to understand what they were aiming at, and asked themselves how
      best to attain it. Most of all, this is true of philosophy. It is possible to raise and solve philosophical
      problems with no very clear idea of what philosophy is, what it is trying to do, and how it can best
      do it; but no great progress can be made until these questions have been asked and some answer
10    to them given.
             Philosophy, moreover, has this peculiarity: that reflection upon it is part of itself. The theory of
      poetry may or may not be of service to a poet—opinions on that question have differed—but it is no
      part of poetry. The theory of science and the theory of history are not parts of science and of history;
      if scientists and historians study these things, they study them not in their capacity as scientists or
15    historians, but in their capacity as philosophers. But the theory of philosophy is itself a problem for
      philosophy; and not only a possible problem, but an inevitable problem, one which sooner or later it
      is bound to raise.
             For these two reasons, both because it is among his/her proper subjects of study and because
      without it his/her chance of success in his/her other subjects is diminished, the philosopher is under an
20    obligation to study the nature of philosophy itself. Towards that study the present essay is intended as
      a contribution; its primary purpose being to consider the question of what philosophy is.
             There are various lines by which that question might be approached. One of these would
      depend upon the relation between an object and the thought of it. Any special science, we might
      argue, must have something special to study, and whatever peculiarities it presents in aim and method
25    must be due to peculiarities in its object; from this point of view it would appear that the most hopeful
      way of approaching our question is first to define the proper object of philosophical thought, and then


8814-5603
                                                              –3–                        N14/3/PHILO/HP3/ENG/TZ0/XX

      to deduce from this definition the proper methods it should follow. But this line of approach would offer
      no hope of success except to a person convinced that he/she already possessed an adequate conception
      of this object; convinced, that is, that his/her philosophical thought had already reached its goal. To
30    me at least, therefore, this path is closed; for though I believe that certain ways of philosophizing are
      more fruitful than others, I know of no philosophy that is not a voyage of exploration whose end—the
      adequate knowledge of its proper object—remains as yet unreached.
             A second way, which might be open even if the first were closed, depends on the relation
      between means and end. We might ask what kind of results philosophy hopes or desires to achieve;
35    and, having thus laid down its programme, consider what means can be found of realizing it. But
      although every philosopher has some idea of what he/she hopes to achieve, this idea varies from
      person to person and in the same person from time to time; nor could it be otherwise, for any progress
      in thought must bring with it a certain change in the conception of its own end, the goal of one stage
      being the starting-point of the next. If I followed this method, therefore, I could not hope or even
40    desire to command the assent of my readers, or even my own assent hereafter.
             There remains a third line of approach. Philosophy never, with any of us, reaches its ultimate
      goal; and with its temporary gains it never rests content: it is an activity which goes on in our minds,
      and we are able to distinguish it from among others, and to recognize it by certain peculiar marks.
      These marks characterize it as an activity or process; they are, therefore, peculiarities of procedure;
45    and accordingly it is possible to answer the question of what philosophy is by giving an account of
      philosophical method.
             This suggests taking philosophical thought as a special kind of fact, scrutinizing it, and
      describing the procedure which it is found to exhibit. But that would not be enough. The question
      of what philosophy is, cannot be separated from the question of what philosophy ought to be.
50    When we distinguish philosophy from the other activities of our minds, we do not think of it as
      something that merely happens in us like the circulation of the blood; we think of it as something
      we try to do, an activity which we are trying to bring into conformity with an idea of what it ought
      to be. Consequently, when we set out to give an account of philosophical method, what we are
      trying to describe is not so much a method actually followed by ourselves or anyone else, as a
55    method which in our philosophical work we are trying to follow, even if we never entirely succeed.
      Hence an account of philosophical method must attempt to satisfy two conditions. First, to avoid a
      kind of philosophical utopianism, it must keep in touch with facts, and never lose sight of the question
      of what methods have actually been used by philosophers of the past. Secondly, to avoid replacing a
      philosophical question with a historical one, it must treat all such precedents as mere preliminaries to
60    the main question: the final appeal must be to our own experience of philosophical work and to our
      consciousness that when we are engaged in it these are the principles which we are trying to follow.
