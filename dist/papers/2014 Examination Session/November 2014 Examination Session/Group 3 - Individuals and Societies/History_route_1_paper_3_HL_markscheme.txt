Paper 3 markbands: The following bands provide a précis of the full markbands for paper 3 published in the
History guide (2008) on pages 77–81. They are intended to assist marking but must be used in conjunction
with the full markbands found in the guide. For the attention of all examiners: if you are uncertain about
the content/accuracy of a candidate’s work please contact your team leader.

 18–20: Answers are clearly focused with a high degree of the awareness of the question and may challenge
        it successfully. Knowledge is extensive, accurately applied and there may be a high level of
        conceptual ability. Evaluation of different approaches may be present as may be understanding of
        historical processes as well as comparison and contrast where relevant. Evaluation is integrated into
        the answer. The answer is well-structured and well-focused. Synthesis is highly developed.
 15–17: Answers are clearly structured and focused, have full awareness of the demands of the question, and
        if appropriate may challenge it. Accurate and detailed historical knowledge is used convincingly to
        support critical commentary. Historical processes such as comparison and contrast, placing events
        in context and evaluating different interpretations are used appropriately and effectively. Answers
        are well-structured and balanced and synthesis is well-developed and supported with knowledge and
        critical commentary.
 12–14: Answers are clearly focused on the demands of the question. Relevant in-depth knowledge is
        applied as evidence, and analysis or critical commentary are used to indicate some in-depth
        understanding but is not consistent throughout. Events are placed in context and there is sound
        understanding of historical processes and comparison and contrast. Evaluation of different
        approaches may be used to substantiate arguments presented. Synthesis is present but not always
        consistently integrated. Focus on AO3 and AO4.
 9–11: Answers indicate that the question is understood but not all implications considered. Knowledge is
        largely accurate. Critical commentary may be present. Events are generally placed in context, and
        historical processes, such as comparison and contrast, are understood. There is a clear attempt at a
        structured approach. Focus on AO1, AO2 and AO4. Responses that simply summarize the views
        of historians cannot reach the top of this markband.
 7–8: The demands of the question are generally understood. Relevant, historical knowledge is present
        but is unevenly applied. Knowledge is narrative or descriptive in nature. There may be limited
        argument that requires further substantiation. Critical commentary may be present. An attempt to
        place events in historical context and show an understanding of historical processes. An attempt at
        a structured approach, either chronological or thematic has been made.
 5–6: Answers indicate some understanding of the question, but historical knowledge is limited in quality
        and quantity. Understanding of historical processes may be present but underdeveloped. The
        question is only partially addressed.
 3–4: There is little understanding of the question. Historical knowledge is present but the detail is
        insufficient. Historical context or processes are barely understood and there are little more than
        poorly substantiated assertions.
 1–2: Answers do not meet the demands of the question and show little or no evidence of appropriate
        structure. There is little more than unsupported generalization.
 0:     Answers not meeting the requirements of descriptors should be awarded no marks.

 Examiners and moderators are reminded of the need to apply the markbands that provide the “best fit” to
 the responses given by candidates and to award credit wherever it is possible to do so. If an answer
 indicates that the demands of the question are understood and addressed but that not all implications are
 considered (eg, compare or contrast; reasons or significance; methods or success), then examiners should
 not be afraid of using the full range of marks allowed for by the markscheme: ie, responses that offer good
 coverage of some of the criteria should be rewarded accordingly.

Christianity c500–1300

1.   Examine the impact of the Benedictine rule on monastic organizations up to 900.

     The reasons for the establishment of the Benedictine rule may include but not be limited to: there
     was a need to organize and control the many monastic communities that were being established by
     individuals. The lack of organization led to lack of spiritual and moral discipline in some cases and
     also disputes over religious doctrine and belief within the Church. There was also a desire to make
     monastic organizations a more permanent part of the Church structure that would continue beyond
     the life of their founders.

     The results of the establishment of the Benedictine rule may include but not be limited to:
     monasteries were recognized as centres of Christian ideals of spirituality, asceticism and personal
     devotion. They were peaceful refuges from the violence, passion and cruelty of the world and
     demonstrated a society that was based on law and order, and self-control.

     Monasteries organized according to the Benedictine rule spread across Europe by the 8th century.
     Benedictine rule provided the basis of monastic organization in all parts of Western Europe.

     The respect they earned led to them acquiring great wealth and influence and expanding their roles
     to include hospitals, charitable organizations, schools, libraries and refuges from the hardship of
     life. They became a key element in the organization and structure of the western Church.

     When monastic reform became essential the reformers often looked to the Benedictine rule to
     provide inspiration for a more disciplined community.

2.   “The attempt by the Papacy to expand its temporal power was the most significant cause of
     the investiture crisis.” To what extent do you agree with this assessment?

     The points in support of the statement:
     The Papacy sought to establish itself as the supervisor of temporal rulers through the Dictatus
     Papae; this would challenge the Holy Roman Emperor and his claim to determine the appointment
     of the pope, furthermore the attempt by the Church to acquire control of Church revenue would be a
     blow to temporal rulers and their inability to appoint bishops would weaken their control over
     feudal territories which provided them with military power.

     The points to challenge the statement:
     The Investiture Crisis was a result of Church reform in which the Church sought to establish its
     spiritual independence and the right of the pope to dismiss bishops and be the sole source of
     appointments. This reversed the position and influence of secular rulers and sought to make the
     Church an independent spiritual and moral force. The issue of the pope as spiritually supreme
     challenged the concept of the Divine Right of Kings thus creating a conflict.

     Candidates should support their responses with relevant content – a narrative of the Investiture
     Crisis will not score well.

The Fatimids 909–1171

3.   Examine the internal and external causes of the fall of the Fatimid Empire.

     The internal causes for the fall of the Fatimid Empire may include but not be limited to: severe
     ethnic tension within the army led to outbreaks of civil war and insurrection. The army was a key
     to Fatimid power and this breakdown greatly undermined the regime. There were a number of
     famines which led to popular discontent with the leadership and a number of insurrections. A
     struggle for power amongst the leadership led to the seizure of power by the wazir who attempted to
     manipulate the succession to the caliphate. This led to many supporters of the Empire breaking
     away and refusing to support the new government.

     The external causes for the fall of the Fatimids may include but not be limited to: they were subject
     to a number of attacks from the Crusaders and the Byzantine Empire which led to extensive loss of
     territory in the Middle East and the Mediterranean. These losses also affected their trade and
     commercial activities. They were in conflict with the Seljuk Turks who were expanding their
     territory and also seeking to eliminate the Ismaili regime in order to expand and strengthen the
     power of the Sunni Orthodoxy. Powerful leaders such as Saladin attacked the Fatimids and ended
     their rule in 1171.

     The above material is an indication of what candidates may elect to write about in their
     responses. However, the list is not exhaustive and no set answer is required.

     “best fit” to the responses given by candidates and to award credit wherever it is possible to do so.


4.   “Fatimid ideology had little impact on the Islamic world.” To what extent do you agree with
     this statement?

     In support of the statement:
     The Fatimids had little impact on the Islamic world as their influence collapsed with their failure to
     take over the Caliphate and the collapse of their empire in the 12th century.
     The rise of the Sunni Orthodoxy under the Seljuks eliminated their influence and saw them
     condemned as a heretical group.
     Their association with the Assassins undermined their reputation as well.
     Their views were too liberal for the Islamic world which was becoming less tolerant.

     To challenge the statement:
     They established the city of Cairo as a major economic and intellectual centre which continued after
     their demise. They opened trade routes to Asia and in the Mediterranean. They remained as a
     significant breakaway group within the Islamic world promoting commerce and intellectual
     development.

     responses. However, the list is not exhaustive and no set answer is required.

     Examiners and moderators are reminded of the need to apply the markbands that provide the

Monarchies in England and France 1066–1223

5.   “English kings were more successful than French kings in establishing their power between
     1066 and 1137.” To what extent do you agree with this statement?

     Candidates will have to consider the success of English and French kings in establishing their
     power and assess which was more successful.

     With respect to English kings the work of William I and Henry I will be most noted. They were
     able to suppress all internal rebellions from the outset, the feudal system was reorganized to reduce
     the power of the nobles, force all landholders to swear allegiance to the king and retain large
     amounts of land in royal hands to provide for a powerful military force for the king. In addition
     royal castles were situated to promote control and barons were not allowed to build castles without
     permission of the ruler. The English monarchy operated a large royal bureaucracy of sheriffs and
     judicial, officials which enforced royal authority throughout the kingdom and supervised the actions
     of local authorities. Furthermore financial organization such as the Domesday Book and the Pipe
     rolls ensured that the kings had steady revenue and were able to collect taxes throughout the realm.
     This served to pay for the bureaucracy, an army and further expansions of royal power. England
     did not face any serious challenge to monarchical power during this time.

     In France the situation was different. The French kings held very little territory, sometimes less
     than some of their powerful vassals; this made it difficult for them to enforce their authority beyond
     their own lands. They also lacked extensive bureaucracies as they could not afford to develop
     administrative structures by which to expand their authority. Constant warfare occurred amongst
     various feudal lords and the kings were not able to restrain or prevent it. The fact that the king of
     England was also Duke of Normandy and ruled larger territories in France than the king of France
     and much more effectively showed how limited the French monarchy was. Improvements occurred
     under Louis VI who improved the royal bureaucracy and made alliances with the Church and the
     towns to increase his power and influence. The work of Abbott Suger helped to improve the royal
     administration. Louis was less successful in expanding his territory and disciplining his great
     vassals including the king of England.

     He was able to improve the administration in his own territories but was not successful in
     expanding his authority over the whole country. As such it is clear that French kings had not
     reached the level of power and authority exercised by English kings by 1137.

     The above material is an indication of what candidates may elect to write about in their
     responses. However, the list is not exhaustive and no set answer is required.

     Examiners and moderators are reminded of the need to apply the markbands that provide the
     “best fit” to the responses given by candidates and to award credit wherever it is possible to do so.

6.   Evaluate the reasons for the military victory of the kings of France over the kings of England
     by 1223.

     The French and English monarchy engaged in a lengthy struggle from 1154 onwards. The French
     monarchy was attempting to expand its territory by conquering land held by the English Angevin
     empire in France. This struggle involved the English monarchs Henry II, Richard I and John I and
     the French monarchs Louis VII and Phillip II. By 1223, the Angevin lands had been greatly
     reduced and the French monarchy had been successful in its campaign to expand.

     The reasons for the French victory may include but not be limited to: the Angevin lands in France
     were scattered and not administered as a unit. It required enormous time, energy and skill to
     administer them which few leaders could do successfully. The divisions in the Angevin family
     weakened their hold on the lands as some of Henry II’s sons made alliances with Louis VII and
     Phillip II, which weakened the English monarchy’s position. Richard’s absence on the Crusades
     allowed the French to attack and recapture many territories and his early death prevented him from
     recovering the land on his return.

     The financial problems of the English monarchy under John I led to increased taxes in France which
     caused revolts and unpopularity which Phillip II exploited. John’s unpopularity and lack of military
     skill caused him to suffer a number of defeats most notably at Bouvines. This was a major blow
     and caused the loss of much territory to France.

     It should also be noted that French victory was the result of greatly increased French power as a
     result of the policies of Phillip II which took advantage of English financial and military
     weaknesses and mobilized the power of France in a more effective manner. His skill, diplomacy
     and legal stratagems helped to defeat the English and recover large amounts of territory for France.

     responses. However, the list is not exhaustive and no set answer is required.

The Crusades 1095–1291

7.   “The Muslims’ military tactics played a minor role in their defeat of the crusading movement
     by 1291.” Discuss.

     This question deals with the reasons for the defeat of the Crusading movement. Candidates may
     wish to challenge the question but they must address the issue of military tactics in their response.

     The influence of Muslim military tactics may include but not be limited to: making use of their
     greater mobility to avoid direct confrontation with the heavy cavalry of the west. Western attempts
     to attack Muslim forces led to exhaustion and frustration and made their defeat easier as at Hattin.
     Muslim mobility allowed them to engage in raiding tactics which increasingly cut off Christian
     forces from each other by cutting lines of supply and communication. Muslim forces made use of
     their superior knowledge of the environment to launch attacks, avoid battle and defeat isolated
     Christian forces.

     The other factors that may be discussed as leading to the defeat of the Crusaders may include but
     not be limited to: failure of the western leaders and organizations to cooperate effectively, lack of
     support from Europe, declining European populations, poor relations with their former ally, the
     Byzantine Empire and increasing Muslim power, unity and leadership.

     The above material is an indication of what candidates may elect to write about in their
     responses. However, the list is not exhaustive and no set answer is required.

     Examiners and moderators are reminded of the need to apply the markbands that provide the
     “best fit” to the responses given by candidates and to award credit wherever it is possible to do so.


8.   Examine the reasons for the collapse of the Crusader States.

     The reasons for the collapse of the Crusader states may include: their failure to attract European
     immigrants to expand their power and territory. Their failure to form an effective alliance to
     support each other and increase their military power. Disputes among the rulers caused them to be
     isolated and vulnerable to attack. The failure of the Crusades after 1099 allowed Muslim power to
     grow and threaten them. The greatly increased power of the Muslim forces as a result of better
     unity and leadership proved too much for them. The loss of support from the Byzantine Empire
     was also a factor.

     responses. However, the list is not exhaustive and no set answer is required.

The Mongols 1200–1405

9.    Examine the reasons for the rise of Timur-I-Lang (Tamerlane 1370–1405) and evaluate his
      impact on the Islamic world.

      The reasons for Tamerlane’s rise may include but not be limited to: he was recognized as a very
      skilled military leader who was able to take advantage of the disputed succession in the Mongol
      Empire, he was recognized as a very intelligent individual who demonstrated skill in administration
      and was able to attract large following of individuals of all professions of different ethnic groups.
      He married a descendant of Genghis Khan to further improve his claim to power. The fact that he
      was a Muslim enabled him to attract further support.

      His effect on the Islamic world was significant but not necessarily permanent in all areas. He
      conquered vast territories from the Syria to India including Iran and all of central Asia, he was
      responsible for enormous destruction, millions of deaths and de-population of whole regions. He
      defeated the Mamluk and Ottoman states but on his death they reassumed their power so his impact
      was limited in those areas. He destroyed the Christian church in Asia including the Nestorian
      church which had been quite large until his time. His major impact was in central Asia in cities like
      Samarkand became highly civilized centres of art, architecture, science and literature. Tamerlane
      was a great conqueror but had little long-term impact except in central Asia.

10.   “Hülegü (1256–1265) had no long term impact on the Islamic world.” Discuss.

      Material in support of the statement may include: he failed to destroy Muslim power in the Middle
      East and was expelled by the Mamluks which preserved Muslim power in the region.
      He retreated to Central Asia and did not attempt to conquer Islamic territory after 1260.
      His failure to ally with the Crusaders helped protect Islamic power and territory.

      Material to challenge the statement may include: he destroyed the Abbasid Caliphate and ended the
      unity of the Islamic world, he destroyed Baghdad as a centre of government, scholarship and
      culture. His destruction of the library was a severe blow to Islamic scholarship at the time. He also
      damaged Damascus as an Islamic centre. He made the Mamluks the supreme power in the Islamic
      world and shifted the centre of Islam to the Middle East and North Africa.

Muslim, Christian and Jewish interactions in Spain 711–1492

11.   To what extent was Umayyad rule in Cordoba successful up to 1031?

      The reasons that Muslim rule may be considered successful may include: the development of a
      multicultural society where different faiths and cultures were respected, a thriving commercial
      system which expanded trade and industry and introduced numerous new products and techniques,
      exceptional developments in art and architecture, modern urban design.
      Intellectual development which created extensive libraries, attracted scholars and disseminated
      knowledge to the Islamic and European worlds.

      Reasons that it may not be considered successful: increasing friction within the government which
      led to collapse, excessive spending on luxury items which undermined the state and failure to
      achieve peaceful relations with the Christian states.

      The above material is an indication of what candidates may elect to write about in their
      responses. However, the list is not exhaustive and no set answer is required.

12.   Evaluate the reasons for the collapse of Arab rule on the Iberian Peninsula.

      Candidates must analyse the internal weaknesses of the Islamic kingdoms as well as the strength of
      the Christian opposition in order to provide a complete response.

      The internal weakness of al-Andalus may include but not be limited to: the collapse of the Umayyad
      caliphate in 1031 eliminated any hope of unity in the Islamic world. Struggles for power broke out
      which resulted in the emergence of dozens of small independent states within a few years. These
      states or taifas weakened each other by engaging in constant warfare. They were forced to pay
      protection money to the Christian kingdoms. This weakened them financially and strengthened the
      Christians. This led to the fall of Toledo in 1085, which was a major defeat for Islam. The attempt
      to restore Islamic power under the Almoravids failed as they alienated many Muslims in Spain and
      were overthrown by the Almohads who also failed to retain power due to the ongoing dispute with
      the Almoravids. Islamic states failed to attain unity under one leader after this time and was now
      vulnerable to the attack by the Christian kingdoms.

      The external pressure increased after the fall of Toledo – Christian kingdoms continued to expand
      their territory and military forces. The Crusading movement brought much support to these
      kingdoms from the 12th century on, which led to the conquest of Portugal and the major defeat of
      the Islamic armies at Las Navas de Tolosa. The Christian kingdoms became more unified and thus
      stronger, reaching a culmination under Ferdinand and Isabella. This was in contrast to the divided
      taifas of Muslim Spain. The momentum was now on the side of the Christians who had confidence
      and support for their campaigns.

Emperors and kings 1150–1300

13.   Compare and contrast the reasons for the growth of royal power under Louis IX (1226–1270)
      and Philip IV (1285–1314).

      Both monarchs increased royal power in France.
      The reasons for compare may include but not be limited to:
      • Both monarchs increased the size of the royal bureaucracy to extend royal power in law and
        taxation;
      • Both monarchs took steps to limit the power of the nobility through legal means as well as force;
      • Both used foreign wars in an attempt to expand their royal domain and power.

      The reasons for contrast may include but not be limited to:
      • Louis maintained good relations with the Church – this increased his revenues, influence and
        popularity;
      • Many clergy served as administrators in the royal bureaucracy;
      • He also gained Church support by his persecution of heretics and other religious dissident;
      • Phillip was in conflict with the Church and gained power by seizing Church lands, preventing
        taxation by the Church and exercising legal power over the clergy. He increased the conflict by
        seizing the Pope and transferring the papacy to France;
      • Louis relied on his reputation as a just and saintly individual to increase his authority and
        influence;
      • Phillip relied heavily on force to increase his authority and crushed all who opposed him;
      • Louis improved the economy through his relations with the towns and peasants who supported
        him;
      • Phillip solved his economic problems by expelling the Jews and the Italian bankers to avoid his
        debts and destroying the Templars in order to seize their money. He also raised taxes and
        debased the coinage.

14.   To what extent were the attempts to limit the power of King John (1199–1216) successful?

      The reasons for attempting to limit the John’s power may include but not be limited to: his
      oppressive taxation to finance his failed wars in France made him unpopular, his marriage in 1204
      and his murder of his nephew were very unpopular. His loss of large amounts of land and his
      constant defeats by the French reduced confidence in him and caused resentment amongst the
      barons who had lost land and wealth as a result of his failures.

      His quarrel with the Church and the pope caused England to be placed under an interdict which
      damaged his support amongst the devout and the clergy. His excommunication damaged his
      prestige and encouraged opposition. The nobility and the merchants both wished to limit the king’s
      powers to exact ever higher taxes and act without regard to law or custom.

      The results may include but not be limited to: John was forced to swear an oath to practice good
      government in order to be released from excommunication. Many barons refused to pay taxes or
      render military service and demanded that he reinstitute the coronation charter of Henry I. John’s
      refusal to change his policies led to armed revolt and the signing of Magna Carta by the king.

      This was an attempt to force the king to obey the customs and laws of the land. It was not effective
      as John appealed to the pope who denounced it and John defeated the barons who imposed it on
      him.

      The barons then sought to replace him with Louis of France. This produced a stalemate at which
      point John died.

      Efforts to limit his authority had been quite unsuccessful in his lifetime. The concept of limiting the
      king’s power did not disappear, however.

      The principles of Magna Carta were accepted by his son and then reinforced by the Provisions of
      Oxford in 1258 and in the growing power of Parliament under Edward I.

Late medieval political crises 1300–1485

15.   “The fall of Ducal Burgundy had a significant impact on the monarchies of England and
      France.” To what extent do you agree with this statement?

      The impact of the decline in the power of the Duchy of Burgundy may include but not be limited to:
      the power of France under Louis XI was greatly expanded as a result of the decline. France gained
      territory and a powerful rival was eliminated. Louis XI was able to defeat Burgundy and its allies
      and thus increase his absolute authority, territory and influence. English influence in France
      declined as their invasion of France in 1475 was unsuccessful as a result of the loss of Burgundian
      support. The decline in Burgundy led to territory being acquired by the Swiss as well as the
      Austrians as a result of a series of military defeats. Burgundy lost large amounts of territory and
      ceased to exist as an independent power.

      Another impact of the decline was the Burgundian focus on their remaining territories in the Low
      countries. Considerable progress was made in commercial and constitutional development and a
      more unified and progressive state emerged in that area.

16.   Evaluate the reasons for conflict during the reign of Henry VI (1422–1461).

      The reasons for conflict during the reign of Henry VI are both long and short-term.

      The long-term causes may include but not be limited to: the long-term feud between the
      Lancastrians and Yorkists over the succession, the division of government between the Gloucester
      and Beaufort families created constant strife within the government, the concept of removing
      unpopular monarchs such as Edward II and Richard II which left the monarchy to be fought over by
      the great noble families, the growing power both financial and military, of noble families which
      encouraged them to seize power from the Crown or other families leading to strife. The 15-year
      minority of the king encouraged the rise of factions in government seeking influence. Many of the
      problems associated with Henry’s reign manifested themselves after the end of the regency.

      The short-term causes may include: the loss of the war in France led to much resentment amongst
      those who had profited and general discontent at the decline of English power and the loss of land
      in France, the death of the Duke of Bedford removed a powerful force for stability. Increasing
      divisions in government about how to arrange an end to the war led to further division and
      confrontation. The lack of an heir encouraged plots with respect to the succession and the mental
      problems of the king weakened the government and encouraged plots to seize power. The
      unpopularity of his French wife, Margaret of Anjou, who tried to control the government increased
      tensions in England. Poor financial management, resentment by the merchants and numerous
      outbreaks of rebellion and violence made the king unpopular and encouraged talk of replacing him.

14th century famine, pestilence and social change

17.   Compare and contrast the economic effects of famine in the early 14th century and the Black
      Death (1348–1349).

      Both of these events produced major effects in Europe in the 14th century.
      For compare:
      • Both events resulted in significant population decline in rural areas;
      • Both caused anger in the population against ruling groups which led to insurrections;
      • Both helped change agriculture from farming to stock-raising in many areas;
      • Both changed the feudal system by weakening the traditional relationship of peasants and
        landholders.

      For contrast:
      • The Black Death resulted in far more deaths across a much wider area of Europe;
      • Towns as well as the rural areas were affected;
      • The Black Death had a major impact on the Church which the famines did not;
      • The Black Death effects while similar to the famine were much larger in scale and had a much
        wider impact on feudalism, employment and economic structure;
      • Social conventions and mores were greatly affected by the Black Death;
      • The Black Death led to persecution of Jews and others who were blamed for the disease – this
        did not happen in the famine which was caused by the weather to a large degree.

18.   Examine the reasons for the rapid spread of the Black Death (1348–1349).

      The reasons for the spread of the Black Death may include but not be limited to: lack of medical
      knowledge on the nature of the disease and its spread, overcrowded living conditions in villages and
      towns, lack of knowledge about and practice of personal hygiene, reduced resistance of the
      population to disease due to the famines that had occurred in previous years, ongoing warfare
      spread the disease and reduced the health and resistance of the population, and the use of sea
      transportation moved the infection rapidly from one city to another. The disorganization and
      weakness of governments prevented any organized response.

The Ottomans 1281–1566

19.   Examine the reasons for, and the results of, the conflict between the Ottomans and the
      Safavids.

      The reasons for the conflict between the Ottomans and the Safavids may include but not be limited
      to: the rise of the Safavids in Iran was both a territorial and religious challenge to the Ottomans.
      The Safavids were Shi’ites. The Ottomans feared their territorial expansion into areas such as Iraq
      – they also feared that many of their subjects would be attracted to the Shi’ite state. A Shi’ite revolt
      occurred in 1511 in Anatolia – this led to further fears on the part of the Ottomans.

      The results may include but not be limited to: in response to the threat a new Ottoman sultan was
      installed. War broke out and the Safavids were defeated. The Safavids were defeated but not
      eliminated and their state continued to exist.

      This led to the continuation of the struggle between the two empires for many years. Iraq was a
      constant battleground between the two powers. The struggle was both for territory and a war
      between the Sunnis and Shi’ites which led to many deaths. This war also deflected the Ottoman
      Empire to expansion into Egypt, North Africa, the Middle East, Arabia and Europe.

20.   To what extent was either Mehmet II (1451–1481) or Suleiman the Magnificent (1520–1566) a
      successful ruler?

      Candidates should consider how successful either Mehmet II or Suleiman was both in terms of their
      accomplishments and in terms of how well their accomplishments reflected their aims as a ruler.

      The major accomplishments of Mehmet II may include: Mehmet is often referred to as the
      Conqueror. He captured Constantinople in 1453 and ended the Byzantine Empire. This was a
      major boost to the power and prestige of the Ottoman Empire. He further extended Ottoman
      territories in the Balkans and along the Black Sea. He even invaded Italy in 1480 but the expedition
      ended upon his death in 1481.

      He established Constantinople as an intellectual centre by welcoming Christian and Jewish scholars.
      He also encouraged Western merchants to settle in Istanbul and made it a commercial centre. His
      general policy of toleration for other faiths made the Ottoman Empire the most progressive state at
      the time. Many Europeans were attracted to it and this caused fear in Europe as rulers were afraid
      that their populations would desert to the Ottoman lands.

      He also engaged in a major rebuilding of Istanbul and established a number of mosques and
      schools.

      He was largely successful in his aims to expand and strengthen the Ottoman Empire- suffered minor
      setbacks in the Balkans but overall was one of the most accomplished of Ottoman rulers.

      The major accomplishments of Suleiman may include but not be limited to: he was successful in
      expanding the Ottoman Empire and making it a powerful state. He conquered extensive territory in
      Europe including Hungary and he besieged Vienna. He expanded the empire further into North
      Africa and Arabia. Overall he was a very successful military leader. He defeated the Safavids on a
      number of occasions but failed to destroy them and they remained a rival of the Ottomans for
      centuries. His naval forces controlled the Mediterranean and entered the Atlantic on raiding
      expeditions. His empire marked a high point of Islamic power and caused great fear in Europe.

      He reformed and issued a new law code which formed the basis of the Ottoman legal system for
      centuries. His support of non-Muslims was notable as he improved the lot of Christians and Jews
      which brought peace and strength to the empire. The evidence of this was found in that many
      refugees who came to the Ottoman Empire from Europe to seek a freer and more secure life.
      Ottoman government was admired by many Europeans at the time.

      He was notable for his support of the arts and culture – from poetry to architecture. He built a vast
      range of structures from mosques to schools, monuments and bridges. He expanded access to
      education throughout the empire by building schools and providing free tuition.

      His reign was an overall success but some questions could be raised about his failure to eliminate
      the Safavid problem, the possible over-expansion of the empire and the fact that his system
      depended on his talents to a large degree and without his leadership it began to decline after his
      death.

Renaissance government and society in Italy 1300–1500

21.   “The cultural vitality of the Italian city states was the most important cause of the
      Renaissance in Italy.” To what extent do you agree with this statement?

      This question requires that students comment on the reasons for the origins of the Italian
      Renaissance. Candidates may not agree with the statement and have a different opinion but they
      must address the issue of classical and cultural heritage in their response.

      The material in support of the statement may include but not be limited to: the Italian city states
      continued to have some degree of knowledge of the classical world, in philosophy, science and art
      based on the legacy of the Roman Empire. They had examples of artistic work from the classical
      era which was not dominated by the religious themes of the medieval period. This provided
      inspiration for the humanism of the Renaissance period.

      This heritage was maintained through their connections with the Byzantine Empire after the fall of
      Rome. This was a further source of information in classical knowledge. They established the first
      universities which studied secular subjects such as law and medicine whose inspiration was from
      Greece and Rome. They were a key part of the 12th century renaissance which helped revive
      classical studies.

      The factors that may challenge the statement may include but not be limited to: the wealth of the
      Italian cities through trade gave them the resources to attract artists, philosophers and seek out new
      ideas. The non-feudal nature of their governments made them less traditional and more open to
      change and progress in many areas. Their extensive commercial contacts had brought them a vast
      amount of knowledge from the Islamic world that could be used to develop many new ideas and
      directions in philosophy, science, art, architecture and technology.

      Their increasingly secular nature and wealth freed them from a degree of church influence and
      allowed new ideas to develop.

      responses. However, the list is not exhaustive and no set answer is required.

22.   To what extent do the writings of Castiglione and Machiavelli reflect the values of
      the Renaissance?

      Castiglione and Machiavelli are often regarded as portraying key aspects of the Renaissance in
      terms of its character and values in personal and political areas.

      Castiglione in essence portrays the characteristics of the “Renaissance man”. He emphasizes the
      values of the Renaissance period in terms of personal development. These involve physical fitness
      and action to a wide knowledge of music, literature and philosophy. He was to set a model of
      deportment, culture, speech and civility. This was the renaissance ideal, a reaching back to the
      classical world of the philosophers and scholars of Greece and Rome who had also been soldiers,
      politicians and poets. Castiglione portrayed an ideal that was not likely reached by many but
      represented what the Renaissance had striven for in terms of creating a new world freed from the
      strictures of the Middle Ages.

      Machiavelli’s writings seem to portray the world of power and intrigue of the Renaissance period,
      the politics, rivalries and struggles for power amongst the city states, great families and foreign
      invaders.

      Machiavelli wrote about Florence which is seen as the centre of the new political liberty and civic
      humanism of the Renaissance – in essence a new view of a man’s place and responsibility in
      society. This lies at the basis of what many see as a key value of the renaissance period. His
      interest in politics reflects the renaissance period in terms of the constant political turmoil in many
      states and the struggles for power by citizens and princes. There is great debate over whether his
      writings really reflect the age or are a satire on the period or idealized portraits of leaders like
      Cesare Borgia. It is important to note that his writings did encourage debate on human nature and
      this was a prime concern of the Renaissance.

New horizons: exploration 1400–1550

23.   “Western society’s motives for expansion and exploration were secular rather than religious.”
      Discuss.

      This question deals with the motives for Western exploration and expansion. Candidates must
      assess the degree to which secular motives, land trade, gold were the most powerful motives in
      comparison with the desire to attack Islam, spread Christianity and continue the missionary work of
      the Church.

      The secular motives may include but not be limited to: a desire to end the monopoly on eastern
      goods (spices, silks) held by the Islamic world, this would enrich the European nations and their
      rulers, a desire for additional territory as part of ongoing rivalry amongst European countries, a
      search for gold and other materials that would enrich both the country and individuals. The
      improvement in science, navigation, cartography and ship design were also incentives as they made
      long voyages more possible.

      The religious motives may include but not be limited to: a desire to continue the struggle against
      Islam as shown in the Reconquista. Europeans could circumvent the Ottomans in the
      Mediterranean and attack Islamic states in the east. New Christian states could be founded to
      increase the numbers of Christian and stop the spread of Islam. Lost Christian kingdoms could be
      found and supported in the struggle against Islam. In addition, the missionary orders of the Church
      were anxious to expand their work to newly discovered areas. The Catholic Church also wished to
      expand its territories as part of the counter-reformation to limit the power of the protestants.

24.   “The rise of Western exploration was only made possible by the adoption of technology
      developed in the Islamic world.” To what extent do you agree with this statement?

      The ways in which Islamic science and technology made western exploration easier may include:
      Islamic cartographers, explorers, geographers, astronomers and mathematicians had produced a vast
      array of knowledge of many areas of the world, had developed navigation methods and instruments
      and published accounts of voyages to different regions that provided knowledge to western
      explorers. In addition advances in ship-design in the Islamic world such as the lateen sail made
      sailing ships more efficient. Islamic science and technology was overall an invaluable aid to
      Western navigators and explorers.

      Challenges to the statement may include: Western scientists such as Henry the Navigator were
      developing knowledge, instruments and experience that would support exploration, ambitious
      individuals such as Columbus were prepared to take risks despite a relative lack of knowledge,
      Westerners may have had knowledge of the voyages of the Vikings and European fishermen who
      had crossed the Atlantic – this encouraged them to explore further.
