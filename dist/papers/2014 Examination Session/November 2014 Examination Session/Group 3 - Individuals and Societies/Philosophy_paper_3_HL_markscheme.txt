How to use the Diploma Philosophy markscheme

The assessment criteria constitute the formal tool for marking examination scripts, and in these assessment criteria
examiners can see the skills being assessed in the examinations. The markschemes are designed to assist examiners
in possible routes taken by candidates in terms of the content of their answers when demonstrating their skills of
doing philosophy through their responses. The points listed are not compulsory points, and not necessarily the best
possible points. They are a framework to help examiners contextualize the requirements of the question, and to
facilitate the application of marks according to the criteria listed on pages 5–8.

It is important that examiners understand that the main idea of the course is to promote doing philosophy, and this
involves activity and engagement throughout a two-year programme, as opposed to emphasizing the chance to
display knowledge in a terminal set of examination papers. Even in the examinations, responses should not be
assessed on how much candidates know as much as how they are able to use their knowledge in support of an
argument, using the skills listed in the assessment criteria published in the subject guide, reflecting an engagement
in philosophical activity throughout the course. As a tool intended to help examiners in assessing scripts, the
following points should be kept in mind when using a markscheme as an examiner:

   • The IB Philosophy programme is designed to encourage the skills of doing philosophy in the students.
     These skills can be accessed through reading the assessment criteria in the subject guide
   • The markscheme does not intend to outline a model/correct/good answer
   • The markscheme has an introductory paragraph which contextualizes the emphasis of the question being
     asked
   • The bullet points below the paragraph are suggested possible points of development that should not be
     considered a prescriptive list where necessarily all (or even some) should appear in the answer
   • The names of philosophers and references to their work associated with the question help to give a context
     for the examiners and does not reflect a requirement that such philosophers and references should appear in
     an answer: they are possible lines of development with the emphasis being on how the material is used in
     support of the candidate’s answer and not whether it appears in the answer
   • Candidates can legitimately select from a wide range of ideas, arguments and concepts in service of the
     question they are answering, and it is possible that candidates will use material effectively that is not
     mentioned in the markscheme
   • In markschemes for Paper 3, there are suggested pertinent points found in the text extract relating to
     philosophical activity. The markschemes include suggested questions that might stimulate analysis of those
     points. These bullet points cannot predict how a candidate will relate his or her personal experience of the
     IB HL Philosophy course to the text extract, so the examiner must be aware that much of the response of the
     candidate will not be covered by material in the markscheme.

A reminder of candidate requirements for Paper 3 (Unseen text – exploring philosophical activity):

Examiners are reminded that in the examination paper it states that candidates are expected to demonstrate the
following skills. Since these skills are encouraged within the assessment criteria, examiners should take them into
account in their marking:
• develop a response in an organized way using clear, precise language, which is appropriate to philosophy
• identify pertinent issues regarding the philosophical activity raised in the text
• take an independent position about the nature of philosophical activity in relation to the ideas developed in the
    text
• draw upon, and show a holistic appreciation of, the skills, material and ideas developed throughout the course.

In the examination paper candidates are required to:

Write a response (of approximately 800 words) in which they:
Candidates are also told that their responses are expected to include:
• a concise description of philosophical activity as presented in the text
• an exploration of the pertinent issues regarding philosophical activity raised in the text, relating this to their
  experience of doing philosophy throughout the whole course
• appropriate references to the text that illustrate their understanding of philosophical activity
• their personal evaluation of the issues regarding philosophical activity raised in the text.

         Level
           0      The student has not reached level 1.
           1      The student expresses some basic ideas but it is not always clear what the
                  response is trying to convey. The use of language is not appropriate to
                  philosophy.
           2      The student presents some ideas in an organized way. There is some clarity of
                  expression but the response cannot always be followed. The use of language is
                  not always appropriate to philosophy.
           3      The student presents ideas in an organized way and the response can be easily
                  followed. The use of language is appropriate to philosophy.
           4      The student presents ideas in an organized and coherent way and the response is
                  clearly articulated. The use of language is effective and appropriate to
                  philosophy.
           5      The student presents ideas in an organized, coherent and incisive way, insights
                  are clearly articulated and the response is focused and sustained. The use of
                  language is precise and appropriate to philosophy.

Unseen text – exploring philosophical activity

The purpose of the exercise is to allow candidates to reflect upon the nature, function, methodology and
meaning of philosophical activity, relating this to the candidates’ experience of doing philosophy
throughout the whole course. Candidates may reflect this in very different ways in their responses,
giving examples which draw from their experience of the course, or from their experience in general.
The following points—referring to the text extract—might be included in a response, but they are
neither exhaustive nor prescriptive.

We might act with or without understanding of what we are doing. When that which we do is in the
nature of thinking, it is better if we understand what we are trying to do. In philosophy no great progress
can be made until we reflect on what we are doing; reflection upon it is part of philosophy itself.
The question of what philosophy is might be approached from different angles. One approach consists of
defining the proper object of philosophical thought, and then deducing from this definition the proper
methods it should follow. A second way follows the relation between means and ends, asking what kind
of results philosophy hopes or desires to achieve. A third line of approach states that philosophy never
reaches its ultimate goal, conceiving it is an activity which goes on in our minds. Giving an account of
philosophical method is a possible answer to the question of what philosophy is but it can never be a
complete answer because the question of what philosophy is cannot be separated from the question of
what philosophy ought to be. In general, an account of philosophical method must attempt to satisfy two
conditions: first, it must never lose sight of the question of what methods have actually been used by
philosophers of the past; and second, the final appeal must be to our own experience of philosophical
work, and to our consciousness of the principles which we are trying to follow.

Candidates might consider the following given their experience of doing the course in response to this
text extract:
• The text understands philosophy mainly in relation to intellectual activity. What about the possibility
   of directing philosophical reflection towards other human dimensions which require consideration of
   different values, or foster emotions?
• The approach based on the relation between means and ends seems to have been productive according
   to significant traditions, among them those of Aristotle and Kant
• Comparison with other views or possible approaches to philosophy, eg, non-Western, feminist, other
   contemporary critical positions
• Ways in which Collingwood’s approach might be further developed or applied
• The strong distinction between the question of “what philosophy is” and an historical approach might
   go too far, in that many philosophical problems have their conceptual history as part of the problem
• Possible relations between the arguments of the text and non-Western conceptions and philosophical
   activity, eg,Taoist approach of wu wei (non-action), where non-action is not the same as inaction.
