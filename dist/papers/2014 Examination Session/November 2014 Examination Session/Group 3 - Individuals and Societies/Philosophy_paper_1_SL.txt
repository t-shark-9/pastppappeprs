In your answers you are expected to:

     •   argue in an organized way using clear, precise language, which is appropriate to philosophy
     •   demonstrate knowledge and understanding of appropriate philosophical issues
     •   analyse, develop and critically evaluate relevant ideas and arguments
     •   present appropriate examples providing support for your overall argument
     •   identify and analyse counter-arguments
     •   provide relevant supporting material, illustrations and/or examples
     •   offer a clear and philosophically relevant personal response to the examination question.

                                                          SECTION A

Answer one question from this section. Each question in this section is worth [30 marks].

Core Theme: What is a human being?

1.       Read the following passage and develop your response as indicated below.

         In the great majority of animals there are traces of psychical qualities which are more markedly
         differentiated in the case of human beings. For just as we pointed out resemblances in the physical
         organs, so in a number of animals we observe gentleness or fierceness, mildness or cross temper,
         courage or timidity, fear or confidence, high spirit or low cunning, and, with regard to intelligence,
         something equivalent to sagacity. Some of these qualities in man, as compared with the corresponding
         qualities in animals, differ only quantitatively: that is to say, a man has more of this quality, and an
         animal has more of some other; other qualities in man are represented by analogous qualities: for
         instance, just as in man we find knowledge, wisdom, and sagacity, so in certain animals there exists
         some other natural capacity akin to these.

      evaluation of works of art.
