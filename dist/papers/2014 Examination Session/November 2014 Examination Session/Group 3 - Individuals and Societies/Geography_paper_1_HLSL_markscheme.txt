                                 Core Theme – Patterns and Change

                                             SECTION A

1.   Populations in transition

     (a)   Describe the global pattern of birth control use shown on the map.                     [4]

           Award [1 mark] for each valid descriptive point, up to a maximum of [3 marks].

           Possible descriptions include:
            high birth control use is mainly found in the Americas, Europe, Russia, China,
             and Australia [1 mark]
            low birth control use is seen in some parts of Sub-Saharan Africa [1 mark] (Not
             all of Africa)
            mid usage is shown in, for example, the Middle East, North Africa, South and
             South West Asia [1 mark]
            majority of the world is over 50% birth control use.

           Award the final [1 mark] for valid reference to anomalies or quantification/use of
           data.

     (b)   Suggest two reasons why the percentage of women using some type of birth
           control is low in some countries.                                                    [2+2]

           Award [1 mark] for each valid reason, and [1 mark] for development and/or
           exemplification.

           Answers must be specific to birth control/contraceptive use/access.

           eg for religious or cultural reasons [1 mark] the use of contraceptives amongst
           women is very low in Afghanistan [1 mark].

           Possibilities include:
            Religious/cultural reasons – see example
            Poverty – “poorer women use contraception a lot less than wealthier women”
             – WHO
            Access – many women live in remote/rural regions and do not have access to any
             modern methods of contraception
            Lack of gender empowerment – could be very low priority and as such
             promotion of contraception is limited
            Aid agencies limiting funding to family planning and promoting abstinence
             policies instead eg Bush administration PEPFAR
            Government policies related to family planning services
            Education of women and how this could influence their choices or lack of
             choices re contraceptive use.
                                           –4–              N14/3/GEOGR/BP1/ENG/TZ0/XX/M


(c)   Explain two reasons why the Crude Death Rate is falling in most low-income
      countries.                                                                            [2+2]

      Award [1 mark] for each distinct, valid reason, and [1 mark] for development and/or
      exemplification.

      eg access to antiretroviral therapies in many Sub-Saharan African nations [1 mark]
      has reduced the crude death rate amongst HIV+ individuals [1 mark].

      Crude Death Rates are falling; in fact all nations according to the UN are below
      20/1000.

      Possibilities include:
       vaccination programmes
       water and sanitation
       increased wealth in some nations – more hospitals, better health care
       the work of civil society organizations and multinational organizations such as
        MSF/WHO
       improving food security and access
       education, especially of women, results in healthier families, lower infant and
        child mortality rates
       diet, improving due to access/distribution
       hazard mitigation strategies = less fatalities.

      Accept any other valid reasons.

2.   Disparities in wealth and development

     (a)   (i)    Describe the relationship shown on the graph.                                     [3]

                  The     relationship     is    negative     /     the      lower    the GNI
                  per capita, the higher the share of informal employment [1 mark];
                  exemplification using countries from the graph [1 mark]. The final [1 mark]
                  should be reserved for reference to data/quantification or an anomaly.

           (ii)   Suggest two possible reasons for this relationship.                             [2+2]

                  Award [1 mark] for each possible reason, and [1 mark] for development and/or
                  exemplification.

                  eg limited formal employment opportunities [1 mark] results in many
                  attempting to make a living through informal employment [1 mark].

                  Possibilities include:
                   limited formal opportunities linked to country’s level of development/GNI
                   large agricultural sector, most of which is informal/subsistence
                   lack of education and/or capital – lacking skills that would enable formal
                    businesses to be started or attract large formal employers eg TNCs
                   most informal economic activities require little capital to set up / so are
                    more prevalent in low income countries
                   GNI not recording informal sector US$, so appears lower if higher
                    percentage of economy is informal
                   informal sector not being able to generate enough money
                   informal sector being labour intensive versus capital intensive.

                  Accept other valid suggestions.
                                           –6–              N14/3/GEOGR/BP1/ENG/TZ0/XX/M


(b)   Briefly explain how debt relief can reduce global disparities.                        [4]

      Answers should explain/imply that they know what debt relief is [1 mark] and how
      receiving it frees up money that would have exited the highly indebted nation
      [1 mark].

      The remaining [2 marks] should explain how this money could be put to use in a
      way that reduces disparities / that helps that nation develop.

      Award [1 mark] for each valid explanation, and [1 mark] for each further
      development/exemplification of how this can reduce global disparities or contribute
      to economic and social development.

      Possibilities include:
       this revenue could be spent on development projects possibly related to MDGs eg
        construction of schools/hospitals hence reducing global disparities in social
        development
       alternatively it could be used to fund projects which boost the nation’s economic
        development such as infrastructure allowing for increased trade, hence reducing
        economic disparities between nations.

3.   Patterns in environmental quality and sustainability

     (a)   Describe the relationship between the level of poverty and the level of soil
           degradation shown on the diagram.                                                        [3]

           Possible descriptions might include:

            low levels of poverty have lower levels of high soil degradation / high levels of
             poverty have higher levels of high soil degradation
            low levels of poverty have the most improving soil
            low levels of poverty appear to suffer the most from moderate soil degradation

           Accept other valid descriptions.

           Reserve the final [1 mark] for some attempt at quantification/use of the data.

     (b)   Explain one strategy that has been successful in reducing soil degradation.              [3]

           Award [1 mark] for a valid choice, [1 mark] for its description, and [1 mark] for its
           explanation. Identification of a valid specific location may also receive [1 mark], up
           to a maximum of [3 marks].

           There are many possible choices including reforestation, shallow plowing, the use of
           ground covers during fallow periods, planting of wind breaks, controlled grazing, etc.
           Example:
           “One strategy is reforestation [1 mark] where the planting of trees on degraded soil
           can help stabilize the surface [1 mark] because their roots bind the soil together and
           make it less likely that erosion can occur [1 mark].”

     (c)   Explain the importance of maintaining biodiversity in tropical rainforests.              [5]

           Award [1 mark] for a definition, or clear or implied understanding of the term
           “biodiversity”.

           Award [1 mark] for each valid statement linking a reason to the importance of
           biodiversity, and [1 mark] for each development/exemplification, up to a maximum
           of [2 + 2 marks].

           Possible reasons include: climate regulation; flood control/protection; gene bank
           maintenance; food/timber; soil conservation; value to indigenous people; tourism
           value; research opportunities; keeping food chains intact; value of medicinal
           products.
                                                  –8–              N14/3/GEOGR/BP1/ENG/TZ0/XX/M


4.   Patterns in resource consumption

     (a)   With reference to the diagram, describe the movement of e-waste into and out
           of Asia.                                                                                [4]

           Possible valid statements could include:
            there is more waste going into Asia than out
            there is movement in from every region (all five)
            there is movement out to four regions (none to Oceania)
            the volume of movements in is very high
            Asia is the largest importer of e-waste mainly from Americas and the Middle
             East
            Asia does also export some e-waste, mainly to Europe

           Credit other valid statements.

           For the award of the full [4 marks], some mention should be included of both
           in (imports) and out (exports) and there should be some attempt at quantification/use
           of data.

     (b)   Briefly explain the limitations of recycling as a strategy to reduce global
           resource consumption.                                                                   [3]

           Award [1 mark] for each valid limitation                 and    [1 mark]    for   any
           development/exemplification (at any scale).

           Possible limitations could include:
            energy is still consumed in the transportation of waste to recycling centres
            energy is used for the recycling process
            some materials cannot be recycled or are too expensive to recycle
            recycling is not available on a large enough scale to deal with all waste
            growth in recycling is outstripped by growing consumption
            there may be better alternatives, eg substitution, lower consumption
            desire for economic growth is greater than the desire for sustainability.

           Credit other valid limitations.


     (c)   Explain the neo-Malthusian view of the relationship between population size
           and resource consumption.                                                               [4]

           The response must make reference to “neo-”, eg contemporary supporters of the
           views of Thomas Malthus, for [1 mark].

           The remaining [3 marks] should be awarded for explanation of the view:
           Human population has a carrying capacity [1 mark] because it increases
           geometrically while resources increase arithmetically [1 mark] leading to a
           check/crash/adjustment [1 mark] / a need for anti-natal policies [1 mark].

           Other valid points may be credited in substitution for those already mentioned.

5.   Referring to one or more countries, discuss the view that internal (national) migration
     can help to reduce economic and social disparities.                                              [15]

     There are many possible approaches to this question and each should be marked on its
     merits.

     The question warrants a look at “migration” in a wider sense than a single narrow
     case study. In making a case for or against the view, examples must be used. These
     examples must be national in scope, and must name individual countries. The response
     may be spatial in nature or it could refer to the migrants themselves.

     Economic disparities that may be referred to are: income / employment (formal or
     informal) / remittances / labour. Social disparities may be gender related / access to
     services / demographic in nature / social mobility / housing / education.

     For example some academics argue that migrants who move from rural to urban areas tend
     to improve their standard of living. This argument could be developed with examples.
     However, the conditions in some urban slums could warrant an increase in disparities
     within the urban area itself.

     Examples of forced internal migration and internally displaced persons could be explored,
     arguing that disparities can actually increase as a result of, for example, hazards, conflict,
     land-grabs, economic inequalities.

     Responses that only look at either social or economic disparities and do not make use of
     examples should not progress beyond band D.

     At band E both social and economic disparities should be addressed, with effective use of
     examples.

     At band F both social and economic disparities should be addressed, with effective use of
     examples, and both the negative and positive impacts of the migration on disparities should
     be addressed.

6.   “We still have the resources to live as wastefully as we want.” Discuss this statement.     [15]

     Whether or not the statement is accepted as holding any validity, it suggests many
     implications worth discussing. These implications include not only considerations of
     demographic, social, cultural, economic and (geo-)political development/progress but also
     of environmental, social and economic sustainability.

     Many approaches are possible.

     Some candidates may base their discussion around the distinction between renewable and
     non-renewable resources, arguing that by using the former, we can reduce or remove our
     concern about using the latter. Nuanced positions are also tenable since some
     non-renewable resources are present in such large amounts that they could easily supply
     our needs for many generations (no adverse implications), whereas other non-renewables
     are in such short supply that they do require immediate protection, conservation or
     substitution.

     An alternative approach might be to look at the adverse effects of living wastefully and
     then consider how society or individuals can avoid these problems. For example, it might
     be argued that wastefulness could lead to positive impacts such as the stimulation of new
     technologies, new ideas, the substitution of resources, recycling and policies to reduce
     resource use.

     Stronger candidates are likely to point out that there are some ways of assessing or
     measuring our impact(s), employing such approaches as environmental footprints and
     food miles. Stronger responses may also link the discussion to neo-Malthusian and
     opposing viewpoints about the relationship between population size and resource
     consumption.

     Answers that are simplistic and/or generalized with few or no relevant examples are
     unlikely to advance beyond band C.

     Responses that discuss a range of ideas, supported by evidence, within a structured
     framework (eg compares renewable and non-renewables, or different societies,
     eg rich/poor countries) and show some recognition that there is room for alternative
     viewpoints about this question are likely to be credited at band E/F.

7.   “The Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) are unlikely to be achieved without a
     dramatic increase in global energy consumption.” Discuss this statement.                       [15]

     Responses could discuss concepts of MDGs, oil/gas resources, alternative energy sources,
     ecological footprint, etc.

     There are many possible approaches to this question and each should be marked on in its
     merits.

     An explanation of the MDGs should be given in terms of their purpose. Some of the
     specific MDGs should be referred to. Candidates may recognize that, as people move out
     of poverty (MDG 1), they will consume more energy, therefore agreeing with the
     statement. Other MDGs, eg schooling, also require energy for classrooms, etc. However,
     gender equality requires a change in attitudes not more energy. So the statement becomes
     invalid. Equally, it could be possible to meet some MDGs without a dramatic increase in
     energy, eg low energy technologies (solar and rechargeable).

     Alternatively, some may argue that the MDGs cannot be met, irrespective of energy,
     because of a wide variety of other reasons. Depending on the goals and/or the countries
     used in the response, these reasons include: conflict (DRC/Afghanistan), HIV/AIDS,
     corruption, lack of political will, global recession, “cultural obstacles” to improving the
     status of women, natural disasters eg Haiti, not a level playing field, voting rights in the
     WB and IMF, work of the WTO, trading blocs, debt, tied aid, inappropriate aid.

     The extent to which these reasons are linked to global energy consumption is debatable.
     Responses could look, for example, at how a rise in energy consumption might help a
     country develop manufacturing industry and create additional employment opportunities,
     offering families a way out of poverty, or increase a country’s GNI, allowing it to allocate
     more resources to health/education, with positive effects on gender awareness, nutrition,
     maternal mortality, and so on.

     Answers that are simplistic and/or generalized with few or no relevant examples are
     unlikely to advance beyond band C.

     Responses that discuss a range of ideas, supported by evidence, within a structured
     framework (eg focusing on a number of specific goals or countries) and with some
     recognition that there is room for alternative viewpoints, are likely to be credited at band
     E/F.
