     Overview

     Cobb Publishing, a publishing company with 500 employees, is situated in Vancouver.
     The company publishes a range of books for the public, provincial and local government,
     local organizations, as well as schools and universities in British Colombia. It is not a major player
     in the publishing field but serves the local market, and in areas the major publishers do not
 5   see as being profitable. Cobb Publishing prides itself on being responsive to the needs of its
     local community.

     Current IT system

     The current IT system is based around standard production equipment for publishers: a network
     with the standard publishing software that is used by the staff to develop and store the texts.
     When a book is finished it is passed to the printers who print and distribute it. The company
10   uses a variety of printers, their own machines, local printers and sometimes national or overseas
     companies if there are special requirements.

     The changing publishing industry

     The publishing industry is going through a significant period of change brought about by the
     development of mobile devices such as laptops, smartphones, dedicated e-book readers and tablet
     computers. Consequently there is significant pressure from existing clients and the general public
15   for Cobb Publishing to publish for these devices. Readers are also starting to look for the inclusion
     of interactive/multimedia features in e-books. Writers are beginning to self-publish their e-books,
     both large and small.

     The ability to read the same book across a variety of formats and platforms will be a requirement
     for the future. A person may want to read their book on their tablet computer at home, on their
20   smartphone while they travel, on their e-book reader on holiday and on their laptop while at work
     at lunch time. This would require a method to enable efficient synchronization of which page a
     reader is up to on each device.

     In responding to these changes Cobb Publishing may need to develop a new digital publishing
     section of the business. Cobb Publishing may also need to outsource and form partnerships with
25   other publishers and distributors, and companies that have skills and knowledge Cobb Publishing
     does not currently have, especially in the multimedia sector.

     The senior managers of Cobb Publishing are aware that over the next few years there are going to
     be significant changes in the way it operates.

     The changing format of e-books

     Cobb Publishing needs to consider the format and features of e-books, and often this will depend
30   on the purpose and the audience:
     • There are various electronic file formats in which e-books can be published, such as epub,
        PDF, and others used by mobile devices.
     • The ways of accessing e-books are also changing with an increasing variety of platforms,
        from dedicated e-book readers, to mobile devices with/without dedicated apps/software,
35      and the Internet.
     • Readers are expecting to be able to use the same e-book across various platforms including
        automatically synchronizing the last page read and transferring other data such as highlighting,
        notes and bookmarks.
     • Educational consumers are asking for e-books to be customized for their own students.
40      The customization would not only include the choice of chapters but the selection of multimedia
        resources and other features (depending on the cost).
     • The range and type of multimedia content is increasing and becoming more interactive.
     • Readers want to be able to navigate their way through the e-book in a less restrictive manner
        than the current page turning method.
45   • Readers want to be able to search and annotate the e-book and also copy, paste and export
        sections together for study purposes. Cobb Publishing is apprehensive as it has commercial
        and copyright concerns.
     • Readers will want to update their e-books, especially those used in the educational market.
     • E-books and the Internet allow for interaction between the reader and the publisher/author.
50      One of these interactions is the automatic gathering of data about how the e-book is used.
        Another is the gathering of feedback such as through blogs, or Facebook links in the e-book.
     • New technologies could include flexible paper-like screens that can download and display
        newspapers, magazines and books.
     • The “cloud” could be used to facilitate new services, for example to store e-books and resources
55      connected to the e-book.

     Challenges faced

     Over the next few years Cobb Publishing faces a number of challenges about which its managers
     need to make decisions.

     Marketing / business analytics
     Cobb Publishing has always needed to understand the reading habits and preferences of its actual
60   and potential customers. Traditional market research has used the following methods:
     • Interviews
     • Questionnaires
     • Focus group meetings.

     In order to get a better insight into customers’ behaviours, Cobb Publishing is considering collecting
65   data from its e-book readers in order to analyse their reading habits. This data-driven approach
     allows them to track what readers do in a variety of ways. They can collect large quantities of data
     which can be analysed to give them the basis for making better business decisions.

     Cobb Publishing is also considering developing links with other organizations to share data that
     will provide them with potential access to more customers. However, Cobb Publishing is aware
70   that the collection and sharing of data from readers is affected by privacy laws and has been advised
     that it should explicitly state in any user acceptance agreement that this data will be shared.

     Furthermore, civil liberty groups have expressed concern about the possibility of e-books being
     censored by the companies that control the publication, ownership and distribution of e-books.
     They are also concerned with the collecting of data about users’ reading habits that can promote a
75   feeling of “Big Brother is watching”, especially if shared with governments and other businesses.

     Self-publishing
     In recent years the availability of e-book development software and on/off-line services has
     increased the ability for authors to self-publish. Cobb Publishing caters for some self-publishing
     at the moment but needs to make a decision whether to develop its own in-house system for
80   self-publishing e-books that would include interactive and additional content such as quizzes,
     video and audio materials.




                                                                                               Turn Over
                                                –6–          M&N14/3/ITGSX/HP3/ENG/TZ0/XX/CS

      Distribution and licensing
      Cobb Publishing will need to consider the following impacts on e-book ownership, licensing and
      distribution methods:
 85   • Users will want to have the option to borrow or buy e-books. This would mean providing
         different types of ownership and licensing arrangements.
      • Some users may want to have greater flexibility in the e-books or chapters they can access,
         for example books on a certain topic or selected chapters only. This would mean providing
         distribution methods focusing on interest groups and readers of specialist materials.
 90   • Some universities and schools may want to get e-books for their libraries – Cobb Publishing
         would have to consider types of licences available for these organizations.
      • Synchronization of e-books across various platforms brings its own distribution and licensing
         problems with the possibility of multiple copies of an e-book and multiple people accessing the
         same e-book.
 95   • Cobb Publishing will have to decide which mobile devices / e-book readers they will support.
      • Cobb Publishing will have to decide which distribution outlets they will use. Some large
         publishers are developing their own distribution technologies and Cobb Publishing will need
         to decide whether to go into partnership with them and/or develop their own. Also, non-book
         businesses such as supermarkets have investigated setting up e-book sales outlets.
100   • Cobb Publishing is aware that methods of payment will need to be flexible, such as regular
         subscriptions, or an upfront payment plus extra payments for more features and updates.

      Legal rights and copyright
      Apart from distribution, ownership and licensing considerations, Cobb Publishing needs to:
      • investigate which types of Digital Rights Management (DRM) are most suitable for the types
105     of material they decide to publish in digital form.
      • decide on levels of protection that will protect the material from copying but still allow the
        customer the flexibility to use the product’s features fully, without undue interference.
      • consider the impact of obsolescence of standards and formats because it may be difficult to
        transfer DRM-restricted material to the new ones.
110   • consider what will be included in their “terms and conditions” of use and ownership and how
        these need to be able to adapt to emerging technologies.
      • consider the implications of data sharing with third party organizations.

      The current absence of any standard format for DRM makes these choices more difficult.
