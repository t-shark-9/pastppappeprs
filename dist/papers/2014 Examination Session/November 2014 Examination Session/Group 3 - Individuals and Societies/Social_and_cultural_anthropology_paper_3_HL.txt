Answer one question. The answer must refer to both theoretical perspectives and theory/schools of
thought in anthropology and their application to specific and clearly identified ethnographic illustrations.
Each question is worth [20 marks].

1.    To what extent is an ethnographic account shaped by the theoretical interests and perspectives of
      its author?


2.    Discuss the relationship between structure and agency in one of the following schools of thought:

      • structural functionalism
      • postmodernism
      • political economy.


3.    Examine why one school of thought has emphasized one of the following:

      • an idealist perspective
      • a diachronic perspective
      • a materialist perspective.


4.    Discuss the reasons for the differences between particularistic and universalistic perspectives in the
      development of anthropological theory.


5.    Compare and contrast cohesion-centred and conflict-centred perspectives in the work of one school
      of thought.
