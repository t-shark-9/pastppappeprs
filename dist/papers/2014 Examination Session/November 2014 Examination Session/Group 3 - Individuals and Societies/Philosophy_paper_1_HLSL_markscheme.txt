How to use the Diploma Philosophy markscheme

The assessment criteria constitute the formal tool for marking examination scripts, and in these assessment criteria
examiners can see the skills being assessed in the examinations. The markschemes are designed to assist examiners
in possible routes taken by candidates in terms of the content of their answers when demonstrating their skills of
doing philosophy through their responses. The points listed are not compulsory points, and not necessarily the best
possible points. They are a framework to help examiners contextualize the requirements of the question, and to
facilitate the application of marks according to the criteria listed on pages 5–8 for the Core Theme and pages 11–14
for the Optional Themes.

It is important that examiners understand that the main idea of the course is to promote doing philosophy, and this
involves activity and engagement throughout a two-year programme, as opposed to emphasizing the chance to
display knowledge in a terminal set of examination papers. Even in the examinations, responses should not be
assessed on how much candidates know as much as how they are able to use their knowledge in support of an
argument, using the skills listed in the assessment criteria published in the subject guide, reflecting an engagement
in philosophical activity throughout the course. As a tool intended to help examiners in assessing scripts, the
following points should be kept in mind when using a markscheme as an examiner:

   • The IB Philosophy programme is designed to encourage the skills of doing philosophy in the students.
     These skills can be accessed through reading the assessment criteria in the subject guide
   • The markscheme does not intend to outline a model/correct/good answer
   • The markscheme has an introductory paragraph which contextualizes the emphasis of the question being
     asked
   • The bullet points below the paragraph are suggested possible points of development that should not be
     considered a prescriptive list where necessarily all (or even some) should appear in the answer
   • The names of philosophers and references to their work associated with the question help to give a context
     for the examiners and do not reflect a requirement that such philosophers and references should appear in an
     answer: they are possible lines of development with the emphasis being on how the material is used in
     support of the candidate’s answer and not whether it appears in the answer
   • Candidates can legitimately select from a wide range of ideas, arguments and concepts in service of the
     question they are answering, and it is possible that candidates will use material effectively that is not
     mentioned in the markscheme
   • In Paper 1, examiners must be aware that a variety of types of answers and approaches, as well as a freedom
     to choose a variety of themes, is expected. Thus, examiners should not penalize different styles of answers
     or different selections of content when candidates develop their response to the questions. The markscheme
     should not imply that a uniform response is expected
   • In markschemes for the Core Theme questions in Paper 1 (Section A) the bullet points suggest possible
     routes of response to the stimulus, but it is critical for examiners to understand that the selection of the
     philosophical issue raised in the stimulus, and the two contrasting philosophical approaches that can be
     explored in light of the issue identified, are entirely at the choice of the candidate so it is possible for
     material to gain credit from the examiner even if none of the material features in the markscheme.

A reminder of candidate requirements for Paper 1 (Core Theme and Optional Themes):

Examiners are reminded that in the examination paper it states that candidates are expected to demonstrate the
following skills. Since these skills are encouraged within the assessment criteria, examiners should take them into
account in their marking:
• argue in an organized way using clear, precise language, which is appropriate to philosophy
• demonstrate knowledge and understanding of appropriate philosophical issues
• analyse, develop and critically evaluate relevant ideas and arguments
• present appropriate examples providing support for their overall argument
• identify and analyse counter-arguments
• provide relevant supporting material, illustrations and/or examples
• offer a clear and philosophically relevant personal response to the examination question.

In the examination paper candidates are required to:

Write a response (of approximately 800 words) in which they:
• identify a central philosophical concept or philosophical issue in the passage or photograph that addresses the
  question, “what is a human being?”
• investigate two different philosophical approaches to the philosophical concept or philosophical issue they
  identified
• explain and evaluate the philosophical concept or philosophical issue they identified.

Candidates at both Higher Level and Standard Level answer one question on the Core Theme (Section A).
Candidates at Higher Level answer two questions on the Optional Themes (Section B), each based on a different
Optional Theme.
Candidates at Standard Level answer one question on the Optional Themes (Section B).

                                              SECTION A

Core Theme: What is a human being?

1.   Passage from the History of Animals

     This question provides an opportunity to identify in the set passage a central philosophical concept
     or issue related to the question “what is a human being?”, to investigate two different philosophical
     approaches to the concept or issue identified, and to explain and evaluate the philosophical concept
     or issue. Responses might consider whether there exist any essential characteristics that distinguish
     a human being from other animals. Rationalist approaches might suggest that humans differ from
     animals in their ability to reason and to reflect upon causal connections, speculate, determine
     relevance, and control inclinations and passions instead of being controlled by them. Theories of
     recollection and reminiscence might argue that humans, unlike animals, have memory enabling
     them to focus reflectively on images, while reminiscence sifts systematically through memories to
     locate images not immediately accessible to the senses. Social contract theories see human beings
     as social/political animals constructing organized communities, cities and states, a trait not present
     in the other animals. Cognitive science argues that animals have immediate needs satisfied
     according to the limitations of their species while humans have an infinite number of needs—
     including artificial, abstract and metaphysical needs—which we create for ourselves.
     A Nietzschean perspective might argue that human beings differ from animals in their ability to
     make promises. Animals are locked into the present; humans can commit to the future. Humans
     demonstrate the power of will. Philosophies of culture might suggest that humans deal with the
     world and other people through symbolization while animals live in direct acquaintance with the
     sensible world. Environmental philosophers might submit that human beings share the environment
     with all other animal species and might assume the role of responsible stewardship. Existentialism
     might suggest that humans are distinguished from animals by their freedom and by their meaningful
     encounters with others. Finally, other factors might include perspectives that explore friendship,
     love, technology, reciprocity, language, spirituality, the Aristotelian notion of ends, and the
     continuity between non-human and human animal experience. In addressing these philosophical
     issues candidates might explore:
     • Whether the determination of the differences between a human being and an animal is simply
        a matter of degree with regard to certain characteristics. Is it a matter of quantitative or
        qualitative differences?
     • What might constitute a useful set of defining characteristics of a human being? What criteria
        would be used to select these defining characteristics?
     • To what extent is human nature determined by strictly biological factors that differ from those
        biological factors which determine animal nature?
     • Might we not say that the claim that human nature is different in kind from the nature of animals
        is just a case of human conceit and/or speciesism?
     • Are self-consciousness and rationality sufficiently convincing characteristics to distinguish
        human beings from other animals?
     • What are the roles of reason and emotion in distinguishing humans from animals?
     • Is the presence of a “first-person perspective” the key characteristic which distinguishes humans
        from other animals?
     • What aspects of personal identity and/or human nature do we share with other living beings?
     • Are human beings fundamentally just animals?
     • Does Aristotle’s stress on the bodily features of human and non-human animals diminish the
        distinction of human from non-human animals as compared with the Platonic-Cartesian stress on
        non-bodily features, like the mind?

2.   Image: Barcode Prisoner

     This question gives an opportunity to identify in the image a central philosophical concept or issue
     related to the question “what is a human being?”, to investigate two different philosophical
     approaches to the concept or issue identified, and to explain and evaluate the philosophical concept
     or issue. Responses might explain and evaluate the challenges technology and technological culture
     present to personhood, personal identity, and a sense of the self. The dilemma of digital identity as
     opposed to authentic personal identity might be considered. In this context, responses might
     investigate philosophically the impact of the collection and dissemination of personal data on
     personal identity and integrity, and the threats the mass digitalization of personal information
     present to human interaction. Philosophical approaches which offer a critique of anonymous
     regulation and centralized control of personal identity might be investigated along with
     philosophical approaches that contrast the dignity and integrity of the self with those factors that
     threaten interdependence, intersubjectivity and/or community. Responses might investigate
     philosophical approaches that highlight alienation, isolation, exploitation, nihilism, loss of identity,
     anonymity, dehumanization. Non-Western perspectives on understanding the self, alienation, desire
     for freedom, and freedom itself might be included in the investigation. The phenomenon of the
     dehumanization of individuals might be explored: names versus numbers; persons versus social
     units; digital convenience versus personal privacy. In addressing these philosophical issues
     candidates might explore:
     • Whether it is possible to understand the nature of the self in isolation from others
     • Different forms of imprisonment
     • Freedom versus determinism
     • Whether there is any escape from digitalization. From computerization? From communication
        via digital media?
     • Is the challenge to overcome isolation and establish authentic relationships with others
        unavoidably accompanied by anxiety and fear of alienation?
     • How can the individual achieve balance between individuality and community? Can each
        individual work out that balance in freedom with a sense of authenticity or is this project
        threatened by mass, electronic, digital culture?
     • Is nihilism a necessary consequence of the search for selfhood and self-constituted meaning in
        contemporary culture?
     • Can personal identity be captured digitally?
     • Will individual persons be absorbed into a seamless environment of computing, advanced
        networking technology and social interfaces?
     • Are we imprisoned by faceless materialism?
     • How free are we in digital, materialistic, mass culture?
     • Foucauldian notions like “technologies of the self” and their relation to self-surveillance
     • What other possible interpretations of the image might emerge regarding the question “what is a
        human being?”?

Optional Theme 1: Grounds of epistemology

3.   Evaluate the importance, in the process of gaining knowledge, of tracing the origins of ideas
     and concepts to experience.

     This question invites an exploration of tracing ideas to their origins. In the empiricist tradition
     minds are seen as original blank slates upon which experience subsequently writes content. In
     checking the empirical origin of the impressions that perception gives the mind, empiricists claim
     that knowledge can be verified or made clear. Responses will look at the empiricist handling of
     ideas, concepts, perceptions and impressions. Despite the reliance on sense-perception, empiricism
     defines a role for reason in abstracting, extending and manipulating original sense-experience.
     Hume splits mental content into “relations of ideas” (a priori manipulation of ideas) and “matters of
     fact” (that which is subject to perception). Locating the original experience associated with an idea
     offers criteria for clarifying how a claim is meaningful. Responses might discuss the verification
     principle and its development by the logical positivists of the 20th century. Some thinkers (eg,
     Popper) limit our checking of experience to the possibility of falsification. Responses might
     explore the rejection by empiricism of a priorism and the assumption by rationalism of a
     metaphysical world of principles able to be accessed via thought alone. Responses might also point
     to the problem raised by non-direct experience (complex ideas) and the issue of verifying facts in
     the past. In contrast, rationalism claims some knowledge comes innately. In addressing these
     philosophical issues candidates might explore:
     • The distinction between mental content and justification of that mental content as knowledge
     • Logical positivism
     • The need for sense-experience to say anything about the world; Kant on the need for a network
        of categories through which an objective experience can be made possible
     • The incorrigibility of sense-experience
     • The difference between vivid and indirect impressions
     • The claim that knowledge about the world must be based ultimately on sense-experience.

4.   Explain and discuss the problems faced in justifying beliefs as knowledge.

     This question invites an exploration of the ways in which mental content can be considered a
     faithful representation of the world outside the mind. It may involve an exploration of different
     ways beliefs are reckoned to rely on more foundational beliefs, or an exploration of the way beliefs
     provide mutual support in order to be justified as knowledge. Plato defines knowledge as “justified
     true belief” but this raises issues about truth and justification. Responses might discuss sense-data
     theories and might discuss the difference between sensations as simply given and incorrigible, and
     what is inferred about the world from them. Different approaches exist in an attempt to justify the
     basis of knowledge. Foundationalism attempts to find a basic, self-justifying basis for knowledge,
     while coherentism sees knowledge as consisting of a mutually supporting set of beliefs.
     Rationalism claims that only through reason can knowledge of the world be gained, but such
     knowledge is criticized as tautological and inapplicable to the world outside the knower. Kant
     attempts an account of knowledge through his synthetic a priori response to the issue, claiming the
     world is mind-shaped due to pre-existing mental schemes. In addressing these philosophical issues
     candidates might explore:
     • Skepticism – from global to partial approaches
     • “Brain in a vat” type examples
     • Concepts that do not need to be derived from experience and so can be confirmed a priori
     • The claim that knowledge gained a priori is merely tautological
     • Lack of certainty about the past or future if knowledge is based on sense-experience
     • Are sense-impressions indubitable?
     • All sense-impressions are subject to interpretation by the knower
     • The difference between knowledge by acquaintance and factual knowledge
     • Wittgenstein’s critique of empiricism’s reliance on “private” sense-data and beliefs.

Optional Theme 2: Theories and problems of ethics

5.   Evaluate the claim that “morality is a sickness peculiar to humans”.

     This question invites an evaluation of the nature, importance and purpose of morality in society and
     might lead to a challenge to the value of morality for humans. The idea of a non-moral stance by
     humans might be explored to see whether such a stance is human. There might be some evaluation
     as to whether the absence of controls or mores that influence and mould behaviour is beneficial.
     The attempt of humans to marry and control conflicting instincts and drives might be reflective of
     the complexity of society. The value and worthwhileness of issues of responsibility and
     accountability for actions might arise. There is also the possibility to contrast views on the nature
     of humans: essentially good or fundamentally bad. There might be a challenge to the claim in that
     morality might not necessarily be seen as a sickness, but rather a valued condition of humanness.
     In addressing these philosophical issues candidates might explore:
     • Whether morality is a fundamental or defining feature of humanness
     • If humans would have a better life without imposed moral codes
     • If an amoral or non-moral stance is possible in a complex industrial/post-industrial society
     • Whether moral codes are a means of benefiting some in society at the expense of others
     • Nietzschean concepts of morality
     • Examples of societal behaviour that are deemed amoral or non-moral and therefore classified as
        inhumane, eg, cannibalism or torture
     • Whether humans can negate or deny their self-interest.

6.   Evaluate the claim that humans have moral duties beyond those they have towards other
     humans.

     This question seeks an evaluation of the claim that humans might have moral duties towards
     non-humans or concerning the environment. There is need to explore the nature of moral duty and
     whether it can be applied outside the human domain. It raises the issue as to whether non-humans
     or the environment have value and what the nature of that value might be – instrumental or intrinsic
     concepts of value, eg, there might be seen to be an interrelationship of technology and the
     environment and a negative impact of destruction contrasted with the use of technology to
     protect nature. Applications of the Gaia hypothesis might be explored in terms of the overpowering
     regenerative features of the environment, along with the deep ecologists’ underestimation of the
     balance of nature. Kant’s conception of what duty is might be explored. Issues of duty and
     responsibility to future generations or questions about the treatment of animals, the distribution of
     wealth, bio-medical issues, etc, might be explored. In addressing these philosophical issues
     candidates might explore:
     • The limit or extent of duty
     • Whether as part of nature we have an implicit responsibility to care for the environment or to
        treat animals in certain ways etc.
     • Whether by attributing human qualities to nature or non-humans, we are making a category
        mistake
     • Different perspectives about nature, humans and non-humans
     • Whether international organizations establish laws or codes of practice that articulate universal
        moral duties.

Optional Theme 3: Philosophy of religion

7.   “Conceptions of the divine should not be reduced to only one notion of a higher being.”
     Discuss and evaluate.

     This question asks for a discussion and evaluation of both the possible diversity of the divine and
     the core idea of a higher being. Furthermore, it opens the discussion on the relations between these
     polar opposites. The diversity of conceptions of the divine, eg, in non-Western traditions,
     might include: Indian traditions (Buddhism, Hinduism, Jainism), Chinese traditions (Taoism,
     Confucianism), African traditions (Kongo, Ifa, Vodun, Orisha), Japanese traditions (Shinto,
     Tenrikyo), Australasian traditions (Maori, Aboriginal), Native North, South and Central American
     traditions (Hopi, Inuit, Mayan, Aztec, Inca). A basic conception, common to both Eastern and
     Western religions is of God as an ultimate reality, the source or ground of all else, perfect and
     deserving of worship. There are different views of God from religious experience, revealed or
     authoritative texts, and rational reflection. Philosophical conceptions include: God as a perfect
     being; God’s relation to the universe (first-cause view); God as creator of the universe ex nihilo,
     that is, from no pre-existing material; God conserving the universe in being moment by moment.
     In addressing these philosophical issues candidates might explore:
     • Why should there not be a unified notion of a higher being?
     • The extent of the diversity is significant even within a unified form of religion, eg, within
        Christianity some believers differ significantly on the nature of God. Some see God as
        all-controlling, others as self-limiting; some believe God to have infallible knowledge of all that
        has occurred, is occurring or will occur
     • The variety of theistic conceptions of the higher being/s
     • Perfect-being theology and criticisms of it; perfect-being theology has focused both on the
        possibility that the set of candidates for divine perfections may not be consistent or unique, and
        doubts as to whether human judgment can be adequate for assessing concepts of God
     • The tension between monotheistic and polytheistic conceptions of the divine – is it legitimate to
        maintain, as some do, that monotheism is the superior conception?
     • Whether multiculturalism might provide support for the claim in the question.

8.   “Attitudes such as belief, trust and hope allow various kinds of epistemic evaluation; they can
     be (or fail to be) rational, reasonable, reliably formed, warranted, and the like.” Discuss and
     evaluate.

     The question invites a discussion and evaluation of a central issue in the epistemology of religion:
     do religious beliefs and hopes have epistemic justification? Many issues might be associated with
     this concern and answers might address the general issue or discuss some more specifically.
     Taking part in a religion involves propositional attitudes: hoping, trusting, regretting and accepting
     different things. It also involves believing various things about God, the sacred, humanity, the past,
     present and future, glory and misery, and about the world. The ideal of justified belief and its
     questioning is prompted by Plato. To verbalize a religious belief is to express, often in
     metaphorical language, some aspect of a religious form of life while at the same time engaging in
     that form of life (eg, Wittgenstein, Tillich, Phillips). In addressing these philosophical issues
     candidates might explore:
     • Areas of our cognitive lives which depend on beliefs formed through testimony
     • Whether maintaining the idea that religious beliefs have epistemic merit implies a
        defence of religion
     • Whether religious beliefs have epistemic merits even if they are not grounded in any evidence
     • Religious beliefs are, at least in some forms and with regard to some issues, based on arguments
        and evidence, eg, verification and falsification
     • The form and value of the negation of religious beliefs. Are religious skepticism and nihilism
        forms of religious beliefs?
     • Epistemic value and other possible values of religious beliefs
     • Whether religious beliefs, like any other kind of beliefs, need to undergo rational examination
     • Different ways of coming to knowledge of a higher being, either through use of reason,
        revelation, mystical faith, or a combination.

Optional Theme 4: Philosophy of art

9.   Evaluate the claim that any plausible conception of the value of art will have to be
     instrumentalist, non-essentialist, and recognize that there is no single value shared by all
     works of art.

     The question asks for an assessment of the claim that this conception of the value of art is correct.
     It is necessary and important to distinguish between something’s being valued instrumentally (ie,
     being valued in terms of the benefits it provides – in the case of art, valuable for human beings,
     given that artworks are artifacts, which are always produced for human purposes or functions) and
     its being valued for its own sake. Typically the value of art is characterized instrumentally as
     providing pleasure, understanding, etc. When art is considered to have non-essentialist value this is
     because its value is not a matter of its possessing valuable properties—consider, for example, art
     that is intended to shock or disgust—nor of its possessing a distinctive value because of being
     unique and irreplaceable, since this is not true of all works of art, nor of there being some single
     value that is shared by all works of art (like evoking a particular emotional response or having a
     certain cognitive significance) since, again, this is not always the case. Finally, the sheer diversity
     of art—ranging from painting and sculpture through craft, literature, music, dance, architecture,
     film, photography and so on—speaks against its having a singular value. In addressing these
     philosophical issues candidates might explore:
     • The distinction between instrumental value and intrinsic value
     • Essential properties versus non-essential properties
     • Plural value versus singular value
     • The bearing of the above notions on the value of art.

10.   Examine the significance of our emotional responses for our understanding, appreciation and
      evaluation of works of art.

      The question asks for an examination of the relationship between people’s emotional responses to
      art and their appreciation, understanding and evaluation of art. On some views (eg, David Hume’s,
      A J Ayer’s), to appraise aesthetic qualities just is to respond emotionally. However, these views are
      implausible because emotional responses are not necessary for understanding, appreciating and
      evaluating works of art even though they are not precluded from them. It is clearly possible to have
      a dispassionate engagement with a work of art. On some other views (eg, Bertolt Brecht’s Marxist
      view) emotional engagement is said to impede our understanding, appreciation and evaluation of
      works of art. A consideration that often lurks in the background of views like these is that
      emotional engagement is at odds with rational engagement. Such a consideration finds inspiration
      in the contention of William James that emotions are bodily feelings and sensations. It is nowadays
      better recognized, however, that in at least some emotional experiences there is a cognitive
      component and/or the exercise of reason because those experiences involve judgment. Once this is
      acknowledged our emotional experiences can readily be seen as relevant to our understanding,
      appreciation and evaluation of works of art. Puzzles still remain, however. One such puzzle that
      candidates might examine is how certain emotions can figure in our experience of works of art
      when we know the characters they portray do not exist (eg, how we can loathe Iago in
      Shakespeare’s play Othello, or pity Anna in Tolstoy’s novel Anna Karenina, or fear the
      psychopathic killer in Hitchcock’s film Psycho, etc). In addressing these philosophical issues
      candidates might explore:
      • The nature of emotions
      • Emotions (or, passions) and their relation to human responses to art
      • Emotions and their relation to reason; emotions and bodily engagement
      • The puzzling emotional responses humans have to what they know to be fictional art objects.

Optional Theme 5: Political philosophy

11.   Explain and discuss the role consent can play as a basis of political obligation.

      This question invites an exploration of whether any citizen should feel obliged to act in accordance
      with the directives of the state in which he/she lives. The dominant approach towards
      political obligation is found in theories of the consent established through social contracts.
      Political obligation refers to law-keeping by citizens where the obligation is established within the
      context of living in the state, not for any metaphysical or religious reason. Social contract theories
      attempt to show that the individual citizen agrees to keep the law as part of a contract he/she
      establishes with the state. The individual’s part of the contract comes because he/she agrees to keep
      the law and thus sacrifices a certain amount of freedom. Consent offers a rational explanation for
      why a citizen should feel a duty to keep the law apart from any other specific moral motivations,
      however problems arise about how such consent is offered or taken. Theories of consent vary from
      explicit to tacit to hypothetical forms of consent, but in whatever form consent is granted there is
      much disagreement about why any specific individual should be obligated through this mechanism.
      Classic accounts of the social contract vary and place the stronger party in a partial position of
      power over the weaker. Candidates might draw on examples of anarchism, both political
      and economic, to use as illustrations of their response. In addressing these philosophical issues
      candidates might explore:
      • Consent through voting or residence; cf Hume’s illustration of the person coerced to join a ship
      • The use of the “state of nature” to justify the social contract; eg, Hobbes, Rousseau
      • Rousseau’s “general will”
      • Dissent and justifying civil disobedience; eg, Locke
      • Consent and democracy; is a government only legitimized by popular approval? The limits
         of democracy
      • Modern contract theory of Rawls offering impartiality and equality in the state.

12.   Evaluate the view that we possess human rights simply by virtue of being human.

      This question explores the notion of human rights and specifically of justifying how such rights
      arise. It encourages discussion of the concept of rights and might involve an evaluation of the
      implications of granting rights, and claims that rights are, or might be, inalienable. The UN
      Declaration of Universal Human Rights implies possession of rights simply by virtue of being alive,
      but some groups seek to stress the discussion of responsibilities alongside the granting of rights.
      Thinkers address what might constitute the minimum expectation in recognizing the rights
      of others. Responses might explore religious ideas that rights are given equally to all by virtue of
      the sacred nature of creation. Some might discuss Bentham’s relegation of rights as “nonsense on
      stilts” in the context of the primacy of utility. Alternatives to intrinsic notions of rights are that they
      are socially conferred through legislation or based on attributes of individuals. Such human
      attributes include autonomy, self-consciousness and awareness of individuality for informed choice.
      Responses might explore possible limits on rights, eg, children, the mentally ill or less able,
      criminals denied certain rights of freedom or democratic participation. In addressing these
      philosophical issues candidates might explore:
      • Basic rights involve freedom and notions of well-being; possessing rights may not guarantee
          their realization
      • Rights and the Harm Principle
      • Clashes of rights
      • Whether it is possible to relinquish inalienable rights
      • The relationship between legislation and inalienable rights; the relationship between the alleged
          universality of rights and the difficulties encountered in exercising them within particular states.

Optional Theme 6: Non-Western traditions and perspectives

13.   With reference to at least one non-Western tradition that you have studied, evaluate
      philosophically the relation between appearance and reality.

      The question is focused on this core distinction, which might be analysed at different levels, eg,
      material, spiritual or personal, in evaluating the defensibility of the chosen view. According to
      Buddhism the constituents of all existence are mental as well as physical factors, and include inner
      consciousness as well as outer bodily existence. According to Hinduism the beings that we
      experience as real outside of us are just a series of instantaneous flashes of dharmas. In a school of
      Vedanta, advaita means literally “not two” or “non-dual”. In the idea of the “non-dual”, reality is
      one and not to be differentiated. This reality is brahman, divine power, knowledge of which leads
      to moksa or liberation. The central notion here is of a hierarchy of levels of viewing reality. The
      Tao is an attempt at transcending dualisms of nothingness/being, existence/non-existence, and
      reality/illusion. It is sometimes expressed in the analogy of emptiness existing like the eternal
      ocean, while being is its waves. A common cosmological idea in Native American conceptions
      tends to see the universe as a unity prior to the difference between appearance and reality: a
      primordial form which is fundamentally animate and permeates the entire reality. In addressing
      these philosophical issues candidates might explore:
      • How the distinction between appearance and reality might appear at different levels: individual,
         cosmological, spiritual
      • Different ontologies: ancient Japanese worldview understood the gods, the natural world and
         humanity to be an ontological continuum; some schools of Hinduism divided the world into the
         material (prakriti) and the conscious (purusa)
      • Possible comparisons with aspects of Western thought by means of concepts such as substance,
         atoms, force.

14.   With reference to at least one non-Western tradition that you have studied, evaluate
      philosophically the nature and purpose of human life.

      This question invites an examination and evaluation of the origin, nature and purpose of human life
      in relation to ground notions (eg, universe, freedom, destiny, immortality) of at least one of the
      traditions chosen. The Confucian concept of freedom applies to all voluntary activities
      of humankind. The right of freedom is sacred as long as people do not deliberately violate the Tao.
      According to Hinduism in general the joys and suffering of a human life are of the person’s own
      making; the destiny of the soul is immortality through self-realization. For Confucians, Taoists and
      many Buddhists, human nature as it is experienced by us is the launching pad for our eventual
      emancipation and self-transformation. A common view of India’s religious and philosophical
      traditions is that human life is subject to karma and rebirth. The retributive power of actions and
      decisions generates a not necessarily endless succession of births and deaths for living beings.
      In addressing these philosophical issues candidates might explore:
      • Happiness and suffering as basic possibilities of human life
      • The possibility of a radical notion of final liberation (nirvana) and the commitment to achieve it
         by eliminating the roots of karmic existence, that is, selfish desire and the illusion of the self
         (ancient Buddhism)

Optional Theme 7: Contemporary social issues

15.   Evaluate the claim that, by taking into account a variety of expressions of justice (such as
      multicultural, multi-ethnic, global), social justice can be relevant in a variety of social
      contexts.

      This question requires an evaluation of the nature of social justice and its incorporation into
      multicultural, multi-ethnic and even global contexts. Social justice incorporates notions of justice
      for the individual as well as justice for the social whole. In multicultural, ethnically pluralistic and
      global conditions, an adequate understanding of social justice might address the interactions within
      and amongst a multitude of peoples in a multitude of contexts. Social justice might consider how
      dominant and non-dominant conceptions of justice arise, how they are selectively institutionalized
      and are formally and informally applied, what persons and groups are protected by or deprived of
      its mandates, and how to facilitate its promotion in social contexts. Social justice might incorporate
      notions of distributive, retributive, restorative and procedural justice. As no single conception or
      practice of justice is adequate for all historical periods or for all forms of society, the notion of
      social justice changes and develops along with societies. Social justice should promote democratic
      discourse, the meeting of needs, the attainment of equality, and the equitable distribution of wealth
      and resources. It should also be relevant to political, economic and historical conditions, their local
      and global manifestations, the attainment of human well-being and development at the individual
      and social levels, and the development of evaluative criteria and legitimate processes by which the
      effects of these factors might be measured. Social justice resists inequality and institutionalized
      disenfranchisement both locally and globally. Social justice must guard against the tendency of
      dominant groups to translate resistance into legalistic and institutionalized responses to perceived
      harm that can discriminate, disenfranchise, and silence segments of the population in the struggle
      for social justice. In addressing these philosophical issues candidates might explore:
      • How social justice emerges in the context of minority groups and their interests
      • What is justice/social justice and who provides the definition: the few (elites); the majority; a
          minority and/or minorities?
      • The challenges to social justice posed by globalism, multiculturalism, multi-nationalism, and
          post-colonialism. Can they be addressed successfully? Realistically? At all?
      • To what extent, if at all, social justice can/should incorporate the concerns of indigenous
          societies, gender and sexuality issues, and environmental issues
      • Whether social justice highlights the differences between asking what is fair and what is just in
          retributive and distributive forms of justice
      • Whether there can ever be a just society. Can we ever view all people as inherently equal and
          entitled to the same rights and privileges?
      • How multiculturalism affects our understanding of social justice.

16.   Evaluate the claim that gender equality is just, is good for human society and will facilitate
      new ways of thinking and living together.

      This question asks for an evaluation of gender equality as the measurable equal representation of
      women and men in their personal and social status especially in terms of rights, duties and
      responsibilities. Responses might evaluate the view that gender equality does not imply that
      women and men are the same, but that they have equal value and should be accorded equal
      treatment. Equality in the context of gender equality might be understood as: a) a qualitative or
      descriptive notion where equality is conceived in respect to some property possessed in
      varying degrees, b) an evaluative notion where equality is conceived according to some standard
      of value or merit, and c) a distributive or prescriptive notion where the focus is upon a clear policy
      of treating people, or the sexes, equally. This includes equal access to schooling, employment,
      legal standing, cultural enrichments, medical care, and any aspects of life that potentially or actually
      involve gender. Abandoning certain gender-based roles facilitates personal development and
      self-realization and maximizes opportunity. Equal contribution to every person’s life does not
      equalize the success of each person. Abilities, social skills, mental acuity, and appearance differ.
      Gender equality requires changes in personal, social and business practices. Thus, greater
      socio-economic justice is a primary goal of a less gendered society. In addressing these
      philosophical issues candidates might explore:
      • What is meant or intended by the notion of gender equality
      • What factors account for the continuing prevalence of gender inequality wherever it is found
      • The empowerment of women in order to alleviate social problems
      • Whether there is a convincing line of reasoning for providing a justification for treating people
         equally (as a policy) when they are not descriptively equal (in fact)
      • How and to what extent does gender equality produce conflicts between equal treatment and
         notions of justice and freedom
      • The possibility of going beyond thinking about equality in terms of male experience, which tends
         to make equality mean the masculinization of women
      • Whether we can philosophically justify gender equality, eg, Kant’s practical imperative (treat all
         people as ends, never merely as means), Bentham’s principle of utility (effect the greatest
         balance of pleasure over pain)
      • Commonly used arguments for gender-based roles: they appeal to nature; they are efficient;
         they foster the well-being and happiness of women implying that women are weak and
         vulnerable because of physical and psychological differences between men and women;
         they highlight the attractiveness of certain differences between men and women.

Optional Theme 8: People, nations and cultures

17.   Evaluate the claim that even though a state is entitled to design and enforce a selective
      immigration policy, it is not entitled to restrict the entry of political refugees.

      The question asks for an evaluation of the claim that a state is entitled to restrict the entry of
      political (as against, say, economic) refugees. “Political refugees” are those who seek protection
      from a state other than their own because of a well-founded fear of being persecuted for reasons to
      do with their race or ethnicity, their religious beliefs, or their political convictions, etc.
      Traditionally such refugees have been thought to constitute a special category among potential
      immigrants because of the urgency of their need to be afforded state protection. This urgency has
      been thought to take precedence over the right of a state to enforce its immigration policy. (In light
      of this tradition, candidates might consider whether so-called “economic refugees” should similarly
      be regarded as being in urgent need of state protection.) Despite this traditional contention some
      have questioned whether even the dire predicament of a (political) refugee is sufficient to require a
      particular state to offer assistance that has the potential to lead to citizenship. They accept that there
      are some obligations to assist those in peril, but they ask why borders must be unrestrictedly laid
      open to refugees instead of assistance being given in other ways (eg, via temporary protection
      orders until the oppressive circumstances in the refugee’s own country are overturned and it is safe
      to return). It has been suggested as well that poorer states have less capacity to take in refugees
      than do richer states. So, if poorer states are required to accept refugees without restriction, this is
      likely to have devastating impacts on their capacity to provide for their existing citizens.
      Richer states, which tend to be better able to protect their borders, are apt to be much less affected.
      These critics conclude that richer states should shoulder more of the burden by accepting as
      immigrants those refugees given temporary protection by poorer states. In addressing these
      philosophical issues candidates might explore:
      • What it means to be a refugee
      • The right (if there is one) of a national government to determine its immigration level (including
         its refugee intake)
      • The financial and social implications for a nation in the event of there being no restrictions on
         immigration
      • The obligations (if any) of wealthy nations to ensure that poorer nations do not have to bear a
         disproportionate share of the world’s refugee burden.

18.   Evaluate the claim that the moral duty we have to aid foreigners who are starving or
      undergoing serious suffering has precedence over our obligations to our fellow citizens.

      The question asks for an assessment of the compatibility of moral cosmopolitanism with our
      obligations to our fellow citizens. Moral cosmopolitanism is the view that to live a good human life
      requires that one provide aid to the suffering, promote the achievement of justice, and guarantee the
      human rights of all without regard to social and political affiliation. Communitarians (like
      MacIntyre) believe, by contrast, that our obligations to others arise out of sharing close relations
      with them. Accordingly, they are highly critical of moral cosmopolitanism. Other critics have
      advanced different criticisms of moral cosmopolitanism. In particular, they have claimed, first, that
      moral cosmopolitans neglect (or, at the very least, underplay) obligations of reciprocity stemming
      from the benefits provided by fellow citizens. Moral cosmopolitans have responded by claiming
      that the benefits that derive from societal cooperation are not straightforwardly attributable to
      fellow citizens as such and, moreover, that it is not obvious why the receipt of benefits should in
      itself be thought to give rise to social obligations. Moreover, it is denied that citizens (especially
      children) voluntarily enter into a social contract in the expectation of getting benefits in return.
      In consequence, no more can be demanded of citizens than social cooperation. A second line of
      criticism has been advanced by, for example, David Miller. He claims that certain sorts of
      relationship – for example, friendship – give rise to, or, may even be said to be constituted by,
      reciprocal obligations. He further claims that the relationship with one’s fellow citizens is one of
      these sorts of relationship. Moral cosmopolitans reject the claim that citizenship is relevantly
      like friendship. While acknowledging that it may not always be easy psychologically to do so,
      they contend that it is possible to lead a good human life without favouring their compatriots over
      other human beings. In addressing these philosophical issues candidates might explore:
      • The character and implications of moral cosmopolitanism (whether by that name or simply by a
          description of the view known by that name)
      • Criticisms of moral cosmopolitanism by communitarians
      • Criticisms of moral cosmopolitanism by social contractarians
      • Responses by moral cosmopolitans to criticisms, especially those concerned with whether fellow
          citizens should be favoured over non-citizens.
