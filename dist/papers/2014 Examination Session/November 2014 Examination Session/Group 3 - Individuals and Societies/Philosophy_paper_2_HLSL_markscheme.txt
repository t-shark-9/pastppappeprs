How to use the Diploma Philosophy markscheme

The assessment criteria constitute the formal tool for marking examination scripts, and in these assessment criteria
examiners can see the skills being assessed in the examinations. The markschemes are designed to assist examiners
in possible routes taken by candidates in terms of the content of their answers when demonstrating their skills of
doing philosophy through their responses. The points listed are not compulsory points, and not necessarily the best
possible points. They are a framework to help examiners contextualize the requirements of the question, and to
facilitate the application of marks according to the criteria listed on pages 5–8.

It is important that examiners understand that the main idea of the course is to promote doing philosophy, and this
involves activity and engagement throughout a two-year programme, as opposed to emphasizing the chance to
display knowledge in a terminal set of examination papers. Even in the examinations, responses should not be
assessed on how much candidates know as much as how they are able to use their knowledge in support of an
argument, using the skills listed in the assessment criteria published in the subject guide, reflecting an engagement
in philosophical activity throughout the course. As a tool intended to help examiners in assessing scripts, the
following points should be kept in mind when using a markscheme as an examiner:

   • The IB Philosophy programme is designed to encourage the skills of doing philosophy in the students.
     These skills can be accessed through reading the assessment criteria in the subject guide
   • The markscheme does not intend to outline a model/correct/good answer
   • The markscheme has an introductory paragraph which contextualizes the emphasis of the question being
     asked
   • The bullet points below the paragraph are suggested possible points of development that should not be
     considered a prescriptive list where necessarily all (or even some) should appear in the answer
   • The names of philosophers and references to their work associated with the question help to give a context
     for the examiners and do not reflect a requirement that such philosophers and references should appear in an
     answer: they are possible lines of development with the emphasis being on how the material is used in
     support of the candidate’s answer and not whether it appears in the answer
   • Candidates can legitimately select from a wide range of ideas, arguments and concepts in service of the
     question they are answering, and it is possible that candidates will use material effectively that is not
     mentioned in the markscheme
   • In markschemes for Paper 2 there is a greater requirement for specific content as the Paper requires the study
     of a text by the candidates and the questions set will derive from that text. The markscheme will show what
     is central in a text to an expected response by the candidate and examiners can use the markscheme to be
     aware of centrally relevant material.

A reminder of candidate requirements for Paper 2:

Examiners are reminded that in the examination paper it states that candidates are expected to demonstrate the
following skills. Since these skills are encouraged within the assessment criteria, examiners should take them into
account in their marking:
• argue in an organized way using clear, precise language, which is appropriate to philosophy, and demonstrate
    an understanding of the author’s specific terminology
• show an understanding of the specific demands of the question
• give references to the ideas and arguments presented in the text
• present appropriate examples providing support for their overall argument
• identify and analyse counter-arguments
• provide relevant supporting material, illustrations and/or examples
• develop a critical evaluation of the ideas and arguments of the text
• offer a clear and philosophically relevant personal response to the position expressed by the author.

Candidates at both Higher Level and Standard Level answer one question.

     Achievement     Descriptor
        Level
          0          The candidate has not reached level 1.
         1–2         The candidate develops ideas and arguments in a basic way and there is little or
                     no evaluation of the text.
          3–4        The candidate develops some ideas and arguments but the development is
                     simple, or is asserted without reference to the text. There may be some basic
                     evaluation of the ideas and arguments of the text but it is not developed.
          5–6        The candidate develops ideas and arguments in a satisfactory way and evaluates
                     them to some extent. A limited critique of the ideas and arguments of the text is
                     offered. There is some evidence of a relevant personal response.
          7–8        The candidate develops ideas and arguments from a consistently held
                     perspective, in close response to the ideas and arguments of the text. Evaluation
                     is thoughtful and convincing and the candidate offers a critique of the text that
                     goes beyond a statement of opinion or belief. There is good evidence of a
                     relevant personal response.
         9–10        The candidate develops ideas and arguments in an incisive and coherent way in
                     detailed response to the text. Evaluation is compelling or subtle, and convincing,
                     and the candidate offers a critique of the text that shows strong evidence of a
                     relevant personal response. The candidate shows an ability to challenge the
                     assumptions made by the author and explores different approaches to the text.

Bhagavad Gita

1.   Evaluate the view that the Bhagavad Gita might contribute to world peace by providing
     insight into the nature of, and a possible solution to, conflict and war.

     The question asks for an evaluation of the possible contribution of the text to the understanding of
     peace. The situation which gives rise to the dialogue refers to a military conflict, involving power
     issues and spiritual aspects. Arjuna’s hesitation to battle is centred on the personal consequences of
     fighting and guilt about the decimation of his people. Krishna speaks with him and he resolves to
     fight. After the war is fought, the Pandavas emerge victorious due to devious tactics suggested by
     Krishna. Whoever applies Krishna’s yogic attitude behaves traditionally, participating in existing
     institutions and helping to sustain the community. The idea of dehin, the “one in the body”
     (“spirit”, “soul”), also known as atman (“self”) and purusa (literally “person”), cannot be killed,
     and will repeatedly take another body after the death of the current one. Salvation is centred on the
     possibility of moksa or nirvana, an end to a sequence of lives. This approach to future life might
     give grounds for a positive evaluation regarding the contribution of the text to peace.
     In addressing these philosophical issues candidates might explore:
     • Wars as being fought in the minds of people: cultivate peace in their minds and there will be
        no wars
     • Arjuna’s objection to fighting: his actions will produce an unpleasant afterlife for himself and
        his family
     • That the human being is considered as an extended sequence of individual lives. This may be
        reflected in the understanding of war and peace
     • Krishna’s attitude is particularly conducive to social harmony and cultural continuity within a
        diverse, organized and potentially enormous community
     • Interpretations of the Bhagavad Gita: rejection of quietism, justification of violent action against
        tyrants, and encouragement to revolutionary activity
     • Gandhi: the Mahabharata war as an allegorical representation of the internal struggle between
        the human soul and worldly temptations. He saw his principles of non-violence and politics of
        passive resistance as deriving from the text.

2.   “Meditation is a method to go beyond one’s reality, to gain greater wisdom of [the] self and a
     newer insight into who one is.” Discuss and evaluate.

     The question asks for a discussion and evaluation of what meditation might imply, eg, renunciation,
     and its implications with regard to the development of self-awareness. The self that transcends
     bodily identification transmigrates from one body to another in a seemingly endless series
     of incarnations. Knowledge is more important than exercises, and meditation is more important
     than knowledge, but renouncing personal profit is more important than meditation, it leads to
     greater wisdom of oneself. The self is related to or constituted by consciousness, which is the most
     fundamental part of human experience; nothing is more intimate or more immediate and, at the
     same time, more transcendent. In addressing these philosophical issues candidates might explore:
     • That meditation teaches renunciation of attachments to the material, one becomes free from the
        earthly passions
     • That meditation enables the performance of actions as sacrificial offerings to a higher power,
        merging human actions with the harmony of the entire creation
     • Whether meditation is a kind of method which can be taught and learned
     • Meditation attempts to transcend the limits of one’s belief system and experiences and goes
        beyond the ego-based reality. How can someone be himself or herself without being the
        same self?
     • Whether meditation is a means of escape from reality.

Confucius: The Analects

3.   Explain and discuss the view that Confucius’s version of the Golden Rule consists of two
     notions, zhong (loyalty, truthfulness to oneself, self-regard) and shu (reciprocity), which form
     the “one thread” running through the Tao.

     This question asks for an explanation and discussion of a central tenet of Confucian ethics,
     its relation to its constitutive notions of zhong (loyalty, truthfulness to oneself, self-regard) and
     shu (reciprocity), and their interrelationship. Confucius’s version of the Golden Rule relates to the
     key concepts of li (ritual), ren (benevolence, humaneness) and the Tao. The Golden Rule invokes
     principles of constraint and recommendation: do not treat others as I would not like to be treated
     (constraint); treat others as I would like to be treated (recommendation). This is central to the Tao.
     Zhong concerns what I should do to others because I would like others to do the same to me.
     It focuses upon moral self-discipline and attention to the specific duties of one’s roles. Those who
     are zhong are conscientious about their obligations and seek to understand and fulfil them by
     imagining how they would like to be treated by others. Zhong is an ethical imperative to do one’s
     best at implementing the course of action revealed through shu. Shu, on the other hand, concerns
     that which I should not do to others because I would not like others to do it to me.
     Shu complements the practice of zhong as a disposition of moral discretion sensitive to how the
     practice of one’s role-specific duties affects others. By imagining how one would like to be treated
     if one were in the other’s place, we can see when it is appropriate to amend, bend, or even suspend
     the practice of the rites and norms of the Tao. Shu connects oneself with others and identifies
     which actions satisfy the ethical criterion of the Golden Rule. In addressing these philosophical
     issues candidates might explore:
     • Whether zhong and shu, as the best way to practice righteousness, which function as two strands
         of a single thread, constitute the only way to practice and achieve righteousness
     • Zhong as a necessary and preliminary stage of ethical development that must be refined and
         guided by the possession of shu. In this perspective, we would examine two virtuous attitudes of
         how to act rather than assess the quality of the actions themselves
     • Zhong and shu as intimately connected to the practice of the correct rites (li) and to the study of
         traditional wisdom; together zhong and shu enable us to achieve discernment and make progress
         along the Tao
     • How li (rites) prescribe what is proper but the practice of shu ensures that in exercising the
         prerogatives of our position, we temper our application of rules
     • How zhong supplies one half of the Golden Rule by governing conduct toward one’s peers and
         social superiors. It involves the act of imaginatively putting yourself in the position of one’s
         equal or superior and, in light of li, seeing how one would want to be treated; shu supplies the
         other half of the Golden Rule by governing conduct toward one’s peers and subordinates.
         It inspires the care and concern that one should adopt when in a position of authority
     • How reciprocity is able to be defended on rational grounds as opposed to liturgical or
         dogmatic/scriptural grounds
     • Is Confucius’s version of the Golden Rule a convincing enough basis to form the unifying thread
         in the Tao as claimed?

4.   Explain and discuss the view that Confucian ethics sees ren tao (the human way) in relation to
     tian tao (the way of heaven) through the practice of li (ritual).

     This question asks for an explanation and discussion of the relationship of ren tao to tian tao and
     the ways in which the principal ethical factor li sustains that relationship. Tao is “the way” of
     proper relations for all earthly and heavenly contexts. Ren tao is a microcosm of the tian tao.
     Ren tao is the way of li conceived as benevolent conduct ritualized into formal practices. Ren and li
     are unified in these practices so that humaneness, goodness and decency (ren) are communicated
     through ritual conventions (li). The unity of ren and li facilitates human flourishing consistent with
     and descended from the way of heaven and expressed through one’s roles in life. Thus, li links the
     human way with the greater way of heaven itself and is the vehicle for its expression.
     The connection of the human way with the way of heaven cultivates excellence that seeks high
     ideals, even divine perfection. Ren tao unifies the human community situating it in relation to tian
     and to the heavenly ancestors and spirits. The most perfect expression of li issues from divine
     sages, ancestors and descendents of heaven who serve humanity with excellence and transform the
     world into a better place. Our sublime relations with them and with the wisdom of the ages as
     realized by us in the present are the means by which we make the Tao great. In so doing, the
     human way becomes an expression of the great way of heaven. Humanity improves when ren tao
     expresses the harmony and order of tian tao, making moral agency and spiritual power inseparable.
     Ren tao is linked to tian tao insofar as we are noble in spirit (ren) and action (li). Ren is the
     greatness that li expresses and makes human life sacred. The secular conventions of ritual express
     the sacred human spirit. In addressing these philosophical issues candidates might explore:
     • The extent to which Confucianism sees humanity (macrocosm) in relation to the larger scheme
        of things. The “self” or “person” (microcosm) is also established relationally – in connection
        with family, friends, colleagues, community, nation, and with heaven
     • How li literally is the “ritual vessel” through which human excellence is realized. Li can be lofty
        and grand, as in the case of an elaborate religious or political ceremony, or li can be down to
        earth, as in the case of a handshake, a bow, or even a smile
     • The extent to which tian tao is nothing more than a rarefied and transcendental version of ren tao
     • How through li humanity can fine-tune its relation with the natural harmony and grace of the
        way of being itself (Tao) and with the way of heaven. Is this ethical perspective a bit too
        mechanical and/or simplistic?
     • How failure in our duties to our ancestors can bring about imbalance in our lives. If we
        genuinely fulfil our obligations to them with rituals that are proper and reverent, will we be
        assured of achieving and maintaining harmony between heaven and earth (cosmic harmony)?
     • How the importance of moral character is the means of demonstrating how the goodness that
        extends from tian is put into practice on earth
     • What criteria are available to distinguish the authentic from the inauthentic practice of ritual?
        Is this a problem for Confucian ethics?
     • How ritual translates into ethical behavior; is the supposed translation plausible?

Lao Tzu: Tao Te Ching

5.   Evaluate the claim that in the service of heaven there is nothing better than limiting oneself
     and one’s actions.

     This question allows for the evaluation of aspects of the nature of the Tao in terms of heaven and
     how by limiting action one can better serve the Tao “in heaven”. The nature of heaven (tian)
     compared to the physical world of nature (ti) and the human world (tien-hsia) could be explored.
     The idea that heaven is pure is because the Tao is within it, unlike our world, which is unstable,
     changing and self-oriented. Limiting can be seen as wu wei (non-action). By being non-active the
     Tao can best be seen and be reached. Humans should be striving to be nearer to heaven because of
     its purity. Wu wei encourages humans not to be competitive and not to strive against natural forces.
     Limiting oneself allows time for reflection and seeing things as a whole which is in tune with the
     Tao. It might also allow humans to return to a “golden age” where selfishness and cunning did not
     exist and with the absence of these two, seemingly negative qualities, humans would come closer to
     heaven. A challenge could be put that with non-action and a non-competitive spirit, a fundamental
     drive to success and progress might be missing from human society. Human activity would
     stagnate. It is possible that as a result of this non-interfering, humans might not be effective in a
     modern industrialized/post-industrialized world. Moreover is it within the nature of humans to limit
     themselves in the ways suggested? If they, as individuals, could not, who would, when it is also
     suggested that the ruler and government should equally not interfere in the patterns of nature?
     Harmonious relationships and a containment of emotion might reduce conflict but might also not be
     an effective counter to reason.            In addressing these philosophical issues candidates
     might explore:
     • The non-action of humans, their passivity, raises the issue of how they change things or whether
         they change anything
     • Whether the attempt to reach heaven means that human progress and the control of the natural
         environment should be limited
     • How far the qualities of human nature and ideas of heaven are mutually exclusive or are part of
         the same phenomena, which might be seen as simply different aspects of human nature
     • Whether Lao Tzu’s desire to move towards the Tao in heaven is far too idealistic in a
         materialistic world. Could humans survive without being materialistic?
     • Whether humans are meant to serve heaven. Are humans capable of limiting their
         own capacities?

6.   Explain and discuss how if one “puts away morality and throws away duty” life will be better.

     This question seeks an explanation and discussion of whether being amoral and not fulfilling one’s
     duty will produce a better life which is more harmonious and closer to the Tao. “Better” in this
     tradition is seen as in harmony with the Tao and maintaining natural relationships – those that relate
     to nature, as opposed to social interactions. The rejection of morality and duty is a rejection of what
     is necessary for directed and controlled social order. What is sought is an individual in harmony
     with the Tao, not a civically responsible individual. Therefore it might be questioned as to how,
     with no morality and duty, confusion in the state could be avoided since the normal role of servants
     (meaning both those that wait on others and civil servants of the state) is to interfere in the natural
     behaviour of the individual for the greater good. In contrast if morality and duty were upheld then
     civic responsibilities would drive action. The solution that is offered involves removing
     materialism and property ownership as well as the application of wu wei. With wu wei,
     competition, greed and selfishness will be removed and with them the need for morality and duty.
     In addressing these philosophical issues candidates might explore:
     • Whether an amoral society relies on the fundamental good nature of humans. Is this feasible?
     • How far, in urban industrialized environments, civic responsibility can simply be ignored
     • Whether wu wei is a natural condition of humans or whether humans are naturally competitive
        and materialistic
     • Whether Lao Tzu’s notion of a “better” society is compatible with the modern world
     • Who, without morality and duty, would care for the poor, disadvantaged and disabled of
        our societies?

Plato: The Republic, Books IV–IX

7.   Evaluate Plato’s claim that it is because those suited to be workers are ruled by their appetites
     rather than their reason, that they should be governed by those in whom reason rules.

     The question asks for an evaluation of a claim sometimes attributed to Plato, namely that those
     ruled by their appetites should be slaves to those who are governed by reason. This claim has been
     attributed to Plato on the basis of what Socrates says at 590c–d. Gregory Vlastos, for example, did
     so even though he construed what Socrates had in mind as “idealized slavery”, while Terry Irwin
     contended that, according to Plato, while it is best to be ruled by one’s own reason, where this is not
     possible the next best option is to be subject to someone else in whom reason rules. Candidates
     defending the claim might appeal to the image of the steersman of a normal ship (who has superior
     knowledge of seafaring) who is likened to the steersman who rules the ship of state at 527c.
     Candidates arguing against the claim might point out that nowhere is it claimed that farmers,
     artisans and handicraftsmen (who are all numbered among the demos) have weak rational parts.
     Moreover, it is said to be possible (see 590c–591a) to strengthen a person’s rational part (relative to
     his/her appetitive part) by habituation and practice. Finally, at 547b–c it is said that the rulers are
     not despotic and that the workers only become slaves in the event of the downfall of the ideal city
     and control subsequently falling into the hands of the property-owning class. In addressing these
     philosophical issues candidates might explore:
     • The nature of, and relations between, appetite and reason in Plato’s philosophy
     • The simile of “the ship of state”; does what is said to hold for individuals apply via analogy to
         the state?
     • Plato’s view concerning the rationality of the individual members of the demos
     • Whether an intellectual capacity ought to legitimize a form of (political or other) power
         over others?
     • The circumstances in which the workers would, in fact, become governed.

8.   Evaluate the claim that an individual with a just soul will refrain from unjust activities.

     The question asks for an assessment of the view that one whose soul is just will not act unjustly.
     Socrates describes the individual with a just soul as having inner harmony because he/she is ruled
     by reason, which alone can ensure that all of his/her rational, spirited and appetitive parts are
     satisfied. But if justice has to do with a person’s relations with others (not just with his/her inner
     harmony) what reason is there to think a just soul will refrain from actions that show disregard for
     the interests of others? Two main suggestions have been made about closing this gap. First, it has
     been claimed that an individual with a just soul will have no interest in acting unjustly because
     he/she will act on values and desires whose satisfaction is incompatible with unjust actions (485d–
     486b). Second, it has been claimed that an individual with a just soul knows what is objectively
     good and is directly motivated to bring it about (479a–c). The first view proposes implausibly that
     the individual’s reasons for refraining from injustice are independent of his/her concern for others;
     the second allows for the possibility of the just individual sacrificing his/her self-interest for the
     good which runs counter to Socrates’s claim that it is always in our best interest to be just. A way
     of improving on these flawed suggestions might be to see Socrates as arguing for consideration of
     the good of others on the ground that it is necessary for personal harmony, in which case an
     individual cannot be just without seeing the good of others as an element of his/her own good
     (462b–e, 463e–464d). In addressing these philosophical issues candidates might explore:
     • The requirements for someone to have a just soul
     • Whether a just soul can be motivated to act unjustly
     • Whether a just soul can be motivated to act against his/her best interest
     • Whether concern for the good of others is among the properties constitutive of acting justly
     • Whether Plato is right to tie knowledge of the good to motivation to act justly and what
        implications this might have for Plato’s moral cognitivism
     • Connections to virtue ethics.

René Descartes: Meditations

9.   Evaluate Descartes’s arguments for God’s existence.

     This question requires an explanation of the proofs for the existence of God offered in the Third and
     Fifth Meditations. The trademark argument is based on “the causal adequacy principle” in which
     God places the a priori idea of himself inside us. The idea of God is innate and is caused efficiently
     since “there must be at least as much reality in an efficient cause and the total cause as in the effect
     of that cause”. The causal adequacy principle applies to ideas as much as material things. If an
     idea represents an object with a certain property then the cause of the idea must possess as much of
     that particular property as is actually contained in the idea. The properties Descartes mentions are
     God being “eternal, infinite, immutable etc”. The idea of God is also “clear and distinct” and there
     is no idea which is truer for Descartes. The other proof is about deriving existence from less
     perfect sources. Descartes asks if he could exist if there were no being more perfect than himself.
     Descartes cannot derive existence from himself for if he did he would endow himself with
     perfections only God has, eg, Descartes raises the possibility of not having a beginning, but even
     then he would need the power to keep himself in existence. The ontological argument claims that
     God cannot fail to exist given it would be a contradiction to think of a perfect being without
     existence, since existence is a perfection. In addressing these philosophical issues candidates
     might explore:
     • Whether a lesser formal reality could not cause a greater objective reality
     • Whether it is arbitrary to demand as much formal reality in the cause of an idea as the objective
        reality in the idea itself; cases of causes not being like their effects, eg, two cold sticks rubbed
        together to make heat
     • Whether existence can be compared in such a way that one existence is inferior to another
     • The notion Descartes uses of bringing himself into existence, when his objection is not being
        aware of being able to keep himself in existence – but why might he not have this power without
        being aware?
     • That the ontological argument claims that existence is a property of perfection
     • Possible existence versus necessary existence
     • Whether Descartes seems to rely on God to supply support for his thesis in Meditations; is
        this justified?

10.   Explain and discuss the method of doubt which Descartes presents.

      This question invites an exploration of the doubt which Descartes deliberately raises in the First
      Meditation and which establishes the central task for his exploration of knowledge and certainty
      throughout the work. Descartes raises specific doubts but the general problem of global skepticism
      is raised throughout the work. Answers can range from a criticism of Descartes’s expression of the
      doubts themselves to a treatment of his solution to the general issue of doubt expressed in the cogito
      and in his subsequent treatment of imagination and its relation to knowledge gained through the
      senses. In addressing these philosophical issues candidates might explore:
      • Descartes’s response to the doubts of the First Meditation – the cogito and self-evident truth
      • The difference between knowledge of the mind and knowledge of material objects – the
          wax illustration
      • Sources of ideas and clarity/distinctiveness of ideas
      • Sensory error and the faithfulness of God in guaranteeing knowledge gained by the senses
      • Descartes’s proposed solution.

John Locke: Second Treatise on Government

11.   Evaluate Locke’s claim that since the main end of government is the preservation of the
      individual’s natural rights it cannot justify killing, enslaving, or plundering its citizens.

      The question asks for an evaluation of Locke’s contention that because the main end of government
      is the preservation of rights, then no government can be justified in killing, enslaving or plundering
      its citizens. Government is to protect and promote the public good by upholding the rights
      established by the natural law (which mirror the duties individuals have in relation to life, liberty,
      health and property). Accordingly, both negative and positive purposes are included within the
      goals of government. So, it is entitled to take such steps as constitute means to the goal of
      preserving (that is, protecting and promoting) human life and property. (Indeed, even in the state of
      nature, as conceived by Locke, any punishment meted out by an individual could only be justified
      as a means to the protection of human life and property.) The requirement to preserve human life
      and property may require making provision for increases in population, improving defensive
      capacities, strengthening infrastructure and the economy, etc. However, whatever rules are devised
      to govern the actions of citizens must be “conformable to the law of nature (ie, to the will of God)”
      (Ch. XI, para. 135). So, the killing, enslaving and plundering of citizens are prohibited and a
      government that does such things has no legitimacy. In addressing these philosophical issues
      candidates might explore:
      • Locke’s claims concerning the positive and negative obligations of governments
      • The right of citizens to revolt against governments that fail to fulfil their obligations
      • The means Locke envisaged governments employing for the preservation of life
      • The relationship Locke maintained must exist between those means and “the law of nature”
      • The obligations Locke thought this imposed on governments.

12.   Evaluate Locke’s claim that “Since [money] […] has its value only from the consent of men
      […] it is plain that men have agreed to disproportionate and unequal possession of the earth”.

      The question asks for an examination of the relationship between the introduction of money to
      facilitate commerce and any ensuing inequality. The introduction of money (which results in barter
      being set aside) is dictated by reason. It nullifies the non-spoilage (non-wastage) proviso placed on
      the acquisition of private property, allows for differing degrees of industry, promotes the production
      of surplus goods and services, and facilitates their exchange and distribution on a wider scale than
      was previously possible. All of these advantages are consistent with the goal of the preservation of
      human life. Locke may seem (at Ch. V, para. 50) to endorse unequal appropriation of
      natural resources. Indeed, some, for example C B McPherson, have maintained that he did
      (although James Tully is widely agreed to have shown that Locke is, in fact, a persistent critic of
      self-interested motivation). Nonetheless, there are lines of argument against this position that
      candidates might examine. In particular, they might consider that Locke nowhere sets aside the
      proviso that those acquiring private property are to leave “enough and as good” for others. It
      remains a requirement even after the introduction of money and hence precludes unlimited
      appropriation. Moreover, the surpluses promoted by the introduction of money are said to be in the
      products of the land. So, there is no suggestion of a licence to appropriate vast tracts of land as
      such. Because land was to be productively utilized, and there was little by way of mechanical
      assistance for working it, the application of labour was required. Locke certainly allowed for
      wage-labour. However, he did not allow for the acquisition of land for the purpose of selling it off
      in smaller lots for profit, or for renting it out. Moreover, he was aware of the need to hold land back
      for future population growth. In addressing these philosophical issues candidates might explore:
      • The significance for a polity, according to Locke, of the introduction of monetary exchanges
      • Whether Locke’s account of money fits with his general account of labour and natural rights
      • The implications (if any) that the introduction of monetary exchanges has on the operation of
         “the Lockean provisos”
      • Whether Locke (unwittingly) gave support to the idea of unlimited appropriation of land
      • The implications for land ownership of Locke’s provisos in light of his awareness of the need to
         provide for future population growth
      • Whether Locke’s account of money fits with his general account of labour and natural rights.

John Stuart Mill: On Liberty

13.   Evaluate the claim that the principles outlined by Mill support the criminalization of acts
      motivated by hatred but not of hate speech.

      The question asks for an assessment of the claim that support can be found in On Liberty for
      making acts motivated by hatred illegal but not hate speech. Hate crimes are crimes motivated at
      least in part by hatred of people because of their ethnicity, or their religious beliefs, or their gender,
      or their sexual orientation. Hate speech consists of verbal or written attacks on people because of
      their ethnicity, or their religious beliefs, or their gender, or their sexual orientation. Some liberals
      consider that Mill would have rejected the idea of criminalizing hate speech because even when it is
      intended to wound, subordinate or silence those at whom it is aimed, it is not harmful to them. It is
      offensive behaviour but not harmful behaviour. In addressing these philosophical issues candidates
      might explore:
      • The distinction between hate crimes and hate speech; whether such a distinction is maintainable
         and whether it should be maintained
      • The extent to which freedom of speech should legally be protected; whether hate speech falls
         foul of Mill’s Harm Principle
      • Whether Mill is right to think that offensive behaviour is not a matter for the criminal law
      • Ways in which the issue has contemporary significance, eg, in relation to the use of
         social media.

14.   Evaluate whether Mill is consistent in opposing people voluntarily selling themselves into
      slavery while at the same time approving people voluntarily entering into arrangements that
      significantly restrict their freedom (for example, certain types of employment contract,
      certain lifestyle choices).

      The question asks for an evaluation of the consistency of Mill’s views about the legitimacy of
      paternalistic restrictions on various freely chosen options. Mill relies on a “negative” conception of
      freedom, that is, he conceives of freedom as not being interfered with by others. This conception of
      freedom has been heavily criticized. In particular, there have been criticisms concerned with how
      the idea of “non-interference” should be understood. Criticisms of the consistency of Mill’s views
      have been directed at whether being enslaved necessarily involves greater interference with one’s
      freedom than not being enslaved (eg, being enslaved by a kind slave-master when faced with a
      particularly dismal alternative like severe poverty, or homelessness, or joblessness, etc). As well,
      criticisms have been offered concerning the extent to which entering into certain types of
      employment contract can be considered to impact upon an individual’s freedom by imposing
      significant restrictions (eg, in relation to diet, recreational activities, place of domicile, etc) in a
      manner parallel to that involved in certain forms of slavery. In addressing these philosophical
      issues candidates might explore:
      • Mill’s idea of freedom; “negative” freedom versus “positive” freedom
      • How the key element in the negative conception of freedom, namely, non-interference, should
          be understood
      • The grounds for Mill’s opposition to voluntary enslavement; his anti-paternalist views
      • The accuracy of putative parallels between slavery and, for example, some employment
          contracts
      • Lifestyle choices that predictably lead to addiction.

Friedrich Nietzsche: The Genealogy of Morals

15.   Evaluate Nietzsche’s claim that genealogy is concerned with “a real history of morality” and
      not with mere “hypothesis-mongering”.

      This question asks for a consideration of Nietzsche’s genealogical method and its application to a
      possible history of morality. Genealogy can be seen as a new historic-philosophical method which
      provides a concrete critique of morality. Since genealogy claims to be a naturalistic history of
      morality, it proceeds without appeal to any supernatural or metaphysical factors. It examines,
      without prejudice, factors that accompany all beginnings. Genealogy is “a real history of morality”
      focusing on what can be documented, confirmed and has actually existed as opposed to any form of
      “hypothesis-mongering” about arbitrary interpretations of the origins of morality. Genealogy as a
      critical method demonstrates that the present value, meaning or purpose of an object (morality)
      allows no inference about the object’s origin. It shows that morality had multiple purposes and
      meanings appropriated by different peoples and epochs, and that the present purpose or meaning is
      simply the latest functional meaning imposed upon the object under investigation.
      Finally, genealogy identifies the stable central element of morality as the practice of evaluating
      oneself and others. Thus, master and slave morality equally demonstrate that morality is not
      concerned with things but with human beings (both as actor and as acted upon). In this way,
      moralities are able to differ in origin, value, purpose and successful application while maintaining
      an identity of function. In addressing these philosophical issues candidates might explore:
      • Whether through three essays telling three different stories Nietzsche is suggesting one
         genealogy of one morality (the Judeo-Christian morality) or three genealogies of three different
         moralities (master-slave moralities in Essay 1, the morality of the debtor and creditor
         relationship in Essay 2 and the morality of the ascetic ideal in Essay 3)
      • Whether genealogy is successful in preventing mistaken inferences from the present purpose of
         morality to any conclusions about its history or origin. Why or why not?
      • The view that genealogy avoids the genetic fallacy of claiming that the origin of something
         demonstrates its value
      • The extent to which it is actually possible to develop a method which provides for an analysis of
         the value of a value system
      • Whether any history of morality, or of the origins of morality, only posits the development of a
         hypothetical situation for which there may be no hard evidence
      • Whether Nietzsche is correct in arguing that we are unable to understand morality unless we
         understand the historical situation in which that morality takes shape
      • Whether a genealogy of morality is meant to undermine the obvious connotations we associate
         with moral values and to demonstrate that traditional morality itself is just “a special case”
      • Genealogy as positive valorization versus genealogy as critical practice
      • Whether Nietzsche’s use of genealogy is more a sociological than a philosophical methodology.

16.   Explain and discuss Nietzsche’s view that understanding slave morality as the creation of a
      particular type of people at a particular historical moment and for particular reasons “has
      been lost sight of because this morality [slave morality] was victorious”.

      This question asks for a discussion of Nietzsche’s view that we are unable to identify and
      understand the origin, development and dissemination of the slave morality due to the victory of
      this morality over all alternative moral systems. Given the naturalistic, historical and psychological
      factors accounting for its victory, the emergence of slave morality is specific to the conditions of
      existence characteristic of a precise historical era. The dynamic interplay of such factors is the
      catalyst for the creation of new moral codes or the revaluation of competing codes.
      The development of slave morality is accounted for by the psychology of types of people
      (nobles/masters and slaves). Slave morality was the self-interested creation of a type of people who
      were reacting against their social and economic circumstances in the only way available: the
      creation of values that inverted those of the perceived oppressors. Driving this process of
      valuation-devaluation-revaluation was the psychological state of ressentiment. We have lost sight
      of the creation and spread of slave morality because: a) slave morality has two thousand years of
      history behind it, b) slave morality has been successfully embedded into the core of all modern
      civilizations, c) the misleading and misguided historical interpretations of English psychologists
      who commit the genetic fallacy in their analysis of morality, and d) the absence of precise
      intellectual tools for the critical analysis of morality, notably philological tools for the analysis of
      the “archeological evidence” of the word pairs “good and bad” and “good and evil”. In addressing
      these philosophical issues candidates might explore:
      • Whether Nietzsche is correct that our blindness to the victory of the slave morality accounts for
         the view that slave morality is the only valid morality
      • Whether the supposed blindness to the victory of slave morality means that values require a
         stance which is fundamentally anti-nature
      • Whether it is possible to remain blind to factors which account for the development of an
         important moral system. Is the claim that Judeo-Christian morality is itself the outgrowth of an
         earlier, triumphant and magnanimous lifestyle defensible?
      • Whether the values of slave morality are omnipresent in political systems, scientific
         understanding, literature, arts and above all in religious beliefs, as Nietzsche claims
      • Whether Nietzsche offers a credible explanation of how the victory of slave morality
         was possible
      • Whether the victory of slave morality would demonstrate its superiority over competing moral
         codes.

Bertrand Russell: The Problems of Philosophy

17.   Evaluate the claim that an essential characteristic of philosophical knowledge is criticism.

      This question invites an evaluation as to whether philosophical knowledge necessarily demands the
      activity of criticism. Criticism, which is not necessarily negative, is the use of reason, with the
      main purpose of reducing error.            Philosophical activity seeks to find inconsistencies.
      The application of absolute skepticism can be destructive, whereas with a Cartesian methodology
      skepticism becomes acceptable. Philosophical knowledge analyses the basic principles of science
      and those of daily life, and therefore belief and assumptions can and should be reflected upon and
      might be rejected. By practising criticism philosophy attacks dogmas so that knowledge might be
      clarified. By realizing there is no absolute certainty, philosophy shows unsuspected possibilities
      about matters of fact. Challenges to this essentially analytical approach to philosophy could come
      from the idea that the objective of philosophical knowledge is to provide answers to fundamental
      questions. In addressing these philosophical issues candidates might explore:
      • Whether absolute skepticism should be rejected as a non-productive activity
      • Whether criticism is the only function of philosophy. Should philosophy not also concern itself
         with wisdom or the discovery of new knowledge?
      • Whether philosophical knowledge should be concerned with making a radical difference to
         people’s lives
      • Whether philosophy gives an escape from narrow thinking and the practical activities which
         make up daily life.

18.   Explain and discuss the nature of universals and their relationship to knowledge.

      This question invites an explanation and discussion of the nature of universals and their relationship
      to knowledge. Universals are the supposed referents of general terms (eg, red, tree) understood as
      entities distinct from any of the particular things described by those terms. This definition of
      universals might be seen as something similar to Plato’s Ideas or Forms. As a result of universals
      we might have a priori knowledge within mathematics, logic and ethics. Our understanding of
      universals is necessary for us to have knowledge of truths. When in the form of adjectives it might
      not be necessary to define the quality of a universal as they help with understanding relationships.
      Universals allow us to take knowledge from the general and apply it to particular instances and
      make links to intuitive knowledge. In addressing these philosophical issues candidates
      might explore:
      • Whether Russell is simply confirming Plato’s metaphysical world in his acceptance and
         discussion of the nature of universals
      • Whether it is possible when dealing with universals that we are dealing with a set of particulars
         each of which is singular, suggesting universals do not have a universal property in themselves
      • Whether the world is only indirectly accessible through sense-data, and what role universals play
         in clarifying our perception of the world
      • How far universals are essential in conveying our understanding of our world.

Hannah Arendt: The Human Condition

19.   Evaluate the claim that the necessary element of plurality in action makes it “the condition of
      all political life”.

      This question invites an exploration of Arendt’s theory of action, in which she proposes there is a
      hierarchy of components, “in so far as it (human life) is actively engaged in doing something”,
      namely the vita activa. In the vita activa “action” is placed at the top, and action is “the only
      activity that goes on between men without the intermediary of things or matter”. The element of
      action that gives it its political context is its plurality. Action’s plurality incorporates human speech
      and Arendt’s contention is that in modern life the hierarchy of human action has been challenged by
      a rise in the significance of labour which has entailed a decline in political life. Action involves
      overcoming isolation, for action can only occur among a plurality of agents bringing a plurality of
      perspectives. Life without speech and action loses what is human about it, so speech is essential for
      human interaction and entails a plurality of perspectives from different speakers and agents.
      The significance of action arises from others being present to see it take place; without plurality
      action would be meaningless. To live in the condition of plurality is to live as a distinct being
      among equals, since others must sufficiently understand us while knowing we are unique.
      In addressing these philosophical issues candidates might explore:
      • The claim that without equality humans would not be able to understand each other; is this
         credible? See eras of inequality, eg, apartheid-era South Africa – is it impossible to understand
         others when inequality is imposed?
      • The importance of disclosure to plurality, where speech most significantly discloses meaning and
         human identity
      • Whether speech entails action both by being an act in itself, but also in the means by which the
         speaker’s sincerity is checked
      • How Arendt reflects an Aristotelian concern about public life and uses the term bios politikos for
         a life devoted to matters of the polis; see Arendt’s conception of the space in which
         communication and disclosure occurs
      • The importance of freedom alongside plurality as the vital characteristics of action.

20.   Explain and discuss what Arendt means by “loss of the world” in her critique of modernity.

      This question invites a discussion of Arendt’s stark depiction of modernity. Writing after the
      second world war, Arendt uses the phrase “loss of the world” to depict modernity. Loss of the
      world refers mainly to how the public aspects of human life have been restricted while in its place
      the pursuit of private needs and wants has emerged on a big scale. For Arendt, modernity is the
      new era of mass society where there is a toppling of the proper hierarchy of human activity, where
      labour replaces action as the dominant human experience. This involves the victory of the animal
      laborans over the homo faber, in that the world created by homo faber is threatened by the “rise of
      the social”. Material concerns have forced society to abandon the pursuit of higher ends performed
      in a public space, a space now being eroded. This modern trend away from the public sphere has an
      individualistic economic aspect alongside Arendt’s criticism of the rise of introspection.
      Responses might look at the (increasingly eroded) distinction between the public and private sphere
      where conformity has replaced plurality, and isolation is preferred to forms of public life. In
      addressing these philosophical issues candidates might explore:
      • Challenges to the public/private distinction, eg, feminism, political activity motivated by
         religious faith
      • World alienation, the “rise of the social” and its relation to work
      • There is little sense of enduring values or a chance of historical continuity, for in industrial
         modernity “all the values characteristic of the world of fabrication – permanence, stability,
         durability […] are sacrificed in favour of the values of life, productivity and abundance”; work
         and permanence
      • Modernity’s emphasis on battling to survive in the present rather than preserve things for
         the future
      • Modern science and artificiality
      • Arendt’s account of economics and consumerism.

Simone de Beauvoir: The Ethics of Ambiguity

21.   Evaluate the claim that the human condition is ambiguous.

      This question seeks an explanation and discussion of the problems and anxieties that humans face
      because of their nature. Human anxiety stems from them knowing that they are objects and
      struggling for a sense of being. This struggle for a sense of being and existence comes about by not
      being free. Freedom is seen as allowing others to make choices and take responsibility for their
      choices. If we deny their freedom we deny both their ability to make a choice and to face
      responsibility. It is realized that our individual freedom is linked to the freedom of others, but if we
      manipulate the freedom of others we lose our own freedom. We do not eagerly grasp freedom
      because of the associated responsibility. We must think of the freedom of others for us to fulfil our
      own freedom and face the responsibility for our actions. Our sense of being comes through a social
      reality which we can only achieve through subjectivity. The ambiguity of both seeking and yet
      rejecting the consequences of freedom results in anxious individuals; individuals who are fearful of
      themselves and others. This fear might be seen as counter-productive and restrictive of any actions
      by the individual. As a result of this fear the individual might become indecisive. However, by
      facing responsibility, confidence and the development of a greater sense of being might appear. In
      addressing these philosophical issues candidates might explore:
      • Whether humans might not wish to take responsibility and therefore will not achieve their own
         freedom, which is needed to allow the freedom of others
      • Whether there might be a contradiction between working with others—increasing collective
         freedom and developing an ethics of caring—and the selfish nature of humans
      • Whether there are objective criteria that might guide actions of freedom; the criteria might be
         based on caring for others
      • Whether a better tomorrow might be brought about by the increase of freedom linked
         to responsibility
      • Whether humans are inherently fearful and anxious about freedom because of the
         associated accountability.

22.   Explain and discuss the extent to which de Beauvoir justifies an “ethic of violence”.

      This question seeks an explanation and discussion of de Beauvoir’s justifications for an ethics
      of violence. The central argument focuses on the idea that violence could be used to oppose those
      who wish to restrict the freedom of the individual and the freedom of the collective.
      Justifiable violence is that which opposes and challenges those who wish to oppress. The objective
      of a bigger cause can justify violence. Violence can be used to re-establish individual rights and
      restore dignity. The contradiction is that violence might not be like surgery, it might simply be the
      easiest solution rather than the best. An ethics of caring might inevitably entertain the use of
      violence to protect the Other. However, the essential proposal put forward is that of creating and
      increasing freedom. Violence then is justified within a longer scenario. A “greater good”, of
      increasing the freedom of the Other, overrides arguments of pacifism. Yet the implicit
      contradiction of violence and ethics might be raised. In addressing these philosophical issues
      candidates might explore:
      • How violence can be justified in any ethical system, if it is a crime
      • Examples of the justifiable use of violence, like the prevention of genocide, the protection of the
         rights of a minority, stopping rape, self defence, etc
      • Whether violence within an ethical system justifies crimes enacted by the state, even
         state terrorism
      • Whether violence can ever be authorized
      • Whether the freedom of the individual to make choices by definition allows the choice of
         violence, or whether there are some universal or absolute criteria that should prevent the choice
         of violence.

Charles Taylor: The Ethics of Authenticity

23.   “The ethics of authenticity holds the ethical imperative to be true to one’s own self. Each
      person is seen as having his or her own mode of being human and is encouraged to realize this
      rather than conform to a pre-existing model or a pattern imposed from outside.” Discuss and
      evaluate.

      The question takes a central dimension of Taylor’s argument—authenticity as an ethical ideal—and
      asks for discussion and evaluation of it. Responses might explore three basic premises:
      a) authenticity is truly an ideal worth espousing; b) it is possible to establish by reason what it
      involves; c) this kind of argument can make a difference in practice. Authentic life is an ethical
      goal peculiar to modern culture, stemming from individualism. Some sources of individualism are
      the affirmation of the primacy of the person as self-responsible to find the truth (Descartes); a
      “voice within” or “the intimate contact with oneself” (Romanticism); also Rousseau and Kant.
      Horizons are the background of intelligibility against which things take on importance; authenticity
      implies maintaining the horizons which define us significantly. The development and realization of
      the self requires both individuality and community. Authenticity is fundamentally dialogical.
      The fragmentation of political life endangers the realization of the self. A fragmented society is one
      whose members find it harder and harder to identify their political society with a community.
      In addressing these philosophical issues candidates might explore:
      • The malaises of modern culture which threaten authenticity: individualism, disenchantment with
         the world, instrumental reason and soft despotism
      • Whether the transformation of authenticity into an ethical ideal might mean emptying the
         specific contents or values of moral life
      • Whether the search for authentic self-fulfillment can become incoherent and self-defeating when
         it is tied to atomistic individualism
      • The success of Taylor’s criticism of those who maintain that the collapse of external points of
         self-reference must necessarily lead to a false search for authenticity
      • Whether authenticity requires rational dialogue and cannot be achieved by taking a “knocker” or
         “booster” approach.

24.   Explain and discuss the idea of soft despotism as a way of losing freedom.

      The question asks for an explanation and discussion of the notion of soft despotism, which Taylor
      develops starting from de Tocqueville’s expression. Soft despotism refers to a type of society in
      which people end up as the kind of individuals who are “enclosed in their own hearts” and where
      few want to participate actively in self-government. They will prefer to stay at home and enjoy the
      satisfactions of private life, as long as the government of the day produces the means to these
      satisfactions and distributes them widely. There is no tyranny of terror and oppression, with a
      government keeping democratic forms and ruling mildly and paternalistically. But, in fact,
      everything will be run by an “immense tutelary power” over which people will have little control.
      The defence against this is a vigorous political culture in which participation is valued, at several
      levels of government and in voluntary associations. In addressing these philosophical issues
      candidates might explore:
      • The extent to which soft despotism refers to societies ordered by market relations. Is it possible
         to combine the action and results of the market with the possibility of a vigorous political culture
         with strong participation?
      • Whether present societies are in danger of losing political control over their destiny, something
         individuals could exercise in common as citizens; this is what de Tocqueville called “political
         liberty”. What is threatened here is the dignity of citizens
      • Impersonal mechanisms which might reduce the degrees of freedom as a society, although the
         loss of political liberty would mean that even the choices left would no longer be made by people
         as citizens, but by irresponsible tutelary power
      • The modern malaises related to soft despotism: a loss of meaning, the fading of moral horizons
         and the eclipse of ends, in the face of rampant instrumental reason
      • Whether effective political action might require focus in smaller arenas, eg, local community
      • Taylor’s controversial picture of contemporary political life, eg, of social discontent
         and defiance.
