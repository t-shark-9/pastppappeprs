Subject Details:              Design Technology HL Paper 3 Markscheme
Mark Allocation

Candidates are required to answer questions from ONE of the Options [1 × 40 marks].
Maximum total = [40 marks]


1.    A markscheme often has more marking points than the total allows. This is intentional.

2.    Each marking point has a separate line and the end is shown by means of a semicolon (;).

3.    An alternative answer or wording is indicated in the markscheme by a slash (/). Either wording can
      be accepted.

4.    Words in brackets ( ) in the markscheme are not necessary to gain the mark.

5.    Words that are underlined are essential for the mark.

6.    The order of marking points does not have to be as in the markscheme, unless stated otherwise.

7.    If the candidate’s answer has the same “meaning” or can be clearly interpreted as being of
      equivalent significance, detail and validity as that in the markscheme then award the mark.
      Where this point is considered to be particularly relevant in a question it is emphasized by
      OWTTE (or words to that effect).

8.    Remember that many candidates are writing in a second language. Effective communication is
      more important than grammatical accuracy.

9.    Occasionally, a part of a question may require an answer that is required for subsequent
      marking points. If an error is made in the first marking point then it should be penalized. However, if
      the incorrect answer is used correctly in subsequent marking points then follow through marks
      should be awarded. When marking indicate this by adding ECF (error carried forward) on the script.

10.   Do not penalize candidates for errors in units or significant figures, unless it is specifically referred
      to in the markscheme.

           this may mean cheaper food for consumers;                                             [2 max]


6.   (a)   Award [1] for each of three distinct correct points in an explanation of one way in
           which food contamination can be minimized in a self-service restaurant [3 max].
           good personal hygiene involves washing of hands before handling food especially
           after using the toilet or handling rubbish, tying back long hair, etc;
           it ensures that food poisoning bacteria are not introduced into foods;
           if there are no food poisoning bacteria in food then it cannot cause food
           poisoning;

           the food should be protected whilst on display;
           serving implemented, tongs, etc., need to be provided
           to ensure that customers cannot sneeze/cough onto food/ handle it before
           purchase;                                                                                       [3]

            which the design of electronic products has contributed to the increased pace of
            innovation [3 max].
            most electronic products are designed for planned obsolescence;
            they are not easy to repair;
            manufacturers need to provide new generations of products with additional
            functionality;

            a manufacturer may rush to be first to market for a product;
            a manufacturer will develop versions/generations of products;
            the product will then be updated at intervals to stimulate the market and maintain
            sales;

            manufacturers often develop based on modular design;
            this has enabled them to develop families of products;
            this can be achieved very quickly so increasing the pace of innovation;

            new technologies are continuously becoming available;
            they provide opportunities for product innovation;
            as the new technology is incorporated into new versions of the product;               [3 max]

      customization;
      individual settings as all users are different;
      the amplification required by different users at different wavelengths is different as
      shown by their audiograms;

      miniaturization/digital processing power evolves exponentially;
      hearing aids can get smaller meaning the hearing aid can be closer to the ear drum;
      so requires less battery power thus enhancing battery life;

      environmental considerations;
      filtration of extraneous noise;
      differentiation of speech and other environmental noises in real time;

      reprogrammability;
      programmable software for individual needs;
      better programming means better sound processing in multiple sound environments –
      from a quiet library to a noisy restaurant;
                                                                                               [9 max]

      introducing CNC machines on the fixed and variable costs of a multinational company
      [3 max] per impact, [6 max] in total.
      Fixed costs:
      the company will have to make a capital investment in CNC machines;
      so fixed costs will rise;
      the company will have to consider its return on investment/breakeven;

      Variable costs:
      labour costs should reduce;
      following an initial period of redundancy and retraining;
      fewer but probably better paid/more technical jobs;

      material costs should reduce;
      increased accuracy;
      fewer errors;                                                                                 [6 max]

      textile products contributes to a global marketing strategy [3 max] per way, [9 max]
      total.
      brand loyalty;
      consumers often develop allegiance with a particular brand;
      they will buy that brand in preference to another brand;

      brand recognition/awareness;
      branding a product makes it easier to promote with potential consumers;
      this makes it easier to launch new products;

      co-creations of brands;
      consumer websites/Facebook/Twitter allow consumers to have their say and to
      contribute to the development of a brand;
      global brands have to develop mechanisms to support consumer involvement;

      a brand may not fit the culture of a particular country context;
      a brand may need to be adapted to meet particular requirements – glocalized;
      this poses challenges for global brands since digital technologies are not limited by
      country borders;                                                                        [9 max]

      (b)   Award [1] for one reason why technophiles would experience psycho-pleasure
            when using a newly-purchased mobile phone and [1] for a brief explanation
            [2 max].
            technophiles welcome technological change and the challenges that go with it;
            they would derive great pleasure from working out how the phone operated in
            order to maximize its use/utilize all the available features/use it before it becomes
            commonplace;                                                                                [2]

      Do not award a mark if the candidate refers solely to fashion as technolphiles are
      pioneers rather than followers of fashion

      date when the measurements were taken;
      dimensions of the user population may have changed since that date;
      due to diet/nutrition;

      difficult to measure people/reliability of the measuring;
      a tolerance is included to allow for a small amount of error;
      measuring instruments may not have been very accurate;

      dimensions are stated in whole numbers;
      actual measurements taken may have included decimal figures;

            which cultural differences can impact on a person’s attitude to personal space
            when using an airport lounge [3 max].
            country of origin;
            people from some countries welcome the opportunity to talk to strangers so enjoy
            a more intimate arrangement of seating;

35.   Award [1] for each of three distinct points in a discussion of human factor
      considerations in the design of a car seat belt for a volume-produced car in relation to
      anthropometrics, psychological and physiological factors [3 max] per factor, [9 max]
      total.
      Anthropometrics:
      data required for relevant aspects of body size (eg dimensions of the
      abdomen/chest/height);
      dimensions to relate to all the user population;
      range of adjustability within 5th–95th percentile;

      Psychological:
      users must feel safe/reassured by the ’click’ with the seatbelt on;
      the driver must also be satisfied about the safety of passengers;
      and complying with legislation;

      Physiological:
      Comfort/feel of the material is important to users;
      the range of adjustability of the belt must provide comfort for all users;
      the tension of the belt must provide safety but also ease-of-use by a wide range of users;   [9]
