Extended response questions - quality of construction

        Extended response questions for SL P2 carry a mark total of [20]. Of these marks, [18] are
         awarded for content and [2] for the quality of construction of the answer.

      Two aspects are considered:
        expression of relevant ideas with clarity
        structure of the answers.

      [1] quality mark is to be awarded when the candidate satisfies EACH of the following criteria.
       Thus [2] quality marks are awarded when a candidate satisfies BOTH criteria.

     Clarity of expression:
        The candidate has made a serious and full attempt to answer all parts of the question and the
        answers are expressed clearly enough to be understood with little or no re-reading.

     Structure of answer:
        The candidate has linked relevant ideas to form a logical sequence within at least two parts
        of the same question (eg within part a and within part b, or within part a and within part c
        etc. but not between part a and part b or between part a and part c etc.).

                                              SECTION A

1.   (a)   with trout: 4 (allow a range of 3.5 to 4.0)
           without trout: 700 (allow a range of 690 to 710)                                           [1]
           Both needed for [1].

     (b)   more tadpoles/frogs without trout / vice versa;
           trout decrease tadpole numbers more than frog numbers / vice versa;                        [2]
           Numbers alone, without comparative words (more, greater, less, etc), are
           insufficient for the mark.

     (c)   tadpoles/frogs are eaten by trout;
           trout could catch/eat more tadpoles than frogs (as frogs not fully aquatic);
           trout could introduce diseases/change breeding sites that affect frogs and tadpoles;   [1 max]

     (d)   Upper LeConte Lake: 210 (tadpoles 10 m–1 shoreline) (allow a range of 200
           to 220)
           Lower LeConte: 6.4 (allow a range of 6.1 to 6.8)                                           [1]
           Both needed for [1].

     (e)   disease;
           other predator;
           Upper LeConte Lake has a supply stream with tadpoles and frogs while Lower
           LeConte Lake does not;
           trout could have been reintroduced to either/both lakes from neighbouring streams;
           food (biotic)/temperature (abiotic) differences between the two lakes;
           other reasonable answer;                                                               [1 max]
           Do not accept frog density as stand alone answer.

     (f)   an increase in population/density in both lakes;
           in Upper LeConte Lake (rapid) increase and then decrease (in 2004) whereas in
           Lower LeConte Lake only increases/never decreases;
           removal of trout causes an exponential increase in frogs;
           small difference in populations 1 year after removal / lag in population increases;
           increased density of frogs only 3 years after removal;
           greater frog increase in Upper LeConte Lake than Lower LeConte Lake / vice
           versa;                                                                                 [3 max]
           Numbers alone without comparative words (eg more, greater, less etc) are
           insufficient for the mark.

(g)   support/non-support of prediction based on observation from data;
      reason for support/non-support;

      eg
      (yes) a permanent recovery (since) in the first (three) years after removal, both
      show a similar trend/number of frogs increased;
      because tadpoles/frogs had no trout predators / other valid reason;
      OR
      no permanent recovery since in Upper LeConte Lake numbers are decreasing after
      2004;
      because tadpoles/frogs can migrate from Upper to Lower LeConte as there are no
      barriers / reinvasion of trout from streams / other valid reason;
      OR
      no prediction possible since data missing/contradictory;
      example of missing/contradictory data; (eg changes in pH of water/climate/depth
      of water/availability of food/predators/disease / frog increase in one lake but frog
      and tadpole decrease in other lake)                                                    [2 max]

           pattern of bands/fragments/lengths (of DNA) is produced (in a gel);
           analysed for matches between child with mother and possible father;
           (half) the child’s bands will match the father (while the other half will match the
           mother);                                                                              [4 max]
