General Marking Instructions

1.   Follow the markscheme provided, award only whole marks and mark only in RED.

2.   Make sure that the question you are about to mark is highlighted in the mark panel on the right-hand
     side of the screen.

3.   Where a mark is awarded, a tick/check () must be placed in the text at the precise point where it
     becomes clear that the candidate deserves the mark. One tick to be shown for each mark awarded.

4.   Sometimes, careful consideration is required to decide whether or not to award a mark. In these
     cases use Scoris™ annotations to support your decision. You are encouraged to write comments
     where it helps clarity, especially for re-marking purposes. Use a text box for these additional
     comments. It should be remembered that the script may be returned to the candidate.

5.   Personal codes/notations are unacceptable.

6.   Where an answer to a part question is worth no marks but the candidate has attempted the part
     question, enter a zero in the mark panel on the right-hand side of the screen. Where an answer to a
     part question is worth no marks because the candidate has not attempted the part question, enter an
     “NR” in the mark panel on the right-hand side of the screen.

7.   Ensure that you have viewed every page including any additional sheets. Please ensure that you
     stamp ‘SEEN’ on any page that contains no other annotation.

8.   A mark should not be awarded where there is contradiction within an answer. Make a comment to
     this effect using a text box or the “CON” stamp.

Subject Details:             Computer Science HL Paper 1 Markscheme
Mark Allocation

Section A: Candidates are required to answer all questions. Total 25 marks.
Section B: Candidates are required to answer all questions. Total 75 marks.
           Maximum total = 100 marks.

General

A markscheme often has more specific points worthy of a mark than the total allows. This is intentional.
Do not award more than the maximum marks allowed for that part of a question.

When deciding upon alternative answers by candidates to those given in the markscheme, consider the
following points:

          Each statement worth one point has a separate line and the end is signified by means of
           a semi-colon (;).

          An alternative answer or wording is indicated in the markscheme by a “/”; either wording can
           be accepted.

          Words in ( … ) in the markscheme are not necessary to gain the mark.

          If the candidate’s answer has the same meaning or can be clearly interpreted as being the
           same as that in the markscheme then award the mark.

          Mark positively. Give candidates credit for what they have achieved and for what they have
           got correct, rather than penalizing them for what they have not achieved or what they have
           got wrong.

          Remember that many candidates are writing in a second language; be forgiving of
           minor linguistic slips. In this subject effective communication is more important than
           grammatical accuracy.

          Occasionally, a part of a question may require a calculation whose answer is required for
           subsequent parts. If an error is made in the first part then it should be penalized. However, if
           the incorrect answer is used correctly in subsequent parts then follow through marks should
           be awarded. Indicate this with “FT”.


General guidance

 Issue          Guidance
 Answering      • In the case of an “identify” question read all answers and mark positively up to the
 more than        maximum marks. Disregard incorrect answers.
 the quantity   • In the case of a “describe” question, which asks for a certain number of facts
 of responses     eg “describe two kinds”, mark the first two correct answers. This could include two
 prescribed       descriptions, one description and one identification, or two identifications.
 in the         • In the case of an “explain” question, which asks for a specified number of
 questions        explanations eg “explain two reasons …”, mark the first two correct answers.
                  This could include two full explanations, one explanation, one partial explanation etc.

                                               SECTION A                                  Total: [25 marks]

1.   Award up to [2 marks max].
     Roles/activities of the users (eg permissions, security, partitions, collaborative work);
     Resources (HW and SW equipment) appropriate for the organization;
     Costs/budget limits;
     Delivery time;
     Compatibility with the old system (data);

     (Other acceptable answers are possible, from the economic, operational and technical
     perspective.)                                                                        [2 marks]


2.   Award up to [2 marks max].
     Testing prior to product’s full release / last stage of testing;
     To see if it works properly / complete functionality / usability;
     Performed by end users (not by designers);                                                  [2 marks]


3.   Award up to [4 marks max].
     Award [1 mark] for the identification of an advantage and [1 mark] for explaining the
     advantage.
     Award [1 mark] for the identification of a disadvantage and [1 mark] for explaining the
     disadvantage.

     Example Advantages:
     Can highlight aspects that are not detected in questionnaires/interviews;
     So the observer can help produce more detailed reports;

     Observations may be more reliable than interviews;
     Because they can reveal what people actually do instead of what they say they do;

     Example disadvantages:
     Time consuming / expense;
     The observer might need to observe a complete cycle etc which could last a significant
     amount of time;

     If the observations are made by only one person, they may be biased;

     Observations may be unreliable;
     Because people act differently when they know they are being watched.

     (Accept formulations that express similar or plausible ideas.)                              [4 marks]

     (If not correct place) move through list using pointers until correct alphabetical position
     is found;

Question 14 continued

     (c)   Award up to [6 marks max] as follows:
           [1 mark] for the idea that there needs to be a loop that executes once for each
           generation, with an additional [1 mark] if it is implemented correctly, for
           [2 marks max].
           [1 mark] for the idea that the endpoints returned while drawing one generation
           must be stored for use in drawing the subsequent generation, with an additional
           [1 mark] if correctly implemented, for [2 marks max]. Note: Any valid storage
           mechanism is permissible ie it does not have to be a stack.

           [1 mark] for correctly drawing a generation of H’s.
           [1 mark] for correctly scaling the size for each generation.

           Example answer:
           ////////////////////
           SIZE = 20                             //do not award marks

           ENDPOINTS = drawH( CENTRE, SIZE )     // of the algorithm

Question 14 continued

      (e)   Award up to [3 marks max] for:
            identifying that the recursive algorithm proceeds downwards (showing on one
            parameter will suffice);
            base case of recursion;
            recursive call;

            counting down (not up);
            When the generation reached is 0 no drawing is done;
            Otherwise draws an H and calls recursively itself on the endpoints of a lower
