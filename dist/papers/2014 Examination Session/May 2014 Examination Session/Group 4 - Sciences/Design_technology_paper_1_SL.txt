Questions 27–30 relate to the following case study. Please read the case study carefully and answer
the questions.

Levi’s have developed a programme called Levi’s Curve ID. It offers “jeans built around shape,
not size” to help women find a pair of jeans that fits well.  Following research on over 65 000 women,
Jill Guenza, global head of women’s design at Levi’s, explained: “… 80 per cent of women around
the world fall into three distinct body shapes”. Levi’s Curve ID provides an online programme
asking three questions (Figure 11) to identify the fit required – slight curve, demi curve or bold curve.  
Customers can order jeans online either directly from Levi’s or indirectly from other online retailers from
a range of standard styles, colours, waist sizes and lengths.
