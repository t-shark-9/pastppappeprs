General Marking Instructions

1.    Follow the markscheme provided, award only whole marks and mark only in RED.

2.    Make sure that the question you are about to mark is highlighted in the mark panel on the right-
      hand side of the screen.

3.    Where a mark is awarded, a tick/check () must be placed in the text at the precise point where it
      becomes clear that the candidate deserves the mark. One tick to be shown for each mark
      awarded.

4.    Sometimes, careful consideration is required to decide whether or not to award a mark. In these
      cases use Scoris™ annotations to support your decision. You are encouraged to write comments
      where it helps clarity, especially for re-marking purposes. Use a text box for these additional
      comments. It should be remembered that the script may be returned to the candidate.

5.    Personal codes/notations are unacceptable.

6.    Where an answer to a part question is worth no marks but the candidate has attempted the part
      question, enter a zero in the mark panel on the right-hand side of the screen. Where an answer to a
      part question is worth no marks because the candidate has not attempted the part question, enter an
      “NR” in the mark panel on the right-hand side of the screen.

7.    Please ensure you check all scanned pages. The candidate may have answered more than one
      option. If the candidate has attempted Option B, please raise this script as an “exception” (page
      73, Scoris guide), choosing “Answer outside of guidance”. This will be escalated to your PE to
      mark. This only concerns Option B, and only because the candidate numbers are relatively low.

8.    If a candidate has attempted more than one Option within a paper mark all the candidate’s
      work. Scoris™ will only award the marks for the higher scoring Option. Once all the work the
      candidate has attempted has been marked, please click “COMPLETE”; all the other questions from
      the other Options will auto complete to “NR” for “no response”.

9.    Ensure that you have viewed every page including any additional sheets.     Please ensure that you
      stamp ‘SEEN’ on any page that contains no other annotation.

10.   A mark should not be awarded where there is contradiction within an answer.    Make a comment to
      this effect using a text box or the “CON” stamp.

Subject Details:             Computer Science HL Paper 2 Markscheme

Mark Allocation

Candidates are required to answer all questions in one Option.   Total 65 marks.

General

A markscheme often has more specific points worthy of a mark than the total allows.    This is intentional.
Do not award more than the maximum marks allowed for that part of a question.

When deciding upon alternative answers by candidates to those given in the markscheme, consider the
following points:

          Each statement worth one point has a separate line and the end is signified by means of
           a semi-colon (;).

          An alternative answer or wording is indicated in the markscheme by a “/”; either wording can
           be accepted.

          Words in ( … ) in the markscheme are not necessary to gain the mark.

          If the candidate’s answer has the same meaning or can be clearly interpreted as being the
           same as that in the markscheme then award the mark.

          Mark positively. Give candidates credit for what they have achieved and for what they have
           got correct, rather than penalizing them for what they have not achieved or what they have
           got wrong.

          Remember that many candidates are writing in a second language; be forgiving of
           minor linguistic slips. In this subject effective communication is more important than
           grammatical accuracy.

          Occasionally, a part of a question may require a calculation whose answer is required for
           subsequent parts. If an error is made in the first part then it should be penalized. However,
           if the incorrect answer is used correctly in subsequent parts then follow through marks
           should be awarded. Indicate this with “FT”.


General guidance

 Issue          Guidance
 Answering      • In the case of an “identify” question read all answers and mark positively up to the
 more than        maximum marks. Disregard incorrect answers.
 the quantity   • In the case of a “describe” question, which asks for a certain number of facts
 of responses     eg “describe two kinds”, mark the first two correct answers. This could include two
 prescribed       descriptions, one description and one identification, or two identifications.
 in the         • In the case of an “explain” question, which asks for a specified number of
 questions        explanations eg “explain two reasons …”, mark the first two correct answers.
                  This could include two full explanations, one explanation, one partial explanation etc.

           SQL, QBE etc.;

           Example 1:
           A view of all drugs for influenza could be created;
           From a menu bar with a drop down list of options leading to choices of diseases;
           Selecting “flu” would give list of all available drugs;

           Example 2:
           Select “query” from list of options;
           Type set of parameters prompted by field names;

     (c)   Award [1 mark] for a feature and [1 mark] for its importance, up to
           [6 marks max]. (Maximum of [1 mark] for mention of normalization – not
           modelling.)
           Examples:
           Data must be modelled knowing the purpose.
           • Otherwise the data will not do what is required.
           Identify the entities/tables.
           • If incorrect they will not support the purpose of the DB.
           The attributes of the tables should be necessary and sufficient for purpose.
           • Otherwise may get inefficiencies.
           The keys for accessing the tables need to be identified.

           Design purpose;
           DB designed for recording records and perform transactions whereas DW is
           designed for large-scale reporting;

           Size of Data Stored;
           DW stores a much larger amount of information than a DB;

           Operations on Data;
           Information in DW must essentially be read whereas a DB (with transactions)
           supports update;

           Data Redundancy;
           DB are normalized to reduce redundant data and therefore space whereas DW
           may contain redundancy to reduce response time;

           Data Model;
           DW uses a multidimensional data model to support analysis, whereas a DB is
           essentially based on the ERD;

           Importance of age (date) of data;
           The DB will store the latest/current state, whereas the DW is time variant;       [4 marks]

             In a DW, data vary their value over time (data is time-variant);
             It is necessary to keep the history of data changes;
             To be valid, analysis needs to be made on current and historical data;
             Therefore analysis needs to be recomputed as data received;                    [3 marks]

      (ii)   Award up to [2 marks max].

      Use of cookies (or pixel tags in adverts) means having a permanent identifier on
      the computer (eg the refill-order option monitors our trends/habits);

      By cross-referencing data, they may offer the same product at different prices for
      different groups of persons (eg higher price for those showing the profile of a
      wealthy person or no service at all if there is evidence of being insolvent);

      E-commerce sites either must give out or do not care to protect enough some
      information to their third party partners;

      Third party may breach the privacy of the e-commerce site;
      E-commerce companies may be acquired and privacy policies may change/be
      revised, the acquirer may not be aware of the whole situation, especially with

     (c)   Award up to [6 marks max].
           Governments can see what effect the decisions they are taking now will have on
           the long term future and not just in the coming year;
           Hence they are warned and have time to take action in advance;
           The simulation rules can then be repeated, changed and the simulation run on the
           current set of data for the next few years until a satisfactory level is achieved;
           The disadvantages are that there is no guarantee that current trends will continue;
           Patterns could be misleading if an unusual event occurred in the time period;
           Both data and rules could change;
           Too much dependence could prevent human initiatives being introduced;               [6 marks]

           Given technical requirements it could be that some children would not have
           access to appropriate hardware such as dual processor/latest video card etc;

           Social
           Game much more exciting and attractive – children will be more willing to play –
           hence it could greatly help those who find maths difficult;
           Negative aspects include addiction or even fear of frightening characters for very
           young children which could have the effect of putting them off maths;

           There should be two technical elaborated points and two social elaborated points. [8 marks]

7.   (a)   The data must be collected at all hours and in key places;
           DO NOT accept questionnaires or surveys as they would not give the traffic
           situation.
           Methods of data collection on traffic patterns would need constant monitoring
           such as sensors at certain points on the roads;
           These would have to be placed at crossroads, roundabouts/traffic circles, traffic
           lights etc;
           And could be backed up by cameras;
           This will have to be done for a long period of time to cover weekdays, weekends,
           holiday periods, bad weather etc;                                                 [4 marks]

     (b)   A mathematical model of the roads can be made showing distances between
           points;
           Traffic lights, roundabouts etc and branches from these points;
           The traffic flow can be calculated as a time stream from the data collected on
           traffic patterns;
           This is then passed through the model of the roads showing the situation
           throughout a day/week/month;                                                   [4 marks]

     (c)   Award [1 mark] for identifying a suitable criterion and [1 mark] for outlining
           how it could be assessed, for two criteria, up to [4 marks].

           For example:
           Traffic flow;
           By seeing how traffic moves throughout the day when rules (such as traffic light
           timing etc) are changed;
           Time to cross the city at rush hour;
           Manipulate the rules to minimize the time taken for a vehicle to get from the
           suburbs to town and vice versa in the morning or evening;

           Improvements on previous situation;
           Key points will have emerged from the data collection;
           These will be the base for evaluating change if they improve or not;               [4 marks]

           Pollution;
           This criterion would need more measures included such as looking at specific
           zones and ensuring that there is not more traffic in some areas than others;

     (d)   New factors are difficult to measure as there is no history as to their effect;
           For example, the number of cyclists/people taking public transport could increase
           and reduce traffic with more cycle lanes/better transport but the amount is not
           measurable except by questionnaires which are not always reliable/are expensive;
           Hence the input into the model without extensive research could cause false
           results in the simulation;                                                        [3 marks]

8.   (a)   Award up to [6 marks max].
           Both languages have vocabulary;
           In human language one word can have more than one meaning;
           For example, foot could be human or measure;
           Which makes word for word translation difficult;

           Human language has syntax but this is not rigidly applied/there are too many
           exceptions;
           Computer language syntax is strict;
           Not flexible enough to apply to human language translation;

           Semantics is the biggest area that causes problems attempting to apply
           vocabulary from a dictionary and arranging according to syntax can give a very
           different meaning to that intended.                                            [6 marks]

     (b)   Three examples, each elaborated, for example:
           Translation – would help in international communication;
           Important new discoveries on the web instantly translated;

           Communication with the computer would aid the research for AI;

           Effective chat bots expert machines etc;
           Speech recognition to aid control – develop more efficient robots;
                                                                                          [6 marks]

      Various images of each letter in the input layer;
      Fitness function would consist of ASCII code for each given letter;
      Probabilities generated between the image and the ASCII code;
      Passed between nodes in the hidden layer;
      The best of these would be retained and used to generate another set;
      The process would be repeated until a satisfactory recognition set was achieved;
      Satisfactory depending on the correct letter for the ASCII code;
      Once the learning is completed any handwritten letter could be input and the
      ASCII equivalent output;
      With a probability of success stated;                                            [6 marks]

            Points to be considered include:
            Search engine designers
            • The algorithm used must result in an index for that page that reflects its
                importance to the search query;
            • This ranking must be based on some genuine analysis;

            • Any paid-for links must be clearly shown to be so;

            Website developers
            • Developers use search engine optimization (SEO);
            • They should only use white-hat techniques to legitimately improve their
               visibility to search engines/web crawlers;
            • eg Use of site diagrams / site promotion to increase back-links / careful
               choice of key-words;
            • They should not use black-hat techniques to mislead search-engines;

            A large number of users might volunteer computer time;

            Connection speed;
            How important this factor is as connection speeds for grid computing is
            considerably slower than internal connections in a supercomputer;

            Reliability/security;
            Is the data too sensitive to allow into the public domain / how trustworthy are the

            Award up to [2 marks max] for consequences of democratization being lost

            Points to be considered include:
            Democratic web means that any one web site can be accessed as easily as
            any other;
            Therefore there is no physical bias between multi-national companies and the
            individual seller;
            Or between retailers in developed or developing countries;
            A specific example (Amazon versus Joe Bloggs);

            Statements needed for consequences, for example:
            Could lead to a 2-tier internet where big companies can buy exposure;
            Starting on-line retailers may not get a fair change /treatment offering their
            products on-line;
            Certain ISP could become very powerful and operate as a monopoly;
            Larger countries may dominate;

            Text based queries try to match the text in the user query with the text in the
            picture tags;
            This can produce poor quality results because the quality of the tags depends upon

                Since all functionality of the parent class is inherited, it is not necessary to
                duplicate the code to reproduce that functionality in the new class;
                Simplifies testing;
                Functionality inherited from a parent class does not need to be
                re-tested in the new class;                                                      [4 marks]

15.   (a)   Encapsulation refers to the practice of hiding the structure and representation of
            data within a class and making it accessible outside that class via accessor
            functions;

            Accept “Refers to bundling the data and methods that operate on the data into
            one unit the methods and data can be accessed via dot notation or accessor
            methods.”                                                                             [1 mark]

      (b)   Award [1 mark] for identifying a benefit and [1 mark] for an elaboration, for two
            benefits, up to [4 marks max].
            Advantages:
                  Data hiding and security;
                  Ease of maintenance;
                  Ease of testing;
                  Speed of development;

            Accept other reasonable advantages.

            Example:
                Advantage: Ease of testing;
                By putting all the structure of the data in a single class, other classes which
                make use of that data can be easily tested by simply providing them with
                data values even before the “real” data class is available for testing;

                 Advantage: Ease of maintenance;
                 If there are changes to the data, or how it is stored or accessed internally,
                 only the one class needs to be changed to accommodate that. All the other
                 classes will continue to use the public accessor methods and will not need to
                 be changed;                                                                   [4 marks]

      (c)   Any accessor method in the Specimen class;
            Example: getName(), getCage(), getTOA() are accessor methods in the
            Specimen class.                                                                       [1 mark]

      (d)   Any instance variable in the Specimen class;
            Example: cageNumber, name and TOA are instance variables in the Specimen
            class.                                                                                [1 mark]

(e)   Award up to [3 marks max].
      Award [1 mark] for a constructor method requiring a single string as a
      parameter;
      Award [1 mark] for String getGenusName()and a set method for the genus
      name;
      Award [1 mark] for String toString()method that returns a valid string;

      Example:
      public class Genus
      {
          private String genusName;
          public Genus(String g)
          {
               setGenusName(g);
          }
          public void setGenusName( String g ) { genusName = g; }
          public String getGenusName() { return genusName; }
          public String toString()
          {
          return "Genus: " + genusName;
          }
      }                                                                                   [3 marks]

(f)   Accept any reasonable advantage and disadvantage. Award [1 mark] for
      identifying the (dis)advantage and [1 mark] for an elaboration, for one advantage
      and one disadvantage, up to [4 marks max].

      Example:
        Advantage: The Specimen objects would inherit all the attributes of the
        Species object;
        This would allow code in the Specimen object to access species-related
        methods directly rather than having to invoke them on a Species object using
        dot-notation;
        Disadvantage: Logically inconsistent, in that data in the Species class may not
        be consistent across the associated Specimens;
        Potential data duplication / waste of memory space;

      Example 2:
        Advantage: The Specimen object, as a subclass, will inherit all methods and
        instance variables applying to the Species object;
        This would take up less space and make access to all common methods
        between specimens easier;
        Disadvantage: Not all methods and variables are consistent between all
        specimens;
        This means that changes made to methods or variables in the Species class may
        not apply to all specimens;                                                   [4 marks]

16.   (a)   The markings are a characteristic of an individual animal;
            Therefore the description of markings should be an instance variable(s) within the
            Specimen class;
            There should be accessor (get/set) methods for the markings;
            The toString()method should include the description of the markings;
            If candidate creates a new class for the markings then award marks
            appropriately, [2 marks max], for the variables.                                   [4 marks]
.
      (b)   Award up to [8 marks max].
            Award [1 mark] for correct method declaration (accept void or int as method
            type);
            Award [1 mark] for initializing species count to zero;
            Award [1 mark] for correctly determining array length;
            Award [1 mark] for correctly looping through the array elements;
            Award [1 mark] for retrieving species object from each specimen;
            Award [1 mark] for comparing species object retrieved with species being
            counted using equals();
                   Note: To earn this mark, the student must either use the equals method of
                   the Species class or use the getSpeciesName() method to retrieve the name
                   as a string and then use the String class equals() method.
            Award [1 mark] for incrementing species count correctly;
            Award [1 mark] for outputting species count (accept “output” in lieu of
            System.out.println);

            Example:
            void countSpecimens( Specimen[] animals, Species s )
            {
                 int sCount = 0;
                 int i;
                 for (i=0; i< animals.length; i++)
                 {
                    if (s.equals(animals[i].getTOA())
                    OR
                    if(s.getSpeciesName().equals(animals[i].getTOA().getSpeciesName()))

                    sCount++;
                 }
                 System.out.println( sCount );
            }                                                                                  [8 marks]

(c)   Award up to [6 marks max].
      Award [1 mark] for initialisation of variables;
      Award [1 mark] for appropriate use of loops and selection
      Award [1 mark] for creating something to hold a list of unique species;
      Award [1 mark] for looping through the input array of Specimen objects;
      Award [1 mark] for searching the list of unique species for each animal’s species;
      Award [1 mark] for inserting the animal’s species into the list if it is not there
      already;
      Award [1 mark] for producing the list of unique species as output;

      Note: In this question the term “pseudocode” indicates that syntax is not being
      tested; the emphasis is on the algorithm.

      Example 1:
      //ANIMALS is an array containing Specimen objects
      //UNIQUE is a collection, initially empty
      //SPECIES is a Species object

      loop BEAST from 0 to the number of elements in ANIMALS
           NEW_SPECIES = true
           UNIQUE.resetNext()
           loop while UNIQUE.hasNext()
                if UNIQUE.getNext() = species of ANIMALS[BEAST] then
                    NEW_SPECIES = false
                end if
           end loop
           if NEW_SPECIES then
                UNIQUE.addItem( species of ANIMALS[BEAST] )
           end if
      end loop

      UNIQUE.resetNext()
      loop while UNIQUE.hasNext()
           SPECIES = UNIQUE.getNext()
           output SPECIES.toString()
      end loop

      Note: The output does not need to be generated in a second pass after finding all
      the unique species. An alternative would be to generate the output for each new
      unique species as it is found.

      An alternative approach would be to pass through the array, and test each object.
      Using a second array into which the unique species name is stored as these are
      found.                                                                            [6 marks]
