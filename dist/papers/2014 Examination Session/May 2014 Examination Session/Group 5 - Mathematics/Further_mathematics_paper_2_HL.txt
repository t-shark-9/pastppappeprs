Please start each question on a new page. Full marks are not necessarily awarded for a correct answer
with no working. Answers must be supported by working and/or explanations. In particular, solutions
found from a graphic display calculator should be supported by suitable working. For example, if graphs
are used to find a solution, you should sketch these as part of your answer. Where an answer is incorrect,
some marks may be given for a correct method, provided this is shown by written working. You are therefore
advised to show all working.

		          (i)    An upper bound for the problem can be found by doubling the weight of the
                   minimum spanning tree. Use this method to find an upper bound.

            C have to be visited first in that order, then D, E, F in any order before returning to A.

                   problem considered in (b).                                                            [5]
