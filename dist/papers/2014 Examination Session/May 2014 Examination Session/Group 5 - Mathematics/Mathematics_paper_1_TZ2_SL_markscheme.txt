                                       Instructions to Examiners

All examiners must read these instructions carefully, as there are some changes since M13.

Abbreviations

M     Marks awarded for attempting to use a correct Method; working must be seen.

(M) Marks awarded for Method; may be implied by correct subsequent working.

A     Marks awarded for an Answer or for Accuracy; often dependent on preceding M marks.

(A)   Marks awarded for an Answer or for Accuracy; may be implied by correct subsequent working.

R     Marks awarded for clear Reasoning.

N     Marks awarded for correct answers if no working shown.

AG Answer given in the question and so no marks are awarded.

Using the markscheme

1     General

      Mark according to scoris instructions and the document “Mathematics SL: Guidance for
      e-marking May 2014”. It is essential that you read this document before you start marking. In
      particular, please note the following. Marks must be recorded using the annotation stamps, using
      the new scoris tool. Please check that you are entering marks for the right question.

      • If a part is completely correct, (and gains all the “must be seen” marks), use the ticks with
        numbers to stamp full marks. Do not use the ticks with numbers for anything else.
      • If a part is completely wrong, stamp A0 by the final answer.
      • If a part gains anything else, all the working must have annotations stamped to show what
        marks are awarded. This includes any zero marks.

      All the marks will be added and recorded by scoris.

2   Method and Answer/Accuracy marks

    • Do not automatically award full marks for a correct answer; all working must be checked, and
      marks awarded according to the markscheme.
    • It is generally not possible to award M0 followed by A1, as A mark(s) depend on the preceding
      M mark(s), if any. An exception to this rule is when work for M1 is missing, as opposed to
      incorrect (see point 4).
    • Where M and A marks are noted on the same line, eg M1A1, this usually means M1 for an
      attempt to use an appropriate method (eg substitution into a formula) and A1 for using the
      correct values.
    • Where there are two or more A marks on the same line, they may be awarded independently; so
      if the first value is incorrect, but the next two are correct, award A0A1A1.
    • Where the markscheme specifies (M2), N3, etc., do not split the marks, unless there is a note.
    • Once a correct answer to a question or part-question is seen, ignore further working.
    • Most M marks are for a valid method, ie a method which can lead to the answer: it must
      indicate some form of progress towards the answer.


3   N marks

     If no working shown, award N marks for correct answers – this includes acceptable answers
     (see accuracy booklet). In this case, ignore mark breakdown (M, A, R).

    • Do not award a mixture of N and other marks.
    • There may be fewer N marks available than the total of M, A and R marks; this is
      deliberate as it penalizes candidates for not following the instruction to show their working.
    • There may not be a direct relationship between the N marks and the implied marks. There are
      times when all the marks are implied, but the N marks are not the full marks: this indicates that
      we want to see some of the working, without specifying what.
    • For consistency within the markscheme, N marks are noted for every part, even when these
      match the mark breakdown.
    • If a candidate has incorrect working, which somehow results in a correct answer, do not
      award the N marks for this correct answer. However, if the candidate has indicated (usually by
      crossing out) that the working is to be ignored, award the N marks for the correct answer.


4   Implied and must be seen marks

    Implied marks appear in brackets eg (M1).
    • Implied marks can only be awarded if the work is seen or if implied in subsequent working (a
      correct final answer does not necessarily mean that the implied marks are all awarded). There
      are questions where some working is required, but as it is accepted that not everyone will
      write the same steps, all the marks are implied, but the N marks are not the full marks for the
      question.
    • Normally the correct work is seen in the next line.
    • Where there is an (M1) followed by A1 for each correct answer, if no working shown, one
      correct answer is sufficient evidence to award the (M1).

    Must be seen marks appear without brackets eg M1.
    • Must be seen marks can only be awarded if the work is seen.
    • If a must be seen mark is not awarded because work is missing (as opposed to M0 or A0 for
      incorrect work) all subsequent marks may be awarded if appropriate.

5   Follow through marks (only applied after an error is made)

    Follow through (FT) marks are awarded where an incorrect answer (final or intermediate) from
    one part of a question is used correctly in subsequent part(s) or subpart(s). Usually, to award FT
    marks, there must be working present and not just a final answer based on an incorrect answer
    to a previous part. However, if the only marks awarded in a subpart are for the final answer,
    then FT marks should be awarded if appropriate. Examiners are expected to check student work in
    order to award FT marks where appropriate.

    • Within a question part, once an error is made, no further A marks can be awarded for work
      which uses the error, but M and R marks may be awarded if appropriate. (However, as noted
      above, if an A mark is not awarded because work is missing, all subsequent marks may be
      awarded if appropriate).
    • Exceptions to this rule will be explicitly noted on the markscheme.
    • If the question becomes much simpler because of an error then use discretion to award fewer FT
      marks.
    • If the error leads to an inappropriate value (eg probability greater than 1, use of r > 1 for the
      sum of an infinite GP, sin θ = 1.5 , non integer value where integer required), do not award the
      mark(s) for the final answer(s).
    • The markscheme may use the word “their” in a description, to indicate that candidates may be
      using an incorrect value.
    • If a candidate makes an error in one part, but gets the correct answer(s) to subsequent
      part(s), award marks as appropriate, unless the question says hence. It is often possible to use
      a different approach in subsequent parts that does not depend on the answer to previous parts.
    • In a “show that” question, if an error in a previous subpart leads to not showing the required
      answer, do not award the final A1. Note that if the error occurs within the same subpart, the FT
      rules may result in further loss of marks.
    • Where there are anticipated common errors, the FT answers are often noted on the markscheme,
      to help examiners. It should be stressed that these are not the only FT answers accepted, neither
      should N marks be awarded for these answers.


6   Mis-read

     If a candidate incorrectly copies information from the question, this is a mis-read (MR). A
     candidate should be penalized only once for a particular mis-read. Use the MR stamp to indicate
     that this is a misread. Do not award the first mark in the question, even if this is an M mark, but
     award all others (if appropriate) so that the candidate only loses one mark for the misread.

    • If the question becomes much simpler because of the MR, then use discretion to award fewer
      marks.
    • If the MR leads to an inappropriate value (eg probability greater than 1, use of r > 1 for the
      sum of an infinite GP, sin θ = 1.5 , non integer value where integer required), do not award the
      mark(s) for the final answer(s).
    • Miscopying of candidates’ own work does not constitute a misread, it is an error.

7    Discretionary marks (d)
     An examiner uses discretion to award a mark on the rare occasions when the markscheme does not
     cover the work seen. In such cases the annotation DM should be used and a brief note written
     next to the mark explaining this decision.


8    Alternative methods
     Candidates will sometimes use methods other than those in the markscheme. Unless the question
     specifies a method, other correct methods should be marked in line with the markscheme. If in
     doubt, contact your team leader for advice.

     • Alternative methods for complete parts are indicated by METHOD 1, METHOD 2, etc.
     • Alternative solutions for parts of questions are indicated by EITHER . . . OR. Where
       possible, alignment will also be used to assist examiners in identifying where these alternatives
       start and finish.


9    Alternative forms
     Unless the question specifies otherwise, accept equivalent forms.

     • As this is an international examination, accept all alternative forms of notation.
     • In the markscheme, equivalent numerical and algebraic forms will generally be written in
       brackets immediately following the answer.
     • In the markscheme, simplified answers, (which candidates often do not write in examinations),
       will generally appear in brackets. Marks should be awarded for either the form preceding the
       bracket or the form in brackets (if it is seen).


10   Accuracy of Answers

     If the level of accuracy is specified in the question, a mark will be allocated for giving the final
     answer to the required accuracy. When this is not specified in the question, all numerical answers
     should be given exactly or correct to three significant figures

     Candidates should NO LONGER be penalized for an accuracy error (AP). Examiners should
     award marks according to the rules given in these instructions and the markscheme. Accuracy is
     not the same as correctness – an incorrect value does not achieve relevant A marks. It is only final
     answers which may lose marks for accuracy errors, not intermediate values. Please check work
     carefully for FT. Further information on which answers are accepted is given in a separate
     booklet, along with examples. It is essential that you read this carefully.

     Do not accept unfinished numerical final answers such as 3/0.1 (unless otherwise stated). As
     a rule, numerical answers with more than one part (such as fractions) should be given using
     integers (eg 6/8). Calculations which lead to integers should be completed, with the exception of
     fractions which are not whole numbers.

     Clarification of intermediate values accuracy instructions

     Intermediate values do not need to be given to the correct three significant figures. But, if
     candidates work with rounded values, this could lead to an incorrect answer, in which case award
     A0 for the final answer. However, do not penalise inaccurate intermediate values that lead to an
     acceptable final answer.

11     Calculators

      No calculator is allowed. The use of any calculator on paper 1 is malpractice, and will result in no
      grade awarded. If you see work that suggests a candidate has used any calculator, please follow the
      procedures for malpractice. Examples: finding an angle, given a trig ratio of 0.4235.


12     Style

       The markscheme aims to present answers using good communication, eg if the question asks to find
       the value of k, the markscheme will say k = 3 , but the marks will be for the correct value 3 – there
       is usually no need for the “ k = ”. In these cases, it is also usually acceptable to have another
       variable, as long as there is no ambiguity in the question, eg if the question asks to find the
       value of p and of q, then the student answer needs to be clear. Generally, the only situation
       where the full answer is required is in a question which asks for equations – in this case the
       markscheme will say “must be an equation”.

       The markscheme often uses words to describe what the marks are for, followed by examples,
       using the eg notation. These examples are not exhaustive, and examiners should check what
       candidates have written, to see if they satisfy the description. Where these marks are M marks, the
       examples may include ones using poor notation, to indicate what is acceptable. A valid method is
       one which will allow candidate to proceed to the next step eg if a quadratic function is given in
       factorised form, and the question asks for the zeroes, then multiplying the factors does not
       necessarily help to find the zeros, and would not on its own count as a valid method.


13     Candidate work
       If a candidate has drawn a line through work on their examination script, or in some other way
       crossed out their work, do not award any marks for that work.

       Candidates are meant to write their answers to Section A on the question paper (QP), and
       Section B on answer booklets. Sometimes, they need more room for Section A, and use the
       booklet (and often comment to this effect on the QP), or write outside the box. That is fine, and
       this work should be marked.

       The instructions tell candidates not to write on Section B of the QP. Thus they may well have
       done some rough work here which they assume will be ignored. If they have solutions on the
       answer booklets, there is no need to look at the QP. However, if there are whole questions or
       whole part solutions missing on answer booklets, please check to make sure that they are not on the
       QP, and if they are, mark those whole questions or whole part solutions that have not been written
       on answer booklets


14.    Diagrams

       The notes on how to allocate marks for sketches usually refer to passing through particular points or
       having certain features. These marks can only be awarded if the sketch is approximately the
       correct shape. All values given will be an approximate guide to where these points/features occur.
       In some questions, the first A1 is for the shape, in others, the marks are only for the points and/or
       features. In both cases, unless the shape is approximately correct, no marks can be awarded (unless
       otherwise stated). However, if the graph is based on previous calculations, FT marks should be
       awarded if appropriate.
