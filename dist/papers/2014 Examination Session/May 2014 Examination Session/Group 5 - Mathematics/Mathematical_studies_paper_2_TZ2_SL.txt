Please start each question on a new page. You are advised to show all working, where possible.
Where an answer is incorrect, some marks may be given for a correct method, provided this is shown by
written working. Solutions found from a graphic display calculator should be supported by suitable working,
for example, if graphs are used to find a solution, you should sketch these as part of your answer.

       Tomek is attending a conference in Singapore. He has both trousers and shorts to
       wear. He also has the choice of wearing a tie or not.

       The probability Tomek wears trousers is 0.3. If he wears trousers, the probability that
       he wears a tie is 0.8.

       If Tomek wears shorts, the probability that he wears a tie is 0.15.

       The following tree diagram shows the probabilities for Tomek’s clothing options at
       the conference.

      A cross-country running course consists of a beach section and a forest section.
      Competitors run from A to B, then from B to C and from C back to A.

      The running course from A to B is along the beach, while the course from B, through
      C and back to A, is through the forest.

      The course is shown on the following diagram.


                                                                  diagram not to scale

       Give your answers to parts (a) to (e) to the nearest dollar.

       On Hugh’s 18th birthday his parents gave him options of how he might receive his
       monthly allowance for the next two years.

             Option A	$60 each month for two years

             Option B	$10 in the first month, $15 in the second month, $20 in the third
                       month, increasing by $5 each month for two years

             Option C	$15 in the first month and increasing by 10 % each month for
                       two years

             Option D	Investing $1500 at a bank at the beginning of the first year, with an
                       interest rate of 6 % per annum, compounded monthly.

       Hugh does not spend any of his allowance during the two year period.

       (a)   If Hugh chooses Option A, calculate the total value of his allowance at the end
              of the two year period.                                                             [2]

       (b)   If Hugh chooses Option B, calculate

             (i)    the amount of money he will receive in the 17th month;

             (ii)   the total value of his allowance at the end of the two year period.           [5]

       (c)   If Hugh chooses Option C, calculate

             (i)    the amount of money Hugh would receive in the 13th month;

             (ii)   the total value of his allowance at the end of the two year period.           [5]

       (d)   If Hugh chooses Option D, calculate the total value of his allowance at the end
              of the two year period.                                                             [3]

       (e)   State which of the options, A, B, C or D, Hugh should choose to give him the
              greatest total value of his allowance at the end of the two year period.            [1]

       Another bank guarantees Hugh an amount of $1750 after two years of investment
       if he invests $1500 at this bank. The interest is compounded annually.

       (f)   Calculate the interest rate per annum offered by the bank.                           [3]

       The front view of the edge of a water tank is drawn on a set of axes shown below.
       The edge is modelled by=y ax 2 + c .


                                                  y




                                     P                              Q



                                                      O                 x




       Point P has coordinates (−3, 1.8) , point O has coordinates (0, 0) and point Q has
       coordinates (3, 1.8) .

       (a)   Write down the value of c .                                                             [1]

       (b)   Find the value of a .                                                                   [2]

       (c)   Hence write down the equation of the quadratic function which models the edge
              of the water tank.                                                                     [1]

(Question 6 continued)

      The water tank is shown below. It is partially filled with water.


                                                                diagram not to scale

                                   Length



                       Height

                                                                                       x
                                                 Width


      (d)   Calculate the value of y when x = 2.4 m .                                            [2]

      (e)   State what the value of x and the value of y represent for this water tank.          [2]

      (f)   Find the value of x when the height of water in the tank is 0.9 m.                   [2]

      The water tank has a length of 5 m.

      (g)   When the water tank is filled to a height of 0.9 m, the front cross-sectional area
            of the water is 2.55 m 2 .

            (i)    Calculate the volume of water in the tank.                                    [2]


            The total volume of the tank is 36 m3 .

            (ii)   Calculate the percentage of water in the tank.                                [2]
