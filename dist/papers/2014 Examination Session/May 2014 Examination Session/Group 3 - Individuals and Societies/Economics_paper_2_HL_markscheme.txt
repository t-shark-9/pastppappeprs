                      The idea that it is to do with too much demand or rising prices in an
                      economy.

                      An explanation that it refers to the situation where:
                      • the economy is (in equilibrium) at a level of output that is greater
                        than the full employment level of output or above potential output
                        OR
                      • an increase in aggregate demand (when the economy is at full
                        employment) results in an increase in the average price level with
                        no increase in real GDP.


           (ii)   Define the term financial account indicated in bold in the text

                      following):
                      • flows of foreign direct investment

(b)   With reference to the concept of price elasticity of demand, explain why
      rising oil prices have contributed to Turkey’s growing current account deficit

        1 The written response is limited.                                                    1–2
          For explaining that oil is an import and that demand for oil is inelastic or for
          explaining that increases in price will lead to relatively smaller decreases in
          quantity demanded, increasing total expenditure on oil (and/or total import
          expenditure) thus contributing to the growing current account deficit.

        2 The written response is accurate.                                                   3–4

          in quantity demanded, increasing total expenditure on oil (and/or total
          import expenditure) thus contributing to the growing current account deficit.

          • the increase in domestic demand would include an increase in the
            demand for imports thus increasing import expenditure
          • an increase in domestic demand would lead to inflation, increasing the
            price of exports and so (possibly) reducing export revenue
          • rapidly rising demand means that producers increase their sales to
            domestic consumers, cutting exports and export revenues
          • rising demand in the economy may mean that producers need to import
            more raw materials and capital to meet the demand, thus increasing
            spending in imports.

        2 An explanation of any two of the following:                                         3–4

          There is clear knowledge/understanding.
          There is some attempt at application/analysis.

        3 Relevant concepts are recognized and developed in reasonable depth.               6–8
          There is clear knowledge/understanding.
          There is effective application/analysis.
          There is synthesis/evaluation, supported by appropriate theory and evidence.

      Command term
      “Evaluate” requires candidates to make an appraisal by weighing up the strengths
      and limitations.

      Responses may include:
      • an explanation of a current account deficit
      • expenditure–switching policies:
        - depreciating the currency to make exports more competitive and imports
           more expensive – might worsen the deficit if PED for oil is inelastic and
           Turkey is a “large net oil importer” (paragraph ); will only be successful
           if the combined price elasticity of demand for exports and imports is greater
           than 1 (Marshall-Lerner condition)
        - protectionist measures such as tariffs, quotas or subsides to reduce spending
           on imports – might lead to retaliation harming the “boom in foreign
           investment and trade” (paragraph )
      • expenditure-reducing policies:
        - use contractionary monetary and/or fiscal policies to reduce overall AD in
           order to reduce spending on imports
        - would also serve to reduce the “inflationary gap” (paragraph )
        - contractionary monetary policy could lead to appreciation of the lira, which
           may help to reduce inflationary pressure; this could also reduce cost of
           imported capital which would increase LRAS
        - would reduce “rapidly rising domestic demand” (paragraph ), however, it
           would be difficult to assess the correct amount of deflation needed.
           May overshoot and cause recession

  - contractionary monetary policies, increasing interest rates, should reduce the
     fear of financial account outflows (paragraph )
  - time lag involved
• supply-side policies
  - supply side policies may be used to improve the competitiveness of exports
     and increase the competitiveness of goods that compete with imports, but
     this is a long term solution.

Any reasonable discussion.

          For drawing a correctly labelled diagram showing an LRAC curve
          indicating falling average cost as output increases or for an explanation that,
          as output increases due to the ability to sell to a larger market, Australian
          farmers may benefit from economies of scale and so benefit from reduced
          costs per unit of output.

      Candidates who incorrectly label diagrams can be rewarded with a maximum of

      For full marks, it is essential to make some use of the diagram, either by referring
      to two points noted on the diagram, or referring to the section of the diagram
      where average costs are falling.

      Some students may show two or more short run costs curves, with the “envelope”
      LRAC curve. This is certainly acceptable, but not necessary.

      For costs diagrams, the use of Cost or Price and Output or Quantity on the axes is
      sufficient. A title is not necessary.

          For explaining that the terms of trade is an index that shows the value of a
          country’s average export prices relative to the import prices (the formula
          would be acceptable, ie the index of export prices divided by the index of
          import prices times one hundred) or for explaining that coffee and cocoa
          prices went down, while petroleum oil prices went up, and if coffee and
          cocoa make up a larger percentage of its exports, then the terms of trade
          likely will have fallen.

           As long as students show understanding of the concept through a
           definition/explanation, and make a logical link to the data, then they may
           receive full credit. For example, some of the main export prices went down
           (coffee and cocoa), while oil prices went up, so it is uncertain what would
           have happened to the terms of trade. For full credit, it is necessary to be
           aware that some prices have gone down while the price of oil has risen.

          curve to the left and a fall in output or for an explanation that foreign
          investment is part of investment and so is a component of AD and, if it falls,

      Command term
      “Evaluate” requires candidates to make an appraisal by weighing up the strengths
      and limitations.

      Responses may include:
      • Explanation of market-oriented policies:
        - reforms in regulations (paragraph )
        - trade liberalization (paragraph )
        - privatization (paragraph )
        - reduction in government expenditure – not in text, but might be mentioned
        - reference to the Washington Consensus – not in text, but could be mentioned
      • Possible strengths:
        - faster economic growth may be attributable to such market-oriented policies
        - increased incomes
        - privatization may result in greater efficiencies
        - privatisation generates revenue for governments
        - greater role for entrepreneurship (paragraph )
        - increased role of incentives
        - increased competition with the growth of new firms (paragraph ) leading
           to increased efficiency, lower prices, more choice
        - may attract more FDI, leading to more employment (paragraph )
        - more MNCs investing in consumer goods businesses, giving consumers
           increased access to goods and services (link to development)
        - benefits of trade liberalisation = greater choice, lower prices (paragraph 
           – regional trade is picking up)

  - trade liberalisation may lead to increased efficiencies – possible reference to
    comparative advantage
• Possible weaknesses
  - under-provision of infrastructure, which is necessary for growth (paragraph
     – shortage of good roads) (paragraph  – more roads and storage
    facilities needed for agriculture)
  - under-provision of merit goods and public goods: although advances in
    technology are contributing to health care (paragraph ), market forces
    alone will not provide enough health care. Disease and hunger are still
    major problems that market-oriented policies are unlikely to solve
  - privatisation may mean that some essential goods (eg water) may not be
    affordable to all
  - possible vulnerability to external forces (eg FDI dropped significantly in
    2008, Figure 1)
  - trade liberalisation may leave some African producers unable to compete
  - growth is not enough to reduce poverty (paragraph )
  - the agricultural sector needs support/government intervention (paragraph )
  - market-oriented policies may lead to increased inequality, with increased
    social tensions. This may threaten growth in the long term
  - profit motive may lead to negative externalities of production = threats to
    sustainability
  - unclear property rights (paragraph ) may make it difficult for market-
    oriented policies to be successful.

Any reasonable discussion.
