                                        Japan in first trade gap since 1963

           Japan’s current account surplus fell 85.5 % in November 2011 from a year earlier to
            138.5 billion Japanese yen (Japan’s currency) ($1.80 billion), the Ministry of Finance said.
            In 2011, Japan recorded its first deficit in its balance of trade in goods since 1963.

           The appreciation of the Japanese yen against the dollar has reduced Japan’s current account
            surplus. The Japanese yen gained 8.5 % against the dollar in the 12 months since January 2011.
            The currency has acquired a new and unusual status as a safe haven, reinforced by the eurozone
            debt crisis since international investors are concerned about the single European currency.

           It is estimated that a 1 % gain in the Japanese yen could reduce the export volumes by 0.34 %,
            slowing down growth for a country that has relied on overseas demand to maintain its recovery
            from March 2011’s earthquake. To stop the trade in goods deficit from getting worse, the world
            economy would have to grow by 4 % and the value of the Japanese yen would have to fall
            by 5 %. It is unlikely that this will happen.

           With their rapidly aging and decreasing population, Japanese firms face severe challenges
            and have little choice but to look abroad for growth. The Japanese yen’s appreciation to
            record highs against the euro and relative strength against the US dollar has led to a boom in
            outward foreign direct investment (FDI). Exporters are transferring their operations from
            Japan to other economies, where parts and labour costs are lower.

           Japan’s current account surplus could move into a deficit sooner than 2015 if more companies
            shift production abroad to combat losses from a strong Japanese yen. In 2011 Japanese firms
            purchased a record number of firms across the rest of Asia. Worldwide the number of Japanese
            purchases reached 455, only just short of its record of 463 in 1990.

           Japanese firms are also acquiring shares in natural resource companies. Mitsubishi spent
            more than $5 billion buying a quarter of mining giant Anglo-American’s Chilean copper unit,
            and trading group Itochu bought a $1 billion stake in a US oil and gas firm.

           The Japanese Prime Minister has encouraged the trend. “We will take advantage of the
            appreciating Japanese yen to support Japanese companies in purchasing foreign companies
            and acquiring resource interests,” he said.

           However, Japanese authorities have signalled there are concerns about a further appreciation
            of the Japanese yen. The central bank said last month that it plans to increase the funds
            available for currency intervention.

3.       Study the extract below and answer the questions that follow.


                                                                 Haiti

           Haiti remains the poorest country in the Americas and one of the poorest in the world, with a
            gross domestic product (GDP) per capita of US$670 and significant needs in basic services.
            It is also one of the most unequal, with a Gini coefficient of 0.59. Over half of its population
            of 10 million lives in absolute poverty, as 78 % live on less than US$2 per day. In 2010,
            an earthquake killed over 200 000 Haitians.

           Before the earthquake, the country’s social indicators were well below regional averages and
            the country had suffered from repeated external and political shocks. In 2008, rising food
            and fuel prices led to riots and the fall of the government. Tropical storms and hurricanes
            that same year caused losses estimated at US$900 million (15 % of GDP). Despite this,
            Haiti experienced modest but stable growth in the 2000s, with an average real growth of
            2.2 % per year between 2004 and 2009. In 2011, Haiti ranked 158th out of 187 in the Human
            Development Index (HDI).

           In October 1996, Haiti agreed to implement a wide range of market-oriented reforms
            outlined in the IMF’s US$1.2 billion Emergency Economic Recovery Plan (EERP).
            The recovery package aimed to create a capital-friendly macroeconomic environment for the
            export-manufacturing sector over a five-year period. Requirements of the recovery package
            include reducing tariffs and selling off state-owned enterprises, as well as keeping wages
            from rising.

           In just 33 years, Haiti has gone from being self-sufficient in rice, sugar, poultry and pork,
            to being the largest importer of US foodstuffs in the Caribbean.

           The Haitian economy is recovering from the earthquake. After a contraction of 5.4 % in
            2009–10, GDP grew 5.1 % in 2010–2011. In 2011–12, it was projected to grow by 7 %,
            mainly driven by agriculture, textiles and construction. The macroeconomic situation
            is improving with domestic tax revenues rising to 13 % of GDP in 2011 due to increasing
            imports and recovery efforts.

     African Development Bank (AfDB) promotes improved access to water, sanitation and health
                               services in rural and urban Uganda

           The AfDB and the Government of Uganda signed two agreements recently to finance
            projects to improve health services and access to water and sanitation, in urban and rural areas
            of Uganda. The projects will cost US$155.8 million and are expected to boost the country’s
            efforts to meet the 2015 Millennium Development Goals for health, water and sanitation.

           Uganda’s National Development Plan identifies the provision of improved health services as
            well as adequate water supply and improved sanitation as key priority areas. “Investing in
            human development is crucial to economic growth and reducing poverty” said a government
            official. “So is the provision of adequate quantity and quality of water for all social and
            economic needs, for current and future generations.”

           Up to 2.4 million people in rural areas and small towns across Uganda should have
            improved access to water supply and sanitation by 2016 following the AfDB’s approval of
            US$67 million. This supports Uganda’s national goal to increase access to water supply and
            sanitation services to 100 % coverage by 2035.

           Furthermore, access to quality and affordable health care services for the Kampala and
            metropolitan area will be improved. Immediate project beneficiaries are estimated at
            3 million people, the majority being women and children under 15 years of age.

           The AfDB Vice-President said: “The AfDB and Uganda have been partners in several
            development areas and the AfDB will continue to work with the Government of Uganda in its
            efforts to improve the economic and social wellbeing of the people of Uganda.”
