                                             SECTION A

Biological level of analysis

1.   Describe one study that demonstrates the effect that the environment can have on
     one physiological process.                                                       [8 marks]

     Refer to the paper 1 section A markbands below when awarding marks.

     The command term “describe” requires candidates to give a detailed account of one
     study related to the effect of the environment on one physiological process. Responses
     should clearly describe the aim, method and findings of one study in which it is clear
     how the environment can affect one physiological process.

     Studies could include, but are not limited to:
     • Meaney’s (1988) study of how environmental stressors lead to hippocampal cell loss
        in rats
     • Rosenzweig, Bennett and Diamond’s (1972) study on stimulating environments and
        dendritic branching
     • Maguire’s (2000) study on taxi drivers and hippocampal change
     • Kasamatsu and Hirai’s (1999) study on sensory deprivation and its effect on
        serotonin leading to hallucinations
     • Small and Vorgan’s (2008) study on the effect of computer use on the brain
     • the effects of jet lag on bodily rhythms.

     In order to access the top markband, candidates must make an explicit link between the
     effect of the environment on one physiological process and the study that is described.

     If a candidate describes more than one study, credit should be given only to the first
     description.

     If a candidate addresses more than one physiological process, credit should be given
     only to the first physiological process addressed.

     1 to 3      There is an attempt to answer the question, but knowledge and
                 understanding is limited, often inaccurate, or of marginal relevance to the
                 question.

     4 to 6      The question is partially answered. Knowledge and understanding is
                 accurate but limited. Either the command term is not effectively addressed
                 or the response is not sufficiently explicit in answering the question.

     7 to 8      The question is answered in a focused and effective manner and meets the
                 demands of the command term. The response is supported by appropriate
                 and accurate knowledge and understanding of research.

Cognitive level of analysis

2.   With reference to one research study, explain how one biological factor may affect
     one cognitive process.                                                                     [8 marks]

     Refer to the paper 1 section A markbands below when awarding marks.

     The command term “explain” requires candidates to give a detailed account, including
     reasons or causes, of how one biological factor may affect one cognitive process.
     A specific biological factor must be clearly identified. Possible cognitive processes
     include, but are not limited to, memory, language acquisition, problem solving, and
     perception.

     Research studies may include, but are not limited to:
     • Broca’s (1861) and Wernicke’s (1874) studies on the role of damage to specific
       regions of the brain on language production and language understanding
     • Martinez and Kesner’s (1991) investigation of neurotransmission and memory
       consolidation
     • Milner et al. (1968) and Blakemore’s (1988) case studies of HM and Clive Wearing,
       investigating the role of the hippocampus on memory consolidation and retrieval
     • Newcomer (1998) or Meaney’s (1988) studies on the role of glucocorticoids
       (cortisol) on memory impairment.

     The focus of the response should be on the explanation of how one biological factor
     affects one cognitive process, not on the description of the study.

     If a candidate only describes an appropriate study without explaining how one
     biological factor may affect one cognitive process, apply the markbands up to a
     maximum of [3 marks].

     If a candidate explains how one biological factor may affect one cognitive process
     without making reference to a relevant study, apply the markbands up to a maximum of
     [4 marks].

     If a candidate refers to more than one study, credit should be given only to the first
     study.

     If a candidate refers to more than one biological factor, credit should be given only to
     the first biological factor.

     If a candidate refers to more than one cognitive process, credit should be given only to
     the first cognitive process.

Sociocultural level of analysis

3.    Outline how one principle that defines the sociocultural level of analysis has been
      demonstrated in one example of research (theory or study).                          [8 marks]

      Refer to the paper 1 section A markbands below when awarding marks.

      The command term “outline” requires candidates to give a brief account of an
      appropriate principle and show how this principle is clearly demonstrated in a study or
      theory relevant to the sociocultural level of analysis.
      Acceptable principles may include, but are not limited to:
      • social and cultural factors influence individual behaviour (for example, social learning
        theory)
      • we want connectedness with, and a sense of belonging to, others (for example, Asch)
      • we construct our conceptions of the individual and social self (for example, social
        identity theory)
      • people’s views of the world are resistant to change (for example, Festinger et al.’s When
        Prophecy Fails study, 1956)
      • our behaviour is influenced by others even when we believe we are acting independently
        (for example, Sherif’s autokinetic effect).

      After outlining the principle and giving a brief summary of one study or theory, candidates
      should make an explicit link between the principle and the theory or study – for example,
      how Asch’s conformity study demonstrates an individual’s need to belong to a group.

      If a relevant principle and research are outlined but not explicitly linked, apply the
      markbands up to a maximum of [6 marks].

      If a candidate outlines more than one principle in relation to one or more theories or studies,
      credit should be given only to the first principle outlined in the first theory or study used.

      If a candidate outlines a principle making no link to an example of research at the
      sociocultural level of analysis, up to a maximum of [4 marks] should be awarded.

      If a candidate outlines a theory or study relevant to the sociocultural level of analysis but
      there is no principle outlined, apply the markbands up to a maximum of
      [3 marks].

                                             SECTION B

4.   Examine one evolutionary explanation of one behaviour.                                     [22 marks]

     Refer to the paper 1 section B assessment criteria when awarding marks.

     The command term “examine” requires candidates to consider one evolutionary
     explanation of one behaviour in a way that uncovers the assumptions and
     interrelationships of the evolutionary explanation of behaviour.

     Assumptions that may be addressed include, but are not limited to:
     • the basic principles of natural selection (adaptation)
     • human behaviours may be inherited
     • the mechanism of sexual selection.

     Candidates must choose one behaviour to examine, such as but not limited to:
     • human mating behaviours (Buss, 1990)
     • emotional behaviour (for example, disgust, Fessler, 2006; universality of emotional
       expressions, Ekman and Frieson, 1971)
     • dysfunctional behaviour (for example, depression, Andrews and Thompson, 2009;
       phobias, Seligman, 1971)
     • altruism (Dawkins, 1976).

     Candidates may examine a specific emotional or dysfunctional behaviour such as
     disgust or depression or may examine emotional or dysfunctional behaviour in general.
     Both approaches are equally acceptable.

     Candidates may look at the underlying assumptions. They may also evaluate the
     evidence in support of the explanation as well as discuss its strengths and limitations.
     Comparison with another explanation of the behaviour is also a plausible approach to
     this question, but the primary focus needs to be on the evolutionary argument.

     If a candidate examines more than one evolutionary explanation of one or more
     behaviours, credit should be given only to the first explanation of the first behaviour.
     However, candidates may address other explanations of the same behaviour and be
     awarded marks for these as long as they are clearly used to examine the evolutionary
     explanation addressed in the response.

5.   Evaluate schema theory.                                                                   [22 marks]

     Refer to the paper 1 section B assessment criteria when awarding marks.

     The command term “evaluate” requires candidates to make an appraisal by weighing up
     the strengths and limitations of schema theory. Although a discussion of both strengths
     and limitations is required, it does not have to be evenly balanced to gain high marks.

     Research may include, but is not limited to:
     • Loftus and Palmer (1974) on schema processing as a consequence of leading
       questions
     • Anderson and Pichert’s (1978) study on the effect of schema processing on memory
       encoding and retrieval
     • Wynn and Logie’s (1998) study using real-life experiences in schema processing
     • Brewer and Treyen’s (1981) “office schema” study
     • Piaget’s studies on the reorganization of schema during child development
     • studies on gender schemas (for example, Martin et al., 1995; Bee, 1999)
     • Bartlett’s (1932) seminal study (“War of the Ghosts”).

     Evaluation of the theory may include, but is not limited to:
     • the degree of empirical support
     • biological support for the theory
     • methodological considerations of research used to support the theory
     • application to real life (for example, eye witness testimony, CBT)
     • if the theory has practical relevance for understanding cognition and/or behaviour
       (for example, gender or cultural roles)
     • Cohen’s (1993) criticism of schema theory.

     If a candidate addresses only strengths or only limitations, the response should be
     awarded up to a maximum of [5 marks] for criterion B, critical thinking, and up to a
     maximum of [2 marks] for criterion C, organization. Up to full marks may be awarded
     for criterion A, knowledge and comprehension.

6.   Discuss two errors in attribution.                                                          [22 marks]

     Refer to the paper 1 section B assessment criteria when awarding marks.

     The command term “discuss” requires candidates to offer a considered and balanced
     review of two errors in attribution.

     Appropriate attribution errors may include, but are not limited to:
     • fundamental attribution error
     • defensive attribution bias
     • illusory correlation
     • self-serving bias
     • modesty bias
     • in-group bias
     • the halo effect
     • actor-observer bias

     Responses may refer to studies such as, but not limited to:
     • Ross et al. (1977), Jones and Harris (1967) on the fundamental attribution error
     • Jellison and Green (1981), Miller (1984), Cousins (1989) on the cultural differences
       in the fundamental attribution error
     • Myers and Bach (1976), Gilovich (1983), Miller and Ross (1975) on the self-serving
       bias
     • Kashima and Triandis (1986), Chandler et al. (1990), Bond et al. (1982) on the
       cultural differences in the self-serving bias and modesty bias
     • Walster (1966) on the defensive attribution bias.

     Discussion may address issues such as, but not limited to:
     • the context in which these errors appear
     • the reasons for their occurrence
     • the cultural differences in the expression of these errors
     • the degree of empirical support.

     If a candidate discusses more than two errors in attribution, credit should be given only
     to the first two errors.

     If a candidate discusses only one error in attribution, the response should be awarded up
     to a maximum of [5 marks] for criterion A, knowledge and comprehension, up to a
     maximum of [4 marks] for criterion B, critical thinking, and up to a maximum of
     [2 marks] for criterion C, organization.
