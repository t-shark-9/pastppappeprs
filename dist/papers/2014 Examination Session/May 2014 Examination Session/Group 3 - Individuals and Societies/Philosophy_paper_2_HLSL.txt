9.    Evaluate the claim that in relying on God to underwrite the reliability of human cognition Descartes

10.   Evaluate Descartes’s claim that “the method of doubt” helps us distinguish those ideas that are
      unshakeable from those that at first glance appear to be unshakeable.



John Locke: Second Treatise on Government

11.   Evaluate the claim that “No man’s labour could subdue or appropriate all, nor could his enjoyment
      consume more than one small part; so that it was impossible for any man to entrench upon the right
      of another or acquire to himself a property to the prejudice of his neighbour”.


12.   Evaluate the claim that parents have power over their children because of their “duty, which is
      incumbent on them, to take care of their offspring during the imperfect state of childhood”.

      from harm.

      Discuss and evaluate.

Hannah Arendt: The Human Condition

19.   Explain and discuss the relationship between the public and the private realm.


20.   Evaluate Arendt’s view that the function of the faculty of promising is to master the basic unreliability
      of humans who can never guarantee today who they will be tomorrow, and that is the price human
      beings pay for freedom.



Simone de Beauvoir: The Ethics of Ambiguity

21.   Evaluate the claim that it is inconsistent of de Beauvoir to hold both that values are human creations
