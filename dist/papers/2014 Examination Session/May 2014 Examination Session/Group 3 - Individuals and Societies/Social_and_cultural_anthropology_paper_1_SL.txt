Extract adapted from Auyero, J. and Swistun, D. “Flammable, Environmental Suffering in an Argentine
Shantytown”, Oxford University Press, New York, 2009.

            In 1931, the Shell oil refinery opened in Flammable [a shantytown]. Flammable is today surrounded
            by one of the largest petrochemical compounds in Argentina. Here, the soil, air and water are
            polluted with lead and other chemicals.

            Experts agree that, given the compound’s industrial activities, Flammable is unsuitable for human
     5      residence. One study found that children in Flammable are exposed to lead and, not surprisingly,
            have many health problems*. For example, Claudia’s youngest child has had seizures since he
            was a baby and another was born with her left leg much shorter than the right leg.

            Daily life is dominated by ignorance, error and doubt regarding the sources and effects of toxicity.
            For example, we were told: “Sometimes you can’t be outside, your throat stings. It smells of gas.
   10       Even if we close our doors, it smells”. Yet, when residents talk about the specifics of contamination,
            when they have to put a name to the sources, location, and contents of pollution, things become
            unclear.

            Misinformation, denial and shifted responsibility are three manifestations of the collective schemes
            of perception that we call “toxic uncertainty”. For example, residents say that oil contaminates
   15       water streams, but they also consider it harmless. Some residents believe that the refinery is
            completely safe; others think it is highly contaminating.

            Residents are aware that lead is harmful, but most think that it lies elsewhere. To them, it is not
            located in the entire neighbourhood but only in the poorest parts. It is not stored in their bodies but
            in those of the poorest residents. As Susana told us: “It’s the mothers’ fault. They allow their kids
   20       to play in the garbage; they don’t bathe them … that’s why they get contaminated”.

            One way of thinking and living pollution acknowledges its existence but denies its seriousness.
            Many adults use their own bodies as instruments of denial. As Francisco put it: “I raised three kids
            here. I have been inside many compounds, and I don’t have health problems”.

            How are we to explain this complex combination of error, denial and confusion? Why do
   25       Flammable residents doubt or deny the “hard facts” of industrial pollution?

            Environmental contamination was not suddenly imposed on Flammable residents … The Shell
            oil refinery opened 75 years ago; the gradual increase in industrial pollution levels occurred at
            the same time as people took roots in the neighbourhood through work, family and friendship
            networks. The process which most of the residents went through is important for understanding
   30       how they think and feel about Flammable – not as an outsider might, but in a way that is part
            of their history and the routine organization of daily life. Routines work smoothly to obscure
            increasing environmental hazards. Perceptions of danger are thus grounded in everyday routines.

            Two additional powerful actors – state officials and doctors – shape the understanding of the origins
            and effects of toxic contamination by making contradictory claims about them. The contradictory
     35     statements shape the confusion which results in shared (mis)understandings.

            On the one hand, state officials discuss contamination, denounce the companies that operate
            the oil industry, demand a study of the effects of industrial pollution and promise the relocation
            of the shantytown. On the other hand, they show up in Flammable talking about relocating
            the residents. And then they disappear. Residents told us that local doctors also advise them
     40     to leave. Other times, residents report the silence of doctors concerning their illnesses. How can
            residents not be confused if state officials, even those responsible for their well-being, send such
            contradictory messages?

            These collective schemes of perception (what people see and don’t see, what they know and
            don’t know) are socially produced, but this production is not simply a cooperative creation.
     45     Perceptions of hazards are shaped by powerful actors. The knowledge actors have about their
            environment is the joint product of the history of that place, the routines and interactions of its
            residents, and the power relations they are caught up in. In Flammable, “not knowing” is one
            example of material suffering and symbolic domination.

* health problems: lead may cause a range of health effects, from behavioural problems and learning disabilities
     to seizures and death



1.      Describe Flammable residents’ views of their environment.                                                  [6 marks]


2.      Explain how the authors understand knowledge to be socially produced.                                      [6 marks]


3.      Compare and contrast the power relations in Flammable with the power relations in
        one society that you have studied in detail.                                                               [8 marks]
