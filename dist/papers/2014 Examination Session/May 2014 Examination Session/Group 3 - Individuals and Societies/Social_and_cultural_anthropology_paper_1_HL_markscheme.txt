1.   Describe Flammable residents’ views of their environment.                                  [6 marks]

     This primarily descriptive question requires candidates to give an account of residents’
     perceptions of contamination, the widespread doubts and errors they cling to about their polluted
     habitat. Flammable residents are confused or mystified about the source, extent, and potential
     effects of contamination.

     The authors define the collective perceptions of contamination and its effects among Flammable
     residents as “toxic uncertainty”. These collective schemes of perception mediate between the
     environment and the subjective experiences of Flammable residents, giving form to their views.

     This uncertainty derives from misinformation, shifted responsibility and denial. Each of these
     manifestations is illustrated by an example through which the residents’ perceptions can be better
     understood. Candidates may refer to any of these in their answer to this question.

     For example, it is evident in Susana’s words that she interprets the cause of pollution to be in the
     poorer mothers’ practices, a clear case of shifted responsibility. Also, the residents’ contradictory
     beliefs regarding Shell’s responsibility or the risks associated with the oil-polluted streams are
     examples of misinformation. Finally, Francisco uses his own body and those of his children to
     deny the dangers of pollution.

     The better answers will make explicit reference to these issues and give an account of the
     contradictions between objective conditions and subjective experience, as mediated by the social
     reality in which they are immersed. Collective schemes of perception mediate between the
     environment and the subjective experience of it, giving form to what people know, ignoring and
     misinterpreting the surrounding dangers.

2.   Using theoretical perspectives, explain how the authors understand knowledge
     to be socially produced.                                                     [6 marks]

     There are several points in the text which can be drawn on to answer this question, but stronger
     answers will incorporate concepts and knowledge from social and cultural anthropology that are
     relevant to the analysis and interpretation of the passage.

     The relationship between the “toxic uncertainty” and the social structure is key to an
     understanding of this passage. The authors explore the sources of risk perceptions emphasizing
     their socially constructed character. Flammable residents’ knowledge of their polluted
     surroundings is socially and politically determined. It does not follow straightforwardly from the
     toxic environment, but it is shaped by two factors; their local history and the interventions of
     state officials and doctors. Thus, the meanings of contamination are the outcome of power
     relations between residents and outside actors, whose actions and statements are highly
     influential and contribute to what Flammable residents know, ignore, or misrecognize about their
     neighbourhood. These meanings shape those unequal relationships.

     The relation between knowledge and social organization can be explained in many ways.
     Candidates may approach this question from general anthropological concepts and terms related
     to different themes (individuals, groups and society; political organization; systems of
     knowledge). Candidates may explain how individuals are embedded in social structures and
     cultural dynamics that shape identity, actions and meanings, and in this particular case, mould
     the construction of knowledge. Thus, the “lack of knowledge” and uncertainty can be
     approached from the analysis of social and cultural factors constraining agency.

     Knowledge, as a way of organizing and comprehending social and natural environments, is
     context dependent. Some candidates may refer to Marx and his view of thought as political
     product (false consciousness). Drawing from more contemporary theoreticians such as
     Bourdieu, candidates may refer to symbolic violence to interpret how these schemes of
     perception or dispositions are influenced by the contradictory messages of powerful actors to
     support residents’ own domination. Also relevant may be the concept of symbolic capital to
     understand state officials and doctors’ knowledge as a manifestation of power. Other
     contemporary concepts (eg socialization, naturalization, power and knowledge) can be used
     effectively.

     Candidates may recognize the viewpoint of the anthropologists in the distinction between insider
     and outsider perspectives. The authors highlight the local categories and understand them not as
     a separate domain but in their relation to the social structure. The use of quotations of the
     residents gives evidence of the authors’ intention to make sense of the situation according to the
     agents’ point of view.

     The question can be approached from different theoretical perspectives. The social production of
     knowledge can be analysed taking structure-centred perspectives that give account of the part
     played by institutional constraints. Also, diachronic perspectives may inform the authors’
     argument that a historical dimension is key to understand the nature of the schemes of perception
     about the environment. Some candidates might refer to conflict-centred perspectives to focus on
     this social interaction. The use of a particularistic perspective is also a possible choice of
     explanation. From agency and structure perspectives, it can be argued that it is necessary to
     grasp the duality of social process.

3.   Compare and contrast the power relations in Flammable with the power
     relations in one society that you have studied in detail.            [8 marks]

     The target societies for this comparative question are varied and many. The question requires
     candidates to demonstrate an understanding of power relations as inherent to any society (or
     groups, institutions or sectors within it) or between societies. These relations may take many
     forms, allowing candidates to make comparisons. While in the Flammable situation, power and
     knowledge are intimately associated, other manifestations of power relations can be analysed and
     the answer structured in other terms. Other social groups may have alternative ways of creating
     inequality.

     The answers need not revolve around the views of the environment or risk perceptions so long as
     they are about how power relations are structured. The measure of this answer lies in the way in
     which candidates compare and contrast and harness ethnographic knowledge, rather than it being
     a test of knowledge of a similar case study.

     In order to obtain full marks answers must be organized in a clear manner, highlighting
     similarities, differences and generalizations. Candidates must situate the comparative case in
     terms of group, place, author and historical context to gain more than 4 marks.

     Candidates may choose to use theoretical perspectives (ideally introduced in their question 2
     response) to help frame their comparison.
