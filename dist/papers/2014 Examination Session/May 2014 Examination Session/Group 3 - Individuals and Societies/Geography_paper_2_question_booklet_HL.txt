Answer three questions. Each question must be selected from a different optional theme. (Do not answer
two questions on the same optional theme.)

Wherever possible, answers should include case studies and examples, and where relevant, large, well drawn
maps and diagrams.

Option A — Freshwater – issues and conflicts

1.    If you choose to answer this question refer to the satellite image on page 2 in the Resources Booklet.

            movement in the area shown on the satellite image.                                          [4]

      (b)   Explain two ways in which agriculture and/or irrigation on flood plains can
            affect water quality.                                                                    [3+3]

      (c)   Examine the factors that affect the response of a stream hydrograph to a
            rainfall event.                                                                            [10]


2.    (a)   Define the terms drainage divide and wetlands.                                           [2+2]

      (b)   Explain how stream discharge is related to channel size and shape.                          [6]

      (c)   Using examples, examine the hydrological impacts that can result from the
            construction of a dam and reservoir across a river channel.                                [10]

      (b)   Explain the formation of two ocean floor landforms associated with volcanic or
            tectonic activity.                                                                    [3+3]
