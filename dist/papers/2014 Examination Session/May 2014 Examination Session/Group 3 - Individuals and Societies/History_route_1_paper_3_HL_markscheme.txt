Paper 3 markbands: The following bands provide a précis of the full markbands for paper 3 published in the
History guide (2008) on pages 77–81. They are intended to assist marking but must be used in conjunction
with the full markbands found in the guide. For the attention of all examiners: if you are uncertain about
the content/accuracy of a candidate’s work please contact your team leader.

 0:     Answers not meeting the requirements of descriptors should be awarded no marks.
 1–2:  Answers do not meet the demands of the question and show little or no evidence of appropriate
       structure. There is little more than unsupported generalization.
 3–4: There is little understanding of the question. Historical knowledge is present but the detail is
        insufficient. Historical context or processes are barely understood and there are little more than
        poorly substantiated assertions.
 5–6: Answers indicate some understanding of the question, but historical knowledge is limited in quality
        and quantity. Understanding of historical processes may be present but underdeveloped. The
        question is only partially addressed.
 7–8: The demands of the question are generally understood. Relevant, historical knowledge is present
        but is unevenly applied. Knowledge is narrative or descriptive in nature. There may be limited
        argument that requires further substantiation. Critical commentary may be present. An attempt to
        place events in historical context and show an understanding of historical processes. An attempt at
        a structured approach, either chronological or thematic has been made.
 9–11: Answers indicate that the question is understood but not all implications considered. Knowledge is
        largely accurate. Critical commentary may be present. Events are generally placed in context, and
        historical processes, such as comparison and contrast, are understood. There is a clear attempt at a
        structured approach. Focus on AO1, AO2 and AO4. Responses that simply summarize the views
        of historians cannot reach the top of this markband.
 12–14: Answers are clearly focused on the demands of the question. Relevant in-depth knowledge is
        applied as evidence, and analysis or critical commentary are used to indicate some in-depth
        understanding but is not consistent throughout. Events are placed in context and there is sound
        understanding of historical processes and comparison and contrast. Evaluation of different
        approaches may be used to substantiate arguments presented. Synthesis is present but not always
        consistently integrated. Focus on AO3 and AO4.
 15–17: Answers are clearly structured and focused, have full awareness of the demands of the question, and
        if appropriate may challenge it. Accurate and detailed historical knowledge is used convincingly to
        support critical commentary. Historical processes such as comparison and contrast, placing events
        in context and evaluating different interpretations are used appropriately and effectively. Answers
        are well-structured and balanced and synthesis is well-developed and supported with knowledge
        and critical commentary.
 18–20: Answers are clearly focused with a high degree of the awareness of the question and may challenge
        it successfully. Knowledge is extensive, accurately applied and there may be a high level of
        conceptual ability. Evaluation of different approaches may be present as may be understanding of
        historical processes as well as comparison and contrast where relevant. Evaluation is integrated into
        the answer. The answer is well-structured and well-focused. Synthesis is highly developed.

 Following a review of marking practices it has been agreed that in order to add further clarity to the
 markscheme for Paper 3, all caveats with regard to the awarding of marks for questions that include more
 than one component (eg, compare and contrast; reasons and significance; methods and success) will be
 removed.

 Examiners and moderators are reminded of the need to apply the markbands that provide the “best fit” to
 the responses given by candidates and to award credit wherever it is possible to do so. If an answer
 indicates that the demands of the question are understood and addressed but that not all implications are
 considered (eg, compare or contrast; reasons or significance; methods or success), then examiners should
 not be afraid of using the full range of marks allowed for by the markscheme: ie, responses that offer good
 coverage of some of the criteria should be rewarded accordingly.

Christianity c500–1300

1.   Assess the impact of the founding of either the Franciscan or Dominican order on the
     medieval church.

     Candidates must choose one of the orders mentioned in the question and provide a well-structured
     and supported assessment of its impact on the church. Both orders may be seen to have had both
     positive and negative impacts on the church.

     The impact of the Franciscan order may include: they helped reduce opposition movements by
     restoring faith in the spiritual and religious nature of the church through their preaching and their
     example of poverty and humility; they worked to eliminate opposition by taking an active role in
     the Inquisition; many Franciscans were respected teachers and academics and they helped to
     reconcile science and other intellectual pursuits with church doctrine; their role as teachers helped
     to maintain Church domination of intellectual life; they were instrumental in expanding the
     geographic reach of the church as they took a leading role in missionary work in the New World
     and in Asia. However, their growing wealth and power led to complaints of corruption and moral
     laxity, which increased opposition to the church. Their influence caused rivalries with other orders,
     which served to divide and weaken the church on some occasions.

     The impact of the Dominicans may include: they helped to reduce opposition to the church and
     increase its prestige through their teaching, preaching and intellectual pursuits; they reconciled faith
     with classical philosophy (eg Aristotle) to prevent weakening of the Church; Thomas Aquinas, a
     Dominican, played a major role in reconciling the Christian faith and classical philosophy; they
     were accomplished university teachers and canon lawyers who reformed and codified canon law.
     They also played a leading role in the Inquisition to eliminate opposition movements in the
     medieval period. However, their rivalry with other orders was a source of division in the Church as
     were their wealth and power, which attracted criticism from within and outside the Church and led
     to further calls for reform.

     The above material is an indication of what candidates may elect to write about in their
     responses. However, the list is not exhaustive and no set answer is required.

     Examiners and moderators are reminded of the need to apply the markbands that provide the
     “best fit” to the responses given by candidates and to award credit wherever it is possible to do so.

2.   Discuss the reasons for, and the consequences of, the Investiture crisis.

     The reasons for the Investiture crisis may include: the Church reform movement, which sought to
     eliminate lay investiture and free the Church from secular control; the assertion by the Papacy that
     popes were superior to lay rulers and could depose them for improper behaviour; the secular rulers
     wished to retain lay investiture for reasons of financial and feudal control, and the Holy Roman
     Emperor wished to maintain his control over papal elections. This was rejected by Gregory VII
     and, in turn, the secular rulers rejected the Pope’s claim to be their superior.

     The conflict occurred when Gregory VII clashed with the Holy Roman Emperor Henry IV over lay
     investiture. The Pope excommunicated the Holy Roman Emperor and declared him no longer the
     ruler of the Holy Roman Empire. Henry IV in turn denounced the Pope and set out to depose him.

     The results of the Investiture crisis may include: a civil war broke out in Germany after Henry
     was deposed by the Pope; Henry defeated his rivals and declared war on the Pope who fled and died
     in exile. The Investiture crisis was partially resolved at the Diet of Worms (1122), whereby the two
     sides reached a compromise. The precedent of papal authority over rulers was continued and
     expanded by Gregory’s successors, who used the concept to expand papal authority and financial
     power.

     The above material is an indication of what candidates may elect to write about in their
     responses. However, the list is not exhaustive and no set answer is required.

     Examiners and moderators are reminded of the need to apply the markbands that provide the
     “best fit” to the responses given by candidates and to award credit wherever it is possible to do so.

The Fatimids 909–1171

3.   Analyse the contribution of one of the following to the Fatimid Empire: al-Mu’izz (953–75) or
     al-Mustansir (1036–94).

     al-Mu’izz (953–975) was one of the most powerful of Fatimid leaders. He conquered Egypt and
     established Cairo as the new capital of the empire. This putd the Fatimids in a position where they
     could challenge the Abbasids for the caliphate. His armies expanded the Fatimid Empire to
     Morocco and attempted to invade Spain. His naval forces expanded their power and challenged the
     Byzantine Empire for control of the Mediterranean. His naval power was crucial to the further
     expansion of Fatimid seaborne trade in the Mediterranean and the Red Sea. This control of trade
     led to great wealth for the merchants in Egypt as they controlled the trade between the Indian Ocean
     and Europe.

     al-Mu’izz established a model for Fatimid government through his policy of religious tolerance and
     his employment of administrators regardless of their faith. This was a pattern followed by
     successive Fatimid governments. This policy of toleration was one of the pillars of Fatimid
     strength for many years in both the government and the military.

     al-Mu’izz was also a substantial supporter of the arts, particularly literature and poetry.

     The Fatimid Empire reached its greatest extent under the leadership of al-Mustansir (1036–
     1094) and it was briefly able to occupy Baghdad and claim the caliphate for the Fatimids; this is
     also the period when Fatimid power began to decline sharply. During his reign, widespread strife
     began within the various ethnic factions of the Fatimid army. These escalated to the point of civil
     war, al-Mustansir was not able to exercise influence, and was forced to surrender power to General
     Badr, who restored order and assumed the office of vizier. From this point on, Fatimid caliphs
     exercised little authority. The Fatimid collapse during this period was exacerbated by years of
     famine and economic decline, which further reduced the power of the caliph and encouraged further
     division and dissent.

     The Fatimid Empire was reduced to Egypt as the Seljuk Turks occupied Syria and the Crusaders
     made inroads in Palestine.

     The succession crisis following al-Mustansir’s death added to the empire’s fragility.

     The above material is an indication of what candidates may elect to write about in their
     responses. However, the list is not exhaustive and no set answer is required.

     Examiners and moderators are reminded of the need to apply the markbands that provide the
     “best fit” to the responses given by candidates and to award credit wherever it is possible to do so.

4.   “The most important impact of the Fatimids on the Islamic world was their development of
     trade.” To what extent do you agree with this statement?

     Candidates must assess the importance of trade and economic development relative to the other
     influences of the Fatimid Empire on the Islamic world. These other influences may be religious,
     cultural, political, or intellectual. Candidates may wish to see economic contributions as being of
     little effect, but they must make reference to them in their response.

     Some of the important influences of the Fatimids may include: they conquered large amounts of
     territory and claimed the caliphate which weakened the Abbasids; they established models of
     government which involved toleration for other faiths. They established the city of Cairo, which
     became one of the major centres of the Islamic world (it was a commercial centre of great
     significance, it was also a leading centre for scholarship and intellectual activity, which was
     encouraged by the founding of the first university in Islam); they created notable examples of
     architecture and artistic works in ceramics; they developed and expanded the Ismaili branch of
     Islam, which further divided the Islamic world and caused sectarian strife. They also expanded
     trade extensively throughout the Islamic world and to Europe as they developed seaborne trade in
     the Mediterranean as well as the Red Sea and Indian Ocean.

     responses. However, the list is not exhaustive and no set answer is required.

     “best fit” to the responses given by candidates and to award credit wherever it is possible to do so.

Monarchies in England and France 1066–1223

5.   Compare and contrast the success of Henry I (1100–35) and Louis VI (1108–39) in
     establishing a strong central government.

     For compare, points may include: both rulers used their relations with the church to strengthen
     their power; both expanded and defended their feudal rights and power over vassals; both took
     military action against rebellious subjects; both established and used royal bureaucracies to expand
     their influence; both were successful in expanding their revenues as a basis for a stronger
     government; both left strong administrative structures to their successors.

     For contrast, points may include: Louis VI was not able to defeat or control his most powerful
     vassal Henry I and this weakened his power; Henry had control of the church whereas Louis had to
     work in partnership and seek its support; Henry had a stronger control of the feudal system, and his
     legal system was enforced throughout the realm; Louis had a constant struggle to control powerful
     vassals and gain respect for his laws. Candidates may note that Henry was more successful because
     he was building on a strong foundation built by William I, while Louis began from a very weak
     position and was the first French king to attempt to establish a strong central administration.

     The above material is an indication of what candidates may elect to write about in their
     responses. However, the list is not exhaustive and no set answer is required.

     Examiners and moderators are reminded of the need to apply the markbands that provide the
     “best fit” to the responses given by candidates and to award credit wherever it is possible to do so.

6.   Analyse the reasons for, and the results of, the wars between England and France from
     1154 to 1214.

     The reasons for the Anglo–French war may include: the kings of England had large landholdings
     in France, which conflicted with the desire of the French monarchy to expand its power; the English
     kings continued to expand their territory during the period through marriage and conquest,
     provoking further conflict with the French. Personal reasons were also a factor as Henry II married
     Eleanor of Aquitaine who had divorced Louis VII, King of France, which resulted in Louis losing a
     large amount of territory – this caused further conflict. The family problems of the Angevin
     dynasty in England led to conflict within the family and this encouraged Louis VII and Philip II to
     enter that conflict to increase their power and influence.

     The absence of Richard I on Crusade and the weakness of John encouraged Philip II to attack
     English possessions in order to increase his territory and influence.

     Candidates may also refer to the fact that conflict between the kings of England and France went
     back to William I, Duke of Normandy, who was a powerful rival of the Capet family for power and
     influence in France, as were his successors, who were in constant conflicts with the Capets.

     The results of the conflict fall into two parts: during the reign of Henry II the Angevins maintained
     and expanded their territory thus limiting the growth of French power. After 1189 the absence of
     Richard I on Crusade and the weakness and unpopularity of John allowed Philip II to defeat the
     Angevins and acquire large amounts of their territory for France.

     The result was that France, after 1214, became the most powerful state in Western Europe. Philip II
     greatly increased the power of the French monarchy. England lost large amounts of territory, was
     heavily in debt due to the wars and was in a state of political upheaval, partly as a result of the
     defeats in the war. The barons’ revolt and the Magna Carta were results of the English defeats in
     the wars.

     responses. However, the list is not exhaustive and no set answer is required.

     Examiners and moderators are reminded of the need to apply the markbands that provide the
     “best fit” to the responses given by candidates and to award credit wherever it is possible to do so.

The Crusades 1095–1291

7.   Assess the principal weaknesses of the Crusading movement after 1099.

     The principal weaknesses of the Crusading movement may include: declining support from Europe;
     few European immigrants to the Middle East and general lack of support from European rulers;
     internal disputes in the ruling groups and the Crusader states; the failure of subsequent crusades to
     strengthen or expand the European presence; the growth of Crusading movements inside Europe
     such as the Reconquista, which diverted resources from the Middle East. Disputes over military
     tactics and strategy between the states and powerful groups such as the Templars led to military
     defeats. The breakdown of relations with the Byzantine Empire further weakened the Christian
     presence in the Middle East and the damage to Byzantium during the Fourth Crusade caused a
     further decline in power.

     In addition to the weakness of the Crusading movement, the increased strength and unity of the
     Muslims and the emergence of powerful leaders such as Nur al-Din and Salah al-Din (Saladin), and
     rivals such as the Seljuks diminished their power.

     The above material is an indication of what candidates may elect to write about in their
     responses. However, the list is not exhaustive and no set answer is required.

     Examiners and moderators are reminded of the need to apply the markbands that provide the
     “best fit” to the responses given by candidates and to award credit wherever it is possible to do so.

8.   Assess the significance of two of the following in the Crusading period: Godfrey de Bouillon;
     Richard I; Nur al-Din; Baybars; the Byzantine Empire; theTemplars.

     Godfrey de Bouillon was an important leader in the First Crusade; he led a large contingent of
     knights from his territory in Lorraine; he demonstrated the Crusading spirit by selling a large part of
     his estates to raise funds for the Crusade; he formed part of the military leadership in the Holy
     Land. He led the assault on Jerusalem, and was made head of the Kingdom of Jerusalem in 1099.
     He won the Battle of Ascalon in 1099, which prevented the Muslims from retaking Jerusalem. His
     quarrels with Raymond of Toulouse prevented the Christian takeover of the important naval base at
     Ascalon. His weak personality alienated other leaders and caused dissension in the Kingdom. He
     died in 1100.

     Richard I was the leader of the Third Crusade that attempted to recover Jerusalem, which had been
     lost in 1187. He had some success in recovering territories but failed to recover Jerusalem. He
     conquered Cyprus and added it to the Crusader states. His recovery of Acre allowed trade and
     commerce to thrive, and it became the headquarters for the Crusader states since Jerusalem was not
     recovered. Richard’s quarrel with Philip II may have undermined the Third Crusade and limited its
     success. He was a skilled soldier, but his failure to defeat Salah al-Din (Saladin) was a sign that
     Islam was now in a powerful position, and that the future of the Latin East was doubtful. The
     expenses that he incurred, and the problems caused by his absence from England may have
     discouraged other monarchs from a commitment to the Crusades.

     Nur al-Din was the son of the Turkish atabeg Zangi. He continued the work of his father that
     would culminate in the destruction of the Crusader states through the efforts of his vassal Salah
     al-Din. His goal was to increase his territory in the Islamic world. This involved war against the
     Christians as well as other Muslims. He called for jihad against the West as well as other Muslims.
     The result was a more unified Muslim world which created a severe threat to the West that had
     benefited from Muslim divisions. He took part in the defeat of the Second Crusade, employed
     Salah al-Din to eliminate the Fatimids in Egypt, which further threatened the Crusader States. He
     became the most powerful Muslim leader in the Middle East. On his death he was succeeded by
     Salah al-Din who used this power to defeat the Crusaders and seize Jerusalem.

     Baybars was the Sultan of the Mamluk dynasty after his seizure of power in 1260. He had defeated
     the Mongols at Ayn Jalut. This was significant to the Crusades as it prevented possible alliance
     between the Mongols and the Crusader states, which would have greatly weakened Islam in the
     region. He launched a series of campaigns against the Crusader States and had eliminated them all
     except Acre when he died in 1277. His campaigns made the final collapse of Acre in 1291 an easy
     task for his successors.

     The Byzantine Empire played a very significant role: its appeal for help against the Muslims in the
     11th century helped launch the First Crusade and their assistance made that crusade a success.
     Their aid to the Crusades was reduced after this by quarrels with the West and internal politics. The
     Fourth Crusade attacked and conquered Constantinople in 1204, which weakened the Christian
     forces and tarnished the crusading image. The weakness of the Byzantines after 1204 allowed the
     Muslims to expand their influence and further undermined the Crusader states.

The Knights Templar or Templars were a military religious order formed to defend the Holy
Land and protect pilgrims after the First Crusade. They had an important military role providing
garrisons for many of the Christian castles in the Holy Land. Their fanatical devotion made them a
powerful force to both attack Islam and defend the Crusader states. They were an independent
group, and sometimes refused to act in concert with other Christian forces, and their militancy
caused friction with the Muslims, which led to greater hostilities. They also contributed to the
political divisions that weakened the Crusader states. Their quarrels with other leaders over
military tactics contributed to the defeat of the Crusaders in some instances.

The Mongols 1200–1405

9.   Examine the impact on the Islamic world of either Hülegü (1256–65) or Timur-I-Lang
     (Tamerlane; 1370–1405).

     The impact of Hülegü on the Islamic world may include: he vanquished the Assassins, who had
     formed a powerful and feared organization creating disruption in the Islamic world; he conquered
     and destroyed Baghdad and murdered the caliph. This eliminated Baghdad as the centre of the
     Islamic world and shifted the economic and political focus of Islam. He reduced the Islamic world
     to its weakest condition in centuries. His defeat at Ayn-Jalut meant that the Mamluks were the most
     important power in the Middle East. He destroyed the medieval Iranian state. His influence may be
     seen as temporary as he imposed no new religion on the Islamic world and his son was converted to
     Islam, as were the majority of Mongol leaders.

     The impact of Timur-I-Lang (Tamerlane) may include: he created an enormous empire from
     India to Damascus, but his impact on the Islamic world was largely negative and disruptive. He
     was responsible for the death of millions of people – many of whom were Muslim and the
     destruction of many Islamic cities; he was a Muslim but this did not impede his attacks on other
     Muslim dynasties, cities and individuals. He created a powerful and wealthy state in Central Asia at
     the expense of other Muslim areas. Samarkand became a powerful and wealthy city as a result of
     his conquests.

     It should be noted that his influence was temporary on the Middle East and Turkey, and he did not
     change the long-term political situation, particularly the continued rise of the Ottomans in Anatolia.
     He was a considerable patron of the arts and supported intellectuals in all fields, but this must be
     weighed against the destruction for which he was responsible. His empire ended with his death
     although his descendants established the Mughal dynasty in India.

10.   “The Crusades significantly weakened the Islamic world prior to the Mongol invasion.”
      To what extent do you agree with this statement?

      Candidates must assess the degree to which they believe that the Crusades were responsible for
      weakening the Islamic world prior to the Mongol invasion.

      The reasons that support the statement may include: the Crusaders controlled some Islamic
      territory; struggles against them had created internal divisions that weakened the Islamic world;
      considerable effort in manpower and money had been expended in defeating the Crusaders; Islamic
      trade had been affected by the Italian cities, which were supporting the Crusades; successful
      Muslim leaders who had fought the Crusaders emerged to challenge the central authority of the
      caliphate.

      The reasons that the Crusaders did not cause weakness may include: the Crusaders had largely been
      defeated prior to the Mongol invasions by such leaders as Salah al-Din (Saladin) and Baybars.
      Crusaders controlled little territory by the time of the Mongol invasions; the ally of the Crusaders,
      the Byzantine Empire, had been weakened by the Crusaders themselves and this aided the Islamic
      world. The campaign against the Crusaders had encouraged the emergence of strong leaders and
      increased military power such as the Seljuks and Mamluks who supported Islam.

      Candidates may also point out that the weakness of the Islamic world was caused by factors other
      than the Crusaders. These may include: increased internal conflicts and struggles for power had
      weakened the Islamic world, the financial situation was deteriorating, the caliphs were seen as
      weak, corrupt and unable to maintain a strong administration; many parts of the Islamic world had
      broken away from the Abbasid caliphate, which was weakened as a result.

Muslim, Christian and Jewish interactions in Spain 711–1492

11.   Assess the reasons for the collapse of Umayyad rule in Spain by 1031.

      The reasons for the fall of the Umayyad rule in Spain in 1031 may include: the increases in strength
      of the Christian kingdoms which began to unite in their opposition to the Umayyads. Dynastic
      strife weakened the regime and encouraged tribal conflicts within the Muslim state, increased
      conflict between the Berber immigrants and the Umayyad families in the 11th century and led to a
      disputed succession and civil war. The Berbers allied with the Christians to overthrow the dynasty.
      This allowed the Christians to seize additional territory. The central government lost its legitimacy
      and its territory was seized by local rulers, tribes and military leaders. The Umayyad state dissolved
      in 1031.

12.   “Spain, prior to 1031, was a ‘fascinating Hispano-Arab society’.” To what extent do you
      agree with this statement?

      The reasons that Spain before 1031 may be referred to as a “fascinating Hispano-Arab society” may
      include: the spirit of “convivencia” or coexistence allowed Muslims, Christians and Jews to exist
      and work together in the same society with minimal friction. Religious tolerance was the norm and
      while Islam was preeminent, other faiths were respected. This spirit led to internal peace and
      prosperity, and the tremendous expansion of intellectual and cultural work.
      The integration of Christians and Jews into Islamic society under rulers devoted to economic and
      intellectual progress led to an enormous flowering of human achievement. Umayyad Spain
      was spared sectarian or religious strife, and valued the work of all its citizens. It was a more
      tolerant state than Christian Europe or Muslim North Africa, and profited from its atmosphere of
      tolerance and progress. Examples that would illustrate this “convivencia” were: the use of Arabic
      across different religious groups including Christians and Jews; development of music and cuisine
      that drew from the Arabic and Hispanic traditions; literature and architecture that demonstrated an
      influence.

Emperors and kings 1150–1300

13.   With reference to either Frederick I (1155–90) or Frederick II (1220–50), assess the reasons
      for their difficulty in establishing and maintaining their authority.

      The reasons for Frederick I’s difficulties in establishing and maintaining authority may include:
      he was unable to establish and maintain power in Germany as he was too frequently absent in Italy;
      he lacked the administration to exert control over the feudal nobility in Germany; the power of the
      feudal princes meant that he had to seek their cooperation rather than exercise control over them.
      They maintained large territories and remained independent, and his attempts to control Italy were
      unsuccessful and diverted him from government in Germany. His prestige was reduced by his feud
      with the pope and the loss of public support. Frederick dissipated his energy and wealth in a futile
      attempt to control Italy and the Papacy. This prevented him from expanding and maintaining his
      authority in Germany and, thus, he failed to achieve his goals with respect to the German princes.

      The reasons for Frederick II’s difficulties in establishing and maintaining authority may include:
      he inherited a poor situation in Germany; he had little control of the Church; the princes had
      become more powerful and autonomous; he was focused entirely on Italy and Sicily. In order to
      obtain money and troops from Germany, he was forced to surrender more power to the princes and
      bishops. This limited his ability to exercise effective authority in Germany. In addition, the
      policies of his son in Germany alienated the nobility and forced Frederick to grant further
      concessions to them in order to maintain peace and their support for his wars. His Italian
      campaigns were constant and expensive as were his struggles with the Papacy. His taxation policy
      alienated the Italian cities and his attempts to control Italy resulted in a series of unsuccessful wars.

      His obsession with Italy and control of the Papacy bankrupted him, and weakened his control in
      Germany while failing to achieve his goal of controlling the Papacy and the Italian cities.

14.   “Military power was the most important factor in the success of Edward I (1272–1307) in
      establishing his authority.” To what extent do you agree with this statement?

      Candidates must determine to what extent Edward I’s power was the result of his military power
      and how much came from his non-military qualities and policies. Edward is well-known for his
      wars in Scotland, Wales and France, which extended his power and territory. The impression may
      be that he was essentially a warrior king whose military power was the basis of his authority.

      Candidates may note his military power and reputation as being important for the image of a king at
      this time. His success in wars gave him respect and authority, and an appearance of power essential
      for a monarch. However, his wars also limited his powers as he was forced to seek the support of
      parliament for additional taxes. The acceptance of the principle of the necessity of parliamentary
      consent for taxation limited the king’s power. His need for money to fund wars also led him into a
      feud with the Church, which created opposition to him.

      Candidates should also note that his authority was based on a comprehensive set of fiscal and legal
      policies that extended both his authority and that of the royal administration. Through a series of
      statutes, Edward reformed the feudal system to ensure that all rights and powers due to the monarch
      were identified and enforced; he increased his revenue by strict collection of all fees and dues
      owing to the crown. He increased revenues through exercise of customary taxation and eliminated
      waste and corruption in the bureaucracy. He restored order in England after the civil war, and
      improved the common law and the administration of justice by statute and through parliament. His
      reform of the law gave greater authority to the central government, and his use of parliament gained
      him widespread support for his reforms. He established a strong national justice system and the
      concept of a powerful central government as the normal governing structure as opposed to the
      feudal system.

      responses. However, the list is not exhaustive and no set answer is required.

Late medieval political crises 1300–1485

15.   Assess the results of the Anglo-French war (1415–53) in either England or France.

      Candidates must address the results of the war in either England or France. Responses must be
      well-structured and supported by relevant content.

      The results of the war in England may include: the rule of Henry V at the beginning of this period
      was one of success, power, wealth, and national pride in England. The impact of the war would be
      judged to be very positive up to 1422. After 1422, the impact of the war may include: political
      divisions increased between those in favour of continuing the war and those interested in seeking a
      peace; the public became increasingly resentful of taxation to support the war; government finances
      were drained by the war; French victories increased the divisions at the English court; war between
      noble families was more widespread; the loss of territories in France produced resentment against
      the king and his ministers. War losses created a decline in English trade which reduced economic
      growth and alienated the merchants and workers. A result of the burdens of the war was Cade’s
      rebellion in 1450. The loss of the war in France made the government seem weak and the divisions
      and rivalries at court created by the war and peace factions were a major cause of the Wars of the
      Roses.

      England lost all its territory in France except Calais. The country was now much weaker due to
      financial strains, territorial loss and internal divisions leading to civil war.

      The impact of the war in France can be seen in two parts. Up until 1429, the impact of the war in
      France may include: huge territorial losses, including Paris, to the English; widespread devastation,
      poverty and famine amongst the population, weak and divided government; all as a result of
      constant defeat in warfare. After 1429 the impact of the war was more positive and may include:
      France was more successful in the war and began to regain territory; patriotism and support of the
      king increased, partially through the efforts and legacy of Joan of Arc; major reforms increased the
      wealth and military power of the French government; a standing army was created to provide
      defence and eliminate the gangs of former soldiers who had ravaged the countryside for many
      years. The military success allowed the crown to raise taxes and exercise greater control of the
      Church and its revenues. French trade and prosperity increased as a result of the reforms brought
      about by a powerful monarch.

      France recovered all of her territory except Calais and became the most powerful state in Europe at
      the time.

16.   Examine the reasons for, and the results of, the deposition of Edward II (1307–27) as King of
      England.

      The reasons for the deposition of Edward II may include: long-term causes based on the reign of
      Edward I. His reign had caused great resentment due to higher taxation, struggles between the King
      and the House of Commons and the nobility’s hostility to the king’s attempts to reduce their
      privileges and increase their taxes. In addition, an unsuccessful war was in progress against
      Scotland when Edward II came to power. There had been growing anger at the attempts by the
      crown, during the reign of Edward I, to increase its power at the expense of the nobles and the
      Commons. A desire to reduce or control royal authority was developing.

      The short term causes of the deposition of Edward II may include: the king was seen as weak and a
      financially irresponsible administrator; the influence of his favourite, Piers Gaveston, caused great
      opposition amongst the nobility; his military failures in Scotland and Ireland caused a lack of
      confidence. His failure in the war against France in 1323 was another cause of opposition. He had
      numerous struggles with the nobility in which he sought to increase his authority over them, but
      succeeded only in increasing their dislike and mistrust of him. His wife organized a rebellion
      against him that proved to be very popular. The king was deposed and executed in 1327.

      The results of the deposition of Edward II may include: Edward III became king in 1330. He was a
      popular monarch whose success restored the image and power of the monarchy to some degree, but
      he was forced to accept the need to consult parliament on tax issues, and to placate and control
      powerful members of the nobility. The longer term effects were to reduce respect for the monarchy
      and establish the idea that kings could be overthrown if they were unpopular. The nobility gained
      in power and confidence, and sought to limit the king’s authority. This would lead to further
      conflicts and internal struggles as the monarchy sought to increase power and the nobles to resist
      the change. An example would be the overthrow of Richard II. Parliament also became more
      important as the overthrow of a king meant that his power was limited and could be challenged if he
      sought to rule autocratically.

      responses. However, the list is not exhaustive and no set answer is required.

14th century famine, pestilence and social change

17.   Examine the political and socio-economic consequences of environmental disaster and
      demographic collapse in 14th century medieval Europe.

      The consequences of the demographic collapse and environmental disaster are social, political and
      economic in nature. They may include: political consequences such as anger at the inability of
      officials to alleviate suffering and famine; resentment about the continuing enforcement of taxes
      and feudal dues in times of hardship; uprisings and revolts because of these issues, and a desire to
      vent anger about the effects of the disasters; the economic consequences involved population
      decline, labour shortage, depopulation of farming communities, migration to towns in search of
      work. The manorial system fell into crisis due to lack of labour, wages rose and landlords struggled
      to find labour and collect rents. Agriculture began to change from the traditional manorial system
      to commercial farming based on the payment of rents. Labour shortages caused a move to stock-
      raising from agriculture, and the removal of peasants from the land. The economy became more
      modern and commercial in nature and less traditional.

      Social consequences would include a move to urban areas, increased status and wealth for peasants,
      wealth for those remaining on the land, traditional institutions such as feudalism and the Church
      were less respected.

18.   Assess the principal reasons for popular insurrections during the 14th century in medieval
      Europe.

      The reasons for popular insurrections in the 14th century may include: the famines in the early part
      of the century had caused unrest and revolts against rulers and landowners who refused to reduce
      the burdens on peasants despite their suffering; the inability of governments or the Church to
      alleviate suffering due to famine or plague was another cause of unrest. The effects of constant
      warfare such as destruction, death, and higher taxes to support armies was a significant issue
      throughout the century and contributed to revolts, including the peasants’ revolts in England and
      France.

      The deaths caused by the Black Death led to anger against institutions such as the Church, and
      governments that had failed to explain or prevent them, it also led to widespread violence against
      various groups in society such as lepers and Jews that contributed to a general mood of unrest.

      Government legislation to limit the rights of peasants such as the Statute of Labourers was a cause
      of unrest as it frustrated the rising expectations of peasants who sought to prosper and escape the
      manorial system after the Black Death, when the decline in population made labour scarce and more
      valuable.

      Criticism of the Church and religious opposition movements, such as the Lollards also contributed
      to unrest and rebellion in the populace.

      Weak governments in France due to defeat in war, as well as a boy king in England, encouraged
      revolts and unrest.

The Ottomans 1281–1566

19.   Assess the reasons for the rise of the Ottomans prior to 1453.

      The reasons for the rise of the Ottomans may include: their military skills allowed them to conquer
      neighbouring tribes and territories; they had three very capable leaders in the 14th century, each of
      who continued their conquests; their success attracted more supporters and their power grew as a
      result; their opponents, such as the Byzantine Empire, were declining in strength; the Balkans were
      dissolved in civil war and could be conquered by a powerful force. The Ottomans were welcomed
      by inhabitants of the Balkans who saw them as less oppressive. This added great territory and
      wealth to support further conquest. The new populations provided additional troops for the army.
      The Ottomans were also progressive in adopting new weapons and military tactics, which assisted
      them in defeating opponents and increasing their lands. The Ottomans were also fortunate in that
      the invasion of Timur-I-Lang (Tamerlane) was temporary and did not destroy their power base.

      The above material is an indication of what candidates may elect to write about in their
      responses. However, the list is not exhaustive and no set answer is required.

      “best fit” to the responses given by candidates and to award credit wherever it is possible to do so.


20.   Examine the reasons for, and the results of, the Ottoman victory over the Mamluks.

      The reasons for the Ottoman victory over the Mamluks may include: the destruction caused by the
      invasion of Timur-I-Lang (Tamerlane) weakened their military strength; their economic strength
      was reduced by a series of natural disasters in agriculture. In addition, the Mamluk economy was
      damaged by the entry of the Portuguese into the spice trade, which diverted revenues from Egyptian
      markets and reduced tax revenues; in addition, Mamluk vessels in the Red Sea and Indian Ocean
      were attacked, and this further undermined their economy. Ottoman strength was increasing as they
      continued to expand their empire. The Mamluks failed to adopt new military technology, while the
      Ottomans were leaders in this area. The Mamluks had no allies as the Ottomans had defeated all
      other powers in the Middle East.

      The results of the defeat were the inclusion of Syria and Egypt into the Ottoman Empire. The
      Ottomans increased their trade with Europe, and their navy now entered the Red Sea where they
      were in conflict with the Portuguese. The Ottomans used their conquest of Egypt to expand their
      control to include all of North Africa. Ottoman control of the trade and commerce through Egypt
      and the Red Sea increased their wealth.

      The Mamluks were not eliminated by the Ottomans, but became their vassals and continued to rule
      their former territories under Ottoman leaders.

Renaissance government and society in Italy 1300–1500
21.   Assess the significance of two of the following in the Renaissance period: Ludovico Sforza;
      Lorenzo de Medici; Julius II; Cesare Borgia.
      Candidates must choose two of the individuals listed in the question and explain their significance
      in the Renaissance period.
      The significance of the contribution of Ludovico Sforza may include: he increased the prosperity
      of Milan through agriculture, canals, and greater support for trade and manufacture; he was a patron
      of Leonardo da Vinci and other artists as he sought to develop the prestige of Milan; he made
      alliances with Florence and Naples to reduce wars and provide security against invasions. Milan
      reached new heights of wealth, culture and stability; however he was not able to prevent the class
      struggles between the merchants and the nobility. This meant that rival groups would welcome
      outside forces to help resolve the power struggle. Sforza was deposed, and Milan conquered by a
      French invasion; its independence and prosperity were destroyed by 1525.
      The significance of the contribution of Lorenzo de Medici may include: he was the foremost
      patron of the arts during the Renaissance, and Florence became its capital; he supported academics
      through the University of Pisa and the Platonic academy. His aim was to be the most glorious of
      the Medici, to which end he spent vast sums on all forms of the arts. His absolute rule was a model
      for the ideas of Machiavelli in The Prince and he was a model of the Renaissance man with a very
      wide range of interests. De Medici was not an able ruler, and left Florence financially weak and
      militarily unprepared. This led to the loss of its position shortly after his death.
      The significance of the contribution of Julius II may include: he was an extraordinary patron of
      the arts and employed Raphael and Michelangelo to create some of the great works of the
      Renaissance; he worked diligently to increase the independence and power of the Church, and
      fought against rulers who tried to usurp the authority of the Church; he led papal armies to defeat
      invaders, and establish the temporal power of the Church – he waged war against Venice to recover
      lost papal territories as well as other states that he sought to add to these territories. Julius II was
      not interested in religious matters, but typified the secular interest of the Renaissance as well as a
      desire for grandeur and display. His concentration on secular power and opulence at the expense of
      spirituality contributed to the criticisms of the Church in the Reformation period.
      Cesare Borgia was a vigorous and unscrupulous despot celebrated by Machiavelli in The Prince.
      He became a model for the new type of despot and governments emerging from the Renaissance.
      He also typifies the violence of the Renaissance period with constant warfare amongst cities and
      powerful families; the fact that he was the son of the pope was a symbol to some of the decadence
      and moral decay of the Church in the Renaissance period.

      responses. However, the list is not exhaustive and no set answer is required.

22.   Assess the reasons for the importance of the Italian city states during the Renaissance.

      The reasons for the influential position of Italian city states may include: the enormous wealth they
      gained from trade and industry allowed them to support large numbers of artists, philosophers, and
      writers who dominated the Renaissance; their traditions of civic organization gave them strong
      governments, which maintained their wealth and power. The control of key trading routes, the
      spice trade with the Ottomans, and the merchant and naval fleets that they possessed gave them
      enormous influence in European commerce. Their links to the classical traditions and their history
      of scholarship in the universities increased their prestige and influence in intellectual and scholarly
      circles. Their progressive and secular ideas based on the power of the urban merchant classes were
      a force for change and the elimination of old ideas that so typified the Renaissance. The lack of a
      powerful ruler who could control Italy allowed them to develop their power and add territories.
      Their long traditions of independence and resistance to the rule of powerful monarchs increased
      their status and ability to influence events. They were able to maintain large armed forces to defend
      their interests against internal and external enemies for much of the Renaissance period. Their
      rivalry during the Renaissance period served to inspire them to new achievements in all areas of
      endeavour.

New horizons: exploration 1400–1550

23.   Analyse the impact of Western exploration and expansion on the Islamic world.

      There is clear difference of opinion on the impact of Western expansion on the Islamic world.
      Candidates may show that while there was an impact, the degree of that impact is open to debate.

      Areas of impact may include: Western attacks on Muslim trading ships in the Indian Ocean and
      Asia reduced the wealth and power of Muslim traders; Western settlements in Asia prevented the
      spread of Islam and established Christian missions to increase Western power, Western forts and
      settlements in Asia attacked and destroyed Muslim settlements. Muslim trade in spices was
      reduced as Western states gained their own supplies. Wealth obtained from trade made Western
      states stronger and allowed them to challenge the Ottomans particularly in the Mediterranean. The
      determination of Western states to expand Christianity would limit Islamic expansion and in some
      cases destroy established Islamic outposts.

      It can also be argued that the impacts were limited as the power of the Ottoman state was not
      affected in the 15th and 16th centuries; Western expansion to the Americas was of minimal
      importance to the Islamic world. Western states were in conflict with each other as much as with
      the Islamic world and therefore, they were not able to create significant opposition to the Islamic
      world.

24.   Assess the significance of the fall of Constantinople as a major cause of the movement of
      Western exploration and expansion.

      This question deals with the motives of the West for a movement of exploration and expansion.
      Candidates must assess to what extent the fall of Constantinople in 1453 was a motive for this
      movement.

      The influence of the fall of Constantinople on exploration may include: the trade in spices was in
      danger of being cut off by a hostile Islamic state; Mediterranean trade would be limited or destroyed
      by the advance of Islam thus forcing Western states to seek wealth elsewhere. Christian hopes of
      expanding in the Middle East were now impossible and Christian expansion would have to seek
      new territories to convert. The strength of the Ottomans was a serious physical and psychological
      blow to Christian states, and they were desperate to find territories and allies to help stem the
      Islamic expansion.

      Many students may challenge the idea that the fall of Constantinople played a significant part in
      Western expansion; the reasons may include: the expansion move had begun long before with the
      Portuguese moves into Africa in search of gold: the work of Henry the Navigator long pre-dates
      1453. Western expansion was also the result of a desire for greater wealth, which could be gained
      from foreign territories such as Africa and Asia. The Ottomans and Italians had dominated trade
      with the east, and many Western states sought to break this monopoly by direct contact with the
      spice producers – religion played little part in their ideas. Desire for personal wealth and fame
      influenced the work of many explorers such as Columbus, Cortés and Pizarro. They were not much
      influenced by the fall of Constantinople. Expansion was possible because of dramatic advances in
      cartography, navigation and ship design, without which expansion would not have occurred despite
      the fall of Constantinople.

      Many states engaged in expansion: England, Portugal and Spain were not entirely concerned with
      the Mediterranean and were expanding to the Americas, where Islam was not an issue. Simple
      greed and desire for commercial profit may be seen as the most powerful determining factor for
      exploration and expansion. Expanding Christianity to new territories not open to Islam was also a
      motive.
