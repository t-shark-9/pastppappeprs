1.   (a)   Why, according to Source A, did the Soviet Union decide to invade
           Afghanistan?                                                                   [3 marks]

           • To save the Afghan revolution from being defeated;
           • Fear of a possible massive American military presence in the region if the Afghan
             revolution was defeated because such a presence would threaten the Soviet Union’s
             border security;
           • If the Soviet Union did not make this difficult decision then it would cease to be a
             great power;
           • The Soviet Union could take action as it was “legal”;
           • If they did not invade it would be a disgrace and a betrayal.

     Award [1 mark] for each relevant point up to a maximum of [3 marks].

     (b)   What is the message conveyed by Source E?                                      [2 marks]

           • The caption “Athlete’s Foot” and/or the “Afghanistan” bandage on Brezhnev’s foot
             imply that the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan has wounded Brezhnev and the Soviet
             Union and/or damaged the country in international affairs;
           • The track made of skulls represents the huge death toll from the Soviet war in
             Afghanistan;
           • The empty stands and/or Brezhnev running alone symbolize the boycott of the
             Olympic Games and/or represent the disapproval of the US and some other Western
             nations;
           • The hammer and sickle emblem waved by a smiling Misha (the bear mascot)
             suggests that Moscow attempted to use the Olympics to promote a positive image of
             Communism;
           • The soldier with the starting pistol suggests a military influence on events.

     Award [1 mark] for each relevant point up to a maximum of [2 marks].
                                             –4–            M14/3/HISTX/BP1/ENG/TZ0/S3/M


2.   Compare and contrast the views expressed in Sources C and D about the
     impact of the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan on foreign relations.               [6 marks]

     For “compare”
     • Both suggest that the US withdrew support for the Strategic Arms Limitation Talks
       (SALT) II treaty and increased arms/defence spending;
     • Both suggest that Carter imposed trade sanctions and/or embargoes against the Soviet
       Union;
     • Both discuss the US boycott of the Olympic Games in Moscow;
     • Both imply that the decision to invade Afghanistan was indicative of the Soviet Union’s
       lack of effective leadership and of poor strategy and/or both sources imply that the USSR
       was losing power or in decline.

     For “contrast”
     • Source C says that America’s allies did not see the need to abandon détente whereas D
       implies that the US abandoned détente by withdrawing SALT II and/or imposing sanctions;
     • Source C explains that other Western nations picked up the trade deals with the Soviet
       Union that the US had dropped, but Source D does not discuss the consequences of the US
       trade sanctions;
     • Source D only mentions the US announcement of a boycott of the Olympics whereas
       Source C considers the outcome of the boycott and says that the majority of nations
       ignored it;
     • Source C says that detente was damaged by the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan whereas
       Source D says that detente was already a failure because it did not prevent the Soviet
       invasion;
     • Source D claims the USSR entered Afghanistan using force to ‘save socialism’ whereas
       Source C claims it had done so at the request of the Afghan government.

     Do not demand all of the above. If only one source is discussed award a maximum of
     [2 marks]. If the two sources are discussed separately award [3 marks] or with excellent
     linkage [4–5 marks]. For maximum [6 marks] expect a detailed running comparison/contrast.
     Award up to [5 marks] if two sources are linked/integrated in either a running comparison
     or contrast.

3.   With reference to their origin and purpose, assess the value and limitations
     of Source B and Source D for historians studying the domestic and foreign
     problems of the Brezhnev era.                                                             [6 marks]

     Source B
     Origin:        This is an extract from President Jimmy Carter’s speech to the US Congress on 23
                    January 1980 about Afghanistan.

     Purpose:       The purpose of the speech is for Carter to report to the US Congress about the
                    American response to the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan, to outline future US
                    policy and to warn the USSR against encroaching into the region.

     Value:         This speech is delivered by the President of the US who leads the government,
                    therefore, it may be a valuable source for a historian to identify how the US
                    government interpreted Soviet actions, the US government’s fears, the US
                    government’s sense of outrage and the way the US government intended to
                    respond. It gives an insight into the public and/or official response of the US at
                    the time of the invasion.

     Limitations:   The limitations for a historian are that this speech only gives the US government’s
                    perspective about the situation and it may be a form of propaganda. Moreover, its
                    origin suggests it is intended for the general public so it might not give insight into
                    complex details. Carter may want to appear to be a strong leader who takes a
                    tough Cold War stance. The speech is a statement of intent rather than an outline
                    of what the US actually did. There is a lack of hindsight.

     Source D
     Origin:        This source is from The Cold War by John Lewis Gaddis, a professor of
                    History at Yale University, published in the US in 2005.

     Purpose:       To present an overview of the Cold War from an academic perspective and
                    to inform his students and a general readership about the significance of the
                    various events.

     Value:         Gaddis is a professor of History at Yale and a Cold War specialist. The book was
                    published in 2005 and therefore he may have had access to the Soviet archives.
                    Sufficient time has passed since the end of the Cold War and this allows for the
                    benefit of hindsight and reflection.

     Limitations:   Gaddis is a professor at Yale in the US, therefore he may have a Western
                    perspective about the Cold War. The book is an overview of the whole Cold War
                    and only a small part of it is focussed on the invasion of Afghanistan and Soviet
                    foreign policy.

     Do not expect all of the above. Ideally, there will be a balance between the two sources, and each
     one can be marked out of [3 marks], but allow a [4/2 marks] split. If only one source is assessed,
     mark out of [4 marks]. For a maximum of [6 marks] candidates must refer to both origin
     and purpose, and value and limitations.

4.   Using the sources and your own knowledge, to what extent do you
     agree that the invasion of Afghanistan was not in the Soviet Union’s
     best interests?                                                                      [8 marks]

     Source material
     Source A:    This source claims that if the counter-revolution in Afghanistan succeeded this
                  would be against the Soviet Union’s vital interests because it could lead to a
                  large US military presence along the Soviet border. Therefore the invasion of
                  Afghanistan was necessary to secure the Soviet Union’s security. However,
                  Source A also acknowledges that the invasion was internationally unpopular.

     Source B:     This source shows the US’s hostile response and, according to Carter, the
                   opposition of most countries to the Soviet Union’s invasion of Afghanistan.
                   Carter outlines a number of penalties, such as trade sanctions and a boycott of
                   the Moscow Olympics. Carter calls on other countries to join in these. He
                   implies that the Soviet Union will suffer economically and politically as a
                   result of the invasion of Afghanistan. Carter also threatened to use military
                   force to protect the US’s regional interests.

     Source C:     This source states that the US was mistaken in its belief that the invasion was
                   part of a plan for Soviet domination of the Persian Gulf region and this belief
                   led the US: to call for trade sanctions; to withdraw its support for SALT II;
                   to increase its military spending; to boycott the Moscow Olympics.
                   This source also shows that the Soviet Union’s relations with other
                   Western countries were not damaged significantly, because the allies of the US
                   stepped into the void created by the US’s economic sanctions and many
                   countries ignored the US’s request for a boycott of the Moscow Olympics.

     Source D:     This source shows the failure of détente. In January 1980 Carter withdrew
                   SALT II, placed embargoes on grain and technology, requested increased
                   defence spending and announced a US boycott of the Moscow Olympic
                   Games. Also this source states that the invasion of Afghanistan alienated the
                   Soviet Union’s economic benefactors, thus damaging the Soviet Union’s
                   economy, and that it was the outcome of an absence of strategic thinking.
                   Detente had concealed the USSR’s difficulties.

     Source E:     The graphic shows that the Soviet Union damaged itself by the invasion of
                   Afghanistan and that it was a burden, symbolised by the bandage on
                   Brezhnev’s right foot. It suggests the Soviet Union had little support in the
                   world and this is indicated by the empty seats in the stadium. The skulls over
                   which Brezhnev is running symbolise the huge casualties as a result of the war.

     Own knowledge
     The intervention could be viewed to be ‘in the best interests’ of the USSR as it had invested in
     Afghanistan, and had sent aid and military assistance to the government. The USSR believed
     that the regime of Amin and reports of increased CIA involvement were a threat. In addition,
     the Islamic revolution in Iran was a concern for the USSR as they did not want it to spread
     through its own central Asian Republics.

     However, the invoking of the Brezhnev Doctrine damaged Soviet relations with neighbouring
     countries such as Iran, Pakistan and China. They condemned the invasion and resolutions to
                                         –7–             M14/3/HISTX/BP1/ENG/TZ0/S3/M


this effect were passed in the United Nations General Assembly. The US gave military aid to
the rebel forces in Afghanistan and allowed the CIA to conduct covert operations. The Soviet
military did not have clear objectives and by 1982 the Soviet leadership realised that it was
involved in a war that it could not win, but it refused to acknowledge this and withdraw. A
diplomatic solution was not sought either. The war proved to be very unpopular with the
Soviet people and became the Soviet Union’s ‘Vietnam’. The human cost of the war was
damaging, with approximately 15,000 Soviets and more than a million Afghans killed. It also
led to internal unrest amongst Muslims in the Soviet Union. The military expenditure,
estimated at $8 billion per annum, made the economic problems in the USSR worse.
Brezhnev died in 1982 and he was succeeded by Andropov who was unable to solve the
economic problems despite his cuts in government spending. These problems paved the way
for Gorbachev who recognised the need for radical change and that withdrawal from
Afghanistan was in the best interests of the USSR.

Do not expect all the above and accept other relevant material. If only source material or own
knowledge is used the maximum mark that can be obtained is [5 marks]. For maximum
[8 marks] expect argument, synthesis of source material and own knowledge, as well as
references to the sources used.
