1.    Analysis of external examination grades by an international school

      Students from an international school sit end-of-course exams, which are set by the Oneto7
      examination board. The Oneto7 examination board has a secure site from which schools may then
      download their exam results. The international school uses a spreadsheet to analyse the results.

      The results are downloaded as CSV files and are then imported into a spreadsheet showing the data,
      as in Sheet 1.  The CSV files contain data about individual candidates and the final grade awarded for
      each subject.

            Sheet 1: Examination grades imported from the CSV file provided by the examination board.

      The school uses this information to carry out statistical analyses and to create graphs.


      (a)     (i)   Identify two characteristics of a CSV file.                                                                                 [2]

		(ii)              Identify two reasons why the Oneto7 examination board would provide files in
                    CSV format.                                                                                                                 [2]

		(iii) Identify two characteristics of a “secure site”.                                                                                        [2]

(Question 1 continued)

      The previous headmaster used a database application designed by the IT department in the school that
      allowed him to list students with certain marks and create specific reports.


                                       Analysis of external exam results

                             Data handling                       Reports

                                   Add new student                    By student

                                   Update marks                        By subject



      The present headmaster would like to analyse the results in more detail. This may include information
      such as:
       all the students who got 7 in their Spanish exam
       the average grade of the students
       charts to compare different subjects.


      (b)   Schools can use either spreadsheets or database software to analyse these exam results.

            Analyse the use of these two software types for this purpose.                              [6]

      (c)   Oneto7, an examination board that serves 5000 schools, has been contacted by a
            new company, schoolscompare.com. This company, schoolscompare.com, wishes to buy
            the data about students’ results from the Oneto7 examination board.

            Schools, parents and others can pay schoolscompare.com for a more detailed analysis of
            the examination results.  This analysis will be provided using data bought from Oneto7,
            as well as other data they have acquired.

            Discuss the implications of the Oneto7 examination board selling the data it holds about
            the schools to schoolscompare.com.                                                         [8]

                                                    –4–                  M14/3/ITGSX/HP1/ENG/TZ0/XX

2.    Online training

      Fernando Garcia is a mining engineer based in La Paz, Bolivia.   His company has a subscription
      to a training company that provides online streaming of interactive videos as a service for mining  
      companies.  As part of his job, he needs to use these videos to train his staff.

      The training company has offered to provide certificates for the participants in the online training but
      they have to complete the online modules first.  These modules have an evaluation area where trainees
      are required to answer questions related to the videos and participate in discussion forums.

      However, most of the work of Fernando’s company is carried out in the Andes mountains, a few hours
      from La Paz, where internet access can be poor at times.

      A colleague informed Fernando that it is possible to download the videos from the training company
      website using lossy compression.   He has downloaded these interactive training videos while in
      La Paz, so that he and his staff can use the videos when they are in the mountains.

      The first video Fernando downloaded had a file size of 720 MB and he used a service with a
      bandwidth of 800 kb/sec (kilobits per second).


      (a)   (i)   Calculate the length of time it took to download the 720 MB video.                      [2]

		(ii)            Outline the difference between lossless and lossy compression.                          [2]

		(iii) Outline the difference between downloading and streaming videos.                                  [2]

      (b)   Compare the use of online evaluation tasks versus face-to-face evaluation tasks to assess
            the skills the trainees may have learned with the training videos.                            [6]

      (c)   Evaluate Fernando’s decision to download the videos and use them to train his staff in
            the Andes.                                                                                    [8]

3.    Energy efficient data centres

      The Green Grid is an association of IT professionals seeking to raise the energy efficiency of
      data centres.

      Even though companies like Amazon, Google, Facebook and Apple are becoming more
      energy efficient, they are still using large amounts of energy.  Consumers are not aware that constant
      uploading and downloading of large files stores large amounts of information on many data centres.  
      Consumers also expect instant access to these files; this requires the servers and data centres to be
      permanently active.

      It is estimated that the total of the world’s data storage is in the region of 300 exabytes (300 million
      terabytes).  It is believed much of this data is redundant.


      (a)   (i)   Define the term terabyte.                                                               [1]

		(ii)            Identify three features/characteristics of data centres that make them consume
                  large amounts of energy.                                                                [3]

		(iii) Identify two ways that data redundancy may occur in data centres.                                 [2]

      (b)   Some governments have decided that data centres will be charged for their environmental
            impact.   This may be done by monitoring the volume of data stored and the energy
            consumed to maintain the data centre.

		          Analyse this decision.                                                                        [6]

      (c)   ORM, a large company, is expanding and the managers are concerned that their IT systems
            will need an expensive upgrade to be able to manage the increasing amount of data held
            by the company.  The company is considering moving all of its data to an external data
            centre and relying on their services to store and provide access to this data.

            Discuss whether ORM should move all of its data to a data centre.                             [8]

4.    Project management at Larssons

      Larssons is a company that produces chips for embedded systems.  Larssons has factories in China
      and Korea with research, development, and sales offices in the UK and US.   The management
      of Larssons has decided that the company needs to commission an information system that can
      keep track of research and development operations across the world and be accessible from all
      their locations.  They have decided to recruit developers in Vietnam and India to write the code.

      The consultants recommend that a formal methodology such as PRINCE2 should be used in order
      to organize the stages of the project development.

      A project manager is appointed who is a certified PRINCE2 practitioner.  He starts by producing a
      project initiation document.

      To ensure that the project is completed on time and within budget, the project manager must liaise
      with all the appropriate stakeholders such as the:
       Information Systems Manager at Larssons
       factory managers
       hardware and software suppliers
       end-users
       programmers/developers.


      (a)   (i)   State three items that will be included in the project initiation document.             [3]

		(ii)            Identify three responsibilities of the Information Systems Manager.                     [3]

      (b)   Explain three problems that may arise if a project does not make use of a properly
            designed project methodology such as PRINCE2.                                                 [6]

      (c)   Project managers need a range of skills, including technical IT skills, to ensure a project
            is completed on time and within budget.

            To what extent is a project manager’s technical knowledge critical to the success of the
            projects they manage?                                                                         [8]

5.    Updating Top Dog’s information system

      The owners of Top Dog Veterinary Practice, a chain of 20 clinics, have been using an information
      system for many years to manage data about customers, animals, accounts and salaries.  They have
      decided that it is time to replace it with a new one.


      (a)   (i)   Identify three reasons why the Top Dog owners have decided that it is time to
                  replace their old information system.                                                [3]

		(ii)            Identify three tasks that might need to be performed during the implementation
                  of the new information system.                                                       [3]

      (b)   The project manager is considering either direct changeover or phased changeover for
            the implementation of the new information system for Top Dog Veterinary Practice.  
            Analyse these options.                                                               [6]

      (c)   Many companies now outsource their IT provision.   This may involve handing over
            responsibility for the running and maintenance of the information system to a cloud
            computing provider.

            To what extent would it be advantageous for Top Dog Veterinary Practice to outsource its
            information system to a cloud computing provider?                                          [8]

6.    Expert systems in health care

      Doctors, such as Dr James, working in busy city hospitals sometimes use expert systems in order to
      help make an initial assessment of their patient’s condition.  When Dr James begins talking with a
      patient, she inputs the patient’s details into the expert system. These include:
       age

7.    Robots in war

      Unmanned aerial vehicles, often known as drones, are pilotless aircraft that are operated from a
      remote location. Drones equipped with bombs and missiles have been used hundreds of times to
      target specific military objectives. More pilots are being trained to operate drones than conventional
      fighter aircraft.

      Drones navigate by using GPS, but they can also make use of various ground-based signals such
      as from radio, cell (mobile) phones or Wi-Fi. High resolution images of terrain can be relayed to
      the operator.

      Artificial intelligence is used in battlefield computer games to produce the illusion of intelligence in
      the behaviour of game characters. This allows the game player to adapt their behaviour to that of the
      game’s characters. Soldiers are now trained using battlefield computer games.

      In the air, on land and at sea, the use of military robots such as drones is increasing rapidly. As robots
      become more autonomous and able to make decisions, identifying a human to be held accountable
      for an incident such as killing innocent civilians will become very difficult. Should it be the robot’s
      programmer, designer, manufacturer, the drone operator or his superiors who is accountable?


      (a)   (i)    Define the term artiﬁcial intelligence.                                                                 [2]

            (ii)   Identify the steps that could be taken by the drone to identify a target.                               [4]

      (b)   Analyse the decision to train soldiers using battlefield computer games.                                       [6]

      (c)   To what extent is it acceptable in war that robots should be able to make their own
            decisions?                                                                                                     [8]
