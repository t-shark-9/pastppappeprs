Answer one question. The answer must refer to both theoretical perspectives and theory/schools of
thought in anthropology and their application to specific and clearly identified ethnographic illustrations.
Each question is worth [20 marks].

1.    Compare and contrast the work of two anthropologists in relation to one of the following:

      • cohesion-centred perspective
      • idealist perspective
      • structure-centred perspective.


2.    Evaluate how an agency-centred perspective has contributed to the understanding of the relationship
      between the individual and society.


3.    Examine how one of the following helps us understand contemporary issues:

      • particularistic perspective
      • materialist perspective
      • conflict-centred perspective.


4.    Examine the work of one anthropologist or one school of thought with regard to the differences
      between synchronic and diachronic perspectives.


5.    Discuss the claim that anthropology must adopt a universalistic perspective if it is to contribute to our
      understanding of the social and cultural world.
