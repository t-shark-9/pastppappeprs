Microeconomics

1.   (a)     Explain three factors that could lead to an increase in demand for
             cigarettes.                                                                  [10 marks]

             Answers may include:
             • definition of demand
             • diagram showing a rise in the demand for cigarettes
             • an explanation of three of the possible factors that could increase the
               demand for cigarettes such as a rise in consumer income, promotion or
               advertising of cigarettes by producers and population or demographic
               changes
             • examples to support the explanations of a rise in demand for cigarettes.

(b)   “Fiscal policy is the most effective way of bringing an economy out of
      recession.” To what extent is this statement valid?                                 [15 marks]

      N.B. It should be noted that definitions, theory, and examples that have already
      been given in part (a), and then referred to in part (b) should be rewarded.

      Answers may include:
      • definitions of recession and fiscal policy
      • diagram showing an increase in AD
      • an explanation of how expansionary fiscal policy may increase AD
        including the role of automatic stabilizers, the disadvantages of fiscal policy
        and alternative policies a government might use
      • examples of situations when fiscal policy has been used in a recession
      • synthesis or evaluation (to what extent).

      Command term
      “To what extent” requires candidates to consider the merits or otherwise of an
      argument or concept.

      Consideration of the merits of the statement may include: the strengths and
      weaknesses of using fiscal policy in relation to other policies.

      Examiners should be aware that candidates may take a different approach
      which, if appropriate, should be rewarded.

      Opinions or conclusions should be presented clearly and should be supported
      by appropriate examples.
