Complete one of the following tasks. Write 250 to 400 words.

1.    Cultural diversity

      You have been assigned the following topic for your weekly essay: “Although they live in the same
      city, different population groups enjoy different kinds of food”. Write your essay.


2.    Customs and traditions

      During your recent holiday, you came across what seemed to you an unusual custom.
      However, the more you spoke to the local people, the more you understood the reason for
      this custom. Describe and explain this custom in your blog.


3.    Health

      The government department concerned with Health and Safety in your country has banned the
      provision of toothpicks on restaurant tables, as they are considered “dangerous”. As a journalist for
      your local magazine, write an article discussing this recent law.


4.    Leisure

      Your local newspaper has published an editorial that states that too much time, publicity and
      money are spent on celebrations of cinema awards and suggests that these could be better used for
      charitable causes. Write a letter to the editor giving your opinion on this matter.


5.    Science and technology

      Write a set of guidelines for your fellow students who use social media accounts such as Facebook
      or Twitter. This is to be uploaded on the school’s website and will describe ways in which these
      accounts can be useful but will also show how they can be harmful.
