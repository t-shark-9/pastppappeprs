General notes:
 The following are to be considered suggestions rather than prescriptions, that is, all points made by
  candidates to be marked on their merits.
 Any attempt to answer should be acknowledged as such; that should be followed especially in
  translation, when some candidates depart from literal in favour of a more poetic rendition, faithful,
  of course, to the original idea.
 The second use of the same figure of speech to answer a style question should be penalized, by not
  being taken into account: for example, double mention of alliteration.

Genre: Elegiac and Lyric Poetry

           [1 mark] for answers with two major errors (or the equivalent). Otherwise, award no mark.

            Ariadne betrayed her father and facilitated the death of her brother, the Minotaur: patris
             auxilium sperem, quemne ipsa reliqui respersum iuvenem fraterna caede secuta?
            Ariadne characterizes Theseus as coniunx but juxtaposes this with his faithlessness in

     (c)   Accept a range of substantiated answers, awarding [1 mark] each up to four for any point

6.   (a)   Cassius refrained from opposition to the new decrees (nova decreta) in order not to show too
           much bias for tradition (ne nimio amore antiqui moris studium meum extollere viderer); and

           in Rome. Tacitus, as usual, does not express his personal point of view but relates what
           happened with concision and (apparent) impartiality. Accept a range of substantiated
           answers, awarding [1 mark] each up to six for stylistic remarks or any detail such as:
            direct speech (oratio recta); the more remarkable, as it is a senatorial speech
            Cassius’s support of ancient customs and laws (instituta et leges maiorum) is stressed by
              contrast with new decrees (nova decreta)

            juxtapositions (defendet … profuerit; tuebitur … protexerint; feret … advertit).

           Award up to two marks for the coherence and clarity of the argument; [2 marks] if very
           coherent and well-argued; [1 mark] if coherent and well-argued; no marks if incoherent and
           poorly argued or if no details from the text are given.
                                                                                           [12 marks]

           provinciae Baeticae); Massa was condemned (damnatoque Massa); his property was

      (b)   Lucretius draws a comparison between the mind and the (suffering) body [1 mark] in order to
            prove that the mind is mortal [1 mark].

      (c)   Lucretius’s argument is developed as a syllogism, whose three elements should be
            summarized as follows. Whatever produces a change (in the mind or any other substance)
            adds or removes new parts [1 mark]. But what is immortal cannot receive or lose any part
