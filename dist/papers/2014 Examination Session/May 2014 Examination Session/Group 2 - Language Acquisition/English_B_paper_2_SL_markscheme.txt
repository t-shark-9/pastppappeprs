These marking notes give additional information for marking paper 2. When marking the paper,
keep in mind that neither subject specific knowledge nor candidates’ personal opinions, as such,
should be assessed, although Criterion B marks may be influenced by how successfully knowledge
or opinions are handled in the message.

These notes are intended to define the top mark of the scale in this examination. The phrase,
“a good answer”, is intended to refer to scripts which are likely to be placed in the 9 to 10 band
(5 for criterion C) of descriptors. Scripts should be marked proportionately lower to the degree to
which they fail to meet these requirements.

In each case, good answers will meet most, though not necessarily all, of the following requirements.

Word count

At SL, students are required to write a minimum of 250 words. Failure to write the minimum
number of words will result in a [1 mark] penalty under criterion A. There is no penalty for
exceeding 400 words: the whole text should be taken into consideration in the award of marks.

Criterion A – Language

A good answer will have few language gaps, and slips or flaws rarely affect meaning.


 Language
 Not all errors have the same importance, and examiners should bear this in mind. Some errors
 affect the communication of meaning significantly, and others do not. Also, some errors indicate a
 fundamental lack of command of the language, while others may simply indicate a moment of
 forgetfulness.
 SLIPS – mistakes at all levels of difficulty, but erratic and occasional – eg the candidate normally
 forms past tenses well, but occasionally forgets “-ed”
 FLAWS – errors occur more regularly, particularly in certain structures – eg past tenses are
 formed correctly quite often, but are not really reliable, and there may be basic confusions
 (eg past simple versus present perfect)
 GAPS – some structures are rarely correct, or simply don’t appear – eg the past tenses are needed,
 but do not appear.

1.     Cultural diversity

       You have been assigned the following topic for your weekly essay: “Although they live in
       the same city, different population groups enjoy different kinds of food”. Write your
       essay.

       A good answer:

       Criterion B – Message
        will concentrate on the relationship of different kinds of food to different population
         groups, not on cultural diversity in general; responses that are too general should be
         marked down under “relevance”. “Population groups” may be interpreted quite widely, eg
         by age- or gender-groups, not just by cultural groups
        will clearly differentiate between at least two different population groups
        will identify the different kinds of food and may also explain their significance
        will link the two ideas: different parts of the population and different kinds of food
        will use paragraphing and cohesive devices which structure the development of ideas
         effectively.

     Criterion C – Format
       will adopt a semi-formal to formal register
       will have a distinct introduction, development and a conclusion
       will use stylistic devices to enable the reader to follow the argument easily
       will have a title
       may use the first person, provided that the focus is on the substantive issue.
                                                 –5–           M14/2/ABENG/SP2/ENG/TZ0/XX/M



2.     Customs and traditions

       During your recent holiday, you came across what seemed to you an unusual custom.
       However, the more you spoke to the local people, the more you understood the reason
       for this custom. Describe and explain this custom in your blog.

       A good answer:

       Criterion B – Message
        will concentrate on the custom observed, not on customs and traditions in general;
         responses that are too general should be marked down under “relevance”
        will fully and clearly describe the specific custom
        will indicate why it appeared to be unusual
        will clearly explain the reason for the custom
        will include both description and explanation. If only one of the required elements is
         covered, the message should be judged as “partially communicated” (ie no more than [6
         marks])
        will use paragraphing and cohesive devices which structure the development of ideas
         effectively
        may also refer to what has been learned from this experience.

       Criterion C – Format
        will adopt a semi-formal to informal register
        will have an engaging title
        will use first person narration
        will show awareness of the readers, eg through direct address, a lively and interesting style,
         an invitation for comments.
        may have more than one entry.


     N.B. Some limited use of textese (eg 4 for four/for and u for you) and/or emoticons is
     permissible.

3.   Health

     The government department concerned with Health and Safety in your country has
     banned the provision of toothpicks on restaurant tables, as they are considered
     “dangerous”. As a journalist for your local magazine, write an article discussing this
     recent law.

     A good answer:

     Criterion B – Message
      will concentrate on the implications of the recent law banning toothpicks, not on health and
       safety in general; responses that are too general should be marked down under “relevance”
      will present the opinion clearly, whether this is for, or against, or making a balanced
       assessment
      will support the opinion with illustrations, eg relevant examples or personal experience
      will use paragraphing and cohesive devices which structure the development of ideas
       effectively
      may adopt a satirical approach.

     Criterion C – Format
      will adopt a semi-formal to formal register
      will adopt a lively style suitable for an article of this nature
      will have a relevant heading/title
      will have a distinct introduction, development and conclusion
      may use other format features, eg name of author, sub-headings, quotes.
                                              –7–           M14/2/ABENG/SP2/ENG/TZ0/XX/M




4.   Leisure

     Your local newspaper has published an editorial that states that too much time,
     publicity and money are spent on celebrations of cinema awards and suggests that these
     could be better used for charitable causes. Write a letter to the editor giving your
     opinion on this matter.

     A good answer:

     Criterion B – Message
      will concentrate on spending on cinema awards as opposed to charitable causes, not on the
       importance of cinema awards/cinema in general; responses that are too general should be
       marked down under “relevance”
      will cover the money spent on both cinema awards and charitable causes, but equal
       treatment of both aspects is not expected
      will present the opinion clearly, whether this is for, or against, or making a balanced
       assessment
      will support the opinion with illustrations, eg relevant examples
      will refer to the original editorial
      will use paragraphing and cohesive devices which structure the development of ideas
       effectively
      will contain appropriate support for the argument/s
      may also use opposing argument/s for rebuttal purposes.

     Criterion C – Format
      will adopt a semi-formal to formal register
      will adopt a suitably serious tone
      will include appropriately formal greeting and closing salutations
      will adopt a style that engages and interests the reader
      may also include address and date.
                                               –8–           M14/2/ABENG/SP2/ENG/TZ0/XX/M



5.   Science and technology

     Write a set of guidelines for your fellow students who use social media accounts such as
     Facebook or Twitter. This is to be uploaded on the school’s website and will describe
     ways in which these accounts can be useful but will also show how they can be harmful.

     A good answer:

     Criterion B – Message
      will concentrate on the use of social media, not on the use of internet in general; responses
       that are too general should be marked down under “relevance”
      will clearly explain the purpose of the guidelines
      will present both useful and harmful aspects of social media accounts; if only one of the
       required elements is covered, the message should be judged as “partially communicated”
       (ie no more than [6 marks] should be awarded)
      may also make useful suggestions on how to avoid the harmful aspects of social media
      may also illustrate points with personal experiences.


     Criterion C – Format
      will adopt a semi-formal register
      will use an accessible and attractive style suitable for a teenage audience
      will set out the guidelines clearly, eg bullets, subheadings, numbering etc
      will have a title
      may contain contact information for further clarification.
