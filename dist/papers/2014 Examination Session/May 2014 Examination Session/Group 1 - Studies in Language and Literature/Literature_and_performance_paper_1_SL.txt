Answer one question. Refer closely to the novel you have selected to study, a clean copy of which may be
brought into the examination.

1.    Select a passage from a novel you have chosen to study in which the shifting moods of the characters
      involved combine to create a pivotal scene in the narrative. Discuss how you would stage this scene
      for an audience paying particular attention to the role of the actors.


2.    Select a passage from a novel you have chosen to study and show how, by staging and action, you
      might convey the atmosphere generated by the passage for an audience.


3.    Select a passage from a novel you have chosen to study which deals with loss. Discuss how you
      would stage this in order to convey to the audience the meaning of that loss.
