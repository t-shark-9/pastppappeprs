These notes to examiners are intended only as guidelines to assist marking and as a supplement to the
published external assessment criteria for written paper 1. They are not offered as an exhaustive and
fixed set of responses or approaches to which all answers must rigidly adhere. Good ideas or angles not
offered here should be acknowledged and rewarded as appropriate. Similarly, answers which do not
include all the ideas or approaches suggested here may still be very good answers.

Of course, some of the points listed below will appear in weaker papers, but are unlikely to
be developed.

1.

      An adequate to good guided literary analysis will:

      •   recognize the significance of the situation of waking from a four-year coma
      •   comment on the individual family members and the way they are portrayed
      •   discuss the tone of the narrator
      •   explore some interesting aspects of the imagery.

      A very good to excellent guided literary analysis may also:

      • recognize and comment on the retrospective and self-reflexive point of view
      • explore in some depth the narrator’s relationship with his brother Terry and/or other family
        members
      • discuss in greater detail aspects of sensory and visual imagery
      • detect and interpret references to death, entombment and resurrection
      • offer a perceptive interpretation of the ending.

2.

      An adequate to good guided literary analysis will:

      • address the identity of the speaker and the perspective from which the memory is viewed.
        (There are many possible readings of the general situation and the exact identity of the speaker
        and subject: general lamentation on loss or change; a mother’s illness and eventual death; adult
        looking back on his/her four-year-old self’s situation; other parent addressing the child. There
        are many reasonable readings of the identity of this adult and the situation of the mother.)
      • consider the contribution of structure and form
      • engage in some way with the last line
      • discuss the relationship between the title and the poem
      • consider the effects of imagery and diction.

      A very good to excellent guided literary analysis may also:

      • offer a more conceptualized response to form and structure, such as the interlocking rhyme
        scheme and/or the disruption in the penultimate stanza and how this contributes to meaning
      • detect, and offer a persuasive interpretation of, any interesting features of the language of the
        poem, such as the chain of terms relating to loss and mourning
      • acknowledge the range of alternative readings of either the poem as a whole or specific
        features of it
      • offer a more sophisticated discussion of the last line.
