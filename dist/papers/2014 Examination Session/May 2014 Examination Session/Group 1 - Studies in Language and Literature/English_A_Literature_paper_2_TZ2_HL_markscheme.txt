Examiners: please note that the term “comparison”, both in the descriptors and in the
marking notes, includes the discussion of relevant “contrasts” as well.

The features of the “very good to excellent” answers assume that those for “adequate to good”
are included.

Drama

1.   An adequate to good answer will identify, describe and comment on both the presentation and
     importance of minor characters, and make an attempt at meaningful comparison. Examiners
     should accept any reasonable definition of “minor” characters, including characters who do
     not appear on stage.

     A very good to excellent answer may also explore in greater detail the way or ways in which
     at least one minor character from each work studied contributes to those works. It will offer
     some form of evaluation of the effectiveness of the presentation and the overall importance of
     minor character(s) in the plays.


2.   An adequate to good answer will identify and comment on the effects of examples of direct
     communication of a character with the audience, comparing the uses by one playwright with
     those of the other(s). Methods could include soliloquy, asides, use of chorus/narrator, among
     others.

     A very good to excellent answer may also explore and analyse in greater detail and depth the
     impact of instances of direct communication. It will evaluate the overall effectiveness of
     these moments in each of the plays addressed.


3.   An adequate to good answer will identify and comment on the effects of examples of the use
     of sound and/or light, offering a comparison of their use by the playwrights.

     A very good to excellent answer may also discuss in greater detail and with deeper insight the
     impact that the uses of sound and/or light have in the works. It will evaluate the effectiveness
     of the impact of the uses of sound and/or light on each play as a whole.
                                              –4–          M14/1/AXENG/HP2/ENG/TZ2/XX/M



Poetry

4.   An adequate to good answer will identify and discuss appropriate examples of imagery, and
     compare how they convey one or more kinds of love. Examiners should be open to a
     multiplicity of definitions of and approaches to love.

     A very good to excellent answer may also offer a more detailed and precise analysis and a
     more nuanced appreciation of the use of imagery to convey love. It will evaluate the
     effectiveness in each case of the use of imagery for this purpose.


5.   An adequate to good answer will show some understanding of what constitutes formal and/or
     informal language and will discuss apt examples, comparing the level of formality and how it
     affects the communication of the subject matter in each case.

     A very good to excellent answer may also explore and analyse in greater depth the examples
     of formal and/or informal language, comparing with more subtlety how they affect
     communication of the subject matter. It will evaluate the effectiveness of the choice of
     language in each poem.


6.   An adequate to good answer will identify and discuss suitable examples of how rhyme and/or
     rhythm are used by poets, analysing and comparing their effects on the organization of the
     poems. (Candidates may discuss the effect of making no use of rhyme.) The analysis of
     effects is more important than the correct definition of terms.

     A very good to excellent answer may also analyse in greater detail examples of the treatment
     of rhyme and/or rhythm and the nature of their effects. It will evaluate the effectiveness of
     the treatment of rhyme and/or rhythm with respect to the organization of each poem.
                                               –5–           M14/1/AXENG/HP2/ENG/TZ2/XX/M



Prose: novel and short story

7.   An adequate to good answer will compare how and how successfully events identified as
     being “key” have contributed to the development of one or more central characters.

     A very good to excellent answer may also discuss in greater detail and with more subtlety
     how an event identified as “key” can contribute to the development of the central characters.
     It will evaluate the success of the writers’ use of the key events.


8.   An adequate to good answer will identify and describe examples of the use of weather,
     explaining and comparing how they have been employed.

     A very good to excellent answer may also analyse in greater detail the ways in which the
     writers have used the weather, perhaps showing, where applicable, that these uses may
     contribute to more than one aspect of a work. It will evaluate the effectiveness of the authors’
     use of the weather.


9.   An adequate to good answer will identify whether the texts have a single plot, or one or more
     subplots, commenting on and comparing the effects achieved by these authorial choices.
     Examiners should be open to various interpretations of what constitutes plot and sub plot.

     A very good to excellent answer may also indicate in greater detail the effectiveness of a
     single plot or more than one plot for those particular works. It will evaluate the effectiveness
     of the authors’ choices in developing these single or multiple plots.
                                               –6–          M14/1/AXENG/HP2/ENG/TZ2/XX/M



Prose other than fiction

10.   An adequate to good answer will discuss the authors’ choices of where to begin and will
      compare the effects of those beginnings at particular points. Examiners should be open to
      many interpretations of what constitutes a beginning.

      A very good to excellent answer may also investigate in greater detail and sophistication the
      impact of beginning at a particular point. It will evaluate that impact in each case.


11.   An adequate to good answer will identify each author’s tone, discussing and comparing some
      ways in which tone reveals a particular attitude towards the content of the work.

      A very good to excellent answer may also show a more nuanced and detailed understanding
      of how tone reveals writers’ particular attitudes toward the content of their works. It will
      evaluate the ways in which tone reveals attitude.


12.   An adequate to good answer will discuss and compare some ways in which a physical journey
      may be interpreted as an allegory for a spiritual or symbolic or other kind of journey (eg one
      where knowledge, wisdom, maturity, etc. is acquired) in the chosen works.

      A very good to excellent answer may also show a more nuanced and detailed understanding
      of ways in which physical journeys may be regarded as allegories. It will evaluate the
      authors’ uses of allegory in the works.
