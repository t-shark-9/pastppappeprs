Write a literary commentary on one of the following:

1.

                   “You didn’t tell me,” her mother said.
                   “What?”
                   “You know.”
                   “That he knows how to speak to me?”
     5             “Yes, that.”
                   “No, I didn’t tell you,” she said, suddenly bold, thrusting her hand as she formed the letters
            and made her irritation clear.
                   Her mother turned and walked into the house. Janey felt her footsteps in the boards of the
            porch. The floor had always carried her mother’s anger. She’d learned this first as a little girl when
     10     her mother and father argued. Their words might not have existed as sound for her, but anger always
            caused its own vibration.
                   She hadn’t been exactly sure why they argued all those years ago, but sensed, the way a child
            will, that it was usually about her. And when she grew older she decided that it must have been
            about what she could and couldn’t do, about what would be allowed and what wouldn’t, and finally
     15     about what would be done with her, or for her, though she couldn’t have put all of this into words as
            a child, words thought or spoken—in any form.
                   After their arguments her mother would come to her, take her into the kitchen while she
            worked, keeping her close, the stove’s heat encircling her, pressing against her, taking her breath
            almost with its expansion through the room. Then her father might come in later, pick her up or
     20     take her by the hand, and quickly they would go out of the house and up to the store or maybe to
            the depot to watch the afternoon train arrive and depart northward. He would sit with her, hold her
            hand, smoke his cigar, the smell and smoke surrounding them in a masculine world of men loading
            and unloading, of coals and iron rails and more smoke and dreams of departure, the two of them
            headed away.
     25            And then they did head away, but not before more silences and anger that she felt kept her
            parents from listening to each other, each made deaf in his or her own way. But the day arrived
            when, her suitcases packed, she and her father boarded the train for Talladega. After three days, he
            left her there, settled, as best she could be at the age of twelve, in her dorm room and in school for
            the deaf and blind.
     30            She’d loved it there, had learned the alphabet on her fingers and how to sign, and how to
            read lips. She’d continued, finally, with her regular schooling too, and taken art, and began to paint
            with oils. The other children there were like her, lived in her world of silence that was no longer
            quiet but filled with the voices of fingers and hands flying—thin fingers, long fingers, the beautiful
            hands of boys. It was wonderful to be able to give shape to words. She knew that her speaking
     35     voice was something she’d had less and less control over, and so seldom used it. Now words came
            through her fingers, the muscles there growing stronger and more sure, giving her a voice again,
            a voice that wanted to shout, or even sing.
                   Her mother wouldn’t visit, but wrote desperate letters about home, about missing her and
            wanting her there, those cursive words on the page like pieces of string tying and knotting her
     40     emotions. During her trips home she taught her father to speak to her, but for the longest time her
            mother could not, or would not, learn. “You can read lips,” she would say. “That’s enough for me.”
                   “What about me?” she’d sign, and, of course, no answer came, and wouldn’t have even if
            she’d forced herself to ask it aloud, from out of her throat and off her tongue.

                                                                              Marlin Barton, Into Silence (2010)

                                                     Better Days

                                     Never anymore in a wash of sweetness and awe
                                     does the summer when I was seventeen come back
                                     to mind against my will, like a bird crossing

                                     my vision. Summer of moist nights full of girls
                                 5   and boys ripened, holy drunkenness and violation
                                     of the comic boundaries, defiances that never

                                     failed or brought disaster. Days on the backs
                                     and in the breath of horses, between rivers
                                     and pools that reflected the cicadas’* whine,

                                10   enervation and strength creeping in smooth waves
                                     over muscular water. All those things accepted,
                                     once, with unnoticing hunger, as an infant

                                     accepts the nipple, never come back to mind
                                     against the will. What comes unsummoned now,
                                15   blotting out every other thought and image,

                                     is a part of the past not so deep or far away:
                                     the time of poverty, of struggle to find means
                                     not hateful—the muddy seedtime of early manhood.

                                     What returns are those moments in the diner
                                20   night after night with each night’s one cup of coffee,
                                     watching an old man, who always at the same hour

                                     came in and smiled, ordered his tea and opened
                                     his drawing pad. What did he fill it with?
                                     And where’s he gone? Those days, that studious worker,

                                25   hand moving and eyes eager in the sour light,
                                     that artist always in the same worn-out suit,
                                     are my nostalgia now. That old man comes back,

                                     the friend I saw each day and never spoke to,
                                     because I hoped soon to disappear from there,
                                30   as I have disappeared, into the heaven of better days.

                                                                             A F Moritz, Poetry Magazine (2003)
