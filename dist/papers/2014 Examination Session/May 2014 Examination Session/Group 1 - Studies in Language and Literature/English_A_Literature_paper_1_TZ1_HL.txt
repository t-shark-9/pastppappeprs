Write a literary commentary on one of the following:

1.

            I’d long quit the idea of living away from home when, on that nineteenth birthday, my mother
            threw me out of the house. She closed the town tourist office that she owned and ran, came
            home early, and said: Mona, happy birthday, my present to you is this. Putting her hands on my
            shoulders, she marched me out of the front door, and stood me on the lawn.
      5           I love you, she said, but you are too old to live here.
                  But I love it here, I said.
                  Her hair blew around in the air. You’re lying, she said, and what’s worse is that you don’t
            even know it.
                  I wasn’t sure if she was adamant or just a lot of talk until she rolled my bed into the front
     10     hallway. My father, confused, just sidled around the sloppy pillow and comforter, and for two
            nights, I dreamt in the space where wall nearly met wall. On the second morning, I woke, went
            to the bathroom, came back, and found the bed was gone again. And the front door was open.
            My mother stood in the doorway, her back to me, shoulders lifting and lowering from laughter at
            the sight of it, covers rumpled, standing in the middle of the front lawn like a cow.
     15           So I’ll sleep out there then, I said, heading towards it.
                  She caught me in her arms and held me close. I could feel the laughter, warm in her arms
            and her chest.
                  I went apartment hunting that Saturday. My mother was off at work, but before I left,
            my father called to me from the living room. He was feeling feverish, and lay on the couch, a
     20     washcloth sprawled on his forehead like the limp flag of a defeated country. Central heating, he
            advised. Do you need anything? I asked, but he shook his head. And Mona, he said, make sure
            you get a place with a toilet that flushes. I nodded. I brought him a glass of water before I left.
                  The whole idea of moving made me nervous, so I kept company with the number 19 as
            I walked around town by myself. 19: the third centered hexagonal number. A prime. The amount
     25     of time alive of my chin, my toes, my brain. I wandered through the tree-lined streets, to the edge
            of town where the gray ribbon of highway dressed the hills in the distance like a lumpy yellow gift.
            I did pass a few FOR RENT signs, but the apartment I finally chose was only three blocks away
            from my parents’ house, sparkled with color, came with a toilet so powerful it could flush socks,
            and had an address that I liked: 9119.
     30           The day I moved in, I placed my furniture pretty much where it had been at home. My bed,
            formerly grayish from the dimmed atmosphere of my parents’ house, was already picking up its
            old pink tones. I hadn’t seen it pink for nine years, and it looked like the color ads in newspapers
            that retain a steely quality of black-and-white even though they’re newly splotched with reds
            and blues.
     35           I called my mother when the phone was hooked up.
                  I’m here, I said. What now?
                  She was eating something crunchy. Decorate, she told me. Have a party.
                  The blank walls loomed white and empty. I ran through the rooms and said my name in
            each one.
     40           Mona, I told the kitchen.
                  Mona, I whispered into the hall closet.

                  When it hit eleven o’clock, I put myself into the bed I’d slept in my entire life, in a room
            I’d never slept in, ever, and switched off the lights. The shadows made moving dark spirits on the
            walls, and I reached over to the potted tree my mother had given me as a housewarming present,
   45       and knocked on the trunk. I knocked and knocked. I didn’t knock just a few times. I knocked
            maybe fifty. One hundred knocks. More knocks. One hundred and fifty. More. I stopped and
            then something felt wrong, my stomach felt wrong, so I knocked some more.
                  The new place held its own around me, learning. This is me, I wanted to tell it. Hello.
            This is me protecting the world.
   50             I knocked until midnight. I’d finish and then go back for more. This is how I imagine drugs
            are. You close in on the wood, pull in your breath, and you want to get it just right and your whole
            body is taut, breath held, tight with getting it just right and awaiting the release—ssss—which lasts
            about five seconds and when it’s over it’s not right again yet, more, you need to go back. Just one
            more time. Just one more time and I’ll get it exactly right this time and be done for the rest of
   55       my life.

                  Once I was all settled in, and each drawer had a purpose, and the bathroom was well-stocked
            with toilet paper and window cleaner, I invited my mother over for lunch.

                                Watching for Dolphins

                 In the summer months on every crossing to Piraeus1
                 One noticed that certain passengers soon rose
                 From seats in the packed saloon and with serious
                 Looks and no acknowledgement of a common purpose
             5   Passed forward through the small door into the bows
                 To watch for dolphins. One saw them lose

                 Every other wish. Even the lovers
                 Turned their desires on the sea, and a fat man
                 Hung with equipment to photograph the occasion
            10   Stared like a saint, through sad bi-focals; others,
                 Hopeless themselves, looked to the children for they
                 Would see dolphins if anyone would. Day after day

                 Or on their last opportunity all gazed
                 Undecided whether a flat calm were favourable
            15   Or a sea the sun and the wind between them raised
                 To a likeness of dolphins. Were gulls a sign, that fell
                 Screeching from the sky or over an unremarkable place
                 Sat in a silent school? Every face

                 After its character implored the sea.
            20   All, unaccustomed, wanted epiphany,
                 Praying the sky would clang and the abused Aegean2
                 Reverberate with cymbal, gong and drum.
                 We could not imagine more prayer, and had they then
                 On the waves, on the climax of our longing come

            25   Smiling, snub-nosed, domed like satyrs3, oh
                 We should have laughed and lifted the children up
                 Stranger to stranger, pointing how with a leap
                 They left their element, three or four times, centred
                 On grace, and heavily and warm re-entered,
            30   Looping the keel. We should have felt them go

                                  Further and further into the deep parts. But soon
                                  We were among the great tankers, under their chains
                                  In black water. We had not seen the dolphins
                                  But woke, blinking. Eyes cast down
                           35     With no admission of disappointment the company
                                  Dispersed and prepared to land in the city.

                                                                           David Constantine, Watching for Dolphins (1983)
