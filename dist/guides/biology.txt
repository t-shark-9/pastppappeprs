Introduction
Purpose of this document
1 Biology guide
The Diploma  Programme  (DP)  is a rigorous  pre-university  course  of study  designed  for students  in the 
16 to 19 age range.  It is a broad-based  two-year  course  that  aims  to encourage  students  to be 
knowledgeable  and  inquiring,  but also  caring  and  compassionate.  There  is a strong  emphasis  on 
encouraging  students  to develop  intercultural  understanding,  open-mindedness,  and  the attitudes 
necessary for them to respect and evaluate a range of points of view.
The Diploma Programme model
The course  is presented  as six academic  areas  enclosing  a central  core  (see  figure  1). It encourages  the 
concurrent  study  of a broad  range  of academic  areas.  Students  study  two  modern  languages  (or a modern 
language  and  a classical  language),  a humanities  or social  science  subject,  an experimental  science, 
mathematics  and  one  of the creative  arts.  It is this comprehensive  range  of subjects  that  makes  the DP a 
demanding  course  of study  designed  to prepare  students  effectively  for university  entrance.  In each  of the 
academic  areas  students  have  flexibility  in making  their  choices,  which  means  they  can choose  subjects 
that particularly interest them and that they may wish to study further at university.

Introduction
The Diploma Programme
2 Biology guide
Choosing the right combination
Students are required to choose one subject from each of the six academic areas, although they can, 
instead  of an arts  subject,  choose  two  subjects  from  another  area.  Normally,  three  subjects  (and  not 
more  than  four)  are taken  at higher  level  (HL),  and  the others  are taken  at standard  level  (SL).  The IB 
recommends 240 teaching hours for HL subjects and 150 hours for SL. Subjects at HL are studied in greater 
depth and breadth than at SL.
At both levels, many skills are developed, especially those of critical thinking and analysis. At the end of the 
course,  students’  abilities  are measured  by means  of external  assessment.  Many  subjects  contain  some 
element of coursework assessed by teachers.
The core of the Diploma Programme model
All DP students participate in the three course elements that make up the core of the model.
Theory  of knowledge  (TOK)  is a course  that  is fundamentally  about  critical  thinking  and  inquiry  into  the 
process of knowing rather than about learning a specific body of knowledge. The TOK course examines the 
nature  of knowledge  and  how  we know  what  we claim  to know.  It does  this by encouraging  students  to 
analyse  knowledge  claims  and  explore  questions  about  the construction  of knowledge.  The task  of TOK  is 
to emphasize  connections  between  areas  of shared  knowledge  and  link them  to personal  knowledge  in 
such  a way  that  an individual  becomes  more  aware  of their  own  perspectives  and  how  they  might  differ 
from others.
In TOK, students explore the means of producing knowledge within the core theme of “knowledge and the 
knower”  as well  as within  various  optional  themes  (knowledge  and  technology,  knowledge  and  politics, 
knowledge  and  language,  knowledge  and  religion,  and  knowledge  and  indigenous  societies)  and  areas  of 
knowledge  (the  arts,  natural  sciences,  human  sciences,  history  and  mathematics).  The course  also 
encourages  students  to make  comparisons  between  different  areas  of knowledge  and  reflect  on how 
knowledge is arrived at in the various disciplines, what the disciplines have in common, and the differences 
between them.
Creativity,  activity,  service  (CAS)  is at the heart  of the DP. The emphasis  in CAS  is on helping  students  to 
develop  their  own  identities,  in accordance  with  the ethical  principles  embodied  in the IB mission 
statement  and  the IB learner  profile.  It involves  students  in a range  of activities  alongside  their  academic 
studies  throughout  the DP. The three  strands  of CAS  are creativity  (arts  and  other  experiences  that  involve 
creative  thinking),  activity  (physical  exertion  contributing  to a healthy  lifestyle)  and  service  (an unpaid  and 
voluntary  exchange  that  has a learning  benefit  for the student).  Possibly,  more  than  any other  component 
in the DP, CAS  contributes  to the IB’s mission  to create  a better  and  more  peaceful  world  through 
intercultural understanding and respect.
The extended  essay  (EE),  including  the world  studies  extended  essay,  offers  the opportunity  for IB students 
to investigate  a topic  of special  interest,  in the form  of a 4,000-word  piece  of independent  research.  The 
area  of research  undertaken  is chosen  from  one  of the students’  six DP subjects,  or in the case  of the 
interdisciplinary  world  studies  essay,  two  subjects,  and  acquaints  them  with  the independent  research  and 
writing skills expected at university. This leads to a major piece of formally presented, structured writing, in 
which ideas and findings are communicated in a reasoned and coherent manner, appropriate to the subject 
or subjects  chosen.  It is intended  to promote  high-level  research  and  writing  skills,  intellectual  discovery 
and  creativity.  An authentic  learning  experience,  it provides  students  with  an opportunity  to engage  in 
personal research on a topic of choice, under the guidance of a supervisor.
Approaches to teaching and approaches to 
learning
Approaches to teaching and approaches to learning (ATL) across the DP refers to deliberate strategies, skills 
and  attitudes  that  permeate  the teaching  and  learning  environment.  These  approaches  and  tools, 
intrinsically  linked  with  the learner  profile  attributes,  enhance  student  learning  and  assist  student The Diploma Programme
3 Biology guide
preparation for the DP assessment and beyond. The aims of approaches to teaching and learning in the DP 
are to:
• empower teachers as teachers of learners as well as teachers of content
• empower teachers to create clearer strategies for facilitating learning experiences in which students 
are more meaningfully engaged in structured inquiry and greater critical and creative thinking
• promote both the aims of individual subjects (making them more than course aspirations) and linking 
previously isolated knowledge (concurrency of learning)
• encourage students to develop an explicit variety of skills that will equip them to continue to be 
actively engaged in learning after they leave school, and to help them not only obtain university 
admission through better grades but also prepare for success during tertiary education and beyond
• enhance further the coherence and relevance of the students’ DP experience
• allow schools to identify the distinctive nature of an IB DP education, with its blend of idealism and 
practicality.
The five ATL (developing  thinking  skills,  social  skills,  communication  skills,  self-management  skills  and 
research  skills)  along  with  the six approaches  to teaching  (teaching  that  is inquiry-based,  conceptually 
focused,  contextualized,  collaborative,  differentiated  and  informed  by assessment)  encompass  the key 
values and principles that underpin IB pedagogy.
The IB mission statement and the IB learner profile
The DP aims  to develop  in students  the knowledge,  skills  and  attitudes  they  will need  to fulfil  the aims  of 
the IB, as expressed  in the organization’s  mission  statement  and  the learner  profile.  Teaching  and  learning 
in the DP represent the reality in daily practice of the organization’s educational philosophy.
Academic integrity
Academic  integrity  in the DP is a set of values  and  behaviours  informed  by the attributes  of the learner 
profile.  In teaching,  learning  and  assessment,  academic  integrity  serves  to promote  personal  integrity, 
engender  respect  for the integrity  of others  and  their  work,  and  ensure  that  all students  have  an equal 
opportunity to demonstrate the knowledge and skills they acquire during their studies.
All coursework—including  work  submitted  for assessment—is  to be authentic,  based  on the student’s 
individual  and  original  ideas  with  the ideas  and  work  of others  fully  acknowledged.  Assessment  tasks  that 
require  teachers  to provide  guidance  to students  or that  require  students  to work  collaboratively  must  be 
completed in full compliance with the detailed guidelines provided by the IB for the relevant subjects.
For further  information  on academic  integrity  in the IB and  the DP, please  consult  the IB publications 
Academic  integrity , Effective  citing  and  referencing , Diploma  Programme:  From  principles  into  practice  and  the 
general  regulations  in Diploma  Programme  Assessment  procedures  (updated  annually).  Specific  information 
regarding  academic  integrity  as it pertains  to external  and  internal  assessment  components  of this DP 
subject can be found in this guide.
Acknowledging the ideas or work of another 
person
Coordinators  and  teachers  are reminded  that  candidates  must  acknowledge  all sources  used  in work 
submitted for assessment. The following is intended as a clarification of this requirement.
DP candidates submit work for assessment in a variety of media that may include audiovisual material, text, 
graphs, images and/or data published in print or electronic sources. If a candidate uses the work or ideas of 
another  person,  the candidate  must  acknowledge  the source  using  a standard  style  of referencing  in a 
consistent  manner.  A candidate’s  failure  to acknowledge  a source  will be investigated  by the IB as a 
potential breach of regulations that may result in a penalty imposed by the IB final award committee.The Diploma Programme
4 Biology guide
The IB does not prescribe which style(s) of referencing or in-text citation should be used by candidates; this 
is left to the discretion  of appropriate  faculty/staff  in the candidate’s  school.  The wide  range  of subjects, 
response  languages  and  the diversity  of referencing  styles  make  it impractical  and  restrictive  to insist  on 
particular styles. In practice, certain styles may prove most commonly used, but schools are free to choose a 
style  that  is appropriate  for the subject  concerned  and  the language  in which  candidates’  work  is written. 
Regardless of the reference style adopted by the school for a given subject, it is expected that the minimum 
information  given  includes:  name  of author,  date  of publication,  title  of source,  and  page  numbers  as 
applicable.
Candidates  are expected  to use a standard  style  and  use it consistently  so that  credit  is given  to all sources 
used,  including  sources  that  have  been  paraphrased  or summarized.  When  writing  text  candidates  must 
clearly  distinguish  between  their  words  and  those  of others  by the use of quotation  marks  (or other 
method, such as indentation) followed by an appropriate citation that denotes an entry in the bibliography. 
If an electronic  source  is cited,  the date  of access  must  be indicated.  Candidates  are not expected  to show 
faultless  expertise  in referencing,  but are expected  to demonstrate  that  all sources  have  been 
acknowledged.  Candidates  must  be advised  that  audiovisual  material,  text,  graphs,  images  and/or  data 
published  in print  or in electronic  sources  that  is not their  own  must  also  attribute  the source.  Again,  an 
appropriate style of referencing/citation must be used.
Learning diversity and learning support 
requirements
Schools  must  ensure  that  equal  access  arrangements  and  reasonable  adjustments  are provided  to 
candidates  with  learning  support  requirements  that  are in line with  the IB documents  Access  and  inclusion 
policy  and Learning diversity and inclusion in IB programmes: Removing barriers to learning . 
The publications  Meeting  student  learning  diversity  in the classroom  and  The  IB guide  to inclusive  education:  a 
resource  for whole  school  development  are available  to support  schools  in the ongoing  process  of increasing 
access and engagement by removing barriers to learning.
Programme standards and practices
The programme  standards  and  practices  are a set of principles  for schools  to ensure  quality  and  fidelity  in 
the implementation  of IB programmes.  Teaching  and  learning  are important  markers  of quality  and 
effective practice in schools; thus the expectations teachers and learners share across all IB programmes can 
be found in the programme standards and practices.
The programme  standards  and  practices  provide  a framework  to help  teachers  understand  their  rights  and 
responsibilities  in IB World  Schools  as they  develop  learning  environments  and  experiences  for their 
students. The IB recognizes that in order for effective teaching to take place, teachers must be supported in 
their  understanding,  well-being,  environment  and  resources.  Teachers  use the core  tenets  of IB philosophy 
and  pedagogy  (approaches  to teaching,  ATL,  the learner  profile  and  international-mindedness)  to design 
learning experiences that prepare learners to fulfil the aims and objectives outlined in this guide.
To learn  more  about  teachers’  rights  and  responsibilities,  please  see the IB publication  Programme 
standards and practices  on the Programme Resource Centre.The Diploma Programme
5 Biology guide
What is nature of science?
Nature of science (NOS) is an overarching theme in the biology, chemistry and physics courses that seeks to 
explore conceptual understandings related to the purpose, features and impact of scientific knowledge.
What do we want to know in science?
Nobel  laureate  and  influential  popularizer  of science,  Richard  Feynman,  once  described  the process  of 
science  using  the analogy  of watching  an unknown  board  game  being  played  “... and  you don’t  know  the 
rules  of the game,  but you’re  allowed  to look  at the board  from  time  to time.  And  from  these  observations, 
you try to figure  out what  the rules  are of the game,  [and]  the rules  of the pieces  moving”  (Feynman  et al., 
1963).
What is the scientific endeavour?
Classifying  such  observations  and  underlying  patterns  in the natural  world  is the essence  of what  scientists 
do, underpinned  by the assumption  that  the universe  exists  as an external  reality  accessible  to the human 
experience.  The varied  and  often  non-linear  processes  used  in scientific  methodologies  have  several  key 
features  in common  to maximize  the validity  and  reliability  of knowledge  produced.  The development  of 
falsifiable  hypotheses,  a requirement  for replicable  data,  and  the utilization  of peer-review  may  be among 
the most  essential  of these  and  help  differentiate  a scientific  process  from  a pseudoscientific  one.  The 
communal  and  collaborative  nature  of this approach  further  strengthens  the objectivity  of science  by 
ensuring the inclusion of diverse perspectives and shared responsibility for its outcomes.
What type of knowledge do we produce?
Formal  scientific  knowledge  may  encompass  several  categories  including  representative  models, 
explanatory  theories  and  descriptive  laws.  As the focus  of each  discipline  of natural  science  differs,  so too 
does  the balance  of their  contributions  to each  category.  What  remains  constant,  however,  is the 
acknowledgement  of assumptions,  exceptions  and  limitations  of scientific  knowledge  to provide  realistic 
parameters  to our understanding  of the natural  world.  Claims  of certainty  are treated  with  caution  given 
the presence of paradigmatic shifts throughout the history of science.
What is the impact of scientific knowledge?
As well  as the pursuit  of knowledge  for its own  sake,  it is useful  to consider  the interplay  of science  with 
other  areas  of society.  Although  advances  in technology  traditionally  fuelled  great  leaps  in scientific 
understanding,  in recent  times  it may  be more  common  to see science  as a driver  of technological 
development.  In addition,  the implications  of science  within  environmental,  political,  social,  cultural  and 
economic domains can also be profound. These connections illustrate the importance of local, national and 
international  scientific  bodies  that  engage  with  the public  understanding  of science  and  heighten  the 
responsibility of scientists to adhere to principles of academic integrity in their research.
Introduction

Table 1
Aspects of nature of science
Aspects How are scientific knowledge claims generated, tested, communicated, 
evaluated and used? What issues arise from these actions?
Observations Scientists act as observers, looking at Earth and all other parts of the universe, to 
obtain data about natural phenomena. Observations can be made directly using 
human senses, or with the aid of instruments such as electronic sensors. Unexpected 
or unplanned observations can open up new research fields.
Patterns and 
trendsScientists analyse their observations, looking for patterns or trends, and try to draw 
general conclusions by inductive reasoning. They also look for discrepancies. 
Scientists classify objects through pattern recognition. A trend may take the form of a 
positive or negative correlation between variables. Correlations may be based on a 
causal relationship, but correlation does not prove causation.
Hypotheses Scientists make provisional explanations for the patterns that they have observed in 
natural phenomena. These hypotheses can be tested, with further observations or 
experiments, to obtain support for a hypothesis or show that it is false.
Experiments Scientists design and perform experiments to obtain data, which can be used to test 
hypotheses. The quality of experimental evidence depends on careful control of 
variables and on the quantity of data generated. Progress in science often follows 
technological developments that allow new experimental techniques. Creativity and 
imagination play a role in experimental design, interpretation and conclusion.
Measurement Quantitative measurements are more objective than qualitative observations, but all 
measurements are limited in precision and accuracy. Measurements are repeated to 
strengthen the reliability of data. Random errors in measurement due to unknown or 
unpredictable differences lead to imprecision and uncertainty, whereas systematic 
errors lead to inaccuracy.
Models Scientists construct models as artificial representations of natural phenomena. They 
are useful when direct observation or experimentation is difficult. Models are 
simplifications of complex systems and can be physical representations, abstract 
diagrams, mathematical equations or algorithms. All models have limitations that 
need to be considered in their application.
Evidence Scientists adopt a sceptical attitude to claims and evaluate them using evidence. 
Some claims cannot be tested using verifiable evidence, so cannot be falsified. They 
are therefore not scientific. Scientific knowledge must be supported by evidence.
Theories Scientists develop general explanations that are widely applicable, based on observed 
patterns or tested hypotheses. Predictions can be generated from these theories by 
deductive reasoning. If these predictions are tested, they may corroborate a theory or 
show that it is false and should be rejected. Paradigm shifts take place when a new 
theory replaces an old one. The term “law” is sometimes used for statements that 
allow predictions to be made about natural phenomena without explaining them.
Falsification Scientists can use evidence to falsify a claim formulated as a hypothesis, theory or 
model, but they cannot prove with certainty that such a claim is true. There is 
therefore inherent uncertainty in all scientific knowledge. Nonetheless, many theories 
in science are corroborated by strong evidence and allow for prediction and 
explanation. Scientists must remain open-minded with respect to new evidence.
Science as a 
shared 
endeavourScientists communicate and collaborate throughout the world. Agreed conventions 
and common terminology facilitate unambiguous communication. Peer review is Nature of science
7 Biology guide
Aspects How are scientific knowledge claims generated, tested, communicated, 
evaluated and used? What issues arise from these actions?
essential to verify the research methods of knowledge claims prior to their publication 
in journals.
Global impact of 
scienceScientists have an obligation to assess the risks associated with their work and must 
aim to do no harm. Developments in science may have ethical, environmental, 
political, social, cultural and economic consequences that must be considered during 
decision-making. The pursuit of science may have unintended consequences. 
Research proposals are often filtered through ethics boards. Scientists have a 
responsibility to communicate their findings to the public with honesty and clarity.
How is NOS different from TOK?
In contrast  to the specificity  of understanding  of science,  the TOK  course  encourages  students  to think 
critically  about  the concepts  that  underpin  knowledge  production.  For example,  peer  review  is used  as a 
tool  to support  objectivity  in scientific  research.  Through  the study  of TOK,  students  question  the 
limitations  of the peer  review  process  and  extend  their  thinking  to an assessment  of objectivity  in other 
areas of knowledge.Nature of science
8 Biology guide
The word  “biology”  was  introduced  by German  naturalist  Gottfried  Reinhold  in 1802.  Since  then,  our 
understanding  of living  organisms  has expanded  considerably  with  the advent  of techniques  and 
technologies  such  as imaging  and  molecular  sequencing  methods.  Of all the sciences,  biology  is a study 
that takes more of a pragmatic view than a theoretical approach.
The earliest  evidence  of life on Earth  dates  from  at least  3.5 billion  years  ago.  Through  reproduction  and 
natural selection, life has diversified tremendously, occupying a wide variety of niches. This diversity makes 
biology both a deeply fascinating and significantly challenging study.
The study  of life makes  progress  through  not only  advances  in techniques,  but also  pattern  recognition, 
controlled  experiments  and  collaboration  between  scientists.  Unifying  themes  provide  frameworks  for 
interpretation  and  help  us make  sense  of the living  world:  Form  and  function,  Unity  and  diversity, 
Continuity  and  change,  and  Interaction  and  interdependence  are four  of the themes  around  which  this 
biology syllabus is constructed, although other frameworks are possible.
The scale  of life in biology  ranges  from  the molecules  and  cells  of organisms  to ecosystems  and  the 
biosphere.  This  way  of considering  complex  systems  as simpler  components—an  approach  known  as 
reductionism—makes  systems  more  manageable  to study.  It is the foundation  of controlled  experiments 
and  has thus  enabled  major  discoveries,  but it provides  an incomplete  view  of life. At each  level  of 
biological  organization,  different  properties  exist.  Living  systems  are based  on interactions, 
interdependence and integration of components between all levels of biological organization.
A student of biology should gain not only a conceptual understanding of the subject, but also an awareness 
of how biologists construct knowledge claims and the limitations of these methods.
Distinction between SL and HL
Students at SL and HL share the following.
• An understanding of science through a stimulating experimental programme
• The nature of science as an overarching theme
• The study of a concept-based syllabus
• One piece of internally assessed work, the scientific investigation
• The collaborative sciences project
The SL course  provides  students  with  a fundamental  understanding  of biology  and  experience  of the 
associated  skills.  The HL course  requires  students  to increase  their  knowledge  and  understanding  of the 
subject, and so provides a solid foundation for further study at university level.
The SL course  has a recommended  150 teaching  hours,  compared  to 240 hours  for the HL course.  This 
difference  is reflected  in the additional  content  studied  by HL students.  Some  of the HL content  is 
conceptually  more  demanding  and  explored  in greater  depth.  The distinction  between  SL and  HL is 
therefore  one  of both  breadth  and  depth.  The increased  breadth  and  depth  at HL result  in increased 
networked  knowledge,  requiring  the student  to make  more  connections  between  diverse  areas  of the 
syllabus.
Introduction
Nature of biology

Biology and the core
Biology and theory of knowledge
The TOK  course  plays  a special  role  in the DP by providing  opportunities  for students  to reflect  on the 
nature,  scope  and  limitations  of knowledge  and  the process  of knowing  through  an exploration  of 
knowledge questions.
The areas  of knowledge  (AOK)  are specific  branches  of knowledge,  each  of which  can be seen  to have  a 
distinct  nature  and  sometimes  use different  methods  of gaining  knowledge.  In TOK,  students  explore  five 
compulsory AOK: history, the human sciences, the natural sciences, mathematics and the arts.
There are several different ways in which aspects of the biology course can be connected to the exploration 
of knowledge.  During  the teaching  and  learning  of the biology  course,  teachers  and  students  evaluate 
knowledge  claims  by exploring  questions  concerning  their  validity,  reliability,  credibility  and  certainty,  as 
well as individual and cultural perspectives on them.
Exploration  of the relationship  between  knowledge  and  TOK  concepts  can help  students  to deepen  their 
understanding  and  make  connections  between  disciplines.  For example,  while  discussing  the depletion  of 
energy  sources  and  the constant  need  for new  energy  resources  to meet  energy  demands,  students  can 
explore the concepts of responsibility, power and justification.
Many  aspects  of the biology  course  lend  themselves  to the exploration  of knowledge  questions.  Some 
examples are provided in the following table.

Biology and the extended essay
Students  who  choose  to write  an EE in biology  undertake  independent  research  as part  of an in-depth 
study  of a focused  topic.  The topic  for study  may  be generated  from  the biology  course  or may  relate  to a 
subject  area  beyond  the syllabus  content.  This  detailed  study  will help  develop  research,  thinking,  self-
management  and  communication  skills,  which  will support  students’  learning  in the biology  course,  and  in 
further studies.
Examples of areas for research topics
• Context: An assessment of the factors affecting species population, using databases or other 
secondary sources.
◦ Example: The impact of predation by the red fox ( Vulpes vulpes ) on Canada geese ( Branta 
canadensis ) nesting populations in Alaska.Nature of biology
10 Biology guide
• Context: Experiments on factors affecting all aspects of plant growth, flowering and germination
◦ Example: A comparison of the effect of salt (sodium chloride) concentration on germination in 
radishes ( Raphanus raphanistrum ) and beet ( Beta vulgaris ).
• Context: Factors affecting enzyme-based reactions in cells.
◦ Example: The effect of processing temperature (60–120°C) of soybean ( Glycine max ) meal on 
urease activity in freshly powdered soybeans.
• Context: Using microorganism growth assays to monitor the presence of toxic chemicals in the 
environment.
◦ Example: The viability of yeast stained with methylene blue in aqueous ethanol solutions (0–
4.0%).
World studies (context: environmental and/or economic sustainability)
• Context: Trade in seed plants and food security based on agricultural practices.
◦ Example: Sustainable food security in Nepal based on a range of millet species and the need to 
protect genetic diversity.
Note:  When  students  are referring  to organisms  in an examination,  either  the common  name  or the scientific 
name is acceptable.
Students and supervisors must ensure that an EE does not duplicate other work submitted for the diploma.

Biology and creativity, activity, service
The CAS  component  of the DP core  provides  many  opportunities  for students  to link science  concepts  and 
topics  to practical  experiences.  Teachers  can highlight  how  knowledge  and  understanding  developed 
through  the course  might  inform  meaningful  experiences.  Outside  the classroom,  CAS  experiences  might 
also ignite students’ passion for addressing topics inside the biology classroom.
Some examples of relevant CAS experiences are as follows.
• Organizing a science club for students in lower years
• Implementing environmental initiatives within the school or local community, such as recycling, 
composting and roof gardens
• Organizing or participating in a social media outreach or advocacy campaign, for example, on an 
environmental or health concern
CAS  experiences  can be a single  event  or may  be an extended  series  of events.  It is important  that  CAS 
experiences be distinct from and not submitted as part of a biology assessment.
For more  information,  please  refer  to the Creativity,  activity,  service  guide  and  the  Creativity,  activity,

Biology and international-mindedness
Science has been, and continues to be, a truly international endeavour. From the beginnings of seismology 
in China,  through  material  science  in Mesopotamia  to astronomy  in the Islamic  Golden  Age,  the search  for 
an objective  understanding  of the natural  world  transcends  the limitations  imposed  by national 
boundaries. The scientific process, requiring curiosity, insight and an open-minded approach, benefits from 
the widest possible participation across genders and cultures through inclusivity and diversity.
Given  the global  nature  of many  scientific  issues,  international  organizations  often  have  a focus  on the 
engagement of science with the public domain. The World Health Organization and the Intergovernmental 
Panel  on Climate  Change  are two  well-known  examples  that  model  a responsibility  to inform  nations  of 
scientific  progress  on an equitable  basis.  Underlying  this responsibility  is the interest  of promoting  a 
peaceful and sustainable future.Nature of biology
11 Biology guide
Advancements  in technology,  along  with  the cost  of modern  research  facilities,  continues  to reinforce  the 
role  of international  collaborative  work.  This  was  clearly  demonstrated  through  the global  initiatives 
focused on addressing the COVID-19 pandemic. Specifically, the initiatives that were undertaken to develop 
the necessary knowledge and technology to create vaccines.
The importance  of collaboration  in contemporary  science  is reflected  by the large  number  of international 
organizations  tasked  with  collating  and  sharing  data  with  the scientific  community.  Access  to shared 
knowledge  through  websites  and  databases  must  be integrated  into  classroom  teaching  as it plays  an 
important role in validating experimental work.
In addition to integrating technology and collaborative work, the collaborative sciences project provides an 
excellent opportunity for students to engage with global issues.
Biology and the IB learner profile
Each  box provides  an example  of how  each  learner  profile  attribute  could  be modelled  by learners  and 
teachers.
Example attribute
• Learners who best embody the attribute with reference to science.
• Directing teachers with possible routes to develop the attribute in the classroom.
• Practical ways in which learners demonstrate the attribute in the process of “doing” science.
Attributes of the IB learner profile
Inquirer
• Inquirers are curious, they actively use research skills, work independently and show enthusiasm 
about the world around them.
• Teachers facilitate skill development and promote inquiry; they provide students with opportunities 
to ask questions, search for answers, and experiment.
• Learners use their inquiry skills to extend their scientific knowledge and engage with research.
Knowledgeable
• Learners explore concepts, ideas and issues related to science in order to broaden and deepen their 
understanding of factual and procedural knowledge.
• Access to a variety of resources and opportunities provides learner agency to develop scientific 
knowledge and understanding.
• Learners apply their knowledge to unfamiliar contexts and make connections between concepts and 
facts to illustrate their understanding of science.
Thinker
• Learners are eager to solve complex problems and reflect on their thinking strategies.
• Teachers provide opportunities for learners to critically analyse their approaches and methods and 
deepen their understanding of science, allowing them to be creative in finding solutions to problems.
• Learners practise reasoning and critical thinking by testing assumptions, formulating hypotheses, 
interpreting data and drawing conclusions from the evidence provided.
Communicator
• Learners collaborate effectively with others and use a variety of modes of communication to express 
their ideas and opinions.Nature of biology
12 Biology guide
Communicator
• Teachers facilitate group work, encourage open discussions and the use of the scientific language to 
provide models for successful communication.
• Learners demonstrate effective communication skills as part of collaborative activities through 
listening to others and sharing ideas.
Principled
• Learners take responsibility for their work, promote shared values and act in an ethical manner.
• Teachers can provide opportunities to model principled behaviour including acknowledging the 
work of others and citing sources. The collaborative sciences project provides opportunities for 
learners to take a principled stance.
• Learners appreciate the importance of integrity in data collection and consider all data, even that 
which does not match their original hypothesis.
Open-minded
• Open-minded learners accept that different perspectives, models or hypotheses exist, and these can 
be used to enhance scientific understanding.
• Teachers can provide models that were at the time supported by data or observations, but through 
reasoning, deduction or falsification may be rejected or refined.
• Learners need to be prepared to have their perspectives and ideas challenged through the study of 
science.
Caring
• Learners act to protect the environment and to improve the lives of others.
• Teachers can draw attention to how daily choices have consequences by challenging learners to 
adopt sustainable practice and providing support to help fellow learners. Reference should be made 
to the Sciences experimentation guidelines .
• Learners can connect curriculum content to global challenges such as healthcare, energy supply or 
food production. The collaborative sciences project provides an opportunity for learners to support 
each other to enable their group to achieve their goal successfully.
Risk-taker
• Risk-takers seek new opportunities to develop their learning and explore new approaches to solve 
problems. They actively thrive on challenges.
• Teachers can provide support and guidance for learners, encouraging them to explore new 
techniques or methods of learning. This might include scaffolds for the use of language, the design of 
experiments and the analysis of data. As learners grow in confidence, these supports can be phased 
out giving them more freedom to choose their own approach.
• Learners should be prepared for the next set of experimental data to falsify their ideas as uncertainty 
is a feature of science. They understand that this is a step forward in their understanding.
Balanced
• Balanced learners look holistically at all aspects of their development and ensure that various tasks 
are given appropriate attention without focusing on one to the detriment of others.
• Teachers should encourage learners to consider a balanced perspective on scientific issues without 
bias.Nature of biology
13 Biology guide
Balanced
• Learners need to organize their own time effectively, giving themselves sufficient time to complete 
all parts of their learning without negatively impacting on the emotional and social aspects of their 
lives.
Reflective
• Reflective learners consider why and how they achieve success, and also how they could change their 
approach when learning is difficult.
• Teachers provide opportunities for learners to continually review strategies, methods, techniques 
and approaches to problem-solving in order to improve their conceptual understandings in science. 
Assessment criteria or checklists can help learners to consider the quality of their work in a guided 
way.
• Learners develop skills and concepts throughout the course, networking their knowledge by 
continually reflecting on their understanding.Nature of biology
14 Biology guide
The approaches to learning framework
What are approaches to learning skills and why do we teach them?
The approaches  to learning  (ATL)  framework  seeks  to develop  in students  affective,  cognitive  and 
metacognitive  skills  that  will support  their  learning  processes  during  and  beyond  their  IB experience.  The 
development  of ATL skills  is closely  connected  with  the IB learner  profile  attributes  and  therefore  helps  to 
advance  the IB mission.  The ATL skills  are an integral  part  of IB learning  and  teaching  that  should  be 
developed  across  the whole  programme—it  is not expected  that  a single  course  should  ever  address  all of 
them.
How are they organized?
The ATL framework  for IB programmes  consists  of five general  skill categories:  thinking  skills, 
communication  skills,  social  skills,  research  skills  and  self-management  skills.  Each  of these  categories 
covers  a broad  range,  as shown  by the examples  presented  in the table  below.  The ATL skill categories  are 
closely linked and interrelated and therefore individual skills may be relevant to more than one category.
How do we teach them?
ATL skills can be learned and taught, improved with practice and developed incrementally. The table below 
illustrates,  through  a number  of examples,  how  the biology  course  can support  ATL skill development.  The 
examples  shown  in the table  are not exhaustive.  Teachers  are encouraged  to adapt  them  for use in their 
school context and collaboratively identify further examples of ATL skill development.
Further  information  on the ATL framework  and  strategies  for the development  of the ATL skills  can be 
found  in the Biology  teacher  support  material  and  the Diploma  Programme  Approaches  to teaching  and 
learning website .

Experimental programme
Integral  to the student  experience  of a biology  course  is the learning  that  takes  place  through  scientific 
inquiry  within  the classroom,  laboratory  or in the field.  Experimentation  through  a variety  of forms  can be 
used  to introduce  a topic,  address  a phenomenon  or allow  students  to consider  and  examine  authentic 
questions and curiosities.
A school’s  experimental  programme  should  allow  students  to experience  the full breadth  and  depth  of the 
course,  develop  scientific  skills  and  demonstrate  safe,  competent  and  methodical  use of a range  of tools, 
techniques and equipment. Students should therefore be encouraged to develop investigations to support 
their  learning  through  open-ended  inquiry  with  a focus  on laboratory  and  fieldwork  experiments, 
databases, simulations and modelling.Approaches to the teaching and learning of biology
16 Biology guide
Conceptual learning
Concept-based teaching and learning is encouraged across the continuum of IB programmes.
Concepts  are mental  representations  of categories.  They  are constructed,  modified  and  activated  by the 
learner  through  learning  experiences.  Concepts  do not exist  in isolation  but are interrelated.  Conceptual 
understanding is always a work in progress—it is continually being developed and refined.
Conceptual  understanding  is therefore  an outcome  of a non-linear,  ongoing  process  of evolving 
understandings,  adapting  previous  understandings,  and  identifying  and  dispelling  misconceptions.  It 
consists  of making  connections  between  prior  and  new  knowledge  to construct  and  build  an awareness  of 
this network of knowledge.
Concepts vary in their level of abstraction and universality.
• They can be organizing ideas that are applicable in many contexts and have relevance both within and 
across subject areas.
• They can provide a deep understanding of specific knowledge fields (or fields of knowledge) and help 
to organize knowledge further, as well as reveal connections between different areas of the subject.
For example, consider the following sequence of three concepts.
Function > Excretion > Ultrafiltration
Understanding of the concept of ultrafiltration is part of the understanding of excretion, which in turn helps 
to develop an understanding of form and function in biology.
Outcomes of a concept-based approach
Fostering critical thinking, the outcome of a concept-based approach is that students are able to:
• identify examples of a concept
• organize, reflect on, modify and expand their network of knowledge
• apply concepts to existing and future knowledge
• apply their conceptual understanding as a scientific thinking tool for predicting outcomes, justifying 
conclusions and evaluating knowledge claims.
Structure of the syllabus and conceptual understanding
The biology  syllabus  comprises  four  themes,  each  made  up of two  concepts.  Each  theme  is a lens  through 
which the syllabus content can be viewed.
• Theme A:  Unity and diversity
• Theme B:  Form and function
• Theme C:  Interaction and interdependence
• Theme D:  Continuity and change
The arrangement  of syllabus  content  follows  four  levels  of biological  organization,  which  also  serve  as 
conceptual lenses.
• Level 1:  Molecules
• Level 2:  Cells
• Level 3:  Organisms
• Level 4:  Ecosystems
The content is further arranged into topics, each with two guiding questions as signposts for inquiry. These 
questions help students view the content of the syllabus through the conceptual lenses of both the themes 
and the levels of biological organization.
Linking  questions  strengthen  students’  understanding  by making  connections.  Linking  questions 
encourage  students  to apply  concepts  from  one  topic  to another.  The ideal  outcome  of the linking 
questions is networked knowledge.Approaches to the teaching and learning of biology
17 Biology guide
The linking  questions  in the guide  are not exhaustive.  Students  and  teachers  may  encounter  other 
connections  between  understandings  and  concepts  in the syllabus,  leading  them  to create  their  own 
linking questions.
Teaching biology in context
The study  of biology  enables  constructive  engagement  with  topical  scientific  issues.  By contextualizing 
biological  concepts,  scientific  knowledge  claims  can be evaluated  more  effectively,  and  informed  choices 
on such  issues  as human  health  and  the environment  can be made.  Biological  research  has brought 
innovation  and  benefit  to many  fields  and  continues  to be at the heart  of seeking  effective  solutions  to 
many  global  challenges.  It is therefore  important  to explore  applications  of biology  in our world  while 
teaching the course to elicit interest, understanding and curiosity.
Teaching  the content  of the course  in relation  to specific  contexts  supports  the pedagogical  principle  of 
teaching in local and global contexts as part of the approaches to teaching framework and offers a number 
of advantages.  First,  it helps  students  relate  their  learning  to genuine  applications  of biology,  highlighting 
the relevance  to global  issues  as well  as the significance  in students’  own  contexts.  Second,  it develops  an 
appreciation  for the interaction  between  scientific  solutions  and  their  implications,  be it ethical, 
environmental or economic. Third, it helps to illustrate some of the NOS aspects underpinning the course.
The Biology  teacher  support  material  highlights  possible  areas  that  could  be visited  throughout  the course 
and  that  may  provide  context  for some  topics  to stimulate  the application  of ideas  and  problem-solving 
skills.  Consideration  of these  and  related  areas  may  help  provide  ideas  for the scientific  investigation,  the 
collaborative sciences project, TOK exhibition, CAS, or an EE in biology or world studies.
Engaging with sensitive topics
Students  and  teachers  are encouraged  to engage  with  exciting,  stimulating  and  personally  relevant  topics 
and  issues  that  may  be, at times,  sensitive  or personally  challenging.  Teachers  should  be aware  of this and 
provide  guidance  on how  to engage  with  such  topics  in a responsible  manner.  Consideration  should  be 
given to the personal, political and spiritual values of others.
Prior learning
Past experience shows that students will be able to study biology at SL successfully with no background in, 
or previous  knowledge  of, science.  Their  approach  to learning,  characterized  by the IB learner  profile 
attributes, will be significant here.
However,  for most  students  considering  the study  of biology  at HL, while  there  is no intention  to restrict 
access,  some  previous  exposure  to formal  science  education  would  be necessary.  Specific  topic  details  are 
not specified  but students  who  have  undertaken  the IB Middle  Years  Programme  (MYP)  or studied  an 
equivalent national science qualification or a school-based science course would be well prepared for an HL 
subject.
Links to the Middle Years Programme
The MYP  sciences  courses  seek  to promote  skills  and  attitudes  needed  to apply  scientific  knowledge  in 
theoretical,  experimental  and  authentic  contexts.  A strong  foundation  is established  for DP sciences  in 
which  learners  will capitalize  on—and  continue  advancing—their  skills  and  attitudes  to develop 
knowledge and understanding commensurate with pre-university level science.
The MYP offers a framework for learning and teaching while maintaining flexibility with curriculum content. 
The content  in MYP  sciences  courses  can therefore  vary  greatly  from  one  school  to another.  Content  in DP 
sciences  courses  is more  prescribed,  and  this is one  of the main  differences  teachers  will notice  when 
comparing the two programmes.Approaches to the teaching and learning of biology
18 Biology guide
A connected, conceptual curriculum where learning is inquiry-based and contextualized is the pedagogical 
principle  that  underpins  both  programmes  and  indeed  the entire  IB continuum  (International 
Baccalaureate, 2019).
Conceptual  learning  focuses  on organizing  ideas  and  their  interconnections.  A conceptual  approach  is 
encouraged in IB programmes because it promotes deep learning and facilitates the construction of further 
knowledge. Conceptual understanding aids the application of knowledge in unfamiliar and novel contexts. 
This skill is reflected in the aims and assessment objectives of both programmes.
Broad  concepts  frame  MYP  learning  and  teaching  with  the purpose  of unifying  ideas  across  subject  areas. 
Discipline-specific related concepts are intended to provide disciplinary depth (International Baccalaureate, 
2014). Key and related concepts are not required in the DP, although some teachers may find that they wish 
to continue  developing  a curriculum  around  them.  In DP sciences,  overarching  concepts  are manifested  in 
the course  roadmaps  and  the NOS.  DP sciences  seek  to highlight  the interconnectedness  of the course 
understandings.  The intention  is to promote  conceptual  understanding  and  further  the construction  of 
learners’ knowledge networks.
Both  MYP  and  DP teaching  involve  inquiry-based  approaches,  which  foster  a high  degree  of student 
engagement,  collaboration  and  interaction.  The inquiry,  design,  experimental,  analysis,  evaluation  and 
communication  skills  encouraged  by criteria  B and  C will serve  students  well  as they  prepare  to undertake 
the scientific  investigation  for the internal  assessment  (IA).  In addition,  MYP  students  will gain  familiarity 
with  criterion-related  assessment  and  the use of assessment  criteria,  which  will further  support  their 
understanding of the DP sciences IA criteria.
IB programmes encourage the exploration of scientific principles in connection to local and global contexts. 
Doing  so helps  students  ground  abstract  concepts  in more  concrete  local  and  global  real-world  situations 
as well  as cultivating  international-mindedness  (see  the “Approaches  to teaching”  section  in Diploma 
Programme Approaches to teaching and learning website ). Teachers should therefore weave opportunities for 
contextualization  into  the curriculum.  MYP  sciences  criterion  D analyses  the real-world  application  of 
science.  In the DP, sciences  teachers  are encouraged  to frequently  anchor  their  teaching  in real-world 
applications that are invoked throughout the course of the programme.
In addition  to equipping  students  with  scientific  knowledge  and  skills,  the MYP  and  DP sciences  courses 
share similar guiding principles that seek to develop in students the learner profile attributes.
Links to the Career-related Programme
In the Career-related  Programme  (CP),  students  study  at least  two  DP subjects,  a core  consisting  of four 
components,  as well  as a career-related  study,  which  is determined  by the local  context  and  aligned  with 
student needs. The CP has been designed to add value to students’ career-related studies. This provides the 
context for the choice of DP courses. The biology course can assist CP students planning careers in a variety 
of professional  fields  where,  for example,  a sound  understanding  of science  skills  is important.  These 
include  environmental  science,  forensic  science  and  healthcare.  Biology  helps  students  understand  the 
underlying  science  in the contemporary  world,  and  it encourages  the development  of strong  problem-
solving, critical thinking and ethical approaches that will assist students in the global workplace.Approaches to the teaching and learning of biology
19 Biology guide
The collaborative sciences project is an interdisciplinary sciences project, providing a worthwhile challenge 
to DP and  CP students,  addressing  real-world  problems  that  can be explored  through  the sciences.  The 
nature  of the challenge  should  allow  students  to integrate  factual,  procedural  and  conceptual  knowledge 
developed through the study of their disciplines.
Through  the identification  and  research  of complex  issues,  students  can develop  an understanding  of how 
interrelated systems, mechanisms and processes impact a problem. Students will then apply their collective 
understanding  to develop  solution-focused  strategies  that  address  the issue.  With  a critical  lens  they  will 
evaluate and reflect on the inherent complexity of solving real-world problems.
Students  will develop  an understanding  of the extent  of global  interconnectedness  between  regional, 
national,  and  local  communities,  which  will empower  them  to become  active  and  engaged  citizens  of the 
world. While addressing local and global issues, students will appreciate that the issues of today exist across 
national boundaries and can only be solved through collective action and international cooperation.
The collaborative  sciences  project  supports  the development  of students’  ATL skills,  including 
teambuilding,  negotiation  and  leadership.  It facilitates  an appreciation  of the environment,  and  the social 
and ethical implications of science and technology.
Full details of the requirements are in the Collaborative sciences project guide .

A1.1 Topic name
The name  of the topic  is preceded  by the letter  for the theme  (A–D)  and  the number  for the level  of 
biological organization (1–4) as listed in the syllabus roadmap .
Relevant theme and level of organization
The theme and level of organization show the conceptual lenses through which the topic can be viewed.
Recommended teaching time 
The approximate  number  of recommended  hours  for teaching  the topic  are given  together  for standard 
level and higher level .
Additional hours for higher level  are listed separately after the core teaching hours.
The recommended  teaching  time  includes  related  experimental  work,  relevant  material  from  “Skills  in the 
study of biology ”, and assessment of learning. However, it excludes the time allocated for the experimental 
programme.
Guiding questions
• These are overarching questions that frame the topic and guide inquiry.
• They help to link the material to the theme or to the level of biological organization.
Course content
Content listed under the SL and HL heading should be taught to both standard and higher level students.
Sections marked as additional higher level  should be taught only to HL students.
Each  topic  is divided  into  numbered  understandings  which  are in turn  divided  into  a content  statement 
and guidance. Some understandings will also include reference to the application of skills and NOS.
A1.1.1—The content statement  indicates the content to be taught.
Guidance  provides clarifications to the scope and requirements of the content statement and applications 
of skills within the content statement.
Application of skills  includes directed activities that connect the “understanding” with a skill.
The application directs an action such as drawing from observation or a micrograph, interpreting data, 
utilizing statistics, or designing or carrying out an experiment.
The following are not examples of the application of skills: drawing a diagram unaided to illustrate 
comprehension of a content statement, and learning examples to support the content statement.
Nature of science (NOS)  relates the content statement to the overarching theme of NOS .
Linking questions
• Two linking questions are provided at the end of each topic. The questions encourage students to 
recognize that the topics can be viewed through lenses other than a single theme or level of biological 
organization. They connect concepts from one topic to another. The intended outcome is networked 
knowledge.
• Teachers and students are encouraged to create their own linking questions.

Students should appreciate that the first cells originated in water and that water remains the medium in 
which most processes of life occur.
A1.1.2—Hydrogen bonds as a consequence of the polar covalent bonds within water molecules
Students should understand that polarity of covalent bonding within water molecules is due to unequal 
sharing of electrons and that hydrogen bonding due to this polarity occurs between water molecules.

properties of water with those of air and illustrate the consequences using examples of animals that live in 
water and in air or on land, such as the black-throated loon ( Gavia arctica ) and the ringed seal ( Pusa 
hispida ).
Note: When students are referring to an organism in an examination, either the common name or the scientific 
name is acceptable.
Additional higher level
A1.1.7—Extraplanetary origin of water on Earth and reasons for its retention

In diagrams of nucleotides use circles, pentagons and rectangles to represent relative positions of 
phosphates, pentose sugars and bases.Syllabus content
35 Biology guide
A1.2.3—Sugar–phosphate bonding and the sugar–phosphate “backbone” of DNA and RNA
Sugar–phosphate bonding makes a continuous chain of covalently bonded atoms in each strand of DNA 
or RNA nucleotides, which forms a strong “backbone” in the molecule.

polymers.
A1.2.6—DNA as a double helix made of two antiparallel strands of nucleotides with two strands linked by 
hydrogen bonding between complementary base pairs
In diagrams of DNA structure, students should draw the two strands antiparallel, but are not required to 
draw the helical shape. Students should show adenine (A) paired with thymine (T), and guanine (G) paired 
with cytosine (C). Students are not required to memorize the relative lengths of the purine and pyrimidine 
bases, or the numbers of hydrogen bonds.Syllabus content
36 Biology guide
A1.2.7—Differences between DNA and RNA

transcription and translation.
A1.2.12—Purine-to-pyrimidine bonding as a component of DNA helix stability
Adenine–thymine (A–T) and cytosine–guanine (C–G) pairs have equal length, so the DNA helix has the 
same three-dimensional structure, regardless of the base sequence.
A1.2.13—Structure of a nucleosome
Limit to a DNA molecule wrapped around a core of eight histone proteins held together by an additional 
histone protein attached to linker DNA.
Application of skills:  Students are required to use molecular visualization software to study the 
association between the proteins and DNA within a nucleosome.
A1.2.14—Evidence from the Hershey–Chase experiment for DNA as the genetic materialSyllabus content
37 Biology guide
Students should understand how the results of the experiment support the conclusion that DNA is the 
genetic material.
NOS:  Students should appreciate that technological developments can open up new possibilities for 
experiments. When radioisotopes were made available to scientists as research tools, the Hershey–Chase 
experiment became possible.
A1.2.15—Chargaff’s data on the relative amounts of pyrimidine and purine bases across diverse life forms
NOS:  Students should understand how the “problem of induction” is addressed by the “certainty of 
falsification”. In this case, Chargaff’s data falsified the tetranucleotide hypothesis that there was a 
repeating sequence of the four bases in DNA.
Linking questions

• How can polymerization result in emergent properties?
A2.1 Origins of cells
Unity and diversity—Cells
Additional higher level: 2 hours 
Guiding questions

• What intermediate stages could there have been between non-living matter and the first living cells?
Additional higher level
Note: There is no SL content in A2.1.
A2.1.1—Conditions on early Earth and the pre-biotic formation of carbon compounds
Include the lack of free oxygen and therefore ozone, higher concentrations of carbon dioxide and 
methane, resulting in higher temperatures and ultraviolet light penetration. The conditions may have 
caused a variety of carbon compounds to form spontaneously by chemical processes that do not now 
occur.
A2.1.2—Cells as the smallest units of self-sustaining life
Discuss the differences between something that is living and something that is non-living. Include reasons 
that viruses are considered to be non-living.
A2.1.3—Challenge of explaining the spontaneous origin of cells
Cells are highly complex structures that can currently only be produced by division of pre-existing cells. 
Students should be aware that catalysis, self-replication of molecules, self-assembly and the emergence of 
compartmentalization were necessary requirements for the evolution of the first cells.
NOS:  Students should appreciate that claims in science, including hypotheses and theories, must be 
testable. In some cases, scientists have to struggle with hypotheses that are difficult to test. In this case the 
exact conditions on pre-biotic Earth cannot be replicated and the first protocells did not fossilize.
A2.1.4—Evidence for the origin of carbon compounds
Evaluate the Miller–Urey experiment.Syllabus content
38 Biology guide
A2.1.5—Spontaneous formation of vesicles by coalescence of fatty acids into spherical bilayers
Formation of a membrane-bound compartment is needed to allow internal chemistry to become different 
from that outside the compartment.
A2.1.6—RNA as a presumed first genetic material
RNA can be replicated and has some catalytic activity so it may have acted initially as both the genetic 
material and the enzymes of the earliest cells. Ribozymes in the ribosome are still used to catalyse peptide 
bond formation during protein synthesis.
A2.1.7—Evidence for a last universal common ancestor
Include the universal genetic code and shared genes across all organisms. Include the likelihood of other 
forms of life having evolved but becoming extinct due to competition from the last universal common 
ancestor (LUCA) and descendants of LUCA.

staining, measuring sizes using an eyepiece graticule, focusing with coarse and fine adjustments, 
calculating actual size and magnification, producing a scale bar and taking photographs.Syllabus content
39 Biology guide
NOS:  Students should appreciate that measurement using instruments is a form of quantitative 
observation.
A2.2.3—Developments in microscopy
Include the advantages of electron microscopy, freeze fracture, cryogenic electron microscopy, and the 
use of fluorescent stains and immunofluorescence in light microscopy.
A2.2.4—Structures common to cells in all living organisms
Typical cells have DNA as genetic material and a cytoplasm composed mainly of water, which is enclosed 
by a plasma membrane composed of lipids. Students should understand the reasons for these structures.
A2.2.5—Prokaryote cell structure
Include these cell components: cell wall, plasma membrane, cytoplasm, naked DNA in a loop and 70S 
ribosomes. The type of prokaryotic cell structure required is that of Gram-positive eubacteria such as 
Bacillus and Staphylococcus . Students should appreciate that prokaryote cell structure varies. However, 
students are not required to know details of the variations such as the lack of cell walls in phytoplasmas 
and mycoplasmas.
A2.2.6—Eukaryote cell structure
Students should be familiar with features common to eukaryote cells: a plasma membrane enclosing a 
compartmentalized cytoplasm with 80S ribosomes; a nucleus with chromosomes made of DNA bound to 
histones, contained in a double membrane with pores; membrane-bound cytoplasmic organelles 
including mitochondria, endoplasmic reticulum, Golgi apparatus and a variety of vesicles or vacuoles 
including lysosomes; and a cytoskeleton of microtubules and microfilaments.
A2.2.7—Processes of life in unicellular organisms
Include these functions: homeostasis, metabolism, nutrition, movement, excretion, growth, response to 
stimuli and reproduction.
A2.2.8—Differences in eukaryotic cell structure between animals, fungi and plants
Include presence and composition of cell walls, differences in size and function of vacuoles, presence of 
chloroplasts and other plastids, and presence of centrioles, cilia and flagella.
A2.2.9—Atypical cell structure in eukaryotes
Use numbers of nuclei to illustrate one type of atypical cell structure in aseptate fungal hyphae, skeletal 
muscle, red blood cells and phloem sieve tube elements.
A2.2.10—Cell types and cell structures viewed in light and electron micrographs
Application of skills:  Students should be able to identify cells in light and electron micrographs as 
prokaryote, plant or animal. In electron micrographs, students should be able to identify these structures: 
nucleoid region, prokaryotic cell wall, nucleus, mitochondrion, chloroplast, sap vacuole, Golgi apparatus, 
rough and smooth endoplasmic reticulum, chromosomes, ribosomes, cell wall, plasma membrane and 
microvilli.
A2.2.11—Drawing and annotation based on electron micrographs
Application of skills:  Students should be able to draw and annotate diagrams of organelles (nucleus, 
mitochondria, chloroplasts, sap vacuole, Golgi apparatus, rough and smooth endoplasmic reticulum and Syllabus content
40 Biology guide
chromosomes) as well as other cell structures (cell wall, plasma membrane, secretory vesicles and 
microvilli) shown in electron micrographs. Students are required to include the functions in their 
annotations.
Additional higher level
A2.2.12—Origin of eukaryotic cells by endosymbiosis
Evidence suggests that all eukaryotes evolved from a common unicellular ancestor that had a nucleus and 
reproduced sexually. Mitochondria then evolved by endosymbiosis. In some eukaryotes, chloroplasts 
subsequently also had an endosymbiotic origin. Evidence should include the presence in mitochondria 
and chloroplasts of 70S ribosomes, naked circular DNA and the ability to replicate.
NOS: Students should recognize that the strength of a theory comes from the observations the theory 
explains and the predictions it supports. A wide range of observations are accounted for by the theory of 
endosymbiosis.
A2.2.13—Cell differentiation as the process for developing specialized tissues in multicellular organisms
Students should be aware that the basis for differentiation is different patterns of gene expression often 
triggered by changes in the environment.
A2.2.14—Evolution of multicellularity
Students should be aware that multicellularity has evolved repeatedly. Many fungi and eukaryotic algae 
and all plants and animals are multicellular. Multicellularity has the advantages of allowing larger body size 
and cell specialization.
Linking questions
• What explains the use of certain molecular building blocks in all living cells?
• What are the features of a compelling theory?
A2.3 Viruses
Unity and diversity—Cells
Additional higher level: 2 hours 
Guiding questions
• How can viruses exist with so few genes?
• In what ways do viruses vary?
Additional higher level
Note: There is no SL content in A2.3.
A2.3.1—Structural features common to viruses
Relatively few features are shared by all viruses: small, fixed size; nucleic acid (DNA or RNA) as genetic 
material; a capsid made of protein; no cytoplasm; and few or no enzymes.
A2.3.2—Diversity of structure in viruses
Students should understand that viruses are highly diverse in their shape and structure. Genetic material 
may be RNA or DNA, which can be either single- or double-stranded. Some viruses are enveloped in host Syllabus content
41 Biology guide
cell membrane and others are not enveloped. Virus examples include bacteriophage lambda, 
coronaviruses and HIV.
A2.3.3—Lytic cycle of a virus
Students should appreciate that viruses rely on a host cell for energy supply, nutrition, protein synthesis 
and other life functions. Use bacteriophage lambda as an example of the phases in a lytic cycle.
A.2.3.4—Lysogenic cycle of a virus
Use bacteriophage lambda as an example.
A2.3.5—Evidence for several origins of viruses from other organisms
The diversity of viruses suggests several possible origins. Viruses share an extreme form of obligate 
parasitism as a mode of existence, so the structural features that they have in common could be regarded 
as convergent evolution. The genetic code is shared between viruses and living organisms.
A2.3.6—Rapid evolution in viruses
Include reasons for very rapid rates of evolution in some viruses. Use two examples of rapid evolution: 
evolution of influenza viruses and of HIV. Consider the consequences for treating diseases caused by 
rapidly evolving viruses.
Linking questions
• What mechanisms contribute to convergent evolution?
• To what extent is the natural history of life characterized by increasing complexity or simplicity?
A3.1 Diversity of organisms
Unity and diversity—Organisms
Standard level and higher level: 3 hours
Additional higher level: 2 hours 
Guiding questions
• What is a species?
• What patterns are seen in the diversity of genomes within and between species?
SL and HL
A3.1.1—Variation between organisms as a defining feature of life
Students should understand that no two individuals are identical in all their traits. The patterns of variation 
are complex and are the basis for naming and classifying organisms.
A3.1.2—Species as groups of organisms with shared traits
This is the original morphological concept of the species as used by Linnaeus.
A3.1.3—Binomial system for naming organismsSyllabus content
42 Biology guide
Students should know that the first part of the name identifies the genus, with the second part of the 
name distinguishing the species. Species in the same genus have similar traits. The genus name is given an 
initial capital letter but the species name is lowercase.
A3.1.4—Biological species concept
According to the biological species concept, a species is a group of organisms that can breed and produce 
fertile offspring. Include possible challenges associated with this definition of a species and that 
competing species definitions exist.
A3.1.5—Difficulties distinguishing between populations and species due to divergence of non-
interbreeding populations during speciation
Students should understand that speciation is the splitting of one species into two or more. It usually 
happens gradually rather than by a single act, with populations becoming more and more different in 
their traits. It can therefore be an arbitrary decision whether two populations are regarded as the same or 
different species.
A3.1.6—Diversity in chromosome numbers of plant and animal species
Students should know in general that diversity exists. As an example, students should know that humans 
have 46 chromosomes and chimpanzees have 48. Students are not required to know other specific 
chromosome numbers but should appreciate that diploid cells have an even number of chromosomes.
A3.1.7—Karyotyping and karyograms
Application of skills:  Students should be able to classify chromosomes by banding patterns, length and 
centromere position. Students should evaluate the evidence for the hypothesis that chromosome 2 in 
humans arose from the fusion of chromosomes 12 and 13 with a shared primate ancestor.
NOS:  Students should be able to distinguish between testable hypotheses such as the origin of 
chromosome 2 and non-testable statements.
A3.1.8—Unity and diversity of genomes within species
Students should understand that the genome is all the genetic information of an organism. Organisms in 
the same species share most of their genome but variations such as single-nucleotide polymorphisms give 
some diversity.
A3.1.9—Diversity of eukaryote genomes
Genomes vary in overall size, which is determined by the total amount of DNA. Genomes also vary in base 
sequence. Variation between species is much larger than variation within a species.
A3.1.10—Comparison of genome sizes
Application of skills:  Students should extract information about genome size for different taxonomic 
groups from a database to compare genome size to organism complexity.
A3.1.11—Current and potential future uses of whole genome sequencing
Include the increasing speed and decreasing costs. For current uses, include research into evolutionary 
relationships and for potential future uses, include personalized medicine.Syllabus content

A3.1.12—Difficulties applying the biological species concept to asexually reproducing species and to 
bacteria that have horizontal gene transfer
The biological species concept does not work well with groups of organisms that do not breed sexually or 
where genes can be transferred from one species to another.
A3.1.13—Chromosome number as a shared trait within a species
Cross-breeding between closely related species is unlikely to produce fertile offspring if parent 
chromosome numbers are different.
A3.1.14—Engagement with local plant or animal species to develop a dichotomous key
Application of skills:  Students should engage with local plant or animal species to develop a 
dichotomous key.
A3.1.15—Identification of species from environmental DNA in a habitat using barcodes
Using barcodes and environmental DNA allows the biodiversity of habitats to be investigated rapidly.

Guiding questions
• What tools are used to classify organisms into taxonomic groups?
• How do cladistic methods differ from traditional taxonomic methods?
Additional higher level
Note: There is no SL content in A3.2.
A3.2.1—Need for classification of organisms
Classification is needed because of the immense diversity of species. After classification is completed, a 
broad range of further study is facilitated.
A3.2.2—Difficulties classifying organisms into the traditional hierarchy of taxa
The traditional hierarchy of kingdom, phylum, class, order, family, genus and species does not always 
correspond to patterns of divergence generated by evolution.
NOS:  A fixed ranking of taxa (kingdom, phylum and so on) is arbitrary because it does not reflect the 
gradation of variation. Cladistics offers an alternative approach to classification using unranked clades. 
This is an example of the paradigm shift that sometimes occurs in scientific theories.
A3.2.3—Advantages of classification corresponding to evolutionary relationshipsSyllabus content
44 Biology guide
The ideal classification follows evolutionary relationships, so all the members of a taxonomic group have 
evolved from a common ancestor. Characteristics of organisms within such a group can be predicted 
because they are shared within a clade.
A3.2.4—Clades as groups of organisms with common ancestry and shared characteristics
The most objective evidence for placing organisms in the same clade comes from base sequences of 
genes or amino acid sequences of proteins. Morphological traits can be used to assign organisms to 
clades.
A3.2.5—Gradual accumulation of sequence differences as the basis for estimates of when clades diverged 
from a common ancestor
This method of estimating times is known as the “molecular clock”. The molecular clock can only give 
estimates because mutation rates are affected by the length of the generation time, the size of a 
population, the intensity of selective pressure and other factors.
A3.2.6—Base sequences of genes or amino acid sequences of proteins as the basis for constructing 
cladograms
Examples can be simple and based on sample data to illustrate the tool.
NOS:  Students should recognize that different criteria for judgement can lead to different hypotheses. 
Here, parsimony analysis is used to select the most probable cladogram, in which observed sequence 
variation between clades is accounted for with the smallest number of sequence changes.
A3.2.7—Analysing cladograms
Students should be able to deduce evolutionary relationships, common ancestors and clades from a 
cladogram. They should understand the terms “root”, “node” and “terminal branch” and also that a node 
represents a hypothetical common ancestor.
A3.2.8—Using cladistics to investigate whether the classification of groups corresponds to evolutionary 
relationships
A case study of transfer of plant species between families could be used to develop understanding, for 
example the reclassification of the figwort family ( Scrophulariaceae ). However, students are not required to 
memorize the details of the case study.
NOS:  Students should appreciate that theories and other scientific knowledge claims may eventually be 
falsified. In this example, similarities in morphology due to convergent evolution rather than common 
ancestry suggested a classification that by cladistics has been shown to be false.
Note: When students are referring to organisms in an examination, either the common name or the scientific 
name is acceptable. 
A3.2.9—Classification of all organisms into three domains using evidence from rRNA base sequences
This is the revolutionary reclassification with an extra taxonomic level above kingdoms that was proposed 
in 1977.

A4.1 Evolution and speciation
Unity and diversity—Ecosystems
Standard level and higher level: 4 hours
Additional higher level: 1 hour 
Guiding questions
• What is the evidence for evolution?
• How do analogous and homologous structures exemplify commonality and diversity?
SL and HL
A4.1.1—Evolution as change in the heritable characteristics of a population
This definition helps to distinguish Darwinian evolution from Lamarckism. Acquired changes that are not 
genetic in origin are not regarded as evolution.
NOS:  The theory of evolution by natural selection predicts and explains a broad range of observations and 
is unlikely ever to be falsified. However, the nature of science makes it impossible to formally prove that it 
is true by correspondence. It is a pragmatic truth and is therefore referred to as a theory, despite all the 
supporting evidence.
A4.1.2—Evidence for evolution from base sequences in DNA or RNA and amino acid sequences in proteins
Sequence data gives powerful evidence of common ancestry.
A4.1.3—Evidence for evolution from selective breeding of domesticated animals and crop plants
Variation between different domesticated animal breeds and varieties of crop plant, and between them 
and the original wild species, shows how rapidly evolutionary changes can occur.
A4.1.4—Evidence for evolution from homologous structures
Include the example of pentadactyl limbs.
A4.1.5—Convergent evolution as the origin of analogous structures
Students should understand that analogous structures have the same function but different evolutionary 
origins. Students should know at least one example of analogous features.
A4.1.6—Speciation by splitting of pre-existing species
Students should appreciate that this is the only way in which new species have appeared. Students should 
also understand that speciation increases the total number of species on Earth, and extinction decreases it. 
Students should also understand that gradual evolutionary change in a species is not speciation.
A4.1.7—Roles of reproductive isolation and differential selection in speciation
Include geographical isolation as a means of achieving reproductive isolation. Use the separation of 
bonobos and common chimpanzees by the Congo River as a specific example of divergence due to 
differential selection.
Additional higher level
A4.1.8—Differences and similarities between sympatric and allopatric speciationSyllabus content
46 Biology guide
Students should understand that reproductive isolation can be geographic, behavioural or temporal.
A4.1.9—Adaptive radiation as a source of biodiversity
Adaptive radiation allows closely related species to coexist without competing, thereby increasing 
biodiversity in ecosystems where there are vacant niches.
A4.1.10—Barriers to hybridization and sterility of interspecific hybrids as mechanisms for of preventing the 
mixing of alleles between species
Courtship behaviour often prevents hybridization in animal species. A mule is an example of a sterile 
hybrid.
A4.1.11—Abrupt speciation in plants by hybridization and polyploidy
Use knotweed or smartweed (genus Persicaria ) as an example because it contains many species that have 
been formed by these processes.
Note: When students are referring to organisms in an examination, either the common name or the scientific 
name is acceptable.

Guiding questions
• What factors are causing the sixth mass extinction of species?
• How can conservationists minimize the loss of biodiversity?
SL and HL
A4.2.1—Biodiversity as the variety of life in all its forms, levels and combinations
Include ecosystem diversity, species diversity and genetic diversity.
A4.2.2—Comparisons between current number of species on Earth and past levels of biodiversity
Millions of species have been discovered, named and described but there are many more species to be 
discovered. Evidence from fossils suggests that there are currently more species alive on Earth today than 
at any time in the past.
NOS:  Classification is an example of pattern recognition but the same observations can be classified in 
different ways. For example, “splitters” recognize more species than “lumpers” in a taxonomic group.
A4.2.3—Causes of anthropogenic species extinction
This should be a study of the causes of the current sixth mass extinction, rather than of non-anthropogenic 
causes of previous mass extinctions.Syllabus content
47 Biology guide
To give a range of causes, carry out three or more brief case studies of species extinction: North Island 
giant moas ( Dinornis novaezealandiae ) as an example of the loss of terrestrial megafauna, Caribbean monk 
seals ( Neomonachus tropicalis ) as an example of the loss of a marine species, and one other species that 
has gone extinct from an area that is familiar to students.
Note: When students are referring to organisms in an examination, either the common name or the scientific 
name is acceptable.
A4.2.4—Causes of ecosystem loss
Students should study only causes that are directly or indirectly anthropogenic. Include two case studies 
of ecosystem loss. One should be the loss of mixed dipterocarp forest in Southeast Asia, and the other 
should, if possible, be of a lost ecosystem from an area that is familiar to students.
A4.2.5—Evidence for a biodiversity crisis
Evidence can be drawn from Intergovernmental Science-Policy Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem 
Services reports and other sources. Results from reliable surveys of biodiversity in a wide range of habitats 
around the world are required. Students should understand that surveys need to be repeated to provide 
evidence of change in species richness and evenness. Note that there are opportunities for contributions 
from both expert scientists and citizen scientists.
NOS:  To be verifiable, evidence usually has to come from a published source, which has been peer-
reviewed and allows methodology to be checked. Data recorded by citizens rather than scientists brings 
not only benefits but also unique methodological concerns.
A4.2.6—Causes of the current biodiversity crisis
Include human population growth as an overarching cause, together with these specific causes: hunting 
and other forms of over-exploitation; urbanization; deforestation and clearance of land for agriculture with 
consequent loss of natural habitat; pollution and spread of pests, diseases and invasive alien species due 
to global transport.
A4.2.7—Need for several approaches to conservation of biodiversity
No single approach by itself is sufficient, and different species require different measures. Include in situ 
conservation of species in natural habitats, management of nature reserves, rewilding and reclamation of 
degraded ecosystems, ex situ conservation in zoos and botanic gardens and storage of germ plasm in 
seed or tissue banks.
A4.2.8—Selection of evolutionarily distinct and globally endangered species for conservation prioritization 
in the EDGE of Existence programme
Students should understand the rationale behind focusing conservation efforts on evolutionarily distinct 
and globally endangered species (EDGE).
NOS:  Issues such as which species should be prioritized for conservation efforts have complex ethical, 
environmental, political, social, cultural and economic implications and therefore need to be debated.

B1.1.2—Production of macromolecules by condensation reactions that link monomers to form a polymer
Students should be familiar with examples of polysaccharides, polypeptides and nucleic acids.
B1.1.3—Digestion of polymers into monomers by hydrolysis reactions
Water molecules are split to provide the -H and -OH groups that are incorporated to produce monomers, 
hence the name of this type of reaction.
B1.1.4—Form and function of monosaccharides
Students should be able to recognize pentoses and hexoses as monosaccharides from molecular diagrams

yield of energy from oxidation as properties.
B1.1.5—Polysaccharides as energy storage compounds
Include the compact nature of starch in plants and glycogen in animals due to coiling and branching 
during polymerization, the relative insolubility of these compounds due to large molecular size and the 
relative ease of adding or removing alpha-glucose monomers by condensation and hydrolysis to build or 
mobilize energy stores.
B1.1.6—Structure of cellulose related to its function as a structural polysaccharide in plants

B1.1.9—Formation of triglycerides and phospholipids by condensation reactions
One glycerol molecule can link three fatty acid molecules or two fatty acid molecules and one phosphate 
group.
B1.1.10—Difference between saturated, monounsaturated and polyunsaturated fatty acids

B1.2.2—Condensation reactions forming dipeptides and longer chains of amino acids
Students should be able to write the word equation for this reaction and draw a generalized dipeptide 
after modelling the reaction with molecular models.
B1.2.3—Dietary requirements for amino acids
Essential amino acids cannot be synthesized and must be obtained from food. Non-essential amino acids 
can be made from other amino acids. Students are not required to give examples of essential and non-
essential amino acids. Vegan diets require attention to ensure essential amino acids are consumed.
B1.2.4—Infinite variety of possible peptide chains
Include the ideas that 20 amino acids are coded for in the genetic code, that peptide chains can have any 
number of amino acids, from a few to thousands, and that amino acids can be in any order. Students 
should be familiar with examples of polypeptides.
B1.2.5—Effect of pH and temperature on protein structure
Include the term “denaturation”.
Additional higher level
B1.2.6—Chemical diversity in the R-groups of amino acids as a basis for the immense diversity in protein 
form and function
Students are not required to give specific examples of R-groups. However, students should understand 
that R-groups determine the properties of assembled polypeptides. Students should appreciate that R-
groups are hydrophobic or hydrophilic and that hydrophilic R-groups are polar or charged, acidic or basic.
B1.2.7—Impact of primary structure on the conformation of proteins
Students should understand that the sequence of amino acids and the precise position of each amino acid 
within a structure determines the three-dimensional shape of proteins. Proteins therefore have precise, 
predictable and repeatable structures, despite their complexity.
B1.2.8—Pleating and coiling of secondary structure of proteins
Include hydrogen bonding in regular positions to stabilize alpha helices and beta-pleated sheets.
B1.2.9—Dependence of tertiary structure on hydrogen bonds, ionic bonds, disulfide covalent bonds and 
hydrophobic interactions
Students are not required to name examples of amino acids that participate in these types of bonding, 
apart from pairs of cysteines forming disulfide bonds. Students should understand that amine and 
carboxyl groups in R-groups can become positively or negatively charged by binding or dissociation of 
hydrogen ions and that they can then participate in ionic bonding.
B1.2.10—Effect of polar and non-polar amino acids on tertiary structure of proteins
In proteins that are soluble in water, hydrophobic amino acids are clustered in the core of globular 
proteins. Integral proteins have regions with hydrophobic amino acids, helping them to embed in 
membranes.
B1.2.11—Quaternary structure of non-conjugated and conjugated proteinsSyllabus content

B2.1.1—Lipid bilayers as the basis of cell membranes
Phospholipids and other amphipathic lipids naturally form continuous sheet-like bilayers in water.
B2.1.2—Lipid bilayers as barriers
Students should understand that the hydrophobic hydrocarbon chains that form the core of a membrane 
have low permeability to large molecules and hydrophilic particles, including ions and polar molecules, so 
membranes function as effective barriers between aqueous solutions.
B2.1.3—Simple diffusion across membranes
Use movement of oxygen and carbon dioxide molecules between phospholipids as an example of simple 
diffusion across membranes.
B2.1.4—Integral and peripheral proteins in membranes
Emphasize that membrane proteins have diverse structures, locations and functions. Integral proteins are 
embedded in one or both of the lipid layers of a membrane. Peripheral proteins are attached to one or 
other surface of the bilayer.

B2.1.6—Channel proteins for facilitated diffusion
Students should understand how the structure of channel proteins makes membranes selectively 
permeable by allowing specific ions to diffuse through when channels are open but not when they are 
closed.
B2.1.7—Pump proteins for active transport
Students should appreciate that pumps use energy from adenosine triphosphate (ATP) to transfer specific 
particles across membranes and therefore that they can move particles against a concentration gradient.
B2.1.8—Selectivity in membrane permeability
Facilitated diffusion and active transport allow selective permeability in membranes. Permeability by 
simple diffusion is not selective and depends only on the size and hydrophilic or hydrophobic properties 
of particles.
B.2.1.9—Structure and function of glycoproteins and glycolipids
Limit to carbohydrate structures linked to proteins or lipids in membranes, location of carbohydrates on 
the extracellular side of membranes, and roles in cell adhesion and cell recognition.
B2.1.10—Fluid mosaic model of membrane structure

hydrophobic and hydrophilic regions.
Additional higher level
B2.1.11—Relationships between fatty acid composition of lipid bilayers and their fluidity
Unsaturated fatty acids in lipid bilayers have lower melting points, so membranes are fluid and therefore 
flexible at temperatures experienced by a cell. Saturated fatty acids have higher melting points and make 
membranes stronger at higher temperatures. Students should be familiar with an example of adaptations 
in membrane composition in relation to habitat.
B2.1.12—Cholesterol and membrane fluidity in animal cells
Students should understand the position of cholesterol molecules in membranes and also that cholesterol 
acts as a modulator (adjustor) of membrane fluidity, stabilizing membranes at higher temperatures and 
preventing stiffening at lower temperatures.
B2.1.13—Membrane fluidity and the fusion and formation of vesicles
Include the terms “endocytosis” and “exocytosis”, and examples of each process.

B2.2.1—Organelles as discrete subunits of cells that are adapted to perform specific functions
Students should understand that the cell wall, cytoskeleton and cytoplasm are not considered organelles, 
and that nuclei, vesicles, ribosomes and the plasma membrane are.
NOS:  Students should recognize that progress in science often follows development of new techniques. 
For example, study of the function of individual organelles became possible when ultracentrifuges had 
been invented and methods of using them for cell fractionation had been developed.
B2.2.2—Advantage of the separation of the nucleus and cytoplasm into separate compartments
Limit to separation of the activities of gene transcription and translation—post-transcriptional 
modification of mRNA can happen before the mRNA meets ribosomes in the cytoplasm. In prokaryotes 
this is not possible—mRNA may immediately meet ribosomes.
B2.2.3—Advantages of compartmentalization in the cytoplasm of cells

Limit to two example locations and the understanding that the stem cell niche can maintain the cells or 
promote their proliferation and differentiation. Bone marrow and hair follicles are suitable examples.
B2.3.4—Differences between totipotent, pluripotent and multipotent stem cells
Students should appreciate that cells in early-stage animal embryos are totipotent but soon become 
pluripotent, whereas stem cells in adult tissue such as bone marrow are multipotent.
B2.3.5—Cell size as an aspect of specialization
Consider the range of cell size in humans including male and female gametes, red and white blood cells, 
neurons and striated muscle fibres.
B2.3.6—Surface area-to-volume ratios and constraints on cell size
Students should understand the mathematical ratio between volume and surface area and that exchange 
of materials across a cell surface depends on its area whereas the need for exchange depends on cell 
volume.
NOS: Students should recognize that models are simplified versions of complex systems. In this case, 
surface-area-to-volume relationship can be modelled using cubes of different side lengths. Although the 
cubes have a simpler shape than real organisms, scale factors operate in the same way.

Limit to extreme thinness to reduce distances for diffusion in type I pneumocytes and the presence of 
many secretory vesicles (lamellar bodies) in the cytoplasm that discharge surfactant to the alveolar lumen 
in type II pneumocytes. Alveolar epithelium is an example of a tissue where more than one cell type is 
present, because different adaptations are required for the overall function of the tissue.

• How are multicellular organisms adapted to carry out gas exchange?
• What are the similarities and differences in gas exchange between a flowering plant and a mammal?
SL and HL
B3.1.1—Gas exchange as a vital function in all organisms
Students should appreciate that the challenges become greater as organisms increase in size because 
surface area-to-volume ratio decreases with increasing size, and the distance from the centre of an 
organism to its exterior increases.
B3.1.2—Properties of gas-exchange surfaces

Application of skills:  Students should be able to distinguish arteries and veins in micrographs from the 
structure of a vessel wall and its thickness relative to the diameter of the lumen.
B3.2.3—Adaptations of arteries for the transport of blood away from the heartSyllabus content

Application of skills:  Students should be able to evaluate epidemiological data relating to the incidence 
of coronary heart disease.
NOS:  Students should understand that correlation coefficients quantify correlations between variables 
and allow the strength of the relationship to be assessed. Low correlation coefficients or lack of any 
correlation could provide evidence against a hypothesis, but even strong correlations such as that 
between saturated fat intake and coronary heart disease do not prove a causal link.
B3.2.7—Transport of water from roots to leaves during transpiration
Students should understand that loss of water by transpiration from cell walls in leaf cells causes water to 
be drawn out of xylem vessels and through cell walls by capillary action, generating tension (negative 
pressure potentials). It is this tension that draws water up in the xylem. Cohesion ensures a continuous 
column of water.
B3.2.8—Adaptations of xylem vessels for transport of water
Include the lack of cell contents and incomplete or absent end walls for unimpeded flow, lignified walls to 
withstand tensions, and pits for entry and exit of water.

Application of skills:  Students should understand the sequence of events in the left side of the heart that 
follow the initiation of the heartbeat by the sinoatrial node (the “pacemaker”). Students should be able to 
interpret systolic and diastolic blood pressure measurements from data and graphs.
B3.2.17—Generation of root pressure in xylem vessels by active transport of mineral ions
Root pressure is positive pressure potential, generated to cause water movement in roots and stems when 
transport in xylem due to transpiration is insufficient, for example when high humidity prevents 
transpiration or in spring, before leaves on deciduous plants have opened.

Include sieve plates, reduced cytoplasm and organelles, no nucleus for sieve tube elements and presence 
of many mitochondria for companion cells and plasmodesmata between them. Students should 
appreciate how these adaptations ease the flow of sap and enhance loading of carbon compounds into 
phloem sieve tubes at sources and unloading of them at sinks.

many other mixotrophic species are part of oceanic plankton. Students should understand that some 
mixotrophs are obligate and others are facultative.
B4.2.6—Saprotrophic nutrition in some fungi and bacteria
Fungi and bacteria with this mode of heterotrophic nutrition can be referred to as decomposers.

appreciate that there are many such receptors in humans.
C2.1.10—Mechanism of action of epinephrine (adrenaline) receptors
Include the roles of a G protein and cyclic AMP (cAMP) as the second messenger.
NOS:  Students should be aware that naming conventions are an example of international cooperation in 
science for mutual benefit. Both “adrenaline” and “epinephrine” were coined by researchers and are based 
on production of the hormone by the adrenal gland; “adrenaline” comes from Latin ad = at and ren = 
kidney and “epinephrine” comes from old Greek epi = above and nephros  = kidney, respectively. Unusually, 
these two terms persist in common use in different parts of the world.
C2.1.11—Transmembrane receptors with tyrosine kinase activity
Use the protein hormone insulin as an example. Limit this to binding of insulin to a receptor in the plasma 
membrane, causing phosphorylation of tyrosine inside a cell. This leads to a sequence of reactions ending 
with movement of vesicles containing glucose transporters to the plasma membrane.
C2.1.12—Intracellular receptors that affect gene expression
Use the steroid hormones oestradiol, progesterone and testosterone as examples. Students should 
understand that the signalling chemical binds to a site on a receptor, activating it. The activated receptor 
binds to specific DNA sequences to promote gene transcription.
C2.1.13—Effects of the hormones oestradiol and progesterone on target cells
For oestradiol, limit to cells in the hypothalamus that secrete gonadotropin-releasing hormone. For 
progesterone, limit to cells in the endometrium.
C2.1.14—Regulation of cell signalling pathways by positive and negative feedback
Limit to an understanding of the difference between these two forms of regulation and a brief outline of 
one example of each.

SL and HL
C2.2.1—Neurons as cells within the nervous system that carry electrical impulses
Students should understand that cytoplasm and a nucleus form the cell body of a neuron, with elongated 
nerve fibres of varying length projecting from it. An axon is a long single fibre. Dendrites are multiple 
shorter fibres. Electrical impulses are conducted along these fibres.
C2.2.2—Generation of the resting potential by pumping to establish and maintain concentration 
gradients of sodium and potassium ions
Students should understand how energy from ATP drives the pumping of sodium and potassium ions in 
opposite directions across the plasma membrane of neurons. They should understand the concept of a 
membrane polarization and a membrane potential and also reasons that the resting potential is negative.
C2.2.3—Nerve impulses as action potentials that are propagated along nerve fibres
Students should appreciate that a nerve impulse is electrical because it involves movement of positively 
charged ions.
C2.2.4—Variation in the speed of nerve impulses
Compare the speed of transmission in giant axons of squid and smaller non-myelinated nerve fibres. Also 
compare the speed in myelinated and non-myelinated fibres.
Application of skills:  Students should be able to describe negative and positive correlations and apply 
correlation coefficients as a mathematical tool to determine the strength of these correlations. Students 
should also be able to apply the coefficient of determination ( R2) to evaluate the degree to which variation 
in the independent variable explains the variation in the dependent variable. For example, conduction 
speed of nerve impulses is negatively correlated with animal size, but positively correlated with axon 
diameter.
C2.2.5—Synapses as junctions between neurons and between neurons and effector cells
Limit to chemical synapses, not electrical, and these can simply be referred to as synapses. Students 
should understand that a signal can only pass in one direction across a typical synapse.
C2.2.6—Release of neurotransmitters from a presynaptic membrane
Include uptake of calcium in response to depolarization of a presynaptic membrane and its action as a 
signalling chemical inside a neuron.

Use neonicotinoids as an example of a pesticide that blocks synaptic transmission, and cocaine as an 
example of a drug that blocks reuptake of the neurotransmitter.
C2.2.13—Inhibitory neurotransmitters and generation of inhibitory postsynaptic potentials
Students should know that the postsynaptic membrane becomes hyperpolarized.
C2.2.14—Summation of the effects of excitatory and inhibitory neurotransmitters in a postsynaptic neuron
Multiple presynaptic neurons interact with all-or-nothing consequences in terms of postsynaptic 
depolarization.
C2.2.15—Perception of pain by neurons with free nerve endings in the skin
Students should know that these nerve endings have channels for positively charged ions, which open in 
response to a stimulus such as high temperature, acid, or certain chemicals such as capsaicin in chilli 
peppers. Entry of positively charged ions causes the threshold potential to be reached and nerve impulses 
then pass through the neurons to the brain, where pain is perceived.
C2.2.16—Consciousness as a property that emerges from the interaction of individual neurons in the brain
Emergent properties such as consciousness are another example of the consequences of interaction.

This is a necessary process in living systems. Coordination is needed for component parts of a system to 
collectively perform an overall function.
C3.1.2—Cells, tissues, organs and body systems as a hierarchy of subsystems that are integrated in a 
multicellular living organism
Students should appreciate that this integration is responsible for emergent properties. For example, a

C3.1.3—Integration of organs in animal bodies by hormonal and nervous signalling and by transport of 
materials and energy
Distinguish between the roles of the nervous system and endocrine system in sending messages. Using 
examples, emphasize the role of the blood system in transporting materials between organs.

Limit to the role of the brain in processing information combined from several inputs and in learning and 
memory. Students are not required to know details such as the role of slow-acting neurotransmitters.
C3.1.5—The spinal cord as an integrating centre for unconscious processes
Students should understand the difference between conscious and unconscious processes.
C3.1.6—Input to the spinal cord and cerebral hemispheres through sensory neurons

nervous system.
C3.1.7—Output from the cerebral hemispheres to muscles through motor neurons
Students should understand that muscles are stimulated to contract.
C3.1.8—Nerves as bundles of nerve fibres of both sensory and motor neurons
Use a transverse section of a nerve to show the protective sheath, and myelinated and unmyelinated 
nerve fibres.
C3.1.9—Pain reflex arcs as an example of involuntary responses with skeletal muscle as the effector

Students should have a general understanding, but are not required to know differences between 
mechanisms used in the anterior and posterior pituitary.
C3.1.14—Feedback control of heart rate following sensory input from baroreceptors and chemoreceptors
Include the location of baroreceptors and chemoreceptors.
Baroreceptors monitor blood pressure. Chemoreceptors monitor blood pH and concentrations of oxygen 
and carbon dioxide. Students should understand the role of the medulla in coordinating responses and 
sending nerve impulses to the heart to change the heart’s stroke volume and heart rate.
C3.1.15—Feedback control of ventilation rate following sensory input from chemoreceptors
Students should understand the causes of pH changes in the blood. These changes are monitored by 
chemoreceptors in the brainstem and lead to the control of ventilation rate using signals to the diaphragm 
and intercostal muscles.
C3.1.16—Control of peristalsis in the digestive system by the central nervous system and enteric nervous 
system
Limit to initiation of swallowing of food and egestion of faeces being under voluntary control by the 
central nervous system (CNS) but peristalsis between these points in the digestive system being under 
involuntary control by the enteric nervous system (ENS). The action of the ENS ensures passage of material 
through the gut is coordinated.

C3.1.17—Observations of tropic responses in seedlings
Application of skills:  Students should gather qualitative data, using diagrams to record their observations 
of seedlings illustrating tropic responses. They could also collect quantitative data by measuring the angle 
of curvature of seedlings.
NOS: Students should be able to distinguish between qualitative and quantitative observations and 
understand factors that limit the precision of measurements and their accuracy. Strategies for increasing 
the precision, accuracy and reliability of measurements in tropism experiments could be considered.
C3.1.18—Positive phototropism as a directional growth response to lateral light in plant shoots
Students are not required to know specific examples of other tropisms.
C3.1.19—Phytohormones as signalling chemicals controlling growth, development and response to 
stimuli in plantsSyllabus content
77 Biology guide
Students should appreciate that a variety of chemicals are used as phytohormones in plants.
C3.1.20—Auxin efflux carriers as an example of maintaining concentration gradients of phytohormones
Auxin can diffuse freely into plant cells but not out of them. Auxin efflux carriers can be positioned in a cell 
membrane on one side of the cell. If all cells coordinate to concentrate these carriers on the same side, 
auxin is actively transported from cell to cell through the plant tissue and becomes concentrated in part of 
the plant. 
C3.1.21—Promotion of cell growth by auxin
Include auxin’s promotion of hydrogen ion secretion into the apoplast, acidifying the cell wall and thus 
loosening cross links between cellulose molecules and facilitating cell elongation. Concentration gradients 
of auxin cause the differences in growth rate needed for phototropism.
C3.1.22—Interactions between auxin and cytokinin as a means of regulating root and shoot growth
Students should understand that root tips produce cytokinin, which is transported to shoots, and shoot 
tips produce auxin, which is transported to roots. Interactions between these phytohormones help to 
ensure that root and shoot growth are integrated.
C3.1.23—Positive feedback in fruit ripening and ethylene production
Ethylene (IUPAC name: ethene) stimulates the changes in fruits that occur during ripening, and ripening 
also stimulates increased production of ethylene. Students should understand the benefit of this positive 
feedback mechanism in ensuring that fruit ripening is rapid and synchronized.

Guiding questions
• How do body systems recognize pathogens and fight infections?
• What factors influence the incidence of disease in populations?
SL and HL
C3.2.1—Pathogens as the cause of infectious diseases
Students should understand that a broad range of disease-causing organisms can infect humans. A 
disease-causing organism is known as a pathogen, although typically the term is reserved for viruses, 
bacteria, fungi and protists. Archaea are not known to cause any diseases in humans.
NOS: Students should be aware that careful observation can lead to important progress. For example, 
careful observations during 19th-century epidemics of childbed fever (due to an infection after childbirth) 
in Vienna and cholera in London led to breakthroughs in the control of infectious disease.
C3.2.2—Skin and mucous membranes as a primary defenceSyllabus content
78 Biology guide
The skin acts as both a physical and chemical barrier to pathogens. Students are not required to draw or 
label diagrams of skin.
C3.2.3—Sealing of cuts in skin by blood clotting
Include release of clotting factors from platelets and the subsequent cascade pathway that results in rapid 
conversion of fibrinogen to fibrin by thrombin and trapping of erythrocytes to form a clot. No further 
details are required.
C3.2.4—Differences between the innate immune system and the adaptive immune system
Include the idea that the innate system responds to broad categories of pathogen and does not change 
during an organism’s life whereas the adaptive system responds in a specific way to particular pathogens 
and builds up a memory of pathogens encountered, so the immune response becomes more effective. 
Students are not required to know any components of the innate immune system other than phagocytes.
C3.2.5—Infection control by phagocytes
Include amoeboid movement from blood to sites of infection, where phagocytes recognize pathogens, 
engulf them by endocytosis and digest them using enzymes from lysosomes.
C3.2.6—Lymphocytes as cells in the adaptive immune system that cooperate to produce antibodies
Students should understand that lymphocytes both circulate in the blood and are contained in lymph 
nodes. They should appreciate that an individual has a very large number of B-lymphocytes that each 
make a specific type of antibody.
C3.2.7—Antigens as recognition molecules that trigger antibody production
Students should appreciate that most antigens are glycoproteins or other proteins and that they are 
usually located on the outer surfaces of pathogens. Antigens on the surface of erythrocytes may stimulate 
antibody production if transfused into a person with a different blood group.
C3.2.8—Activation of B-lymphocytes by helper T-lymphocytes
Students should understand that there are antigen-specific B-cells and helper T-cells. B-cells produce 
antibodies and become memory cells only when they have been activated. Activation requires both direct 
interaction with the specific antigen and contact with a helper T-cell that has also become activated by the 
same type of antigen.
C3.2.9—Multiplication of activated B-lymphocytes to form clones of antibody-secreting plasma cells
There are relatively small numbers of B-cells that respond to a specific antigen. To produce sufficient 
quantities of antibody, activated B-cells first divide by mitosis to produce large numbers of plasma B-cells 
that are capable of producing the same type of antibody.
C3.2.10—Immunity as a consequence of retaining memory cells
Students should understand that immunity is the ability to eliminate an infectious disease from the body. 
It is due to the long-term survival of lymphocytes that are capable of making the specific antibodies 
needed to fight the infection. These are memory cells.
C3.2.11—Transmission of HIV in body fluids
Include examples of the mechanisms of HIV (human immunodeficiency virus) transmission.Syllabus content
79 Biology guide
C3.2.12—Infection of lymphocytes by HIV with AIDS as a consequence
Students should understand that only certain types of lymphocyte are infected and killed, but that a 
reduction in these lymphocytes limits the ability to produce antibodies and fight opportunistic infections.
C3.2.13—Antibiotics as chemicals that block processes occurring in bacteria but not in eukaryotic cells
Include reasons that antibiotics fail to control infection with viruses.
C3.2.14—Evolution of resistance to several antibiotics in strains of pathogenic bacteria
Students should understand that careful use of antibiotics is necessary to slow the emergence of 
multiresistant bacteria.
NOS: Students should recognize that the development of new techniques can lead to new avenues of 
research; for example, the recent technique of searching chemical libraries is yielding new antibiotics.
C3.2.15—Zoonoses as infectious diseases that can transfer from other species to humans
Illustrate the prevalence of zoonoses as infectious diseases in humans and their varied modes of infection 
with several examples including tuberculosis, rabies and Japanese encephalitis. Include COVID-19 as an 
infectious disease that has recently transferred from another species, with profound consequences for 
humans.
C3.2.16—Vaccines and immunization
Students should understand that vaccines contain antigens, or nucleic acids (DNA or RNA) with sequences 
that code for antigens, and that they stimulate the development of immunity to a specific pathogen 
without causing the disease.
C3.2.17—Herd immunity and the prevention of epidemics
Students should understand how members of a population are interdependent in building herd 
immunity. If a sufficient percentage of a population is immune to a disease, transmission is greatly 
impeded.
NOS:  Scientists publish their research so that other scientists can evaluate it. The media often report on 
the research while evaluation is still happening, and consumers need to be aware of this. Vaccines are 
tested rigorously and the risks of side effects are minimal but not nil. The distinction between pragmatic 
truths and certainty is poorly understood.
C3.2.18—Evaluation of data related to the COVID-19 pandemic
Application of skills:  Students should have the opportunity to calculate both percentage difference and 
percentage change.

Students should understand that members of a population normally breed and that reproductive isolation 
is used to distinguish one population of a species from another.
C4.1.2—Estimation of population size by random sampling
Students should understand reasons for estimating population size, rather than counting every individual, 
and the need for randomness in sampling procedures.
NOS: Students should be aware that random sampling, instead of measuring an entire population, 
inevitably results in sampling error. In this case the difference between the estimate of population size and 
the true size of the whole population is the sampling error.
C4.1.3—Random quadrat sampling to estimate population size for sessile organisms
Both sessile animals and plants, where the numbers of individuals can be counted, are suitable.
Application of skills: Students should understand what is indicated by the standard deviation of a mean. 
Students do not need to memorize the formula used to calculate this. In this example, the standard 
deviation of the mean number of individuals per quadrat could be determined using a calculator to give a 
measure of the variation and how evenly the population is spread.
C4.1.4—Capture–mark–release–recapture and the Lincoln index to estimate population size for motile 
organisms
Application of skills:  Students should use the Lincoln index to estimate population size. 
Population size estimate= M×N
R  , where M  is the number of individuals caught and marked initially, N  is 
the total number of individuals recaptured and R  is the number of marked individuals recaptured. 
Students should understand the assumptions made when using this method.
C4.1.5—Carrying capacity and competition for limited resources
A simple definition of carrying capacity is sufficient, with some examples of resources that may limit 
carrying capacity.
C4.1.6—Negative feedback control of population size by density-dependent factors
Numbers of individuals in a population may fluctuate due to density-independent factors, but density-
dependent factors tend to push the population back towards the carrying capacity. In addition to 
competition for limited resources, include the increased risk of predation and the transfer of pathogens or 
pests in dense populations.
C4.1.7—Population growth curves
Students should study at least one case study in an ecosystem. Students should understand reasons for 
exponential growth in the initial phases. A lag phase is not expected as a part of sigmoid population 
growth.
NOS:  The curve represents an idealized graphical model. Students should recognize that models are often 
simplifications of complex systems.Syllabus content
81 Biology guide
Application of skills:  Students should test the growth of a population against the model of exponential 
growth using a graph with a logarithmic scale for size of population on the vertical axis and a non-
logarithmic scale for time on the horizontal axis.
C4.1.8—Modelling of the sigmoid population growth curve
Application of skills:  Students should collect data regarding population growth. Yeast and duckweed are 
recommended but other organisms that proliferate under experimental conditions could be used.

C4.1.12—Mutualism as an interspecific relationship that benefits both species
Include these examples: root nodules in Fabaceae (legume family), mycorrhizae in Orchidaceae (orchid 
family) and zooxanthellae in hard corals. In each case include the benefits to both organisms.
Note: When students are referring to organisms in an examination, either the common name or the scientific 
name is acceptable.
C4.1.13—Resource competition between endemic and invasive species
Choose one local example to illustrate competitive advantage over endemic species in resource 
acquisition as the basis for an introduced species becoming invasive.
C4.1.14—Tests for interspecific competition
Interspecific competition is indicated but not proven if one species is more successful in the absence of 
another. Students should appreciate the range of possible approaches to research: laboratory 
experiments, field observations by random sampling and field manipulation by removal of one species.
NOS:  Students should recognize that hypotheses can be tested by both experiments and observations 
and should understand the difference between them.
C4.1.15—Use of the chi-squared test for association between two species
Application of skills:  Students should be able to apply chi-squared tests on the presence/absence of two 
species in several sampling sites, exploring the differences or similarities in distribution. This may provide 
evidence for interspecific competition.
C4.1.16—Predator–prey relationships as an example of density-dependent control of animal populations
Include a real case study.
C4.1.17—Top-down and bottom-up control of populations in communitiesSyllabus content
82 Biology guide
Students should understand that both of these types of control are possible, but one or the other is likely 
to be dominant in a community.
C4.1.18—Allelopathy and secretion of antibiotics
These two processes are similar in that a chemical substance is released into the environment to deter 
potential competitors. Include one specific example of each—where possible, choose a local example.

Students should know that in closed systems only energy is able to pass in and out.
C4.2.2—Sunlight as the principal source of energy that sustains most ecosystems
Include exceptions such as ecosystems in caves and below the levels of light penetration in oceans.
NOS:  Laws in science are generalized principles, or rules of thumb, formulated to describe patterns 
observed in nature. Unlike theories, they do not offer explanations, but describe phenomena. Like 
theories, they can be used to make predictions. Students should be able to outline the features of useful 
generalizations.
C4.2.3—Flow of chemical energy through food chains
Students should appreciate that chemical energy passes to a consumer as it feeds on an organism that is 
the previous stage in a food chain.
C4.2.4—Construction of food chains and food webs to represent feeding relationships in a community
Represent relationships in a local community if possible. Arrows indicate the direction of transfer of energy 
and biomass.

simple inorganic substances
Students should understand that energy is required for carbon fixation and for the anabolic reactions that 
build macromolecules.
C4.2.7—Use of light as the external energy source in photoautotrophs and oxidation reactions as the 
energy source in chemoautotrophs
Students should understand that oxidation reactions release energy, so they are useful in living organisms. 
Include iron-oxidizing bacteria as an example of a chemoautotroph.
C4.2.8—Heterotrophs as organisms that use carbon compounds obtained from other organisms to 
synthesize the carbon compounds that they require
Students should appreciate that complex carbon compounds such as proteins and nucleic acids are 
digested either externally or internally and are then assimilated by constructing the carbon compounds 
that are required.
C4.2.9—Release of energy in both autotrophs and heterotrophs by oxidation of carbon compounds in cell 
respiration
Students are not required to be familiar with photoheterotrophs.
C4.2.10—Classification of organisms into trophic levels
Use the terms “producer”, “primary consumer”, “secondary consumer” and “tertiary consumer”. Students 
should appreciate that many organisms have a varied diet and occupy different trophic levels in different 
food chains.
C4.2.11—Construction of energy pyramids
Application of skills:  Students should use research data from specific ecosystems to represent energy 
transfer and energy losses between trophic levels in food chains.
C4.2.12—Reductions in energy availability at each successive stage in food chains due to large energy 
losses between trophic levels
Decomposers and detritus feeders are not usually considered to be part of food chains. However, students 
should understand the role of these organisms in energy transformations in food chains. Consider the 
causes of energy loss.
C4.2.13—Heat loss to the environment in both autotrophs and heterotrophs due to conversion of 
chemical energy to heat in cell respiration
Include the idea that energy transfers are not 100% efficient so heat is produced both when ATP is 
produced in cell respiration and when it is used in cells.
C4.2.14—Restrictions on the number of trophic levels in ecosystems due to energy losses
At each successive stage in food chains there are fewer organisms or smaller organisms. There is therefore 
less biomass, but the energy content per unit mass is not reduced.
C4.2.15—Primary production as accumulation of carbon compounds in biomass by autotrophsSyllabus content
84 Biology guide
The units should be mass (of carbon) per unit area per unit time and are usually g m−2 yr−1. Students should 
understand that biomes vary in their capacity to accumulate biomass. Biomass accumulates when 
autotrophs and heterotrophs grow or reproduce.
C4.2.16—Secondary production as accumulation of carbon compounds in biomass by heterotrophs
Students should understand that, due to loss of biomass when carbon compounds are converted to 
carbon dioxide and water in cell respiration, secondary production is lower than primary production in an 
ecosystem.
C4.2.17—Constructing carbon cycle diagrams
Students should illustrate with a diagram how carbon is recycled in ecosystems by photosynthesis, 
feeding and respiration.
C4.2.18—Ecosystems as carbon sinks and carbon sources
If photosynthesis exceeds respiration there is a net uptake of carbon dioxide and if respiration exceeds 
photosynthesis there is a net release of carbon dioxide.
C4.2.19—Release of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere during combustion of biomass, peat, coal, oil and 
natural gas
Students should appreciate that these carbon sinks vary in date of formation and that combustion 
following lightning strikes sometimes happens naturally but that human activities have greatly increased 
combustion rates.
C4.2.20—Analysis of the Keeling Curve in terms of photosynthesis, respiration and combustion
Include analysis of both the annual fluctuations and the long-term trend.
C4.2.21—Dependence of aerobic respiration on atmospheric oxygen produced by photosynthesis, and of 
photosynthesis on atmospheric carbon dioxide produced by respiration
The fluxes involved per year are huge, so this is a major interaction between autotrophs and heterotrophs.
C4.2.22—Recycling of all chemical elements required by living organisms in ecosystems
Students should appreciate that all elements used by living organisms, not just carbon, are recycled and 
that decomposers play a key role. Students are not required to know details of the nitrogen cycle and 
other nutrient cycles.

pre-existing structure. Include oogenesis in humans and budding in yeast as examples of unequal 
cytokinesis.
D2.1.4—Roles of mitosis and meiosis in eukaryotes
Emphasize that nuclear division is needed before cell division to avoid production of anucleate cells. 
Mitosis maintains the chromosome number and genome of cells, whereas meiosis halves the chromosome

Students should understand that cell proliferation is achieved using the cell cycle. Students should 
understand the sequence of events including G1, S and G2 as the stages of interphase, followed by mitosis 
and then cytokinesis.
D2.1.14—Cell growth during interphase
Students should appreciate that interphase is a metabolically active period and that growth involves 
biosynthesis of cell components including proteins and DNA. Numbers of mitochondria and chloroplasts 
are increased by growth and division of these organelles.

organism
Emphasize that DNA base sequences are not altered by epigenetic changes, so phenotype but not 
genotype is altered.
D2.2.5—Differences between the genome, transcriptome and proteome of individual cells
No cell expresses all of its genes. The pattern of gene expression in a cell determines how it differentiates.
D2.2.6—Methylation of the promoter and histones in nucleosomes as examples of epigenetic tags
Methylation of cytosine in the DNA of a promoter represses transcription and therefore expression of the 
gene downstream.
Methylation of amino acids in histones can cause transcription to be repressed or activated. Students are 
not required to know details of how this is achieved.
D2.2.7—Epigenetic inheritance through heritable changes to gene expression
Limit to the possibility of phenotypic changes in a cell or organism being passed on to daughter cells or

Include hydrogen bond formation between solute and water molecules, and attractions between both 
positively and negatively charged ions and polar water molecules.
D2.3.2—Water movement from less concentrated to more concentrated solutions
Students should express the direction of movement in terms of solute concentration, not water 
concentration. Students should use the terms “hypertonic”, “hypotonic” and “isotonic” to compare 
concentration of solutions.
D2.3.3—Water movement by osmosis into or out of cells
Students should be able to predict the direction of net movement of water if the environment of a cell is 
hypotonic or hypertonic. They should understand that in an isotonic environment there is dynamic 
equilibrium rather than no movement of water.
D2.3.4—Changes due to water movement in plant tissue bathed in hypotonic and those bathed in 
hypertonic solutions
Application of skills:  Students should be able to measure changes in tissue length and mass, and analyse 
data to deduce isotonic solute concentration. Students should also be able to use standard deviation and 
standard error to help in the analysis of data. Students are not required to memorize formulae for 
calculating these statistics. Standard deviation and standard error could be determined for the results of

kilopascals (kPa).
D2.3.9—Movement of water from higher to lower water potential
Students should appreciate the reasons for this movement in terms of potential energy.
D2.3.10—Contributions of solute potential and pressure potential to the water potential of cells with walls

individuals that are adapted to an existing environment, sexual reproduction to produce offspring with 
new gene combinations and thus variation needed for adaptation to a changed environment.
D3.1.2—Role of meiosis and fusion of gametes in the sexual life cycle
Students should appreciate that meiosis breaks up parental combinations of alleles, and fusion of gametes 
produces new combinations. Fusion of gametes is also known as fertilization.Syllabus content
95 Biology guide
D3.1.3—Differences between male and female sexes in sexual reproduction
Include the prime difference that the male gamete travels to the female gamete, so it is smaller, with less 
food reserves than the egg. From this follow differences in the numbers of gametes and the reproductive 
strategies of males and females.
D3.1.4—Anatomy of the human male and female reproductive systems

Include the fusion of a sperm’s cell membrane with an egg cell membrane, entry to the egg of the sperm 
nucleus but destruction of the tail and mitochondria. Also include dissolution of nuclear membranes of 
sperm and egg nuclei and participation of all the condensed chromosomes in a joint mitosis to produce 
two diploid nuclei.
D3.1.7—Use of hormones in in vitro fertilization (IVF) treatment
The normal secretion of hormones is suspended, and artificial doses of hormones induce superovulation.

female plants. Also include the role of animals or wind in transferring pollen between plants.
D3.1.11—Self-incompatibility mechanisms to increase genetic variation within a species
Students should understand that self-pollination leads to inbreeding, which decreases genetic diversity 
and vigour. They should also understand that genetic mechanisms in many plant species ensure male and 
female gametes fusing during fertilization are from different plants.

D3.1.13—Control of the developmental changes of puberty by gonadotropin-releasing hormone and 
steroid sex hormones
Limit to the increased release of gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) by the hypothalamus in 
childhood triggering the onset of increased luteinizing hormone (LH) and follicle-stimulating hormone 
(FSH) release. Ultimately the increased sex hormone production leads to the changes associated with 
puberty.
D3.1.14—Spermatogenesis and oogenesis in humans
Include mitosis, cell growth, two divisions of meiosis and differentiation. Students should understand how 
gametogenesis, in typical male and female bodies, results in different numbers of sperm and eggs, and 
different amounts of cytoplasm.

the use of monoclonal antibodies that bind to hCG.
D3.1.18—Role of the placenta in foetal development inside the uterus
Students are not required to know details of placental structure apart from the large surface area of the 
placental villi. Students should understand which exchange processes occur in the placenta and that it 
allows the foetus to be retained in the uterus to a later stage of development than in mammals that do not 
develop a placenta.
D3.1.19—Hormonal control of pregnancy and childbirth
Emphasize that the continuity of pregnancy is maintained by progesterone secretion initially from the 
corpus luteum and then from the placenta, whereas the changes during childbirth are triggered by a 
decrease in progesterone levels, allowing increases in oxytocin secretion due to positive feedback.
D3.1.20—Hormone replacement therapy and the risk of coronary heart disease
NOS: In early epidemiological studies, it was argued that women undergoing hormone replacement 
therapy (HRT) had reduced incidence of coronary heart disease (CHD) and this was deemed to be a cause-
and-effect relationship. Later randomized controlled trials showed that use of HRT led to a small increase 
in the risk of CHD. The correlation between HRT and decreased incidence of CHD is not actually a cause-
and-effect relationship. HRT patients have a higher socioeconomic status, and this status has a causal 
relationship with lower risk of CHD.

Students should understand that this pattern of inheritance is common to all eukaryotes with a sexual life 
cycle. They should also understand that a diploid cell has two copies of each autosomal gene.
D3.2.2—Methods for conducting genetic crosses in flowering plants
Use the terms “P generation”, “F1 generation”, “F2 generation” and “Punnett grid”. Students should 
understand that pollen contains male gametes and that female gametes are located in the ovary, so 
pollination is needed to carry out a cross. They should also understand that plants such as peas produce 
both male and female gametes on the same plant, allowing self-pollination and therefore self-fertilization. 
Mention that genetic crosses are widely used to breed new varieties of crop or ornamental plants.
D3.2.3—Genotype as the combination of alleles inherited by an organism

distinction between genes and alleles.
D3.2.4—Phenotype as the observable traits of an organism resulting from genotype and environmental 
factors
Students should be able to suggest examples of traits in humans due to genotype only and due to 
environment only, and also traits due to interaction between genotype and environment.

heterozygous genotype for a particular trait will produce the same phenotype.
D3.2.6—Phenotypic plasticity as the capacity to develop traits suited to the environment experienced by 
an organism, by varying patterns of gene expression
Phenotypic plasticity is not due to changes in genotype, and the changes in traits may be reversible during 
the lifetime of an individual.
D3.2.7—Phenylketonuria as an example of a human disease due to a recessive allele
Phenylketonuria (PKU) is a recessive genetic condition caused by mutation in an autosomal gene that 
codes for the enzyme needed to convert phenylalanine to tyrosine.
D3.2.8—Single-nucleotide polymorphisms and multiple alleles in gene poolsSyllabus content

Use IA, IB and i to denote the alleles.
D3.2.10—Incomplete dominance and codominance
Students should understand the differences between these patterns of inheritance at the phenotypic 
level. In codominance, heterozygotes have a dual phenotype. Include the AB blood type (IAIB) as an 
example. In incomplete dominance, heterozygotes have an intermediate phenotype. Include four o'clock 
flower or marvel of Peru ( Mirabilis jalapa ) as an example.
Note: When students are referring to organisms in an examination, either the common name or the scientific 
name is acceptable.
D3.2.11—Sex determination in humans and inheritance of genes on sex chromosomes
Students should understand that the sex chromosome in sperm determines whether a zygote develops 
certain male-typical or female-typical physical characteristics and that far more genes are carried by the X 
chromosome than the Y chromosome.

Show alleles carried on X chromosomes as superscript letters on an uppercase X.
D3.2.13—Pedigree charts to deduce patterns of inheritance of genetic disorders
Students should understand the genetic basis for the prohibition of marriage between close relatives in 
many societies.
NOS: Scientists draw general conclusions by inductive reasoning when they base a theory on observations 
of some but not all cases. A pattern of inheritance may be deduced from parts of a pedigree chart and this 
theory may then allow genotypes of specific individuals in the pedigree to be deduced. Students should 
be able to distinguish between inductive and deductive reasoning.
D3.2.14—Continuous variation due to polygenic inheritance and/or environmental factors
Use skin colour in humans as an example.
Application of skills: Students should understand the distinction between continuous variables such as 
skin colour and discrete variables such as ABO blood group. They should also be able to apply measures of 
central tendency such as mean, median and mode.
D3.2.15—Box-and-whisker plots to represent data for a continuous variable such as student height
Application of skills: Students should use a box-and-whisker plot to display six aspects of data: outliers, 
minimum, first quartile, median, third quartile and maximum. A data point is categorized as an outlier if it 
is more than 1.5 × IQR (interquartile range) above the third quartile or below the first quartile.

D3.2.17—Punnett grids for predicting genotypic and phenotypic ratios in dihybrid crosses involving pairs 
of unlinked autosomal genes
Students should understand how the 9:3:3:1 and 1:1:1:1 ratios are derived.
NOS:  9:3:3:1 and 1:1:1:1 ratios for dihybrid crosses are based on what has been called Mendel’s second law. 
This law only applies if genes are on different chromosomes or are far apart enough on one chromosome 
for recombination rates to reach 50%. Students should recognize that there are exceptions to all biological 
“laws” under certain conditions.

genes can fail to assort independently.
D3.2.20—Recombinants in crosses involving two linked or unlinked genes
Students should understand how to determine the outcomes of crosses between an individual 
heterozygous for both genes and an individual homozygous recessive for both genes. Identify 
recombinants in gametes, in genotypes of offspring and in phenotypes of offspring.
D3.2.21—Use of a chi-squared test on data from dihybrid crosses
Students should understand the concept of statistical significance, the p=0.05  level, null/alternative 
hypothesis and the idea of observed versus expected results.
NOS:  Students should recognize that statistical testing often involves using a sample to represent a 
population. In this case the sample is the F2 generation. In many experiments the sample is the replicated

• How are constant internal conditions maintained in humans?
• What are the benefits to organisms of maintaining constant internal conditions?
SL and HL
D3.3.1—Homeostasis as maintenance of the internal environment of an organismSyllabus content
100 Biology guide
Variables are kept within preset limits, despite fluctuations in external environment. Include body 
temperature, blood pH, blood glucose concentration and blood osmotic concentration as homeostatic 
variables in humans.
D3.3.2—Negative feedback loops in homeostasis
Students should understand the reason for use of negative rather than positive feedback control in 
homeostasis and also that negative feedback returns homeostatic variables to the set point from values 
above and below the set point.
D3.3.3—Regulation of blood glucose as an example of the role of hormones in homeostasis
Include control of secretion of insulin and glucagon by pancreatic endocrine cells, transport in blood and 
the effects on target cells.
D3.3.4—Physiological changes that form the basis of type 1 and type 2 diabetes
Students should understand the physiological changes, together with risk factors and methods of 
prevention and treatment.
D3.3.5—Thermoregulation as an example of negative feedback control
Include the roles of peripheral thermoreceptors, the hypothalamus and pituitary gland, thyroxin and also 
examples of muscle and adipose tissue that act as effectors of temperature change.
D3.3.6—Thermoregulation mechanisms in humans
Students should appreciate that birds and mammals regulate their body temperature by physiological and 
behavioural means. Students are only required to understand the details of thermoregulation for humans. 
Include vasodilation, vasoconstriction, shivering, sweating, uncoupled respiration in brown adipose tissue 
and hair erection.
Additional higher level
D3.3.7—Role of the kidney in osmoregulation and excretion
Students should understand the distinction between excretion and osmoregulation. Osmoregulation is 
regulation of osmotic concentration. The units for osmotic concentration are osmoles per litre (osmol L−1).
D3.3.8—Role of the glomerulus, Bowman’s capsule and proximal convoluted tubule in excretion
Students should appreciate how ultrafiltration remove solutes from blood plasma and how useful 
substances are then reabsorbed, to leave toxins and other unwanted solutes in the filtrate, which are 
excreted in urine.
D3.3.9—Role of the loop of Henle
Limit to active transport of sodium ions in the ascending limb to maintain high osmotic concentrations in 
the medulla, facilitating water reabsorption in the collecting ducts.
D3.3.10—Osmoregulation by water reabsorption in the collecting ducts
Include the roles of osmoreceptors in the hypothalamus, changes to the rate of antidiuretic hormone 
secretion by the pituitary gland and the resultant switches in location of aquaporins between cell 
membranes and intracellular vesicles in cells of the collecting ducts.Syllabus content

• What biological systems are sensitive to temperature changes?
D4.1 Natural selection
Continuity and change—Ecosystems
Standard level and higher level: 2 hours
Additional higher level: 2 hours
Guiding questions
• What processes can cause changes in allele frequencies within a population?
• What is the role of reproduction in the process of natural selection?
SL and HL
D4.1.1—Natural selection as the mechanism driving evolutionary change
Students should appreciate that natural selection operates continuously and over billions of years, 
resulting in the biodiversity of life on Earth.
NOS:  In Darwin’s time it was widely understood that species evolved, but the mechanism was not clear. 
Darwin’s theory provided a convincing mechanism and replaced Lamarckism. This is an example of a 
paradigm shift. Students should understand the meaning of the term “paradigm shift”.
D4.1.2—Roles of mutation and sexual reproduction in generating the variation on which natural selection 
acts
Mutation generates new alleles and sexual reproduction generates new combinations of alleles.
D4.1.3—Overproduction of offspring and competition for resources as factors that promote natural 
selection
Include examples of food and other resources that may limit carrying capacity.
D4.1.4—Abiotic factors as selection pressures
Include examples of density-independent factors such as high or low temperatures that may affect 
survival of individuals in a population.
D4.1.5—Differences between individuals in adaptation, survival and reproduction as the basis for natural 
selection
Students are required to study natural selection due to intraspecific competition, including the concept of 
fitness when discussing the survival value and reproductive potential of a genotype.
D4.1.6—Requirement that traits are heritable for evolutionary change to occurSyllabus content
102 Biology guide
Students should understand that characteristics acquired during an individual’s life due to environmental 
factors are not encoded in the base sequence of genes and so are not heritable.
D4.1.7—Sexual selection as a selection pressure in animal species
Differences in physical and behavioural traits, which can be used as signs of overall fitness, can affect 
success in attracting a mate and so drive the evolution of an animal population. Illustrate this using 
suitable examples such as the evolution of the plumage of birds of paradise.
D4.1.8—Modelling of sexual and natural selection based on experimental control of selection pressures
Application of skills:  Students should interpret data from John Endler’s experiments with guppies.
Additional higher level
D4.1.9—Concept of the gene pool
A gene pool consists of all the genes and their different alleles, present in a population.
D4.1.10—Allele frequencies of geographically isolated populations
Application of skills:  Students should use databases to search allele frequencies. Use at least one human 
example.
D4.1.11—Changes in allele frequency in the gene pool as a consequence of natural selection between 
individuals according to differences in their heritable traits
Darwin developed the theory of evolution by natural selection. Biologists subsequently integrated 
genetics with natural selection in what is now known as neo-Darwinism.
D4.1.12—Differences between directional, disruptive and stabilizing selection
Students should be aware that all three types result in a change in allele frequency.
D4.1.13—Hardy–Weinberg equation and calculations of allele or genotype frequencies
Use p  and q  to denote the two allele frequencies. Students should understand that p+q=1  so genotype 
frequencies are predicted by the Hardy–Weinberg equation: p2+2pq+q2=1.
If one of the genotype frequencies is known, the allele frequencies can be calculated using the same 
equations.
D4.1.14—Hardy–Weinberg conditions that must be maintained for a population to be in genetic 
equilibrium
Students should understand that if genotype frequencies in a population do not fit the Hardy–Weinberg 
equation, this indicates that one or more of the conditions is not being met, for example mating is non-
random or survival rates vary between genotypes.
D4.1.15—Artificial selection by deliberate choice of traits
Artificial selection is carried out in crop plants and domesticated animals by choosing individuals for 
breeding that have desirable traits. Unintended consequences of human actions, such as the evolution of 
resistance in bacteria when an antibiotic is used, are due to natural rather than artificial selection.Syllabus content

• What mechanisms minimize competition?
D4.2 Stability and change
Continuity and change—Ecosystems
Standard level and higher level: 4 hours
Additional higher level: 2 hours
Guiding questions
• What features of ecosystems allow stability over unlimited time periods?
• What changes caused by humans threaten the stability of ecosystems?
SL and HL
D4.2.1—Stability as a property of natural ecosystems
Illustrate ecosystem stability with evidence of forest, desert or other ecosystems that have shown 
continuity over long periods. There is evidence for some ecosystems persisting for millions of years.
D4.2.2—Requirements for stability in ecosystems
Include supply of energy, recycling of nutrients, genetic diversity and climatic variables remaining within 
tolerance levels.
D4.2.3—Deforestation of Amazon rainforest as an example of a possible tipping point in ecosystem 
stability
Include the need for a large area of rainforest for the generation of atmospheric water vapour by 
transpiration, with consequent cooling, air flows and rainfall. Include uncertainty over the minimum area 
of rainforest that is sufficient to maintain these processes.
Application of skills:  Students should be able to calculate percentage change. In this case the extent of 
deforestation can be assessed by calculating the percentage change from the original area of forest.
D4.2.4—Use of a model to investigate the effect of variables on ecosystem stability
Mesocosms can be set up in open tanks but sealed glass vessels are preferable because entry and exit of 
matter can be prevented but energy transfer is still possible. Aquatic or microbial ecosystems are likely to 
be more successful than terrestrial ones.
NOS:  Care and maintenance of the mesocosms should follow IB experimental guidelines.
D4.2.5—Role of keystone species in the stability of ecosystems
Students should appreciate the disproportionate impact on community structure of keystone species and 
the risk of ecosystem collapse if they are removed.
D4.2.6—Assessing sustainability of resource harvesting from natural ecosystems
Sustainability depends on the rate of harvesting being lower than the rate of replacement. Include one 
terrestrial plant species and one species of marine fish as examples of renewable resources and how 
sustainability of harvesting can be assessed.Syllabus content
104 Biology guide
D4.2.7—Factors affecting the sustainability of agriculture
Include the need to consider soil erosion, leaching of nutrients, supply of fertilizers and other inputs, 
pollution due to agrochemicals, and carbon footprint.
D4.2.8—Eutrophication of aquatic and marine ecosystems due to leaching
Students should understand the effects of eutrophication resulting from leaching of nitrogen and 
phosphate fertilizers, including increased biochemical oxygen demand (BOD).
D4.2.9—Biomagnification of pollutants in natural ecosystems
Students should understand how increased levels of toxins accumulate in the tissues of consumers in 
higher trophic levels. Include DDT and mercury as examples.
D4.2.10—Effects of microplastic and macroplastic pollution of the oceans
Students should understand that plastics are persistent in the natural environment due to non-
biodegradability. Include examples of the effects of plastic pollution on marine life.
NOS:  Scientists can influence the actions of citizens if they provide clear information about their research 
findings. Popular media coverage of the effects of plastic pollution on marine life changed public 
perception globally, which has driven measures to address this problem.
D4.2.11—Restoration of natural processes in ecosystems by rewilding
Methods should include reintroduction of apex predators and other keystone species, re-establishment of 
connectivity of habitats over large areas, and minimization of human impact including by ecological 
management. Include the example of Hinewai Reserve in New Zealand.
Additional higher level
D4.2.12—Ecological succession and its causes
Succession can be triggered by changes in both an abiotic environment and in biotic factors.
D4.2.13—Changes occurring during primary succession
Use any suitable terrestrial example to illustrate these general principles: increases in size of plants, 
amount of primary production, species diversity, complexity of food webs and amount of nutrient cycling.
D4.2.14—Cyclical succession in ecosystems
Students should appreciate that in some ecosystems there is a cycle of communities rather than a single 
unchanging climax community. Students should refer to an example.
D4.2.15—Climax communities and arrested succession
Given any specific environmental conditions, ecological succession tends to lead to a particular type of 
climax community, but human influences can prevent this from developing. Use grazing by farm livestock 
and drainage of wetlands as examples.

Continuity and change—Ecosystems
Standard level and higher level: 3 hours
Additional higher level: 1 hour
Guiding questions
• What are the drivers of climate change?
• What are the impacts of climate change on ecosystems?
SL and HL
D4.3.1—Anthropogenic causes of climate change
Limit to anthropogenic increases in atmospheric concentrations of carbon dioxide and methane.
NOS:  Students should be able to distinguish between positive and negative correlation and should also 
distinguish between correlation and causation. For example, data from Antarctic ice cores shows a positive 
correlation between global temperatures and atmospheric carbon dioxide concentrations over hundreds 
of thousands of years. This correlation does not prove that carbon dioxide in the atmosphere increases 
global temperatures, although other evidence confirms the causal link.
D4.3.2—Positive feedback cycles in global warming
Include release of carbon dioxide from deep ocean, increases in absorption of solar radiation due to loss of 
reflective snow and ice, accelerating rates of decomposition of peat and previously undecomposed 
organic matter in permafrost, release of methane from melting permafrost and increases in droughts and 
forest fires.
D4.3.3—Change from net carbon accumulation to net loss in boreal forests as an example of a tipping 
point
Include warmer temperatures and decreased winter snowfall leading to increased incidence of drought 
and reductions in primary production in taiga, with forest browning and increases in the frequency and 
intensity of forest fires, which result in legacy carbon combustion.
D4.3.4—Melting of landfast ice and sea ice as examples of polar habitat change
Include potential loss of breeding grounds of the emperor penguin ( Aptenodytes forsteri ) due to early 
breakout of landfast ice in the Antarctic and loss of sea ice habitat for walruses in the Arctic.
Note: When students are referring to organisms in an examination, either the common name or the scientific 
name is acceptable.
D4.3.5—Changes in ocean currents altering the timing and extent of nutrient upwelling
Warmer surface water can prevent nutrient upwelling to the surface, decreasing ocean primary production 
and energy flow through marine food chains.
D4.3.6—Poleward and upslope range shifts of temperate species
As evidence-based examples, include upslope range shifts for tropical-zone montane bird species in New 
Guinea and range contraction and northward spread in North American tree species.
D4.3.7—Threats to coral reefs as an example of potential ecosystem collapseSyllabus content
106 Biology guide
Increased carbon dioxide concentrations are the cause of ocean acidification and suppression of 
calcification in corals. Increases in water temperature are a cause of coral bleaching. Loss of corals causes 
the collapse of reef ecosystems.
D4.3.8—Afforestation, forest regeneration and restoration of peat-forming wetlands as approaches to 
carbon sequestration
NOS:  There is active scientific debate over whether plantations of non-native tree species or rewilding 
with native species offer the best approach to carbon sequestration. Peat formation naturally occurs in 
waterlogged soils in temperate and boreal zones and also very rapidly in some tropical ecosystems.
Additional higher level
D4.3.9—Phenology as research into the timing of biological events
Students should be aware that photoperiod and temperature patterns are examples of variables that 
influence the timing of biological events such as flowering, budburst and bud set in deciduous trees, bird 
migration and nesting.
D4.3.10—Disruption to the synchrony of phenological events by climate change
Students should recognize that within an ecosystem temperature may act as the cue in one population 
and photoperiod may be the cue in another. Include spring growth of the Arctic mouse-ear chickweed 
(Cerastium arcticum ) and arrival of migrating reindeer ( Rangifer tarandus ) as one example. Also include a 
suitable local example or use the breeding of the great tit ( Parus major ) and peak biomass of caterpillars in 
north European forests as another.
Note: When students are referring to organisms in an examination, either the common name or the scientific 
name is acceptable.
D4.3.11—Increases to the number of insect life cycles within a year due to climate change
Use the spruce bark beetle ( Ips typographus  or Dendroctonus micans ) as an example.
Note: When students are referring to organisms in an examination, either the common name or the scientific 
name is acceptable.
D4.3.12—Evolution as a consequence of climate change
Include changes in the fitness of colour variants of the tawny owl ( Strix aluco ) as a consequence of changes 
in snow cover.
Note: When students are referring to organisms in an examination, either the common name or the scientific 
name is acceptable.

General
Assessment  is an integral  part  of teaching  and  learning.  The most  important  aims  of assessment  in the 
Diploma  Programme  (DP)  are that  it should  support  curricular  goals  and  encourage  appropriate  student 
learning.  Both  external  and  internal  assessments  are used  in the DP. IB examiners  mark  work  produced  for 
external  assessment,  while  work  produced  for internal  assessment  is marked  by teachers  and  externally 
moderated by the IB.
There are two types of assessment identified by the IB.
• Formative assessment informs both teaching and learning. It is concerned with providing accurate and 
helpful feedback to students and teachers on the kind of learning taking place and the nature of 
students’ strengths and weaknesses in order to help develop students’ understanding and capabilities. 
Formative assessment can also help to improve teaching quality, as it can provide information to 
monitor progress towards meeting the course aims and objectives (0404-01).
• Summative assessment gives an overview of previous learning and is concerned with measuring 
student achievement at, or towards the end, of the course of study (0404-04).
A comprehensive  assessment  policy  is viewed  as being  integral  with  teaching,  learning  and  course 
organization. For further information, see the IB Programme standards and practices  publication.
The approach  to assessment  used  by the IB is criterion-related,  not norm-referenced.  This  approach  to 
assessment  judges  students’  work  by their  performance  in relation  to identified  levels  of attainment,  and 
not in relation  to the work  of other  students.  For further  information  on assessment  within  the DP, please 
refer to the publication Assessment principles and practices—Quality assessments in a digital age .
To support  teachers  in the planning,  delivery  and  assessment  of the DP courses,  a variety  of resources  can 
be found  on the Programme  Resource  Centre  or purchased  from  the IB store  (store.ibo.org).  Additional 
publications  such  as specimen  papers  and  markschemes,  teacher  support  material  (TSM),  subject  reports 
and  grade  descriptors  can also  be found  on the Programme  Resource  Centre.  Past  examination  papers  as 
well as markschemes can be purchased from the IB store.
Methods of assessment
The IB uses several methods to assess work produced by students.
Assessment criteria
Assessment  criteria  are used  when  the assessment  task  is open-ended.  Each  criterion  concentrates  on a 
particular  skill that  students  are expected  to demonstrate.  An assessment  objective  describes  what 
students should be able to do, and assessment criteria describe how well they should be able to do it. Using 
assessment criteria allows discrimination between different answers and encourages a variety of responses. 
Each  criterion  comprises  a set of hierarchically  ordered  level  descriptors.  Each  level  descriptor  is worth  one 
or more marks. Each criterion is applied independently using a best-fit model. The maximum marks for each 
criterion may differ according to the criterion’s importance. The marks awarded for each criterion are added 
together to give the total mark for the piece of work.
Markbands
Markbands  are a comprehensive  statement  of expected  performance  against  which  responses  are judged. 
They represent a single holistic criterion divided into level descriptors. Each level descriptor corresponds to 
Assessment
Assessment in the Diploma Programme
108 Biology guide
a range  of marks  to differentiate  student  performance.  A best-fit  approach  is used  to ascertain  which 
particular mark to use from the possible range for each level descriptor.
Analytic markschemes
Analytic  markschemes  are prepared  for those  examination  questions  that  expect  a particular  kind  of 
response and/or a given final answer from students. They give detailed instructions to examiners on how to 
break down the total mark for each question for different parts of the response.
Marking notes
For some  assessment  components  marked  using  assessment  criteria,  marking  notes  are provided.  Marking 
notes give guidance on how to apply assessment criteria to the particular requirements of a question.
Inclusive access arrangements
Inclusive  access  arrangements  are available  for candidates  with  access  requirements.  Standard  assessment 
conditions may put candidates with assessment access requirements at a disadvantage by preventing them 
from  demonstrating  their  attainment  level.  Inclusive  access  arrangements  enable  candidates  to 
demonstrate their ability under assessment conditions that are as fair as possible.
The IB document  Access  and  inclusion  policy  provides  details  on all the inclusive  access  arrangements 
available  to candidates.  The IB document  Learning  diversity  and  inclusion  in IB programmes:  Removing 
barriers  to learning  outlines  the position  of the IB with  regard  to candidates  with  diverse  learning  needs  in 
the IB programmes. For candidates affected by adverse circumstances, the publication Diploma Programme 
Assessment  procedures  (updated  annually),  which  includes  the general  regulations,  provides  details  on 
access consideration.
Responsibilities of the school
The school  is required  to ensure  that  equal  access  arrangements  and  reasonable  adjustments  are provided 
to candidates  with  learning  support  requirements  that  are in line with  the IB documents  Access  and 
inclusion policy  and Learning diversity and inclusion in IB programmes: Removing barriers to learning .Assessment in the Diploma Programme

Purpose of internal assessment
Internal  assessment  is an integral  part  of the course  and  is compulsory  for both  SL and  HL students.  It 
enables students to demonstrate the application of their skills and knowledge, and to pursue their personal 
interests,  without  the time  limitations  and  other  constraints  that  are associated  with  written  examinations. 
The internal  assessment  should,  as far as possible,  be woven  into  normal  classroom  teaching  and  not be a 
separate activity conducted after a course has been taught.
The internal assessment requirements at SL and at HL are the same.
Guidance and authenticity
The scientific  investigation  (SL and  HL) submitted  for internal  assessment  must  be the student’s  own  work. 
However, it is not the intention that students should decide upon a title or topic and be left to work on the 
internal  assessment  component  without  any further  support  from  the teacher.  The teacher  should  play  an 
important  role  during  both  the planning  stage  and  the period  when  the student  is working  on the 
internally assessed work. It is the responsibility of the teacher to ensure that students are familiar with:
• the requirements of the type of work to be internally assessed
• the Sciences experimentation guidelines  publication
• the assessment criteria. Students must understand that the work submitted for assessment must 
address these criteria effectively.
Teachers and students must discuss the internally assessed work. Students should be encouraged to initiate 
discussions  with  the teacher  to obtain  advice  and  information,  and  students  must  not be penalized  for 
seeking guidance. As part of the learning process, teachers should read and give advice to students on one 
draft  of the work.  The teacher  should  provide  oral  or written  advice  on how  the work  could  be improved, 
but not edit the draft. The next version handed to the teacher must be the final version for submission.
It is the responsibility of teachers to ensure that all students understand the basic meaning and significance 
of concepts  that  relate  to academic  integrity,  especially  authenticity  and  intellectual  property.  Teachers 
must  ensure  that  all student  work  for assessment  is prepared  according  to the requirements  and  must 
explain  clearly  to students  that  the internally  assessed  work  must  be entirely  their  own.  Where 
collaboration between students is permitted, it must be clear to all students what the difference is between 
collaboration and collusion.
All work  submitted  to the IB for moderation  or assessment  must  be authenticated  by a teacher,  and  must 
not include  any known  instances  of suspected  or confirmed  malpractice.  Each  student  must  confirm  that 
the work  is their  authentic  work  and  constitutes  the final  version  of that  work.  Once  a student  has officially 
submitted the final version of the work, it cannot be retracted. The requirement to confirm the authenticity 
of work applies to the work of all students, not just the sample work that will be submitted to the IB for the 
purpose  of moderation.  For further  details,  refer  to the IB publications  Academic  integrity , Diploma 
Programme:  From  principles  into  practice  and  the relevant  general  regulations  (in Diploma  Programme 
Assessment procedures ).
Authenticity may be checked by discussion with the student on the content of the work, and by scrutiny of 
one or more of the following.
• The student’s initial proposal
• The first draft of the written work
• The references cited
Assessment
Internal assessment
114 Biology guide
• The style of writing compared with work known to be that of the student
• The analysis of the work by a web-based plagiarism detection service such as www.turnitin.com
The same piece of work cannot be submitted to meet the requirements of both the IA and the EE.
Time allocation
Internal assessment is an integral part of the biology course, contributing 20% to the final assessment in the 
SL and  the HL courses.  This  weighting  should  be reflected  in the time  that  is allocated  to teaching  the 
knowledge,  skills  and  understanding  required  to undertake  the work,  as well  as the total  time  allocated  to 
carry out the work.
It is recommended  that  a total  of approximately  10 hours  (SL and  HL) of teaching  time  should  be allocated 
to the work. This should include:
• time for the teacher to explain to students the requirements of the internal assessment
• class time for students to work on the internal assessment component and ask questions
• time for consultation between the teacher and each student
• time to review and monitor progress, and to check authenticity.
Safety requirements and recommendations
It is the responsibility  of everyone  involved  in science  education  to make  an ongoing  commitment  to safe 
and healthy practical work.
The working  practices  and  protocols  should  be effective  in safeguarding  students  and  protecting  the 
environment. Schools are responsible for following national or local guidelines, which differ from country to 
country. The Biology teacher support material  provides some further guidance.
Using assessment criteria for internal assessment
For internal  assessment,  a number  of assessment  criteria  have  been  identified.  Each  assessment  criterion 
has level  descriptors  describing  specific  achievement  levels,  together  with  an appropriate  range  of marks. 
The level  descriptors  concentrate  on positive  achievement,  although  for the lower  levels  failure  to achieve 
may be included in the description.
Teachers  must  judge  the internally  assessed  work  at SL and  at HL against  the criteria  using  the level 
descriptors.
• The same assessment criteria are provided for SL and HL.
• The aim is to find, for each criterion, the descriptor that conveys most accurately the level attained by 
the student, using the best-fit model. A best-fit approach means that compensation should be made 
when a piece of work matches different aspects of a criterion at different levels. The mark awarded 
should be one that most fairly reflects the balance of achievement against the criterion. It is not 
necessary for every single aspect of a level descriptor to be met for that mark to be awarded.
• When assessing a student’s work, teachers should read the level descriptors for each criterion until 
they reach a descriptor that most appropriately describes the level of the work being assessed. If a 
piece of work seems to fall between two descriptors, both descriptors should be read again and the 
one that more appropriately describes the student’s work should be chosen.
• Where there are two marks available within a level, teachers should award the upper marks if the 
student’s work demonstrates the qualities described to a great extent; the work may be close to 
achieving marks in the level above. Teachers should award the lower marks if the student’s work 
demonstrates the qualities described to a lesser extent; the work may be close to achieving marks in 
the level below.
• Only whole numbers should be recorded; partial marks (fractions and decimals) are not acceptable.Internal assessment
115 Biology guide
• Teachers should not think in terms of a pass or fail boundary but should concentrate on identifying the 
appropriate descriptor for each assessment criterion.
• The highest level descriptors do not imply faultless performance but should be achievable by a 
student. Teachers should not hesitate to use the extremes if they are appropriate descriptions of the 
work being assessed.
• A student who attains a high achievement level in relation to one criterion will not necessarily attain 
high achievement levels in relation to the other criteria. Similarly, a student who attains a low 
achievement level for one criterion will not necessarily attain low achievement levels for the other 
criteria. Teachers should not assume that the overall assessment of the students will produce any 
particular distribution of marks.
• It is recommended that the assessment criteria be made available to students.
Internal assessment details—SL and HL
The scientific investigation
Duration: 10 hours
Weighting: 20%
The IA requirement  is the same  for biology,  chemistry  and  physics.  The IA, worth  20%  of the final 
assessment, consists of one task—the scientific investigation.
The scientific  investigation  is an open-ended  task  in which  the student  gathers  and  analyses  data  in order 
to answer their own formulated research question.
The outcome  of the scientific  investigation  will be assessed  through  the form  of a written  report.  The 
maximum overall word count for the report is 3,000 words.
The following are not included in the word count.
• Charts and diagrams
• Data tables
• Equations, formulas and calculations
• Citations/references (whether parenthetical, numbered, footnotes or endnotes)
• Bibliography
• Headers
The following details should be stated at the start of the report.
• Title of the investigation
• IB candidate code (alphanumeric, for example, xyz123)
• IB candidate code for all group members (if applicable)
• Number of words
There is no requirement to include a cover page or a contents page.
Facilitating the scientific investigation
The research  question  should  be of interest  to the student,  but it is not necessary  that  it encompasses 
concepts beyond those described by the understandings within the guide.
The scientific investigation undertaken must have sufficient extent and depth to allow for all the descriptors 
of the assessment criteria to be meaningfully addressed.
The investigation of the research question must involve the collection and analysis of quantitative data that 
should be supported by qualitative observations where appropriate.
The scientific  investigation  allows  a wide  range  of techniques  for data  gathering  and  analysis  to be 
employed. The approaches that could be used in isolation or in conjunction with each other are as follows.
• Hands-on practical laboratory workInternal assessment
116 Biology guide
• Fieldwork
• Use of a spreadsheet for analysis and modelling
• Extraction and analysis of data from a database
• Use of a simulation.
The Biology teacher support material  contains further guidance on these possible approaches.
Teachers must:
• ensure that students are familiar with the assessment criteria
• ensure that students are able to investigate their individual research question
• counsel the students on whether their proposed methodology is feasible in consideration of available 
time and resources
• ensure that students have given appropriate consideration to safety, ethical and environmental factors 
before undertaking the action phase
• remind students of the requirements for academic integrity and the consequences of academic 
malpractice. The difference between collaboration and collusion must be made clear.
Developing the research question
Each  student  is expected  to formulate,  investigate  and  answer  a unique  research  question,  seeking  advice 
from their teacher.
A student must not present the same set of raw data as another student.
Methodology for individual work
Each  student  develops  their  own  methodology  to answer  their  individual  research  question.  The student 
investigates by:
• manipulating an independent variable
or
• selecting variables during fieldwork
or
• selecting different data from external databases.
The student might seek support from peers when collecting data.
Methodology for collaborative work
Collaborative  work  is optional  and  where  it is facilitated  the groups  formed  must  be no larger  than  three 
students.  Students  may  organize  their  own  groups.  The teacher  must  provide  guidance  to ensure  that  all 
students  are fully  engaged  in the collaborative  activity.  Students  must  clearly  understand  the requirement 
to conduct an individual investigation.
The methodology  developed  to answer  their  individual  research  question  may  be in part  the outcome  of 
collaborative  activity.  A student  within  the group  investigates  their  individual  research  question  by 
manipulating:
• a different independent variable from those selected by other group members
or
• the same independent variable with a different dependent variable from those selected by other 
group members
or
• different data from those selected by other group members from within a larger communally acquired 
data set.
In this context,  collaborative  work  is permitted  under  the understanding  that  the final  report  presented  for 
assessment is that of the individual student. A report by the group is not permitted. All authoring, including Internal assessment
117 Biology guide
the description  of the methodology,  must  be done  individually.  This  diagram  illustrates  a possible  route 
through the IA process where students collaborate.
Figure 3
A possible route through collaborative work
Class collaboration to set up a database
A school  may  take  part  in a large-scale  activity  collecting  data  to generate  a database  using  standardized 
protocols.  If a student  decides  to utilize  this database  in order  to answer  their  research  question,  then  the 
investigation  must  be treated  as a database  investigation.  In such  a case  the methodology  should  be 
focused on the way the data is filtered and sampled from the whole database in the same way as if the data 
was wholly acquired from an external source.
Assessing the scientific investigation
The performance  in IA at both  SL and  HL is marked  against  common  assessment  criteria,  with  a total  mark 
out of 24. Student work is internally assessed by the teacher and externally moderated by the IB.
The four assessment criteria are as follows.
• Research designInternal assessment
118 Biology guide
• Data analysis
• Conclusion
• Evaluation
Each  assessment  criterion  has level  descriptors  describing  specific  achievement  levels,  together  with  an 
appropriate  range  of marks.  The level  descriptors  concentrate  on positive  achievement,  although  for the 
lower levels failure to achieve may be included in the description.
Teachers  must  judge  the internally  assessed  work  at SL and  at HL against  the same  criteria  using  the level 
descriptors  and  aided  by the clarifications.  The criteria  must  be applied  systematically  using  a best-fit 
approach—when  a piece  of work  matches  different  aspects  of a criterion  at different  levels  the mark 
awarded  should  be one  that  most  fairly  reflects  the balance  of achievement  against  the criterion.  It is not 
necessary  for every  single  aspect  of a level  descriptor  to be met  for that  mark  to be awarded.  The highest 
level descriptors do not imply faultless performance.
Where  there  are two  or more  marks  available  within  a level,  teachers  should  award  the upper  mark  if the 
student’s  work  largely  satisfies  the qualities  described;  the work  may  be close  to achieving  marks  in the 
level  above.  Teachers  should  award  the lower  marks  if the student’s  work  demonstrates  the qualities 
described to a lesser extent; the work may be close to achieving marks in the level below.
Only whole numbers must be recorded; partial marks (fractions and decimals) are not acceptable.
The criteria  should  be considered  independently.  A student  who  attains  a high  achievement  level  in 
relation  to one  criterion  will not necessarily  attain  high  achievement  levels  in relation  to the other  criteria. 
Similarly,  a student  who  attains  a low achievement  level  for one  criterion  will not necessarily  attain  low 
achievement  levels  for the other  criteria.  Teachers  should  not assume  that  the overall  assessment  of the 
students will produce any particular distribution of marks.
Where  command  terms  are used  in the level  descriptors,  they  are to be interpreted  as indicated  in the 
“Glossary of command terms” section of this guide. These command terms indicate the depth of treatment 
required. Command terms used within the descriptors are provided in the following table.

AO1 State Give a specific name, value or other brief answer without explanation or 
calculation.
AO2 Identify Provide an answer from a number of possibilities.
AO2 Outline Give a brief account or summary.
AO2 Describe Give a detailed account.
AO3 Explain Give a detailed account including reasons or causes.
AO3 Justify Give valid reasons or evidence to support an answer or conclusion.
Referencing and academic integrity
Appropriate  referencing  to sourced  information  used  in the report  of the scientific  investigation  is 
expected. Omitted or improper referencing will be considered to be academic malpractice.
Students  must  ensure  their  assessment  work  adheres  to the IB’s academic  integrity  policy  and  that  all 
sources  are appropriately  referenced.  A student’s  failure  to appropriately  acknowledge  a source  will be 
investigated  by the IB as a potential  breach  of regulations  that  may  result  in a penalty  imposed  by the IB 
Final Award Committee. See the “Academic integrity” section of this guide for full details.

This  criterion  assesses  the extent  to which  the student  effectively  communicates  the methodology 
(purpose and practice) used to address the research question.
Marks Level descriptor
0 The report does not reach the standard described by the descriptors below.
1–2 • The research question is stated without context.
• Methodological considerations associated with collecting data relevant to the 
research question are stated.
• The description of the methodology for collecting or selecting data lacks the detail 
to allow for the investigation to be reproduced.
3–4 • The research question is outlined within a broad context.
• Methodological considerations associated with collecting relevant and sufficient 
data to answer the research question are described.
• The description of the methodology for collecting or selecting data allows for the 
investigation to be reproduced with few ambiguities or omissions.
5–6 • The research question is described within a specific and appropriate context.
• Methodological considerations associated with collecting relevant and sufficient 
data to answer the research question are explained.
• The description of the methodology for collecting or selecting data allows for the 
investigation to be reproduced.
Clarifications for research design
A research question with context should contain reference to the dependent and independent variables 
or two correlated variables, include a concise description of the system in which the research question is 
embedded, and include background theory of direct relevance.
Methodological considerations include:
• the selection of the methods for measuring the dependent and independent variables
• the selection of the databases or model and the sampling of data
• the decisions regarding the scope, quantity and quality of measurements (e.g. the range, interval or 
frequency of the independent variable, repetition and precision of measurements)
• the identification of control variables and the choice of method of their control
• the recognition of any safety, ethical or environmental issues that needed to be taken into account.
The description of the methodology refers to presenting sufficiently detailed information (such as specific 
materials used and precise procedural steps) while avoiding unnecessary or repetitive information, so that Internal assessment

Clarifications for research design
the reader may readily understand how the methodology was implemented and could in principle repeat 
the investigation.
Data analysis
This  criterion  assesses  the extent  to which  the student’s  report  provides  evidence  that  the student  has 
recorded, processed and presented the data in ways that are relevant to the research question.
Marks Level descriptor
0 The report does not reach a standard described by the descriptors below.
1–2 • The recording and processing of the data is communicated but is neither clear nor 
precise.
• The recording and processing of data shows limited evidence of the consideration 
of uncertainties.
• Some processing of data relevant to addressing the research question is carried out 
but with major omissions, inaccuracies or inconsistencies.
3–4 • The communication of the recording and processing of the data is either clear or 
precise.
• The recording and processing of data shows evidence of a consideration of 
uncertainties but with some significant omissions or inaccuracies.
• The processing of data relevant to addressing the research question is carried out 
but with some significant omissions, inaccuracies or inconsistencies.
5–6 • The communication of the recording and processing of the data is both clear and 
precise.
• The recording and processing of data shows evidence of an appropriate 
consideration of uncertainties.
• The processing of data relevant to addressing the research question is carried out 
appropriately and accurately.
Clarifications for data analysis
Data refers to quantitative data or a combination of both quantitative and qualitative data.
Communication
• Clear communication means that the method of processing can be understood easily.
• Precise communication refers to following conventions correctly, such as those relating to the 
annotation of graphs and tables or the use of units, decimal places and significant figures.
Consideration of uncertainties is subject specific and further guidance is given in the Biology teacher 
support material .
Major omissions, inaccuracies or inconsistencies impede the possibility of drawing a valid conclusion that 
addresses the research question.
Significant omissions, inaccuracies or inconsistencies allow the possibility of drawing a conclusion that 
addresses the research question but with some limit to its validity or detail.
Conclusion
This  criterion  assesses  the extent  to which  the student  successfully  answers  their  research  question  with 
regard to their analysis and the accepted scientific context.Internal assessment

Marks Level descriptor
0 The report does not reach a standard described by the descriptors below.
1–2 • A conclusion is stated that is relevant to the research question but is not supported 
by the analysis presented.
• The conclusion makes superficial comparison to the accepted scientific context.
3–4 • A conclusion is described that is relevant to the research question but is not fully 
consistent with the analysis presented.
• A conclusion is described that makes some relevant comparison to the accepted 
scientific context.
5–6 • A conclusion is justified that is relevant to the research question and fully consistent 
with the analysis presented.
• A conclusion is justified through relevant comparison to the accepted scientific 
context.
Clarifications for conclusion
A conclusion that is fully consistent requires the interpretation of processed data including associated 
uncertainties.
Scientific context refers to information that could come from published material (paper or online), 
published values, course notes, textbooks or other outside sources. The citation of published materials 
must be sufficiently detailed to allow these sources to be traceable.
Evaluation
This  criterion  assesses  the extent  to which  the student’s  report  provides  evidence  of evaluation  of the 
investigation methodology and has suggested improvements.

weaknesses or limitations, are described.
5–6 • The report explains the relative impact of specific methodological weaknesses or 
limitations.
• Realistic improvements to the investigation, that are relevant to the identified 
weaknesses or limitations, are explained.
Clarifications for evaluation
Generic is general to many methodologies and not specifically relevant to the methodology of the 
investigation being evaluated.
Methodological refers to the overall approach to the investigation of the research question as well as 
procedural steps.
Weaknesses could relate to issues regarding the control of variables, the precision of measurement or the 
variation in the data.Internal assessment
