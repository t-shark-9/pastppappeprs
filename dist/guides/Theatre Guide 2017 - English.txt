The Diploma Programme

The Diploma Programme is a rigorous pre-university course of study designed for students in the 16 to
19 age range. It is a broad-based two-year course that aims to encourage students to be knowledgeable
and inquiring, but also caring and compassionate. There is a strong emphasis on encouraging students to
develop intercultural understanding, open-mindedness, and the attitudes necessary for them to respect
and evaluate a range of points of view.

The Diploma Programme model
The course is presented as six academic areas enclosing a central core (see figure 1). It encourages the
concurrent study of a broad range of academic areas. Students study two modern languages (or a modern
language and a classical language), a humanities or social science subject, an experimental science,
mathematics and one of the creative arts. It is this comprehensive range of subjects that makes the Diploma
Programme a demanding course of study designed to prepare students effectively for university entrance.
In each of the academic areas students have flexibility in making their choices, which means they can
choose subjects that particularly interest them and that they may wish to study further at university.

The Diploma Programme

Choosing the right combination
Students are required to choose one subject from each of the six academic areas, although they can,
instead of an arts subject, choose two subjects from another area. Normally, three subjects (and not more
than four) are taken at higher level (HL), and the others are taken at standard level (SL). The IB recommends
240 teaching hours for HL subjects and 150 hours for SL. Subjects at HL are studied in greater depth and
breadth than at SL.
At both levels, many skills are developed, especially those of critical thinking and analysis. At the end of
the course, students’ abilities are measured by means of external assessment. Many subjects contain some
element of coursework assessed by teachers.

The core of the Diploma Programme model
All Diploma Programme students participate in the three course elements that make up the core of the
model. Reflection on all these activities is a principle that lies at the heart of the thinking behind the
Diploma Programme.
Theory of knowledge (TOK) is a course that is fundamentally about critical thinking and inquiry into the
process of knowing rather than about learning a specific body of knowledge. The TOK course examines
the nature of knowledge and how we know what we claim to know. It does this by encouraging students
to analyse knowledge claims and explore questions about the construction of knowledge. The task of TOK
is to emphasize connections between areas of shared knowledge and link them to personal knowledge
in such a way that an individual becomes more aware of his or her own perspectives and how they might
differ from others.
Creativity, activity, service (CAS) is at the heart of the Diploma Programme. The emphasis in CAS is on
helping students to develop their own identities, in accordance with the ethical principles embodied in
the IB mission statement and the IB learner profile. It involves students in a range of activities alongside
their academic studies throughout the Diploma Programme. The three strands of CAS are Creativity (arts,
and other experiences that involve creative thinking), Activity (physical exertion contributing to a healthy
lifestyle) and Service (an unpaid and voluntary exchange that has a learning benefit for the student).
Possibly, more than any other component in the Diploma Programme, CAS contributes to the IB’s mission
to create a better and more peaceful world through intercultural understanding and respect.
The extended essay, including the world studies extended essay, offers the opportunity for IB students to
investigate a topic of special interest, in the form of a 4,000-word piece of independent research. The area
of research undertaken is chosen from one of the students’ six Diploma Programme subjects, or in the
case of the inter-disciplinary World Studies essay, two subjects, and acquaints them with the independent
research and writing skills expected at university. This leads to a major piece of formally presented,
structured writing, in which ideas and findings are communicated in a reasoned and coherent manner,
appropriate to the subject or subjects chosen. It is intended to promote high-level research and writing
skills, intellectual discovery and creativity. An authentic learning experience it provides students with an
opportunity to engage in personal research on a topic of choice, under the guidance of a supervisor.

The Diploma Programme

Approaches to teaching and approaches to learning
Approaches to teaching and learning across the Diploma Programme refers to deliberate strategies,
skills and attitudes which permeate the teaching and learning environment. These approaches and
tools, intrinsically linked with the learner profile attributes, enhance student learning and assist student
preparation for the Diploma Programme assessment and beyond. The aims of approaches to teaching and
learning in the Diploma Programme are to:
•

empower teachers as teachers of learners as well as teachers of content

•

empower teachers to create clearer strategies for facilitating learning experiences in which students
are more meaningfully engaged in structured inquiry and greater critical and creative thinking

•

promote both the aims of individual subjects (making them more than course aspirations) and linking
previously isolated knowledge (concurrency of learning)

•

encourage students to develop an explicit variety of skills that will equip them to continue to be
actively engaged in learning after they leave school, and to help them not only obtain university
admission through better grades but also prepare for success during tertiary education and beyond

•

enhance further the coherence and relevance of the students’ Diploma Programme experience

•

allow schools to identify the distinctive nature of an IB Diploma Programme education, with its blend
of idealism and practicality.

The five approaches to learning (developing thinking skills, social skills, communication skills, selfmanagement skills and research skills) along with the six approaches to teaching (teaching that is inquirybased, conceptually focused, contextualized, collaborative, differentiated and informed by assessment)
encompass the key values and principles that underpin IB pedagogy.

The IB mission statement and the IB learner profile
The Diploma Programme aims to develop in students the knowledge, skills and attitudes they will need
to fulfill the aims of the IB, as expressed in the organization’s mission statement and the learner profile.
Teaching and learning in the Diploma Programme represent the reality in daily practice of the organization’s
educational philosophy.

Academic honesty
Academic honesty in the Diploma Programme is a set of values and behaviours informed by the attributes
of the learner profile. In teaching, learning and assessment, academic honesty serves to promote personal
integrity, engender respect for the integrity of others and their work, and ensure that all students have an
equal opportunity to demonstrate the knowledge and skills they acquire during their studies.
All course work—including work submitted for assessment—is to be authentic, based on the student’s
individual and original ideas with the ideas and work of others always fully acknowledged at point of use
and included in a list of sources. Assessment tasks that require teachers to provide guidance to students
or that require students to work collaboratively must be completed in full compliance with the detailed
guidelines provided by the IB for the relevant subjects.
For further information on academic honesty in the IB and the Diploma Programme, please consult the IB
publications Academic honesty, The Diploma Programme: From principles into practice and the General
regulations: Diploma Programme. Specific information regarding academic honesty as it pertains to external
and internal assessment components of this Diploma Programme subject can be found in this guide.

The Diploma Programme

Acknowledging the ideas or work of another person
Coordinators and teachers are reminded that students must acknowledge all sources used in work
submitted for assessment. The following is intended as a clarification of this requirement.
Diploma Programme students submit work for assessment in a variety of media that may include audiovisual material, text, graphs, images and/or data published in print or electronic sources. If a student uses
the work or ideas of another person the student must acknowledge the source using a standard style of
referencing in a consistent manner. A student’s failure to acknowledge a source will be investigated by the
IB as a potential breach of regulations that may result in a penalty imposed by the IB final award committee.
The IB does not prescribe which style(s) of referencing or in-text citation should be used by students; this
is left to the discretion of appropriate faculty/staff in the student’s school. The wide range of subjects,
three response languages and the diversity of referencing styles make it impractical and restrictive to insist
on particular styles. In practice, certain styles may prove most commonly used, but schools are free to
choose a style that is appropriate for the subject concerned and the language in which students’ work is
written. Regardless of the reference style adopted by the school for a given subject, it is expected that the
minimum information given includes: name of author, date of publication, title of source, and page numbers
as applicable.
Students are expected to use a standard style and use it consistently so that credit is given to all sources
used, including sources that have been paraphrased or summarized. When writing text a student must
clearly distinguish between their words and those of others by the use of quotation marks (or other method,
such as indentation) followed by an appropriate citation that denotes an entry in the bibliography. If an
electronic source is cited, the date of access must be indicated. Students are not expected to show faultless
expertise in referencing, but are expected to demonstrate that all sources have been acknowledged.
Students must be advised that audio-visual material, text, graphs, images and/or data published in print
or in electronic sources that is not their own must also attribute the source. Again, an appropriate style of
referencing/citation must be used.

Learning diversity and learning support
requirements
Schools must ensure that equal access arrangements and reasonable adjustments are provided to students
with learning support requirements that are in line with the IB documents Candidates with assessment
access requirements and Learning diversity within the International Baccalaureate programmes: Special
educational needs within the International Baccalaureate programmes.

Nature of the subject

Theatre
Theatre is a dynamic, collaborative and live art form. It is a practical subject that encourages discovery
through experimentation, the taking of risks and the presentation of ideas to others. It results in the
development of both theatre and life skills; the building of confidence, creativity and working collaboratively.
The IB Diploma Programme theatre course is a multifaceted theatre-making course of study. It gives
students the opportunity to make theatre as creators, designers, directors and performers. It emphasizes
the importance of working both individually and collaboratively as part of an ensemble. It offers the
opportunity to engage actively in the creative process, transforming ideas into action as inquisitive and
productive artists.
Students experience the course from contrasting artistic perspectives. They learn to apply research and
theory to inform and to contextualize their work. The theatre course encourages students to appreciate that
through the processes of researching, creating, preparing, presenting and critically reflecting on theatre—
as participants and audience members—they gain a richer understanding of themselves, their community
and the world.
Through the study of theatre, students become aware of their own personal and cultural perspectives,
developing an appreciation of the diversity of theatre practices, their processes and their modes of
presentation. It enables students to discover and engage with different forms of theatre across time, place
and culture and promotes international-mindedness.

Distinction between SL and HL
The syllabus clearly indicates a differential between SL and HL. It allows for greater breadth and depth in the
teaching and learning at HL through an additional assessment task which requires HL students to engage
with theatre theorists and their theories.

Theatre and the Diploma Programme core
Theatre and the extended essay
Undertaking an extended essay in theatre provides students with an opportunity to undertake independent
research into a topic of special interest. Students are encouraged to apply a range of skills in order to develop
and explore a focused research question appropriate to theatre in an imaginative and critical way. It requires
them to test and validate their research by considering its effect on the practice of the investigated theatre
form.
Owing to the composite nature of theatre, students may choose to take an interdisciplinary approach in
their research. Whatever approach they choose, it is important to frame an appropriately focused research
question. It is the task of the supervisor to ensure that this research question leads the student along a path
that uses appropriate theatrical sources and that encourages the application of relevant theatrical concepts,

6

Theatre guide

Nature of the subject

theories or ideas. The essay topic may relate to a specific area of the Diploma Programme theatre course,
but this is not a requirement and other areas of the subject may be explored. It is important that the topic
reflects the student’s particular interest and enthusiasm within the subject area.
Examples of suitable extended essays in theatre include:
•

An exploration of the influence of Bunraku theatre practice on Ariane Mnouchkine’s Tambours sur la
Digue

•

A practical investigation of how Playback Theatre can be used to prevent bullying, and to help victims
of bullying

•

An investigation of how prisoners in Theresienstadt concentration camp (Terezín) met the technical
and artistic challenges of producing theatrical performances during World War II

•

A comparative analysis of the ways in which 21st century theatre directors Michael Boyd and Jamie
Lloyd attempt to convey supernatural in Macbeth

•

Exploring how Neil LaBute’s plays The Shape of Things and Some Girls have been staged in India to
make them relevant for modern Indian audiences

Detailed guidance on undertaking extended essays in theatre can be found in the Extended essay guide.

Theatre and CAS
Studying theatre provides excellent opportunities for students to make links with their CAS activities. The
experiential nature of the subject combines effectively with a range of CAS activities which complement
and counterbalance the academic rigour of the Diploma Programme. The challenge and enjoyment of CAS
activities can often have a profound effect on theatre students, who might choose, for example, to engage
with CAS in the following ways.
•

Participation in a range of creative activities, such as school productions and showcase events. There
is great scope for students to extend their creative thinking through participation in the planning,
rehearsing and presenting of a wide range of performances and events involving different audiences.

•

Participation in a range of artistic activities, workshops and performances created in collaboration
with others. These might include designing projects with the local community or touring theatre in
education pieces targeted at a specific audience with specific needs.

It is important to note that CAS must be distinct from, and may not be included or used in, the student’s
Diploma Programme course requirements.

Teacher support material
Further opportunities for making links between the theatre course and CAS can be found in the Theatre
teacher support material.

Theatre and theory of knowledge
The theory of knowledge (TOK) course (first assessment 2015) engages students in reflection on the nature
of knowledge and on how we know what we claim to know. The course identifies eight ways of knowing:
reason, emotion, language, sense perception, intuition, imagination, faith and memory. Students explore
these means of producing knowledge within the context of various areas of knowledge: the natural sciences,
the social sciences, the arts, ethics, history, mathematics, religious knowledge systems and indigenous
knowledge systems. The course also requires students to make comparisons between the different areas of
knowledge; reflecting on how knowledge is arrived at in the various disciplines, what the disciplines have in
common, and the differences between them.

Nature of the subject

Students of the arts subjects study the various artistic ways through which knowledge, skills and attitudes
from different cultural traditions are developed and transmitted. These subjects allow students to
investigate and reflect on the complexities of the human condition. By exploring a range of materials and
technologies, students should aim to develop an understanding of the technical, creative, expressive and
communicative aspects of the arts.
Students of the arts subjects analyse artistic knowledge from various perspectives, and they acquire this
knowledge through experiential means as well as more traditional academic methods. The nature of the arts
is such that an exploration of the areas of knowledge in general, and knowledge of the different art forms
specifically, can combine to help us understand ourselves, our patterns of behaviour and our relationship to
each other and our wider environment.
The arts subjects complement TOK ethos by revealing interdisciplinary connections and allowing students
to explore the strengths and limitations of individual and cultural perspectives. Studying the arts requires
students to reflect on and question their own bases of knowledge. In addition, by exploring other Diploma
Programme subjects in an artistic fashion, students can gain an understanding of the interdependent
nature of knowledge and are encouraged to become, “active, compassionate and lifelong learners who
understand that other people, with their differences, can also be right” (IB mission statement).
Questions related to TOK activities that a theatre student might consider include the following:
•

What moral responsibilities do theatre-makers have?

•

“Art is a lie that brings us nearer to the truth” (Pablo Picasso). Evaluate this claim in relation to theatre.

•

Are ways of knowing employed in radically different ways in the arts as opposed to other areas of
knowledge?

•

To what extent is imagination a fundamental requirement for participation in theatre?

•

What do the different subjects that make up the arts have in common?

•

How can the subjective viewpoint of an individual contribute to knowledge in the arts?

•

How do artistic judgments differ from other types of judgment such as moral judgments?

•

Why might we be more concerned with process rather than product in the search for knowledge?

•

What is the social function of theatre?

Theatre and international-mindedness
International-mindedness represents an openness and curiosity about the world and its people. It begins
with students understanding themselves in order to effectively connect and collaborate with others. The
arts provide a unique opportunity for students to recognize the dynamic cultural influences around them
and the significance of diversity in the making of theatre. The IB Diploma Programme theatre course gives
students the opportunity to study a wide variety of performance styles, theatre traditions, theatre theorists
and play texts. Students are expected to explore and engage with theatre from a variety of contexts. Through
creating, investigating, critically analysing and appreciating differing forms and styles, students deepen
their understanding of theatre, as well as their knowledge, understanding and experience of the arts within
the global community. They become more informed and reflective, and develop their abilities to become
enriched practitioners, communicators, collaborators and creative thinkers. They learn to acknowledge the
aspects that appear in all performance forms and theatre traditions, and also to recognize the unique ways
in which particular cultures express and represent their values and identity through shared performance.

Theatre guide

Nature of the subject

Culture
For this theatre guide, “culture” is defined as learned and shared beliefs, values, interests, attitudes,
products and all patterns of behaviour created by society. This view of culture includes an organized
system of symbols, ideas, explanations, beliefs and material production that humans create and
manipulate in their daily lives. Culture is dynamic and organic and operates on many levels in the
global context—international, national, regional and local, as well as among different social groups
within a society. Culture is seen as fluid and subject to change.
Culture can be seen as providing the overall framework within which humans learn to organize their
thoughts, emotions and behaviours in relation to their environment, and within this framework
“cultural context”, which specifically appears in both the taught syllabus and assessment tasks of the
theatre course, refers to the conditions that influence and are influenced by culture. These include
social, political, geographical and historical factors.

Engaging with sensitive topics
Studying theatre allows the opportunity for students to engage with exciting, stimulating and personally
relevant topics and issues. However, it should be noted that often such topics and issues can also be sensitive
and personally challenging for some students. Teachers should be aware of this and provide guidance on
how to approach and engage with such topics in a responsible manner. Consideration should also be given
to the personal, political and spiritual values of others, particularly in relation to race, gender or religious
beliefs.
As part of the collective consideration of the school, theatre students must be supported in maintaining
an ethical perspective during their course. Schools must be vigilant to ensure that work undertaken by the
student does not damage the environment, include excessive or gratuitous violence or reference to explicit
sexual activity.

Prior learning
The theatre course at both SL and HL requires no previous experience.
The course is designed to enable students to experience theatre on a personal level and achievement in this
subject is reflected in how students develop, extend and refine the knowledge, skills and attitudes necessary
for studying theatre. Students’ individual ability to be creative and imaginative and to communicate in
dramatic form will be developed and extended through the theoretical and practical content of the course.
The theatre course provides a relevant learning opportunity for a diverse range of students as it lays an
appropriate foundation for further study in theatre, performing arts and other related subjects. In addition,
by instilling discipline, and refining communication, creative and collaborative skills it offers a valuable
course of study for students who may wish to pursue a career or further education studies in areas
unconnected to theatre.

Nature of the subject

Links to the Middle Years Programme
The MYP arts gives students the opportunity to develop as artists as well as learning about the arts through
conceptual understandings essential to the discipline. Learning takes place within contexts relevant to the
student, whether personal, local, national, international or globally significant. Throughout the MYP arts
students are required to use knowledge, develop, think creatively and respond to a variety of artworks. The
MYP arts subjects, and specifically the MYP discipline of drama, provide a solid foundation for the Diploma
Programme theatre course.
In MYP arts, students are provided opportunities to prepare for the Diploma Programme theatre course
through:
•

understanding the role of theatre in context and using this understanding to inform their work and
artistic decisions

•

discovering the aesthetics of theatre and analysing and expressing this in various forms

•

acquiring, developing and applying skills in the process of making and presenting theatre

•

being encouraged to think laterally, develop curiosity and purposefully explore and challenge
boundaries

•

responding to their world, to their own art and its audience and to the theatre of others.

In MYP arts, students not only learn about the arts, they are provided with opportunities to develop
themselves as artists. The MYP arts guide fosters autonomous experimentation and understanding, which
is valued and developed further in the Diploma Programme. In thinking creatively the students become
successful learners of theatre through inquiring and solving problems. Emphasis is placed on the artistic
process, allowing the students to plan, create, present, reflect and evaluate on the process of presenting
theatre. Students further develop their repertoire to engage and convey feelings, experiences and ideas and
build on the skills developed in the PYP.

Theatre and academic honesty
Assessment components across the arts vary considerably, from oral presentations to formal written work,
from the presentation of practical work to the collection of ideas and stimuli that inspire the creative process.
Although guidelines for maintaining academic honesty are consistent for all subjects and components, the
variety and richness of tasks in the arts means that each component raises its own challenges for maintaining
academic honesty. For more information please see Academic honesty in Diploma Programme arts.

Academic honesty
Key opportunities for guiding students on academic honesty issues are highlighted in each of the
assessment tasks later in this guide.

Referencing sources
If a student uses any content from any source, including the internet, these must be acknowledged
consistently following the protocol of the referencing style chosen by the school, in a style that clearly
identifies the section of the work that is being attributed and its origin. When the student is aware that
another person’s work or ideas have influenced their own but it has not been referred to directly in their
work, the source must be cited at point of use in the student’s work and then included as a bibliography
reference. This is particularly relevant to the arts where the creative process will be the result of many
stimuli, influences and sources of inspiration.
10

Theatre guide

Nature of the subject

Authenticity
Most of the assessment tasks in the arts are completed as coursework, and so have strict conditions under
which student work must be completed, presented and—in the case of internally assessed work—assessed.
There are also formal requirements that must be followed to ensure that the work received by examiners and
moderators is consistent and can be assessed against marking criteria. Since these conditions and formal
requirements are designed to provide each student with equal opportunity to demonstrate achievement,
failure to follow them could be considered a form of academic misconduct as it can lead to students being
unfairly advantaged.
Coursework authentication form (CAF)
During the creation of assessment work in theatre, teachers are required to meet with students
at various intervals in order to discuss the progress being made by each student and to verify the
origin and authenticity of the coursework being created. These one-to-one interactions, which
might be formal meetings and/or informal discussions in the classroom, provide the teacher with the
necessary evidence to authenticate each student’s work.
For some of the assessment tasks for the DP theatre course, teachers must provide a written
summary of the authentication conversations using the DP theatre Coursework authentication
form (CAF), which is submitted to the IB as part of the upload of assessment material. Further details
regarding the authentication requirements for each assessment task are identified later in this guide.
By the very practical nature of arts subjects, the creation and progress of student work for some of
the assessment tasks is continually witnessed by teachers. Therefore, not all components will require
written teacher comments on the CAF. However, it is expected that the teacher will continue to
scrutinize the ongoing work of each candidate and seek assurance that every element of the work is
authentic.

Approaches to teaching and learning in theatre

Approaches to the teaching of theatre
The syllabus has been designed to reflect the dynamic nature of theatre and theatre-making. In designing
and delivering the curriculum teachers have a free choice in the selection of plays, playwrights, theorists
and theatre practices, which include theatrical forms, movements, styles, genres and traditions. In the
assessment tasks, students also have free choice to choose plays, theatre traditions, starting points and
theatre theorists which interest and excite them.
Teachers are encouraged to interpret the syllabus creatively according to local circumstances and the
context of the school. This is an international theatre programme: how teachers choose to explore theatre
practices from various times, places and cultures is left to their discretion, however, teachers should not
only teach practices they themselves are familiar with and knowledgeable about, but also be risk-takers and
expose students to unfamiliar world traditions.
No time allocation is given for any individual area of the syllabus because most activities may cover several
different parts of the course. Careful planning of class activities and productions, and also, where feasible, of
visits to experience external productions and workshops with theatre practitioners, is needed to make the
best use of the time and resources available.
Teachers in a theatre programme need to place themselves in a different relationship to the students.
They should consider themselves neither as the source of knowledge, the deliverer of information or the
theatre director. Teachers should, rather, consider themselves as engineers of experiences. The teacher’s
role is to create opportunities that allow the students to explore, learn, discover and collaborate to become
autonomous, informed and skilled theatre-makers. Students learn not only about theatre from around the
world but also the importance of making theatre with integrity, with an understanding of the impact that
theatre can have on the world.
It is possible to run the Diploma Programme theatre course with just one student. Teachers in this situation
must find creative opportunities to meet the requirement for collaboration. The course does not require an
extra-curricular commitment from students.

Approaches to learning in theatre
The Diploma Programme theatre course is student-centred and places student explorations at the heart of a
holistic learning experience. Students focus on the techniques and methods of making theatre, and present
these discoveries in a variety of ways, through performance, presentations, demonstrations and written
expression.
The core belief is that theatre is not separate to the world in which it is created. Each piece of theatre and
each theatre practice is created differently and achieves its impact on its artists and its audience differently
depending on its context.
Learning about theatre relies on action and the course must be experienced practically. The collaborative
process is essential to theatre and students should experience and reflect on the processes of collaboration,
its benefits and its challenges. Organization, self-management and independent study skills are important.
Students learn through problem-solving and inquiry. They communicate their learning through action,
staging, project planning, workshops, presentations, physical demonstrations, oral, visual and written

expression. The course requires higher order thinking skills, such as analysis and synthesis. Students should
also learn what is relevant and useful for their own investigations and how to put their knowledge and
understanding into practice, transforming ideas into action.
The course encourages students to research, not only using traditional academic methods, but also
practically, through the body. The programme embodies many of the approaches to teaching and learning
(ATL) skills which empower teachers and students to facilitate meaningful learning experiences.
The selection of materials for assessment
The assessment tasks for Diploma Programme theatre involve students making their own choices
about the theatre theorists, play texts, world theatre traditions and starting points they wish to
study. The tasks are intentionally student-centred and teachers should encourage students to make
selections for their assessment tasks based on their own personal interests and what inspires and
excites them. Teachers should encourage students to make selections that will best help them to
fulfill the requirements of each task and to provide the best opportunity for fulfilling the assessment
criteria. As such, the task instructions and assessment criteria should be shared with the students
and become a regular focus of interaction.

Teaching hours

The theatre course is structured for the assessment tasks to be ongoing with skills being developed
throughout the course and the material for assessment developed throughout the latter part of the course.

Syllabus outline

Overview of the course
Core areas
The theatre syllabus at SL and HL consists of three equal, interrelated areas:

Figure 2
These core areas, which have been designed to fully interlink with the assessment tasks, must be central to
the planning and designing of the taught programme developed and delivered by the teacher. Students are
required to understand the relationship between these areas and how each area informs and impacts their
work in theatre.
Students are required to approach these areas from the perspectives of each of the following specialist
theatre roles:
•

creator

•

designer

•

director

•

performer.

Theatre in context
This area of the syllabus addresses the students’ understanding that theatre does not occur in a vacuum.
Students examine the personal, theoretical and cultural contexts that inform theatre-making and the ways
in which these affect and influence creating, designing, directing, performing and spectating. Through the
theatre in context area, students will:
•

understand the contexts that influence, inform and inspire their own work as theatre-makers and that
determine the theatre that they choose to make and study

•

experience practically and critically appreciate the theoretical contexts that inform different world
theatre practices

•

be informed about the wider world of theatre and begin to understand and appreciate the many
cultural contexts within which theatre is created.
Theatre guide

Approaches to teaching and learning in theatre

Theatre processes
This area of the syllabus addresses the students’ exploration of the skills, techniques and processes involved
in theatre-making. Students reflect on their own creative processes and skills acquisition as well as gaining a
practical understanding of the processes of others; creators, designers, directors and performers.
Through the theatre processes area, students will:
•

be informed about the various processes involved in making theatre from the perspectives of the
specialist theatre roles (creator, designer, director and performer)

•

observe and reflect on processes used in different theatre traditions and performance practices

•

develop a range of skills required to make and participate in theatre.

Presenting theatre
This area of the syllabus addresses the staging and presentation of theatre as well as the presentation of
ideas, research and discoveries through diverse modes of presentation, both practical and written. Students
consider the impact theatre can have on the spectator. They are encouraged to think about their own
artistic intentions as creators, designers, directors and performers and the impact they wish to have on an
audience.
Through the presenting theatre area, students will:
•

apply their practical theatre skills, either individually or collaboratively, through a range of formats

•

present their ideas about theatre and take part in theatre performances

•

understand and appreciate how artistic choices can impact on an audience.

Mapping the course
To fully prepare students for the demands of the assessment tasks, teachers should ensure that their
planning addresses each of the syllabus activities outlined below, the content and focus of which is not
prescribed. The connections between the syllabus areas and the assessment tasks can be seen in the table
“Linking the theatre core syllabus areas to the assessment tasks”.
Students are required to investigate the core syllabus areas from the perspectives of creator, designer,
director, performer and spectator through the following activities:
•

creating theatre based on theatre theory (HL only)

•

working with play texts

•

examining world theatre traditions and performance practices.

•

collaboratively creating original theatre.

These activities link with the core syllabus areas as follows:

The theatre journal
From the beginning of the course, and at regular intervals, students at both SL and HL are required to
maintain a theatre journal. This is the students’ own record of their two years of study and should be used
to record:
•

challenges and achievements

•

creative ideas

•

critical analysis and experience of live theatre productions as a spectator

•

detailed evaluations

•

experiences as a creator, designer, director and performer

•

feedback

•

reflections

•

research

Theatre guide

19

Approaches to teaching and learning in theatre

•

responses to work seen

•

responses to diverse starting points

•

skills acquisition and development.

Students should be encouraged to find the most appropriate ways of recording their development and
have free choice in deciding what form the journal should take. The content of the journal should focus
specifically on an analysis of learning experiences, rather than being simply a record of triumphs or an
exhaustive chronicle of everything the student experiences in theatre. Although elements of the journal may
be selected, adapted and presented for assessment, the journal itself is not directly assessed or moderated.
It is, however, regarded as a fundamental activity of the course, developing the student’s ability to record
research, process and reflection, skills that are required in all assessment tasks.

Research
When carrying out research, students should ensure that they consult a suitable range of reliable sources,
which may be primary or secondary. At HL level students are required to consult both primary and
secondary sources in researching a theatre theorist and related theories. The suitability of the sources for
each assessment task will depend on its nature and use, and on the play, theory, starting point, convention

and context being investigated. As well as the more obvious sources (books, websites, videos, DVDs, articles)
research may also include live experiences and encounters such as workshops, lectures, correspondence
with experts and performances. All sources consulted during the course must be cited following the
protocol of the referencing style chosen by the school and be presented both at point of use and in a list of
sources.
Please note that each of the assessment tasks for theatre require a separate list of sources to be submitted as
part of the formal requirements.

Syllabus

Syllabus content

The taught activities outlined below are expected to be delivered prior to students commencing the formal
assessment tasks, for which students will be required to explore theatre theorists, play texts, starting points
and world theatre traditions they have not previously studied in depth as part of the core syllabus.

Theatre in context
The theatre in context area of the course allows students to consider the three contexts in which theatre
can be created, presented and experienced by an audience. Its primary aim is to encourage students to
investigate the personal, theoretical and cultural contexts of theatre. These contexts are:
•

personal context—students identify their own personal contexts and understand the impact their
interests, influences and inspirations have on their choices, approaches and interpretations. This
includes taking into consideration their own geographical location, cultural background, skills and
experiences and the impact these make on the sort of theatre that they create and present

•

theoretical context—students identify and understand the theatre theory that informs various play
texts, theatre practices, theatre theorists and world theatre traditions across time and place. They
practically apply this understanding to their work

•

cultural context—students identify and understand the cultural, social, political and historical factors
that affect theatre practice. They practically apply this understanding to their work.

One of the major objectives of the theatre in context area is also to enrich students’ development throughout
the course by ensuring they experience theatre from a variety of times, places and cultures, both in theory
and practice. Students should examine and experience these theatre traditions and performance practices
practically. The syllabus should be flexible enough to ensure that both independent inquiry and group work
take place.
This part of the course requires that students develop skills, knowledge and understanding in the following
areas:
•

the ability to research and analyse play texts, theatre theorists (HL only),world theatre traditions and
performance practices from a variety of cultural contexts (SL and HL)

•

experience the practical presentation and performance skills of theatre practices from a variety of
cultures, through workshops, practical engagement and experimentation with skills particular to
these practices

•

the ability to appreciate critically theatre performances from a diverse range of theatre practices from
various cultural contexts, and to discern the relationship between performance and any theory that
may inform it

•

an appreciation of the cultural, aesthetic and intellectual contexts from which theatre evolves and to
which it contributes

•

the understanding of the significance of theatre and its impact on the lives of particular communities
within a specific cultural context.

Theatre guide

21

Syllabus content

Creating theatre based on theatre theory (HL only)
Teachers must ensure that students at HL have experience of creating theatre based on theatre theory,
researching and examining the various contexts of at least one theatre theorist. A theatre theorist is defined
as someone who has developed and contributed to theatre theory. It is important that the theatre theorist
selected has made a significant contribution to theatre and that the theories are documented and publicly
available.
Taught activities for this area might include:
•

leading sessions introducing key moments in theatre history; identifying specific theatre theorists,
with discussion as to their impact on theatre theory and practice

•

exercises in selecting key and relevant points from a range of research materials

•

identifying and engaging with available internal primary and secondary sources (such as books and
audio-visual materials) through the use of the theatre department library, school resources centre or
appropriate theatre-specific internet sites; participation in practical workshops might also be referred
to as primary or secondary research

•

asking students while working practically with a theorist’s ideas to identify connections between
practice and theory

•

getting students to record in their theatre journals personal responses to the ideas of the theorists
studied and using this as a basis for class discussion around how these might inform and influence the
student’s own work.

Working with play texts (SL and HL)
Teachers must ensure that students have experience of working with play texts, researching and examining
the various contexts of at least one published play text and reflecting on live theatre moments they have
experienced as spectators.
Taught activities for this area might include:
•

exercises encouraging students to interpret play texts, focusing on the ideas in the text and the
relationship of these ideas to the playwright’s own life, cultural context and time

•

identifying and evaluating as spectators how specific moments of tension, emotion, atmosphere, and
the communication of meaning were directed in a local theatre production

•

conducting a workshop in the three different contexts identified in this theatre guide through a
practical class research activity, using a play all students have read as a stimuli

•

researching a play text and guiding the students to present their findings through text and visuals,
highlighting how this influences their own creative responses

•

practically examining the theatrical theory that informs particular moments in a play text and the
creation of tension, emotion, atmosphere and the communication of meaning.

Examining world theatre traditions (SL and HL)
Teachers must ensure that students have experience of examining world theatre traditions, researching and
examining the various contexts of at least one world theatre tradition. A theatre tradition has a fixed set of
specific performance conventions that are ways of doing things and do not change significantly over time.
Taught activities for this area might include:
•

22

leading a session, using sources present within the school, to teach effective citation of sources and
appropriate recording of research in the theatre journal

Theatre guide

Syllabus content

•

setting up a “source hunt” for a particular theatre tradition being studied as a whole group; identifying
what makes reliable and useful research from the sources identified by the class

•

using one particular theatre tradition as a class case study to examine and analyse the relationship
between theatre conventions and the theoretical and/or cultural context of the theatre tradition

•

asking students to choose a convention from a theatre tradition being explored and present the
connections from the convention to the theoretical and cultural context of the tradition.

Collaboratively creating original theatre (SL and HL)
Teachers must ensure that students have experience of collaboratively creating original theatre, researching
and examining the various contexts of at least one starting point (idea, issue, theme, non-dramatic text,
music, object, image, event or site) and at least one professional theatre company that collaboratively
creates original work. Students should also have experience of reflecting on their own personal approaches,
interests and skills in theatre.
Taught activities for this area might include:
•

introducing the use of the theatre journal as a place to record the student’s personal context—their
theatre skills, processes, ideas, influences, inspirations and how these impact on the theatre they make

•

recording and reflecting on research into the creative and collaborative processes of a specific
professional theatre company who collaboratively create original material

•

introducing a common starting point and asking students to research, examine and present the
cultural, theoretical and personal context of that starting point to the group

•

getting students to choose an individual starting point and recording their personal responses to it,
sharing through pair and group work where appropriate

•

conducting research into the theory behind collaboration and original theatre-making (often referred
to as “devising”) processes.

Theatre processes
The theatre processes area of the course allows students to explore the different processes involved in
making theatre from the perspectives of creator, designer, director and performer; in order to develop the
skills required to make theatre and to observe and reflect on processes used in different theatre traditions
and performance practices from around the world.
The syllabus should be flexible enough to ensure that students acquire the necessary skills and practical
knowledge required for performance and production. Students should develop both breadth and depth
in their skills and understandings. This involves exploring the essential elements of the performance
and production processes outlined below and an understanding of how production elements function
individually and with each other in order to create tension, emotion, atmosphere and/or meaning.
The theatre processes area requires that students develop skills, knowledge and understanding in the
following areas.
•

Creating—an understanding of different approaches to creating original and scripted theatre and an
understanding of the art form and its elements (such as tension, emotion, atmosphere, communicating
meaning, character, plot, symbol and aesthetics). Students should have an awareness of different
styles of theatre, different performance spaces, structures, narrative and non-narrative forms of
theatre. This study may include evaluating a range of different approaches to making theatre, from
diverse cultures and theatre traditions and performance practices including collaborative processes.
Students should have practical experience of the various processes of transforming play texts into live
action, forming and communicating directorial intentions through text and visuals.

Theatre guide

23

Syllabus content

•

Designing—an understanding of the principles and processes involved in designing. Students should
explore diverse performance spaces and have an understanding of how production elements function
individually and together. These elements include scenic design elements (such as set, costume,
make-up and props) and technical design elements (such as lighting, sound and projection). Students
should explore the use of production elements in diverse theatre traditions, performance practices
and contexts.

•

Directing—a knowledge and appreciation of the processes undertaken by different directors
in staging play texts with an understanding of directorial intentions and the different processes
undertaken by directors to create a particular impact on an audience. This study can include evaluating
directorial techniques from diverse theatre traditions, performance practices and contexts. Students
should explore the various processes through which artistic ideas, intentions and interpretations are
communicated to others.

•

Performing—an understanding of rehearsal processes, performer training and the development of
skills related to the use of voice, body, face, movement and gesture in performance. Students should
examine these practically. This area of study can include evaluating approaches to performance,
performer training, performance conventions and techniques from diverse theatre traditions and
performance practices.

•

Spectating—an understanding of how an audience receives, experiences and responds to theatre
and how to analyse and critique a production. This requires students to watch, critique and reflect on
the impact live theatre productions have on them. They also need to be aware of how the experience
of these live productions inspires, influences and informs their artistic choices and their own work as
creators of theatre, designers, directors and performers.

presentations and demonstrations, journals and at HL, solo performances. Students are required to explore
this area from the perspective of creator, director, performer and designer.
The syllabus should be flexible enough to ensure that students can participate in a wide range of
performance, production and presentation tasks. Students should also experience productions in a variety
of performance styles. An integral part of this experience is the process of self-reflection (in conjunction
with the theatre journal) and an awareness of how audiences engage with a performance.

Assessment

Assessment in the Diploma Programme

General
Assessment is an integral part of teaching and learning. The most important aims of assessment in the
Diploma Programme are that it should support curricular goals and encourage appropriate student
learning. Both external and internal assessments are used in the Diploma Programme. IB examiners mark
work produced for external assessment, while work produced for internal assessment is marked by teachers
and externally moderated by the IB.
There are two types of assessment identified by the IB.
•

Formative assessment informs both teaching and learning. It is concerned with providing accurate
and helpful feedback to students and teachers on the kind of learning taking place and the nature of
students’ strengths and weaknesses in order to help develop students’ understanding and capabilities.
Formative assessment can also help to improve teaching quality, as it can provide information to
monitor progress towards meeting the course aims and objectives.

•

Summative assessment gives an overview of previous learning and is concerned with measuring
student achievement.

The Diploma Programme primarily focuses on summative assessment designed to record student
achievement at, or towards the end of, the course of study. However, many of the assessment instruments
can also be used formatively during the course of teaching and learning, and teachers are encouraged to
do this. A comprehensive assessment plan is viewed as being integral with teaching, learning and course
organization. For further information, see the IB Programme standards and practices document.
The approach to assessment used by the IB is criterion-related, not norm-referenced. This approach to
assessment judges students’ work by their performance in relation to identified levels of attainment, and
not in relation to the work of other students. For further information on assessment within the Diploma
Programme please refer to the publication Diploma Programme assessment: Principles and practice.
To support teachers in the planning, delivery and assessment of the Diploma Programme courses, a variety
of resources can be found on the OCC or purchased from the IB store (store.ibo.org).
Additional publications such as specimen papers and markschemes, teacher support materials, subject
reports and grade descriptors can also be found on the OCC. Past examination papers as well as
markschemes can be purchased from the IB store.

Methods of assessment
The IB uses several methods to assess work produced by students.

Assessment criteria
Assessment criteria are used when the assessment task is open-ended. Each criterion concentrates on
a particular skill that students are expected to demonstrate. An assessment objective describes what
students should be able to do, and assessment criteria describe how well they should be able to do it. Using
assessment criteria allows discrimination between different answers and encourages a variety of responses.
30

Theatre guide

Assessment in the Diploma Programme
Each criterion comprises a set of hierarchically ordered level descriptors. Each level descriptor is worth one
or more marks. Each criterion is applied independently using a best-fit model. The maximum marks for each
criterion may differ according to the criterion’s importance. The marks awarded for each criterion are added
together to give the total mark for the piece of work.

Markbands
Markbands are a comprehensive statement of expected performance against which responses are judged.
They represent a single holistic criterion divided into level descriptors. Each level descriptor corresponds
to a range of marks to differentiate student performance. A best-fit approach is used to ascertain which
particular mark to use from the possible range for each level descriptor.

Analytic markschemes
Analytic markschemes are prepared for those examination questions that expect a particular kind of
response and/or a given final answer from students. They give detailed instructions to examiners on how to
break down the total mark for each question for different parts of the response.

Marking notes
For some assessment components marked using assessment criteria, marking notes are provided. Marking
notes give guidance on how to apply assessment criteria to the particular requirements of a question.

Inclusive assessment arrangements
Inclusive assessment arrangements are available for students with assessment access requirements. These
arrangements enable students with diverse needs to access the examinations and demonstrate their
knowledge and understanding of the constructs being assessed.
The IB document Candidates with assessment access requirements provides details on all the inclusive
assessment arrangements available to students with learning support requirements. The IB document
Learning diversity and inclusion in IB programmes outlines the position of the IB with regard to students
with diverse learning needs in the IB programmes. For students affected by adverse circumstances, the IB
documents General regulations: Diploma Programme and the Handbook of procedures for the Diploma
Programme provide details on access consideration.

Responsibilities of the school
The school is required to ensure that equal access arrangements and reasonable adjustments are provided
to students with special educational needs that are in line with the IB documents Candidates with assessment
access requirements and Learning diversity and inclusion in IB programmes.

Teacher support material
Please note that the advice for structuring assessment materials contained within each of the
assessment tasks is for guidance only and is not intended to be prescriptive nor restrictive. Further
examples of how to structure assessment work can be found in the Theatre teacher support material..

HL 35%

Introduction
Students at HL research a theatre theorist they have not previously studied, identify an aspect (or aspects)
of their theory, develop and present a solo theatre piece (4–8 minutes) based on an aspect(s) of this theory.
This task develops, builds on and extends the skills and understandings developed in the other areas of the
syllabus. It requires students to create a fully produced piece of theatre based on theatre theory. Students
submit a report (maximum 3,000 words) which includes their research into and understandings of the
theorist, the theory and the context of the theorist’s work. It also records their practical explorations of the
selected aspect(s) of theory, the development of the solo theatre piece and evaluation of the theatre piece
and its implications on their learning in theatre.
Perspective—candidates should approach this task from the four perspectives of creator, director, designer
and performer.
Aim—the aim of this task is for students to:
•

explore the practical implications of theatre theory

•

put theory into practice by developing and presenting a solo piece of theatre based on theatre theory.

•

Understandings—through this exploration students will understand:

•

the various contexts of at least one theatre theorist

•

the relationship between theatre theory and practice

•

the ways in which theatre theory informs and influences the development and presentation of a piece
of theatre.

It is important to note that this is not a performance-only task, but rather brings together the skills of
creating, designing, directing and performing; focussing on (an) aspect/s of a theatre theorist’s theory. It is
fundamentally a task which asks students to consider:
•

how to make a piece of theatre based on an aspect(s) of theory

•

the most appropriate theatre form and performance material required to present the aspect/s of
theory

•

the practical presentation of this aspect(s) of theory through their performance

•

the most appropriate scenic and technical design elements needed to support the presentation of this
aspect/s of theory.

Theatre guide

External assessment

This task does not assess performance skills, but rather the extent to which students can learn, embody and
communicate their understanding through a fully produced solo performance.

Definitions
Theatre theorist
A theatre theorist is a theatre practitioner who has contributed to the shaping and development
of theatre through his or her published work and ideas (primary sources). In addition, there are
published works by others (secondary sources) regarding the theatre theorist’s contributions, ideas
and the impact they have had on theatre practice, signifying that the theatre theorist’s work has had
implications beyond his or her own practice and an impact on theatre in general. Theatre theorists
will often present frameworks, approaches, techniques and models of practice. They will often
develop existing theatre practice or shed a new light on it, as well as innovating new forms and
approaches.
Solo theatre piece
A solo theatre piece is a piece of theatre created, designed, directed and performed by an individual.
Theatre theory
Theatre theory relates to ideas that inform the creation, performance and presentation of theatre. It
encompasses ideas about theatre as an art form, genre, style, theatre processes and theatre practices.
An aspect of theatre theory
An aspect of theatre theory refers to one particular strand of a theatre theorist’s work. It may be an
idea, a process, a series of exercises, a stylistic element, a convention, a technique or an approach.

Preparation process
In preparation for this task within the core syllabus students at HL must have had experience of:

Assessing the task
Students then undertake the following process for assessment.

Theatre in context
•

Each student selects a theatre theorist whose work interests them and who they have not previously
studied as part of their IB programme. The selected theorist may have been referred to or experienced
in a workshop but must not have been taught as the focus of a unit of work by the teacher.

•

Each student selects an aspect (or aspects) of the theatre theorists’ theory they want to explore further.

•

Each student researches the selected aspect (or aspects) of theory using both primary sources (those
directly attributed to the theorist) and secondary sources.

•

Each student documents this in their theatre journal.

34

Theatre guide

External assessment

Theatre processes
•

Each student engages in a process of practical exploration of and experimentation with the aspect/s
of the theatre theory they have selected to develop a solo theatre piece.

•

Each student identifies their intentions regarding how the aspect/s of theatre theory will be used to
inform and develop a solo theatre piece.

•

Each student develops their solo theatre piece taking into consideration feedback from their teacher,
peer mentor or theatre class and taking action in response to this feedback.

•

The student makes choices regarding the most appropriate scenic and technical design elements
needed to support the presentation of this aspect/s of theory in the solo theatre piece.

•

Each student chooses material for their solo theatre piece. They may choose to use or adapt existing
text, create new text or not use any text, as appropriate to the theorist, the nature of the aspect/s of
theory being explored and the stated intentions for the piece.

•

Each student documents this in their theatre journal.

Presenting theatre
•

Each student presents a prepared solo theatre piece to an audience. The theatre pieces may be
presented in a formal or informal performance space as appropriate to the school’s resources and to
the selected theorist and nature of the aspect/s of theory being explored. Following the presentation
of the solo theatre piece, each student holds a talkback session with the audience to assess the extent
to which the piece fulfilled the student’s intentions.

•

The solo theatre piece demonstrates the use of performance and production elements appropriate to
the student’s intentions and the aspect/s of theory they have selected

•

The audience for this task can be fellow classmates, peers or an external audience selected by the
student.

•

Each student evaluates their solo theatre piece and the extent to which they fulfilled their intentions
and the impact this had on the audience. They reflect on the insights gained through the creation,
preparation and presentation of their solo theatre piece and the implications this has for their learning
in theatre

•

Each student documents this in their theatre journal.

Using the theatre journal in this task
The students should use their theatre journal to specifically document their research (carefully recording all
sources used), practical explorations, the process of creating their solo performance, directing and design
ideas and feedback from their mentors and the teacher and the action they have taken in response to this.
Students will select, adapt and present what they have recorded in their journal as the basis and material for
the report.

Task details
Selecting the theatre theorist and theory
Students at HL identify a theatre theorist they have not previously studied who has developed and
contributed to theatre theory. Students should have little or no previous experience of researching or
practically engaging with the theatre theorist or aspect(s) of theory they select for study.
It is important that the theatre theorist selected has made a significant contribution to theatre and that
their theories are documented and publicly available. Published or recorded material of the theorist’s actual
words communicating their theatre theory must exist.
Students must ensure that the theory they select is related to theatrical theory, rather than to social,
psychological, literary, historical or cultural theory. In some cases it may be necessary to consider other
theories alongside the theatre theory, with theorists such as Augusto Boal (b.1931), for example, whose
theatre theory cannot be considered without exploring the wider political components of his work.
However, this must be clearly justified in the report.

Use of sources
For this task the student should consult both primary (the theorist’s own published or recorded words)
and secondary sources related to the theatre theorist, their theories and the aspect/s of theory chosen.
The suitability and range of the sources will depend on the theorist, the nature of their theory and the
aspect/s of theory selected. As well as the more obvious sources (books, websites, videos, DVDs, articles)
research may also include live experiences/encounters such as workshops, lectures, correspondence or
interview with an expert and performances. All sources consulted must be cited following the protocol of
the referencing style chosen by the school and submitted alongside the text of the report.

Performance material
For their solo theatre piece, students may choose to use or adapt existing text, create new text or not use
any text, as appropriate to the selected theorist and nature of the aspect/s of theory being explored. If using
a play text, this does not necessarily need to be from a play written specifically to put that theatre theorist’s
theories into practice. For example, a student would not need to choose a play by Bertolt Brecht (b.1898)
in order to explore an aspect of Epic theatre, they could, perhaps, choose to adapt a Naturalistic play text
instead as long as this is appropriate and fulfills their intentions. If using a play text, this does not need to be
one continuous speech but may be a number of sections of text woven together by the student.
As part of the collective consideration of the school, theatre students must be supported in
maintaining an ethical perspective during their course. Schools must be vigilant to ensure that work
undertaken by the student is appropriate for the context of the school and the age of the students.
Student work for this assessment task must not:

36

•

damage the environment

•

glamorize the taking of drugs

•

incite or condone intolerance or hatred of others

•

include excessive or gratuitous violence

•

make reference to, or represent, explicit sexual activity.

Theatre guide

External assessment

Designing and directing
Students must approach this task from the perspective of performer but must also make their own design
and directorial choices. These will depend on their intentions and should be appropriate to the chosen
theatre theorist and the nature of the aspect/s of theory being explored. Although students may need to
design and source specific technical or scenic elements for their theatre piece these do not need to be made
or operated by the student. A student who wishes to include an original sequence of music or projection
in their theatre piece, for example, will be expected to design and stipulate the nature, duration and style
of the music or footage required. It is acceptable, however, for someone else to capture, assemble and edit
the material under the direction of the student, as well as operate any technology required to play back
the original material for the theatre piece. This applies to scenic design elements (such as costume makeup, props and set) and technical design elements (such as lighting, projection and sound). Where found
material is used, students must be sure to state the source of the material and acknowledge the individuals
involved in its creation. Students should record all decisions made relating to the production (technical and
scenic) elements of the theatre piece in their theatre journals and address them in the submitted report,
following the protocol of the referencing style chosen by the school and copyright legislation.

Supporting the creative process
Solo performers rarely work in isolation. During the rehearsal and development process for this task
students must seek support and feedback from their classmates and from peer “mentors” (and in turn the
student may work in the role of mentor for others). The role of the peer mentor should be to ask questions
and to challenge the student to be clearer in the formulation, development and expression of their creative
ideas. This may involve question and answer sessions, support with learning lines, gaining feedback on
extracts of the theatre piece and other structured coaching activities. Key interactions with peer mentors
(who may or may not be members of the IB theatre class) must be clearly recorded in the theatre journal and
addressed in the report where the student must reflect on how this support has impacted the development
of their piece and the action they took in response to this feedback.

Technical support
The students may receive support in preparing and operating technical equipment during the theatre
piece. They must have designed and stipulated the nature of these technical elements independently even
if they do not operate the technical equipment or make the scenic elements.

Other performers
This is an individual assessment task which requires the student to present a solo theatre piece. Other
performers are not permitted to appear in any part of the final presentation of the solo theatre piece.

Requirements of the video recording
The video recording must be a continuous, unedited record and must capture the full theatre piece.
The video camera must not be switched off at any point during the presentation. More information and
guidance on the video recording of internal and external assessments can be found in the Handbook of
procedures for the Diploma Programme.

The role of the teacher
Teachers must ensure that their students are appropriately prepared for the demands of this task through
the careful planning and delivery of the core syllabus activities outlined above.
Teachers are required to meet with students at each stage of inquiry, action and reflection to discuss the
progress made to date, and to verify the authenticity of the coursework being created by each student. The
key outcomes of these one-to-one interactions, which might be formal meetings and/or informal discussions
in the classroom, must be summarized by the teacher on the DP theatre Coursework authentication

form (CAF), which is submitted to the IB as part of the upload of assessment material. This form can be found
on the theatre page of the OCC.
While students are working on the assessment task the teacher should:
•

discuss each student’s choice of theatre theorist and the aspect(s) of theory selected with them; it is
important that the theatre theorist selected is each student’s own choice

•

give feedback once only following the presentation of a work-in-progress version of the solo theatre
piece; each student must clearly record this feedback in both the theatre journal and subsequent
report; each student must reflect on the impact that this support has made on the development of
the piece

•

ensure that each student holds a talkback session with the audience to evaluate the impact the piece
had and the extent to which the piece fulfilled the student’s intentions

•

give feedback on one draft of the report.

Teachers are not permitted to direct any part of the assessed task.

During the assessment task the teacher should assist with video recording the solo theatre piece to ensure
it accurately captures the assessment task. In preparing to video record the assessed solo theatre piece
teachers are encouraged to allow students time to walk through their presentation prior to filming to give
the video camera operator an indication of how the space will be used and the most appropriate way of
framing each section.

Structuring the report
The report, which can be up to 3,000 words in length, should be written in the first person but use a formal,
academic register. It should, where appropriate, present the student’s personal discoveries, explorations,
intention, process of development, design and the analysis of their theatre piece.
The student may use any relevant illustrations, annotated text, charts, mind maps, visuals, diagrams,
or designs considered necessary. These must be clearly annotated and appropriately referenced to
acknowledge the source, following the protocol of the referencing style chosen by the school. When
students include any of their own photographs or images, these must also be identified and acknowledged
in the same way. Any text that appears within a visual does not count as part of the word limit. There is
no lower limit on the number of words a student can submit for this task and teachers are encouraged to
remind students that their work will be assessed on how it best fulfills the assessment criteria for the task
and not judged on how many words are submitted.
The report should contain a table of contents (which is excluded from the word count) and all pages should
be numbered. The main body of the report should be structured using the following subheadings:
1.

The theorist, the selected aspect/s theory and the contexts

2.

Practical explorations, performance and production intentions and development of the performance
and production of the solo theatre piece

3.

Evaluation of the solo theatre piece and the implications this has on my work in theatre

Students are required to submit a separate list of all sources cited.

Academic honesty
All sources must be acknowledged following the protocol of the referencing style chosen by the
school. If a student uses work, ideas or images belonging to another person in the presentation of the
solo theatre piece or the report, the student must acknowledge the source at point of use and in a list
of sources. A student’s failure to acknowledge a source will be investigated by the IB as a potential
breach of regulations that may result in a penalty imposed by the IB final award committee.

External assessment

The size and format of pages submitted for assessment is not prescribed. Submitted materials are assessed
on screen and students must ensure that their work is clear and legible when presented in a digital, onscreen format. To ensure that examiners are able to gain an overall and legible impression of each page
without excessive scrolling, students are recommended to use common page sizes (such as legal, A4 or
folio). Overcrowded or illegible materials may result in examiners being unable to interpret and understand
the intentions of the work.

Formal requirements of the task
Each student submits for assessment:
•

a report (3,000 words maximum) which includes:
––

the student’s research and understandings regarding the theorist, the selected aspect/s of
theory and the context of both the theorist’s work and the selected aspect

––

the student’s practical explorations of the selected aspect(s) of the theory, their intentions and
the development of the solo theatre piece

––

the student’s analysis and evaluation of the presentation of the solo theatre piece and the
implications this has on their learning

•

a continuous unedited video recording of the whole solo theatre piece (4–8 minutes)

•

a list of all primary and secondary sources cited.

The procedure for submitting the assessment materials can be found in the Handbook of procedures for the
Diploma Programme. Students are required to indicate the length of the video recording and the number
of words used when the materials are submitted. Where submitted materials exceed the prescribed time or
word limits examiners are instructed to base their assessment solely on the materials that appear within the
limits.

Task 2: Director’s notebook
SL 35%, HL 20%

Introduction
Students at HL and SL independently choose a published play text, read the text and record their personal
responses. They then:
•

research and record the cultural and/or theoretical context of the play and identify ideas the playwright
may be addressing and how these are presented

•

explore the entire play and record their own ideas, explorations and responses prior to forming their
directorial intentions

•

reference live theatre performances they have experienced as a spectator that have influenced,
inspired or informed them as directors. They explain how directors of these productions have created
moments of tension, emotion, atmosphere and/or meaning. The live theatre performances must not
be productions of the same play text selected for study in this assessment task.

•

explain their directorial intention(s) and intended impact on audience for the entire play supported by
production and performance ideas

•

explain how they will stage two particular moments of the play; these can be moments of tension,
emotion, atmosphere or which communicate the meaning(s) of the play; they must demonstrate
an understanding of how performance and production elements function together to create these
moments

This process is recorded and presented in the form of a director’s notebook (20 pages maximum) which is
made up of visuals and words.
This is a theoretical exercise. The play text is not actually staged as part of the assessment task though a
student may choose to work practically as part of the process of exploring the play or examining particular
moments. Students are not permitted to edit, make additions or alterations to the play text selected for
study. All sources must be acknowledged following the protocol of the referencing style chosen by the
school.
Perspective—candidates should approach this task from the perspective of director.
Aim—the aim of this task is for students to explore the processes involved in transforming a play text into
live action by developing a directorial vision for staging the play text.
Understandings—through this exploration students will understand:
•

the importance of research into the context of a play text and how this can inform directorial intentions
for staging the play text

•

the artistic processes required to transform text into action

•

how meaning is communicated on stage and how to create moments of tension, emotion, atmosphere
how performance and production elements function together to create an intended impact for an
audience

•

how live performances they have experienced influence, inspire and inform their work as directors.

Definitions
The director of a play text
A director is responsible for the staging of the play. He or she interprets the play text and identifies
his or her directorial intentions regarding how the play will be presented and the impact he or she
wishes to have on a particular audience. The director works with actors and a production team to
stage the play, transforming ideas into action.
The director’s notebook
The director’s notebook is a document developed by the director prior to rehearsals and any
meetings with the performers or production team. It is a record of the director’s personal process
of exploring, interpreting and responding to the play. The director references productions he or she
has experienced as a spectator and explains how other directors have used elements of performance
and production to create tension, emotion, atmosphere and/or meaning. The notebook presents
the director’s intentions and an idea of what impact he or she wants the play to have on an audience
supported by a range of performance and production ideas. The director begins to think about how
particular moments may be staged and how elements of performance and production will be used
to create tension, emotion, atmosphere and/or meaning in order to have a particular impact on the
audience.

Preparation process
In preparation for this task within the core syllabus students at SL and HL must have had experience of:

SL and HL

Working
with play
texts

THEATRE IN CONTEXT

THEATRE PROCESSES

PRESENTING THEATRE

Researching and examining
the various contexts of at
least one published play
text and reflecting on live
theatre moments they have
experienced as spectators.

Taking part in the practical
exploration of at least two
contrasting published play
texts and engaging with
the process of transforming
a play text into action.

Directing at least one
scene or section from one
published play text which is
presented to others.

Each student chooses a play text that they have not previously studied, and for which they can clearly
identify the potential for success in transforming it from page to stage. Once selected, the chosen play text
cannot be used by the student in any other assessment task for this course.

Assessing the task
Students then undertake the following process for assessment.

Theatre in context
•

Each student carries out research into the cultural context from which the play originates and/or
research into the play text’s theoretical context, focusing on its style, form, practice or genre.

•

Each student identifies the key ideas presented by the playwright in the entire play (such as intended
meanings, motifs, themes or throughline). As the author(s) of the text, the playwright might be one
person, more than one person or in some cases a theatre company.

•

Each student documents this in their theatre journal.

46

Theatre guide

External assessment

Theatre processes
•

Each student records their artistic responses, creative ideas and explorations of the entire play text
prior to formulating their directorial intentions.

•

Each student makes links to live theatre performances they have experienced as a spectator that
have influenced, inspired or informed them as directors. They explain how directors of these
productions have created moments of tension, emotion, atmosphere and/or meaning. The live theatre
performances must not be productions of the same play text selected for study in this assessment
task.

•

Each student documents this in their theatre journal.

Presenting theatre
•

To what extent does the student clearly explain their directorial intentions for the staging of the entire
play text, supporting these intentions with a range of imaginative production and performance ideas?

•

To what extent does the student explain their intended impact of the entire play on the audience and
explain how their performance and production ideas would together create this intended impact on
the audience?

•

Each student explains their directorial intention(s) for the staging of the entire play text, supporting
these intentions with a range of imaginative production and performance ideas, explaining
performance space, performance style and production elements (scenic and technical).

•

Each student explains their intended impact of the entire play on the audience and how their
performance and production ideas would together create this intended impact on the audience.

•

Each student explains how they would stage two specific moments of the play and explain how they
would use production and performance ideas in these two moments of the play to effectively create
tension, emotion, atmosphere and/or meaning for an audience.

•

Each student documents this in their theatre journal.

This task is concerned with the textual exploration a director might carry out before they go into
the rehearsal room to work with actors, defining what they want to bring out of the text and how it
might look when finally staged. The process of how this might be achieved through rehearsals is not
the focus of this task.
It is unlikely that a director would be responsible for the full scenic or technical design of the final
theatre production; however their vision for the staging of the play text would certainly involve
a clear understanding of how individual production elements might be employed to fulfill their
directorial intentions and how these would potentially impact on the audience.

Using the visual arts journal in this task
The students should use their theatre journal to document their initial responses to reading the play text
and research conducted, as well as influences on their intended process and final production. The journal
should also be used to record the thoughts and ideas that contribute to the development of their directorial
vision. From the journal they will select, adapt and present for submission an annotated selection of their
research and exploration as the basis for the director’s notebook, focusing on clearly communicating their
processes and justification for their artistic decisions and choices. Students should also use the journal to
document their experiences of live theatre productions seen during the course. Particular attention should
be given to how directors of live theatre integrate performance and production elements to create effective
moments of tension, emotion, atmosphere or the communication of a message.

Task details
Selecting the play text
Students choose a published play text that they have not previously studied, which they are interested
in exploring as a director and which would allow them to successfully fulfill the assessment requirements
and criteria of the task. Students should have little or no previous experience of researching or practically
engaging with the published play text they select for study.
It is expected that students will consult and refer to a number of play texts prior to their final selection.
It is important for teachers to allow students to select their own play text. The key to success in this task
is for students to select a text that excites their imagination and that they would be passionate about
transforming into action.
The play text must remain unaltered. Students are not permitted to edit, make additions or alterations to
the original printed work. They may, however, in communicating their vision for the staging of the selected
play text, add as much additional action or introduce additional elements of design if this will help them
to realise their vision for the staging. In every case this should be appropriate to the play text and students
must clearly identify and justify these additions.
The play text does not necessarily have to be set within the original practice or style for which it was
originally intended. Students may wish to set the play in a contrasting practice or style in order to bring out
a particular idea or theme appropriate to the work.
Students are permitted to work with play texts written in any language. Any descriptions of plot or direct
quotations, however, must be translated into the language in which they are being assessed.
Students must address the context, ideas and staging of the entire play text and not just the selected two
moments of theatre.

Discussing live theatre performance
Students are required to discuss and make links to live theatre performances they have experienced
as a spectator during the theatre course. Students should identify performances that have influenced,
inspired or informed them and should pay particular attention to how directors employed production and
performance elements to create effective moments of tension, emotion, atmosphere or moments that
communicated meaning in the live theatre performance experienced.
The live theatre performances identified must not be productions of the same play text selected for study
in this assessment task. Students are not permitted to write about productions in which they have had
involvement, for example school plays in which they helped backstage or local productions in which they
performed.

Use of sources
As well as the more obvious sources (books, websites, videos, DVDs, articles) valid research may also
include the student’s own practical explorations of the play. Students are also required to refer to theatre
experiences they have had as a spectator. All sources consulted must be acknowledged following the
protocol of the referencing style chosen by the school and be presented in a bibliography and as footnotes,
endnotes or within the body of the text of the director’s notebook.

The role of the teacher
Teachers must ensure that their students are appropriately prepared for the demands of this task through
the careful planning and delivery of the core syllabus activities outlined above.
Teachers are required to meet with students at each stage of inquiry, action and reflection to discuss the
progress made to date, and to verify the authenticity of the coursework being created by each student. The
key outcomes of these one-to-one interactions, which might be formal meetings and/or informal discussions

48

Theatre guide

External assessment

in the classroom, must be summarized by the teacher on the DP theatre Coursework authentication
form (CAF), which is submitted to the IB as part of the upload of assessment material. This form can be found
on the theatre page of the OCC.
While the student is working on the assessment task the teacher should:
•

discuss each student’s choice of play text; it is important that the play text selected is the student’s
own choice

•

guide the students’ explorations and discuss their ideas, without prescribing them; this process may
involve questioning and encouraging the students to expand on their vision and its feasibility, but
should not involve making decisions on their behalf

•

ensure that the students have access to live theatre performances in which performance and
production elements are employed effectively

•

ensure that the students are acknowledging all sources used and referencing them appropriately

•

give feedback on one draft of the director’s notebook.

Structuring the director’s notebook
The director’s notebook, which can be up to 20 pages in length, should be a combination of creative ideas,
presented in both words and visuals, along with detailed ideas and explanations. The director’s notebook
should be written in the first person and present the student’s personal interpretations, responses, ideas,
discoveries and intentions for the proposed staging of their selected play text. Students should be as precise
and specific as possible when discussing performance and production elements. The use of subject specific
terminology may help to give a sense to this precision.
Students may use any relevant illustrations, annotated text, charts, mind maps, visuals, diagrams, designs
and so on. These must be clearly annotated and appropriately referenced to acknowledge the source,
following the protocol of the referencing style chosen by the school. When students include any of their
own photographs or images, these must also be identified and acknowledged in the same way. There is no
lower limit on the number of pages that students can submit for this task and teachers are encouraged to
remind students that their work will be assessed on how it best fulfills the assessment criteria for the task
and not judged on how many pages are submitted.
The director’s notebook should contain a table of contents (which is excluded from the page count) and
all pages should be numbered. The main body of the director’s notebook should be structured using the
following subheadings:
1.

The play text, its context and the ideas presented in the entire play

2.

My artistic responses, creative ideas and explorations for the entire play prior to the forming of
directorial intentions

3.

My own experiences of live theatre as a spectator and how directors use performance and production
elements

4.

My directorial intentions for the entire play and the intended impact on an audience

5.

How I would stage two moments of the play

Students are required to submit a separate list of all sources cited.

Theatre guide

49

External assessment

Academic honesty
All sources must be acknowledged following the protocol of the referencing style chosen by the school. If
a student uses work, ideas or images belonging to another person in the director’s notebook the student
must acknowledge the source at point of use and in a list of sources. A student’s failure to acknowledge
a source will be investigated by the IB as a potential breach of regulations that may result in a penalty
imposed by the IB final award committee.

Formal requirements of the task
Each student submits for assessment:
•

•

a director’s notebook (20 pages maximum) which includes:
––

the student’s research into the published play text, its relevant contexts and the ideas presented
in the entire play

––

the student’s artistic responses and explorations of the entire play text as a director

––

the student’s experience as a spectator of live theatre performances that have influenced,
inspired or informed them and an explanation of how directors have created moments of
tension, emotion, atmosphere or meaning

––

the student’s presentation of their final directorial intentions and the intended impact of these
on an audience

––

the student’s ideas regarding the staging of two specific moments from the play and how these
would create the desired impact on an audience

a list of all sources cited.

The size and format of pages submitted for assessment is not prescribed to enable students to be creative
with how they record and present their work. Submitted materials are assessed on screen and students
must ensure that their work is clear and legible when presented in a digital, on-screen format. To ensure
that examiners are able to gain an overall and legible impression of each page without excessive scrolling,
students are recommended to use common page sizes (such as legal, A4 or folio). Overcrowded or illegible
materials may result in examiners being unable to interpret and understand the intentions of the work.
The procedure for submitting the assessment materials can be found in the Handbook of procedures for
the Diploma Programme. Students are required to indicate the number of pages used when the materials
are submitted. Where the submitted materials exceed the prescribed page limit examiners are instructed to
base their assessment solely on the first 20 pages.

Task 3: research presentation
SL 30%, HL 20%

Introduction
Students at HL and SL plan and deliver an individual presentation (15 minutes maximum) to their peers in
which they outline their research and exploration of a theatre tradition they have not previously studied
(selected from the prescribed list below). Students research the cultural and/or theoretical context of
the selected theatre tradition and identify one performance convention from this tradition to explore
practically and physically. The presentation must include a physical demonstration of the student’s practical
and physical explorations of the performance convention and its application to a moment of theatre. The
student then reflects on the impact this learning has had on them as a performer and explains how this
learning compares and connects to another performance practice.
Students submit a continuous, unedited video recording of the live presentation (15 minutes maximum) and
a list of sources, as well as any additional resources they have used in their presentation that is not clearly
seen or understood within the video.

Perspective—candidates should approach this task from the perspective of performer. Aim—the aim of this
task is for students to:
•

engage in research into a world theatre tradition they have not previously studied and understand its
cultural and/or theoretical contexts

•

explore a performance convention from that world theatre tradition and demonstrate the processes
they have undergone to physically explore and understand this convention

•

understand the performance convention as a result of practical and physical exploration of the
performance convention in the body and apply this to a moment of theatre

•

understand how the exploration of this performance convention develops them as a performer and
the connections between performance in theatre practices around the world.

Understandings—through this exploration students will understand:
•

how to practically and physically explore performance conventions from around the world

•

how to apply the selected conventions to moments of theatre

•

that a world theatre tradition has a fixed set of specific performance conventions unique to that
tradition which do not change significantly over time

•

the significance and value of world theatre traditions and performance conventions to the cultures
from which they evolve

•

the significance of learning about theatre traditions not previously studied on the student’s own
development.

•

the connections between performance conventions across theatre practices.

Definitions
Theatre tradition
A theatre tradition is a theatre practice that has a fixed set of specific performance conventions that
have not changed significantly over time.
Performance convention
A performance convention is a significant and identifiable element of performance that is usually
culturally recognized, accepted and identified as a key feature of the theatre tradition. Performance
conventions have a particular function within a tradition and are a key feature of communication to
the audience. Many conventions are unique to their theatre tradition, although some may appear in
similar form but with significant variations in other world theatre practices.
Moment of theatre
A moment of theatre is a short and concentrated theatrical presentation used to demonstrate a
particular idea, action or narrative.

Preparation process
In preparation for this task within the core syllabus students at SL and HL must have had experience of:

Each student chooses and researches a world theatre tradition they have not previously studied in
depth from the prescribed list below. They research the cultural and/or theoretical context of the
selected world theatre tradition.

•

Each student identifies the performance conventions required by a performer in the world theatre
tradition and selects one of these performance conventions to physically and practically explore for
this task. Each student researches and examines the one performance convention within the context
of the world theatre tradition from which it originates.

•

Each student documents this in their theatre journal.

Theatre processes
•

Each student physically and practically explores the one performance convention they have selected
and records the processes they undertake for this exploration.

•

Each student begins to practically examine how the selected performance convention could be
physically applied to a moment of theatre. The moment they select may be from the world theatre
tradition itself, from another theatre practice or may be material generated by the student. It should

56

External assessment

be selected in order to demonstrate the particular performance convention selected and should be
appropriate to the theatre tradition and the selected convention.
•

Each student documents this in their theatre journal as they reflect on the development of their skills
and knowledge and the process of exploring what is necessary to be a performer in this world theatre
tradition.

Using the theatre journal in this task
The student should use the theatre journal to document the research and discoveries made and to
organize the structure of the presentation. It should contain the discoveries of research into the theatre
tradition and its relationship to the cultural context of the theatre tradition. Students should identify
performance conventions of the chosen theatre tradition; select one to focus on; place the convention
within the context of the theatre tradition; record the process of physically exploring and applying
the performance convention to a moment of theatre; record their learning and place the experience
into a personal context as it relates to their development as a theatre-maker or learner. They should
make connections between this performance convention and another theatre practice. All
sources must be acknowledged following the referencing style chosen by the school.

Presenting theatre
•

Each student presents the world theatre tradition, its contexts and the selected performance
convention.

•

Each student presents the processes they have undertaken to practically and physically examine this
convention.

•

Each student demonstrates and explains how they have applied this convention to a moment of
theatre. This is presented as a “work in progress” and is not polished or fully produced.

•

Each student presents their reflection on the impact this learning has had on them, how this links to
their work as a performer and how the performance convention explored compares to ONE other
performance practice. The entire presentation (maximum 15 minutes) is delivered to the teacher and
to peers and is filmed as a continuous unedited shot.

Having selected a world theatre tradition from the table above, students should carry out research in order
to identify the unique performance conventions required by a performer in this theatre tradition. Students
select one particular performance convention from those identified and begin the process of exploring it
practically, physically and in depth. These explorations should be centred in the use of the performer’s body
and can relate to one or more of the following:
•

gesture

•

face

•

body

•

movement

•

voice.

Each student should be encouraged to select a performance convention that provides the best opportunity
to exemplify the assessment criteria fully. The best of use of time, resources, space, and issues of health and
safety must also be considered when a student makes their choice.

Applying research to a moment of theatre
The assessed presentation includes the application of the research to a “work-in-progress” demonstration
of an appropriate moment of theatre that demonstrates and explains the student’s understanding of the
performance convention they have practically and physically explored. This moment of theatre should be
determined by the student as an appropriate means of demonstrating and explaining how and why the
chosen performance convention selected functions within a performance context. For example, a student

58

Theatre guide

External assessment

selecting the theatre tradition of Kathakali might identify the specific performance convention of the hand
gesture language called mudras. To demonstrate and explain a range of these rich and complex hand poses
a student might select a moment from The Ramanyana. Alternatively, they may choose to use a moment
from a story they have written themselves which they think best demonstrates and explains the mudras to
others.
The moment of theatre should be presented as a “work in progress” and is not be expected to be a polished
performance. The “work in progress” should show the student grappling with the world theatre tradition
and the performance convention explored and students are required to reflect on the skills and knowledge
required to be a performer in this tradition.

Presenting a demonstration of a moment of theatre
It is important that students recognize that many theatre traditions require years and years of dedication and
practical commitment before performers are able to effectively master particular performance conventions.
While this task is not assessing a student’s ability to master a performance convention to any degree, it is
expected that students will recognize, understand and appreciate that there is something to be learned and
understood by engaging and grappling with traditions they have not previously studied. The opportunity
to unlearn, relearn and challenge our own knowledge by exploring new, unfamiliar and diverse forms from
around the world and from different times is one of the key aspects of an international theatre programme.
Where there are key production elements of the tradition that are intrinsic to the performance convention
being explored (such as basic costume, props, set pieces or stage layout) and that are deemed essential to
the demonstration, it is recommended that these production elements are created or sourced as “mock-ups”
(for example, simple piece of fabric to suggest costume, cardboard representations of props, marked out
space to show scale and layout of the stage space) to prevent students from spending time and resources
on elements that are not assessed.
It is advisable for students to present their moment of theatre with a “stop and start” approach within
the main presentation, in order to explain and analyse the relevant points regarding the performance
convention, its cultural and theoretical contexts and the impact it has had on the student’s learning and
their development as a performer.

Supporting the creative process
During the rehearsal and development process for this task students are permitted to seek support and
feedback from peer “mentors” (and in turn the student may work in the role of mentor for others). The role
of the peer mentor should be to support the student in their practical exploration and in the preparation
for the assessed presentation. They may ask questions and challenge the student to be clearer in the
expression of their understanding of the world theatre tradition and their experiences of the process of
practical exploration. This may involve question and answer sessions, support with choosing a moment of
theatre, gaining feedback on the presentation and other structured coaching activities. Key interactions
with peer mentors (who may or may not be members of the IB theatre class) must be clearly recorded in the
theatre journal and addressed in the presentation where the student must reflect on how this support has
impacted on their explorations and learning.
Each student may receive support in preparing and operating any technical equipment during their
presentation.

Other performers
This is an individual assessment task which requires each student to deliver a solo presentation. Other
students or peers are nºt permitted to appear in the presentation.

Supplementary materials
Students can use any relevant and appropriate supplementary materials that will enhance the presentation
of their research into performance and demonstrate the process of their explorations (such as projections,

Theatre guide

59

External assessment

video extracts, handouts, images, props, photographs and so on). Where these are not clearly visible within
the video recording of the presentation, students should submit them with the list of sources which is
submitted as a requirement alongside the video recording.

Requirements of the video recording
As this external assessment is assessed on screen it is crucial that the video recording captures the full
presentation. The video recording must be a continuous, unedited record and must capture any
additional resources used during the task. The video camera must not be switched off at any point during
the assessment task. More information and guidance on the video recording of internal and external
assessments can be found in the Handbook of procedures for the Diploma Programme.

Audience
The audience for this task will be peers and, if possible, students of theatre. It is important for the audience
to be open-minded, considerate and silent during each presentation. Because each student has a maximum
of 15 minutes to present this assessment task, questions and interruptions are not allowed.
When presenting, students should be prepared, organized, coherent, committed and passionate about their
chosen area of focus. Presenters should ensure they speak loud enough to be heard by both the live audience
and the audience of the video recording. Where resources are used to enhance the presentation, copies of
these resources should be submitted along with the list of sources (especially if these resources were not
clearly seen or understood within the video recording). This could include PDF copies of presentation slides,
projection images, handouts and photographs that may have been seen during the presentation.

The role of the teacher
Teachers must ensure that their students are appropriately prepared for the demands of this task through
the careful planning and delivery of the core syllabus activities outlined above.
Teachers are required to meet with students at each stage of inquiry, action and reflection to discuss the
progress made to date, and to verify the authenticity of the coursework being created by each student. The
key outcomes of these one-to-one interactions, which might be formal meetings and/or informal discussions
in the classroom, must be summarized by the teacher on the DP theatre Coursework authentication
form (CAF), which is submitted to the IB as part of the upload of assessment material. This form can be found
on the theatre page of the OCC.
While students are working on the assessment task the teacher should:
•

discuss each student’s choice of world theatre tradition, performance convention and moment of
theatre with them; it is important that these selected elements are each student’s own choice

•

provide the students with the time and place to practically and physically explore the convention

•

encourage each student to use their theatre journal to analyse and reflect on their discoveries,
learning, and the impact this new knowledge and experience has had on them

•

discuss with each student the health and safety considerations and precautions they should take
when approaching the practical exploration and application of performance convention

•

give feedback on the one student’s mock presentation prior to filming

•

provide each student with the date of their presentation well in advance to allow sufficient time for
preparation of material.

Teachers are not permitted to direct any part of the assessed task.

60

Theatre guide

External assessment

During the assessment task the teacher should assist with video recording the presentation to ensure
it accurately captures the assessment task. In preparing to video record the presentation, teachers are
encouraged to allow students time to walk through their presentation prior to filming to give the video
camera operator an indication of how the space will be used and the most appropriate way of framing each
section.

Teachers are not allowed to ask questions or interrupt the presentation.

Structuring the presentation
The presentation may be up to 15 minutes in length. It should demonstrate the research findings of the
world theatre tradition; the cultural and/or theoretical context through which the world theatre tradition
and the selected convention developed and the impact this has had on how and why it is performed; the
student’s physical and practical explorations into the performance convention from that theatre tradition;
the student’s exploration and analysis of the application of their learning to the staging of a moment of
a moment of theatre; the student’s reflection on their learning and their development as a performer, a
comparison and connection between the performance convention examined and one other performance
practice. The student may refer to notes, slides or other prompts during the presentation, but to ensure the
presentation engages their audience the student should avoid simply reading from a pre-prepared script.
Any illustrations, charts, mind maps, visuals, diagrams or designs used within the presentation must be
clearly annotated and appropriately referenced to acknowledge the source, following the referencing style
chosen by the school. When students include any of their own photographs or images in the presentation,
these must also be identified and acknowledged in the same way. There is no lower limit on the length of

Theatre guide

61

External assessment

the presentation and teachers are encouraged to remind students that their work will be assessed on how it
best fulfills the assessment criteria for the task and not judged on how many minutes they present for.
Students may wish to adapt and adopt the following structure for their presentation. This guidance, which
outlines a possible structure for presenting the work rather than a process through which to approach the
task, is neither prescriptive nor restrictive, as students should feel free to cover each section in an order
preferable to their needs and requirements.
•

The world theatre tradition and its cultural and/or theoretical context

•

The performance convention and the process of the physical and practical explorations

•

The performance convention and the process of applying this to a moment of theatre

•

Demonstration and explanation of the convention applied to a moment of theatre

•

The impact of this study on me as a learner and connections and comparisons between performance
practices

Academic honesty
Students must cite all sources at point of use throughout the presentation and any research they have
undertaken, as well as submitting a list of the sources referred to within the presentation (following the
referencing style chosen by the school). Where resources are used to enhance the presentation, copies
of these resources should be submitted along with the list of sources (especially if these resources
were not clearly seen or understood within the video recording). This could include PDF copies of
presentation slides, projection images, handouts and photographs that may have been seen during the
presentation. A student’s failure to acknowledge a source will be investigated by the IB as a potential
breach of regulations that may result in a penalty imposed by the IB final award committee.

Formal requirements of this task
Each student submits for assessment:
•

•

a continuous, unedited video recording of the live presentation(15 minutes maximum) which presents:
––

the student’s research of the selected world theatre tradition and its cultural and/or theoretical
context

––

the student’s practical and physical explorations of one performance convention selected from
the world theatre tradition

––

the student’s explanation and physical demonstration of how they might apply their research to
the staging of a moment of theatre

––

the student’s analysis of the impact of this study on them as a learner and performer

––

an explanation of how the selected performance convention compares and connects to one
other performance practice

a list of all sources cited and any additional resources used by the student during the presentation
which are not clearly seen within the video recording.

The procedure for submitting the assessment materials can be found in the Handbook of procedures for the
Diploma Programme. Students are required to indicate the length of the video recording when the materials
are submitted. Where the video recording of the presentation exceeds the prescribed limit examiners are
instructed to base their assessment solely on the first 15 minutes.

Internal assessment

Internal assessment is an integral part of the course and is compulsory for both SL and HL students. The
internal assessment requirements at SL and at HL are the same.

Guidance and authenticity
The SL and HL components submitted for internal assessment must be the student’s own work. However,
it is not the intention that students should decide upon a title or topic and be left to work on the internal
assessment component without any further support from the teacher. The teacher should play an important
role during both the planning stage and the period when the student is working on the internally assessed
work. It is the responsibility of the teacher to ensure that students are familiar with:
•

the requirements of the type of work to be internally assessed

•

the theatre course ethical guidelines

•

the assessment criteria; students must understand that the work submitted for assessment must
address these criteria effectively.

Teachers and students must discuss the internally assessed work. Students should be encouraged to initiate
discussions with the teacher to obtain advice and information, and students must not be penalized for
seeking guidance. As part of the learning process, teachers can read and give advice to students on one
draft of the work. The teacher should provide oral or written advice on how the work could be improved,
but must not write comments on the draft work or edit it. The next version handed to the teacher must be
the final version for submission.
It is the responsibility of teachers to ensure that all students understand the basic meaning and significance
of concepts that relate to academic honesty, especially authenticity and intellectual property. Teachers
must ensure that all student work for assessment is prepared according to the requirements and must
explain clearly to students that the internally assessed work must be entirely their own. Where collaboration
between students is permitted, it must be clear to all students what the difference is between collaboration
and collusion.
All work submitted to the IB for moderation or assessment must be authenticated by a teacher, and must
not include any known instances of suspected or confirmed academic misconduct. Each student must
confirm that the work is his or her authentic work and constitutes the final version of that work. Once a
student has officially submitted the final version of the work it cannot be retracted. The requirement to
confirm the authenticity of work applies to the work of all students, not just the sample work that will be
submitted to the IB for the purpose of moderation. For further details refer to the IB publication Academic
honesty, The Diploma Programme: From principles into practice and the relevant articles in the General
regulations: Diploma Programme.
Authenticity may be checked by discussion with the student on the content of the work, and scrutiny of one
or more of the following:
•

the student’s initial proposal

•

the first draft of the written work

•

the references cited

Theatre guide

67

Internal assessment

•

the style of writing compared with work known to be that of the student

•

the analysis of the work by a web-based plagiarism detection service such as www.turnitin.com.

The same piece of work cannot be submitted to meet the requirements of both the internal assessment and
the extended essay.

Time allocation
Internal assessment is an integral part of the theatre course, contributing 35% to the final assessment in the
SL course and 25% to the final assessment in the HL course. This weighting should be reflected in the time
that is allocated to teaching the knowledge, skills and understanding required to undertake the work, as
well as the total time allocated to carry out the work.
This should include:
•

time for the teacher to explain to students the requirements of the internal assessment

•

class time for students to work on the internal assessment component and ask questions

•

time for consultation between the teacher and each student

•

time to review and monitor progress, and to check authenticity.

Using assessment criteria for internal assessment
For internal assessment, a number of assessment criteria have been identified. Each assessment criterion has
level descriptors describing specific achievement levels, together with an appropriate range of marks. The
level descriptors concentrate on positive achievement, although for the lower levels failure to achieve may
be included in the description.
Teachers must judge the internally assessed work at SL and at HL against the criteria using the level
descriptors.
•

The same assessment criteria are provided for SL and HL.

•

The aim is to find, for each criterion, the descriptor that conveys most accurately the level attained
by the student, using the best-fit model. A best-fit approach means that compensation should be
made when a piece of work matches different aspects of a criterion at different levels. The mark
awarded should be one that most fairly reflects the balance of achievement against the criterion. It is
not necessary for every single aspect of a level descriptor to be met for that mark to be awarded.

•

When assessing a student’s work, teachers should read the level descriptors for each criterion until
they reach a descriptor that most appropriately describes the level of the work being assessed. If a
piece of work seems to fall between two descriptors, both descriptors should be read again and the
one that more appropriately describes the student’s work should be chosen.

•

Where there are two or more marks available within a level, teachers should award the upper marks
if the student’s work demonstrates the qualities described to a great extent; the work may be close
to achieving marks in the level above. Teachers should award the lower marks if the student’s work
demonstrates the qualities described to a lesser extent; the work may be close to achieving marks in
the level below.

•

Only whole numbers should be recorded; partial marks, (fractions and decimals) are not acceptable.

68

Theatre guide

Internal assessment

•

Teachers should not think in terms of a pass or fail boundary, but should concentrate on identifying
the appropriate descriptor for each assessment criterion.

•

The highest level descriptors do not imply faultless performance but should be achievable by a
student. Teachers should not hesitate to use the extremes if they are appropriate descriptions of the
work being assessed.

•

A student who attains a high achievement level in relation to one criterion will not necessarily
attain high achievement levels in relation to the other criteria. Similarly, a student who attains a low
achievement level for one criterion will not necessarily attain low achievement levels for the other
criteria. Teachers should not assume that the overall assessment of the students will produce any
particular distribution of marks.

•

It is strongly recommended that the assessment criteria be made available to students.

Internal assessment tasks—SL and HL
Task 4: Collaborative project
SL 35%, HL 25%

Introduction
Students at HL and SL collaboratively create and present an original piece of theatre (lasting 13–15 minutes)
to a specified target audience from a starting point selected by the ensemble. They submit a process
portfolio (15 pages maximum) which documents their own individual approaches and skills, the exploration
of the starting point selected by the ensemble, the nature of the collaboration and the student’s individual
contribution to the creation and presentation of the piece of theatre. The student submits a video recording
(4 minutes maximum) in support of the process portfolio which the student selects from the unedited video
recording of the created piece.
Perspective—all students approach this task in the role of collaborative creators of original theatre within
an ensemble.
Aim—the aim of this task is for students to:
•

participate in the collaborative process of creating an original theatre piece for presentation

•

examine and research processes of collaboratively creating original pieces of theatre

•

Collaborative creation of original theatre
The collaborative creation of original theatre involves a group of theatre makers (creators, designers,
directors and performers) who work together practically to examine and develop ideas from a
starting point in order to generate theatrical material that is then developed and structured into a
piece of theatre.
The piece of theatre is prepared for production, rehearsed and presented to an audience.
There are three parts to this process, although these are sometimes run concurrently:
•

creating, generating and developing theatrical material

•

organizing and structuring the material into a piece of theatre

•

preparing (production and performance), rehearsing and presenting the piece for an audience.

The piece of theatre that has been created is not necessarily scripted in traditional forms.
Unlike play text–based theatre written by a playwright(s), collaboratively created theatre is often
developed by the performance and production team that also stage and present the piece.
The collaborative creation of original theatre is also often referred to as devising.
Starting point
The starting point provides the inspiration for the collaborative creation of the piece of theatre. It
gives a focus to the initial stages of practical exploration.
The starting point must be one of the following.
•

Event

•

Idea, issue, question or theme

•

Image or photograph

•

Non-dramatic text

•

Object

•

Person

•

Piece of music

•

Site

•

Street art, graphic novel or comic strip

As theatrical material is drawn out from the starting point and developed, the focus and subject matter
of the piece will become clearer to the ensemble and they will discover the areas of interest that yield the
most material and enthusiasm, as well as address the emerging intentions of the ensemble. As a result of
this development, the subject matter of the final piece, which has originated from the starting point, may
move away from the starting point considerably. It is important for students to track the evolution of the
subject from starting point to final production.

Preparation process
In preparation for this task within the core syllabus students at SL and HL must have had experience of:

THEATRE IN CONTEXT

THEATRE PROCESSES

PRESENTING THEATRE

Reflecting on their own
personal approaches,
interests and skills in
theatre. Researching
and examining at least
one starting point
and the approaches
employed by one
appropriate professional
theatre company
and considering how
this might influence
their own personal
approaches.

Responding to at least
one starting point and
engaging with the
process of transforming
it collaboratively into an
original piece of theatre.

Participation in at least
one production of a
collaboratively created
piece of original theatre,
created from a starting
point, which is presented
to others.

Using the theatre journal in this task
Students should use their theatre journal to document their skills, interests and approaches and the way
the ensemble has been formed. They record their research into professional theatre companies that
collaboratively create original theatre and their initial responses to the starting point. They record their
contribution to the process of exploring the starting point and creating, designing and presenting the original
theatre piece, paying particular attention to the specific explorations led by them individually as well as their
experiences of collaborating. From the journal the students will select, adapt and present for submission
an annotated selection of their research, exploration and reflection as the basis for the process portfolio,
focusing on clearly communicating their processes, the nature of collaboration and justification for
their choices. All sources must be acknowledged following the referencing style chosen by the
school.

Assessing this task
Students then undertake the following process for assessment.

Theatre in context
•

Each student reflects on their own personal context, identifying their own approaches, interests and
skills in theatre, with a view to using this information to determine who they will collaborate with for
this project.

•

Each student researches the work of a professional company that creates and stages original pieces
of theatre (not already studied in depth as part of the theatre course) and examines the approaches
employed by the professional company. This research may take a variety of forms, such as websites,
published articles, direct communication with the company, interviews and experiences of practical
workshops, for example. They use this information to consider how they could possibly use the
approaches of the professional company in their own approach to creation.

•

Each student documents this in their theatre journal, paying particular attention to their individual
approaches, interests and skills, and their research into a theatre company that collaboratively creates
original theatre.

Theatre guide

71

Internal assessment

•

Theatre processesIn light of the process above, students form groups (ensembles) of no more than six
people with whom to collaboratively create. Each ensemble collaboratively selects a starting point
(idea, issue, theme, non-dramatic text, music, object, image, event or site) that they feel has potential
for development into an original piece of theatre.

•

Each student researches the selected starting point, identifying its theatrical possibilities and
presenting this to the ensemble.

•

The ensemble uses the research to formulate their intentions for the piece. They select a target
audience and identify their intended impact on this target audience.

•

Each student leads the ensemble through a practical exploration of the starting point. This exploration
may be in terms of creating, designing, directing or performing material.

•

The ensemble collaboratively creates, develops and structures a piece of theatre from their
explorations, rehearses and stages this paying attention to performance and production elements.

•

Each ensemble is responsible for the construction of any technical or scenic production elements, such
as set building, rigging and other designed elements for their collaborative piece. This is approached
with clear attention to health and safety requirements.

•

Each student documents this in their theatre journal, paying particular attention to their individual
approach, research and contribution to the collaborative process.

Presenting theatre
•

The collaboratively created original piece of theatre (13–15 minutes) is presented to an audience as a
fully realized production. During the performance individuals who are not part of the collaborative
group may operate any pre-designed technical production elements on behalf of the group. Following
the presentation, each ensemble holds a talkback session with the audience to assess the extent to
which the piece fulfilled the ensemble’s intentions.

•

A maximum of 4 minutes of video recording is then selected by each student from the video recording
of their whole 13–15 minute production.

•

Each student thoroughly evaluates the presentation of the original piece, considering how the piece
fulfilled its intentions and the extent to which it achieved its impact on the audience with reference to
the audience’s responses.

•

They analyse their individual contributions as seen in the video and justify the artistic choices they
made. They consider the impact the piece has had on their target audience and the extent to which
their individual contribution supported the ensemble’s intentions and vision of the piece.

Task details
The nature of collaboration
This is a collaborative project and students must work with at least one other person and with no more than
five other students (making a maximum ensemble size of six). In instances where there are fewer than two
students, students may work with peers that are not in the theatre class, such as theatre students from the
year below, or others who are not taking the IB Diploma Programme theatre course (as long as the ensemble
size does not exceed six).
Each student begins the process by identifying their own personal contexts in theatre, individually
reflecting on their own personal approaches, interests and skills in theatre. This is essentially an audit of the
experiences each student has had related to theatre, and a process of identifying where each individual is
at the start of the project and what they are able to bring to the task. Students then use the outcome of this
process to identify who they want to work with or how they will work together with others. The ensemble
may be formed of either like-minded individuals who share a common interest or be made up of diverse
individuals who bring different ideas and approaches to the process of creation and presentation. The

72

Theatre guide

Internal assessment

formation of the ensemble is therefore a key part of this task and teachers should give time for this where
appropriate or feasible.
Each student also carries out research on an unfamiliar professional company that collaboratively creates
and presents original theatre. This research may take a variety of forms and may involve websites, published
articles, direct communication with the company, interviews or experiences of practical workshops, for
example. Students examine the approaches employed by the professional company and reflect on their
learning from this research, considering how this might influence their own personal approach to the
process of collaborative theatre making. Students then use this research to determine the formation of the
group and how they will work together with others.

Identifying the starting point
The ensemble selects a starting point from which to begin the process of creation. Students should
have little or no previous experience of researching or practically engaging with the starting point they
collaboratively select for this project.
The starting point must be selected from one of the following:
•

an event

•

idea, issue, question or theme

•

image or photograph

•

non-dramatic text

•

object

•

person

•

piece of music

•

site

•

street art, graphic novel or comic strip.

The project must not be based on an existing piece of theatre or published play text.

Exploring the starting point and structuring the piece of theatre
Although the process of creation and presentation is collaborative, each student should take responsibility
for some aspect of the group exploration during the process of creating. This artistic exploration involves
leading the group in practical exercises based on their own research into the starting points and their
interests, skills and approaches, perhaps from their research into the work of a professional company
that creates and stages original pieces of theatre, for example. This artistic exploration may be in terms of
creating, designing, directing or performing material. Students need to be aware that not all explorations
make it into the final piece and that the process of exploration should be undertaken in the spirit of play and
experimentation to test ideas.
Once ideas have been tested and played with, the group collaboratively decides on the structure of the
piece and begins a process of rehearsal and production, preparing the piece for an audience.

Theatre guide

73

Internal assessment

As part of the collective consideration of the school, theatre students must be supported in
maintaining an ethical perspective during their course. Schools must be vigilant to ensure that work
undertaken by the student is appropriate for the context of the school and the age of the students.
Student work for this assessment task must not:
•

damage the environment

•

glamorize the taking of drugs

•

incite or condone intolerance or hatred of others

•

include excessive or gratuitous violence

•

make reference to, or represent, explicit sexual activity.

Requirements of the video recording
For this internal assessment the teacher marking the work assesses the selected extracts of video recorded
work on screen rather than the live presentation itself. It is crucial that the video recording captures the
full 13–15 minute piece of theatre. This must be a continuous, unedited record and must capture the full
presentation of the piece. The video camera must not be switched off at any point during the presentation
of the piece. More information and guidance on the video recording of internal and external assessments
can be found in the Handbook of procedures for the Diploma Programme.

Selecting extracts from the video recording
Each student is then required to submit up to 4 minutes of footage selected from this continuous video
recording. The selected footage (up to 4 minutes maximum) must be chosen by the student and must
demonstrate the contributions and artistic choices made by the student.
The footage selected by the student (up to 4 minutes maximum) can be either one continuous shot or can
be from two different moments (maximum) in the presentation of the piece. The combined total submitted
must not exceed 4 minutes of footage for each student.
It is expected that students will be judicious when selecting their footage for assessment. Students may
wish to select up to 4 minutes of sustained action from the recording or two contrasting moments from the
video recording to analyse, evaluate and illustrate their contributions and artistic choices.

The role of the teacher
Teachers must ensure that students are appropriately prepared for the demands of this task through the
careful planning and delivery of the core syllabus activities outlined above.
Teachers are required to meet with students at each stage of inquiry, action and reflection to discuss the
progress made to date, and to verify the authenticity of the coursework being created by each student.
While the students are working on the assessment task the teacher should:
•

facilitate the formation of the ensemble(s) by giving students time to discuss their skills, interests,
approaches and research into a theatre company that collaboratively creates original theatre in order
to make decisions of who they want to work with or how they will work together

•

discuss the starting point selected by each group; it is important that the starting points are identified
and selected by the students and are not teacher-led

•

guide the students’ explorations and discuss their ideas, without prescribing them; this process may
involve questioning and encouraging each group to expand on their vision and its feasibility, but
should not involve making decisions on their behalf

74

Theatre guide

Internal assessment

•

ensure that students are acknowledging all sources used and referencing them appropriately

•

ensure that each ensemble holds a talkback session with the audience to evaluate the impact the
piece had and the extent to which the piece fulfilled the ensemble’s intentions

•

give feedback on one mock presentation of the original theatre piece prior to filming. Students must
reflect on the impact this feedback has made on the development of the final piece.
Teachers are not permitted to direct any area of the assessed task.

During the assessment task the teacher should assist with video recording the original theatre piece to
ensure it accurately captures the assessment task. In preparing to video record the assessed theatre piece
teachers are encouraged to allow students time to walk through their presentation prior to filming to give
the video camera operator an indication of how the space will be used and the most appropriate way of
framing each section.

Structuring the process portfolio
The process portfolio may be up to 15 pages in length and can contain a variety of materials in different
formats (such as text, visuals, diagrams and so on) depending on the nature of the project. It should
demonstrate the dynamic stages of a creative process; preparation, action, reflection.
Any illustrations, charts, mind maps, visuals, diagrams or designs used within the process portfolio must be
clearly annotated and appropriately referenced to acknowledge the source, following the referencing style
chosen by the school. When students include any of their own photographs or images in the portfolio, these
must also be identified and acknowledged in the same way. There is no lower limit on the number of pages
a student can submit and teachers are encouraged to remind students that their work will be assessed on
how it best fulfills the assessment criteria for the task and not judged on how many pages are submitted.
The process portfolio should contain a table of contents (which is excluded from the page count) and
all pages should be numbered. The main body of the process portfolio should be structured using the
following subheadings:
•

My personal context in theatre (including my own approaches, interests and/or skills in theatre) and
my research into a professional company that creates and stages original pieces of theatre

•

The formation of my group and our exploration of the starting point (including our target audience
and intentions for the piece)

•

Reflections on the collaborative development of our piece and the specific explorations led by me

•

My artistic choices (as seen in the video) and my evaluation of the final piece considering the impact
on the audience.

Students are required to submit a separate list of all sources cited.

Academic honesty
All sources must be acknowledged following the protocol of the referencing style chosen by the school. If
a student uses work, ideas or images belonging to another person in the collaboratively created piece or
the process portfolio, the student must acknowledge the source at point of use and in a list of sources. A
student’s failure to acknowledge a source will be investigated by the IB as a potential breach of regulations
that may result in a penalty imposed by the IB final award committee.

Formal requirements of this task
Each student submits for assessment:
•

a process portfolio (15 pages maximum) which includes:
––

the student’s identification of their own approaches, interests and skills in theatre and research
into the approaches used by a professional company that creates and stages original pieces of
theatre (not already studied in depth as part of the theatre course)

––

the student’s account of the formation of the ensemble and the exploration of the starting point
selected by the ensemble, which includes identifying the target audience and intentions for the
piece

––

the student’s reflections on their own specific contributions to the collaborative process and the
development, structuring and preparation of the piece for presentation

––

the student’s evaluation of the final 13–15 minute presentation, the extent to which the piece
fulfilled its intentions, the impact it had on the audience and the analysis and justification of
their specific artistic choices (as evidenced in the video recording outlined below)

•

a video recording (4 minutes maximum) evidencing the student’s contributions and artistic choices
in the collaboratively created piece; the selected footage must be chosen by the student and must
demonstrate artistic choices made by the student; it can be either one continuous shot or can be
from two different moments (maximum) in the presentation; the combined total submitted must not
exceed 4 minutes of footage for each student

•

a list of all sources cited.

The size and format of pages submitted for assessment is not prescribed to enable students to be creative
with how they record and present their work. Submitted materials are assessed on screen and students
must ensure that their work is clear and legible when presented in a digital, on-screen format. To ensure
that examiners are able to gain an overall and legible impression of each page without excessive scrolling,
students are recommended to use common page sizes (such as legal, A4 or folio). Overcrowded or illegible
materials may result in assessors being unable to interpret and understand the intentions of the work
The procedure for submitting the assessment materials can be found in the Handbook of procedures for
the Diploma Programme. Students are required to indicate the number of pages used and the length of the
video recording when the materials are submitted. Where submitted materials exceed the prescribed page
or time limits assessors are instructed to base their assessment solely on the materials that appear within the
limits.
