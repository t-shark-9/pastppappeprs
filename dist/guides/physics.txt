Introduction
Purpose of this document
1 Physics guide
The Diploma  Programme  (DP)  is a rigorous  pre-university  course  of study  designed  for students  in the 
16 to 19 age range.  It is a broad-based  two-year  course  that  aims  to encourage  students  to be 
knowledgeable  and  inquiring,  but also  caring  and  compassionate.  There  is a strong  emphasis  on 
encouraging  students  to develop  intercultural  understanding,  open-mindedness,  and  the attitudes 
necessary for them to respect and evaluate a range of points of view.
The Diploma Programme model
The course  is presented  as six academic  areas  enclosing  a central  core  (see  figure  1). It encourages  the 
concurrent  study  of a broad  range  of academic  areas.  Students  study  two  modern  languages  (or a modern 
language  and  a classical  language),  a humanities  or social  science  subject,  an experimental  science, 
mathematics  and  one  of the creative  arts.  It is this comprehensive  range  of subjects  that  makes  the DP a 
demanding  course  of study  designed  to prepare  students  effectively  for university  entrance.  In each  of the 
academic  areas  students  have  flexibility  in making  their  choices,  which  means  they  can choose  subjects 
that particularly interest them and that they may wish to study further at university.

Introduction
The Diploma Programme
2 Physics guide
Choosing the right combination
Students are required to choose one subject from each of the six academic areas, although they can, 
instead  of an arts  subject,  choose  two  subjects  from  another  area.  Normally,  three  subjects  (and  not 
more  than  four)  are taken  at higher  level  (HL),  and  the others  are taken  at standard  level  (SL).  The IB 
recommends 240 teaching hours for HL subjects and 150 hours for SL. Subjects at HL are studied in greater 
depth and breadth than at SL.
At both levels, many skills are developed, especially those of critical thinking and analysis. At the end of the 
course,  students’  abilities  are measured  by means  of external  assessment.  Many  subjects  contain  some 
element of coursework assessed by teachers.
The core of the Diploma Programme model
All DP students participate in the three course elements that make up the core of the model.
Theory  of knowledge  (TOK)  is a course  that  is fundamentally  about  critical  thinking  and  inquiry  into  the 
process of knowing rather than about learning a specific body of knowledge. The TOK course examines the 
nature  of knowledge  and  how  we know  what  we claim  to know.  It does  this by encouraging  students  to 
analyse  knowledge  claims  and  explore  questions  about  the construction  of knowledge.  The task  of TOK  is 
to emphasize  connections  between  areas  of shared  knowledge  and  link them  to personal  knowledge  in 
such  a way  that  an individual  becomes  more  aware  of their  own  perspectives  and  how  they  might  differ 
from others.
In TOK, students explore the means of producing knowledge within the core theme of “knowledge and the 
knower”  as well  as within  various  optional  themes  (knowledge  and  technology,  knowledge  and  politics, 
knowledge  and  language,  knowledge  and  religion,  and  knowledge  and  indigenous  societies)  and  areas  of 
knowledge  (the  arts,  natural  sciences,  human  sciences,  history  and  mathematics).  The course  also 
encourages  students  to make  comparisons  between  different  areas  of knowledge  and  reflect  on how 
knowledge is arrived at in the various disciplines, what the disciplines have in common, and the differences 
between them.
Creativity,  activity,  service  (CAS)  is at the heart  of the DP. The emphasis  in CAS  is on helping  students  to 
develop  their  own  identities,  in accordance  with  the ethical  principles  embodied  in the IB mission 
statement  and  the IB learner  profile.  It involves  students  in a range  of activities  alongside  their  academic 
studies  throughout  the DP. The three  strands  of CAS  are creativity  (arts  and  other  experiences  that  involve 
creative  thinking),  activity  (physical  exertion  contributing  to a healthy  lifestyle)  and  service  (an unpaid  and 
voluntary  exchange  that  has a learning  benefit  for the student).  Possibly,  more  than  any other  component 
in the DP, CAS  contributes  to the IB’s mission  to create  a better  and  more  peaceful  world  through 
intercultural understanding and respect.
The extended  essay  (EE),  including  the world  studies  extended  essay,  offers  the opportunity  for IB students 
to investigate  a topic  of special  interest,  in the form  of a 4,000-word  piece  of independent  research.  The 
area  of research  undertaken  is chosen  from  one  of the students’  six DP subjects,  or in the case  of the 
interdisciplinary  world  studies  essay,  two  subjects,  and  acquaints  them  with  the independent  research  and 
writing skills expected at university. This leads to a major piece of formally presented, structured writing, in 
which ideas and findings are communicated in a reasoned and coherent manner, appropriate to the subject 
or subjects  chosen.  It is intended  to promote  high-level  research  and  writing  skills,  intellectual  discovery 
and  creativity.  An authentic  learning  experience,  it provides  students  with  an opportunity  to engage  in 
personal research on a topic of choice, under the guidance of a supervisor.
Approaches to teaching and approaches to 
learning
Approaches to teaching and approaches to learning (ATL) across the DP refers to deliberate strategies, skills 
and  attitudes  that  permeate  the teaching  and  learning  environment.  These  approaches  and  tools, 
intrinsically  linked  with  the learner  profile  attributes,  enhance  student  learning  and  assist  student The Diploma Programme
3 Physics guide
preparation for the DP assessment and beyond. The aims of approaches to teaching and learning in the DP 
are to:
• empower teachers as teachers of learners as well as teachers of content
• empower teachers to create clearer strategies for facilitating learning experiences in which students 
are more meaningfully engaged in structured inquiry and greater critical and creative thinking
• promote both the aims of individual subjects (making them more than course aspirations) and linking 
previously isolated knowledge (concurrency of learning)
• encourage students to develop an explicit variety of skills that will equip them to continue to be 
actively engaged in learning after they leave school, and to help them not only obtain university 
admission through better grades but also prepare for success during tertiary education and beyond
• enhance further the coherence and relevance of the students’ DP experience
• allow schools to identify the distinctive nature of an IB DP education, with its blend of idealism and 
practicality.
The five ATL (developing  thinking  skills,  social  skills,  communication  skills,  self-management  skills  and 
research  skills)  along  with  the six approaches  to teaching  (teaching  that  is inquiry-based,  conceptually 
focused,  contextualized,  collaborative,  differentiated  and  informed  by assessment)  encompass  the key 
values and principles that underpin IB pedagogy.
The IB mission statement and the IB learner profile
The DP aims  to develop  in students  the knowledge,  skills  and  attitudes  they  will need  to fulfil  the aims  of 
the IB, as expressed  in the organization’s  mission  statement  and  the learner  profile.  Teaching  and  learning 
in the DP represent the reality in daily practice of the organization’s educational philosophy.
Academic integrity
Academic  integrity  in the DP is a set of values  and  behaviours  informed  by the attributes  of the learner 
profile.  In teaching,  learning  and  assessment,  academic  integrity  serves  to promote  personal  integrity, 
engender  respect  for the integrity  of others  and  their  work,  and  ensure  that  all students  have  an equal 
opportunity to demonstrate the knowledge and skills they acquire during their studies.
All coursework—including  work  submitted  for assessment—is  to be authentic,  based  on the student’s 
individual  and  original  ideas  with  the ideas  and  work  of others  fully  acknowledged.  Assessment  tasks  that 
require  teachers  to provide  guidance  to students  or that  require  students  to work  collaboratively  must  be 
completed in full compliance with the detailed guidelines provided by the IB for the relevant subjects.
For further  information  on academic  integrity  in the IB and  the DP, please  consult  the IB publications 
Academic  integrity  policy , Effective  citing  and  referencing , Diploma  Programme:  From  principles  into  practice 
and  the general  regulations  in Diploma  Programme  Assessment  procedures  (updated  annually).  Specific 
information  regarding  academic  integrity  as it pertains  to external  and  internal  assessment  components  of 
this DP subject can be found in this guide.
Acknowledging the ideas or work of another 
person
Coordinators  and  teachers  are reminded  that  candidates  must  acknowledge  all sources  used  in work 
submitted for assessment. The following is intended as a clarification of this requirement.
DP candidates submit work for assessment in a variety of media that may include audiovisual material, text, 
graphs, images and/or data published in print or electronic sources. If a candidate uses the work or ideas of 
another  person,  the candidate  must  acknowledge  the source  using  a standard  style  of referencing  in a 
consistent  manner.  A candidate’s  failure  to acknowledge  a source  will be investigated  by the IB as a 
potential breach of regulations that may result in a penalty imposed by the IB final award committee.The Diploma Programme
4 Physics guide
The IB does not prescribe which style(s) of referencing or in-text citation should be used by candidates; this 
is left to the discretion  of appropriate  faculty/staff  in the candidate’s  school.  The wide  range  of subjects, 
response  languages  and  the diversity  of referencing  styles  make  it impractical  and  restrictive  to insist  on 
particular styles. In practice, certain styles may prove most commonly used, but schools are free to choose a 
style  that  is appropriate  for the subject  concerned  and  the language  in which  candidates’  work  is written. 
Regardless of the reference style adopted by the school for a given subject, it is expected that the minimum 
information  given  includes:  name  of author,  date  of publication,  title  of source,  and  page  numbers  as 
applicable.
Candidates  are expected  to use a standard  style  and  use it consistently  so that  credit  is given  to all sources 
used,  including  sources  that  have  been  paraphrased  or summarized.  When  writing  text  candidates  must 
clearly  distinguish  between  their  words  and  those  of others  by the use of quotation  marks  (or other 
method, such as indentation) followed by an appropriate citation that denotes an entry in the bibliography. 
If an electronic  source  is cited,  the date  of access  must  be indicated.  Candidates  are not expected  to show 
faultless  expertise  in referencing,  but are expected  to demonstrate  that  all sources  have  been 
acknowledged.  Candidates  must  be advised  that  audiovisual  material,  text,  graphs,  images  and/or  data 
published  in print  or in electronic  sources  that  is not their  own  must  also  attribute  the source.  Again,  an 
appropriate style of referencing/citation must be used.
Learning diversity and learning support 
requirements
Schools  must  ensure  that  equal  access  arrangements  and  reasonable  adjustments  are provided  to 
candidates  with  learning  support  requirements  that  are in line with  the IB documents  Access  and  inclusion 
policy  and Learning diversity and inclusion in IB programmes: Removing barriers to learning . 
The publications  Meeting  student  learning  diversity  in the classroom  and  The  IB guide  to inclusive  education:  a 
resource  for whole  school  development  are available  to support  schools  in the ongoing  process  of increasing 
access and engagement by removing barriers to learning.
Programme standards and practices
The programme  standards  and  practices  are a set of principles  for schools  to ensure  quality  and  fidelity  in 
the implementation  of IB programmes.  Teaching  and  learning  are important  markers  of quality  and 
effective practice in schools; thus the expectations teachers and learners share across all IB programmes can 
be found in the programme standards and practices.
The programme  standards  and  practices  provide  a framework  to help  teachers  understand  their  rights  and 
responsibilities  in IB World  Schools  as they  develop  learning  environments  and  experiences  for their 
students. The IB recognizes that in order for effective teaching to take place, teachers must be supported in 
their  understanding,  well-being,  environment  and  resources.  Teachers  use the core  tenets  of IB philosophy 
and  pedagogy  (approaches  to teaching,  ATL,  the learner  profile  and  international-mindedness)  to design 
learning experiences that prepare learners to fulfil the aims and objectives outlined in this guide.
To learn  more  about  teachers’  rights  and  responsibilities,  please  see the IB publication  Programme 
standards and practices  on the Programme Resource Centre.The Diploma Programme
5 Physics guide
What is nature of science?
Nature of science (NOS) is an overarching theme in the biology, chemistry and physics courses that seeks to 
explore conceptual understandings related to the purpose, features and impact of scientific knowledge.
What do we want to know in science?
Nobel  laureate  and  influential  popularizer  of science,  Richard  Feynman,  once  described  the process  of 
science  using  the analogy  of watching  an unknown  board  game  being  played  “... and  you don’t  know  the 
rules  of the game,  but you’re  allowed  to look  at the board  from  time  to time.  And  from  these  observations, 
you try to figure  out what  the rules  are of the game,  [and]  the rules  of the pieces  moving”  (Feynman  et al., 
1963).
What is the scientific endeavour?
Classifying  such  observations  and  underlying  patterns  in the natural  world  is the essence  of what  scientists 
do, underpinned  by the assumption  that  the universe  exists  as an external  reality  accessible  to the human 
experience.  The varied  and  often  non-linear  processes  used  in scientific  methodologies  have  several  key 
features  in common  to maximize  the validity  and  reliability  of knowledge  produced.  The development  of 
falsifiable  hypotheses,  a requirement  for replicable  data,  and  the utilization  of peer-review  may  be among 
the most  essential  of these  and  help  differentiate  a scientific  process  from  a pseudoscientific  one.  The 
communal  and  collaborative  nature  of this approach  further  strengthens  the objectivity  of science  by 
ensuring the inclusion of diverse perspectives and shared responsibility for its outcomes.
What type of knowledge do we produce?
Formal  scientific  knowledge  may  encompass  several  categories  including  representative  models, 
explanatory  theories  and  descriptive  laws.  As the focus  of each  discipline  of natural  science  differs,  so too 
does  the balance  of their  contributions  to each  category.  What  remains  constant,  however,  is the 
acknowledgement  of assumptions,  exceptions  and  limitations  of scientific  knowledge  to provide  realistic 
parameters  to our understanding  of the natural  world.  Claims  of certainty  are treated  with  caution  given 
the presence of paradigmatic shifts throughout the history of science.
What is the impact of scientific knowledge?
As well  as the pursuit  of knowledge  for its own  sake,  it is useful  to consider  the interplay  of science  with 
other  areas  of society.  Although  advances  in technology  traditionally  fuelled  great  leaps  in scientific 
understanding,  in recent  times  it may  be more  common  to see science  as a driver  of technological 
development.  In addition,  the implications  of science  within  environmental,  political,  social,  cultural  and 
economic domains can also be profound. These connections illustrate the importance of local, national and 
international  scientific  bodies  that  engage  with  the public  understanding  of science  and  heighten  the 
responsibility of scientists to adhere to principles of academic integrity in their research.

Aspects of nature of science
Aspects How are scientific knowledge claims generated, tested, communicated, 
evaluated and used? What issues arise from these actions?
Observations Scientists act as observers, looking at Earth and all other parts of the universe, to 
obtain data about natural phenomena. Observations can be made directly using 
human senses, or with the aid of instruments such as electronic sensors. 
Unexpected or unplanned observations can open up new research fields.
Patterns and trends Scientists analyse their observations, looking for patterns or trends, and try to draw 
general conclusions by inductive reasoning. They also look for discrepancies. 
Scientists classify objects through pattern recognition. A trend may take the form 
of a positive or negative correlation between variables. Correlations may be based 
on a causal relationship, but correlation does not prove causation.
Hypotheses Scientists make provisional explanations for the patterns that they have observed 
in natural phenomena. These hypotheses can be tested, with further observations 
or experiments, to obtain support for a hypothesis or show that it is false.
Experiments Scientists design and perform experiments to obtain data, which can be used to 
test hypotheses. The quality of experimental evidence depends on careful control 
of variables and on the quantity of data generated. Progress in science often 
follows technological developments that allow new experimental techniques. 
Creativity and imagination play a role in experimental design, interpretation and 
conclusion.
Measurement Quantitative measurements are more objective than qualitative observations, but 
all measurements are limited in precision and accuracy. Measurements are 
repeated to strengthen the reliability of data. Random errors in measurement due 
to unknown or unpredictable differences lead to imprecision and uncertainty, 
whereas systematic errors lead to inaccuracy.
Models Scientists construct models as artificial representations of natural phenomena. 
They are useful when direct observation or experimentation is difficult. Models are 
simplifications of complex systems and can be physical representations, abstract 
diagrams, mathematical equations or algorithms. All models have limitations that 
need to be considered in their application.
Evidence Scientists adopt a sceptical attitude to claims and evaluate them using evidence. 
Some claims cannot be tested using verifiable evidence, so cannot be falsified. 
They are therefore not scientific. Scientific knowledge must be supported by 
evidence.
Theories Scientists develop general explanations that are widely applicable, based on 
observed patterns or tested hypotheses. Predictions can be generated from these 
theories by deductive reasoning. If these predictions are tested, they may 
corroborate a theory or show that it is false and should be rejected. Paradigm shifts 
take place when a new theory replaces an old one. The term “law” is sometimes 
used for statements that allow predictions to be made about natural phenomena 
without explaining them.
Falsification Scientists can use evidence to falsify a claim formulated as a hypothesis, theory or 
model, but they cannot prove with certainty that such a claim is true. There is 
therefore inherent uncertainty in all scientific knowledge. Nonetheless, many 
theories in science are corroborated by strong evidence and allow for prediction 
and explanation. Scientists must remain open-minded with respect to new 
evidence.Nature of science
7 Physics guide
Aspects How are scientific knowledge claims generated, tested, communicated, 
evaluated and used? What issues arise from these actions?
Science as a shared 
endeavourScientists communicate and collaborate throughout the world. Agreed 
conventions and common terminology facilitate unambiguous communication. 
Peer review is essential to verify the research methods of knowledge claims prior 
to their publication in journals.
Global impact of 
scienceScientists have an obligation to assess the risks associated with their work and 
must aim to do no harm. Developments in science may have ethical, 
environmental, political, social, cultural and economic consequences that must be 
considered during decision-making. The pursuit of science may have unintended 
consequences. Research proposals are often filtered through ethics boards. 
Scientists have a responsibility to communicate their findings to the public with 
honesty and clarity.
How is NOS different from TOK?
In contrast  to the specificity  of understanding  of science,  the TOK  course  encourages  students  to think 
critically  about  the concepts  that  underpin  knowledge  production.  For example,  peer  review  is used  as a 
tool  to support  objectivity  in scientific  research.  Through  the study  of TOK,  students  question  the 
limitations  of the peer  review  process  and  extend  their  thinking  to an assessment  of objectivity  in other 
areas of knowledge.Nature of science
8 Physics guide
What is physics?
To study  physics  is to attempt  to understand  the nature  of the universe  itself.  It is the search  for answers 
from  how  the universe  exploded  into  life in the Big Bang  to what  the nature  of time  is itself.  Some  of the 
greatest  discoveries  in history  have  been  made  by physicists  and  these  discoveries  have  revolutionized  our 
world—and physicists are continuing to change the way we think today.
Physics  encompasses  everything  that  we do as human  beings.  The very  meaning  of the word  is “the  study 
of nature”.  Indeed,  when  the discipline  was  first defined,  it was  about  observing  the Milky  Way,  the entire 
known universe at the time, while wondering about the existence of the atom. As with the universe, physics 
knowledge  is constantly  expanding.  The existence  of black  holes,  gravitational  forces  so strong  that  even 
light  is unable  to escape,  was  first theorized  in the 18th  century.  In 2019,  an image  of a black  hole  was 
captured for the first time.
However, physics is not just about staring into the vastness of space or scrutinizing the tiniest particles that 
make  up the fabric  of the universe.  The fact is that  discoveries  in physics  are the root  of ideas  that 
revolutionize  the technology  used  in our daily  lives.  It is an everyday,  grounded  science  encompassing 
advances in communication, medical technology and renewable energy.
It is above  all a creative  discipline.  Physics  requires  solid  knowledge  of basic  principles  and  a willingness  to 
put them to the test in new ways. It requires curiosity and an appetite to explore what might be.
Creativity  is essential  to particle  physics,  cosmology,  and  to mathematics,  and  to other  fields  of 
science, just as it is to its more widely acknowledged beneficiaries—the arts and humanities.
Lisa Randall
Look up at the stars and not down at your feet … Be curious.
Stephen Hawking
What do physicists do?
To put it succinctly,  physicists  seek  to expand  knowledge.  They  work  to test hypotheses  and  explain 
observations.  They  use the results  to build  evidence,  which  ultimately  leads  to discoveries.  These  are 
scrutinized  by the scientific  community  and,  if accepted,  become  knowledge.  This  progression  is a process 
of continuous  succession  of inquiry  questions  which  when  answered,  raise  new  ones,  leading  to further 
inquiry,  further  explorations,  further  discoveries  and  the deepening  of knowledge.  This  collective  work  by 
the scientific community is one of the features of “doing” physics.
The process  of doing  physics  never  ends.  Even  the soundest  findings  are subject  to rigorous  questions  and 
further  scientific  exploration.  Physicists  constantly  test and  re-evaluate  accepted  truths.  Knowledge  is 
constantly  scrutinized  and  rechecked,  and  therefore,  confirmed  or rejected  by fresh  insights.  It is in this 
manner  that  objective  experiments  are subjectively  experienced  by scientists  who  repeat  them  to confirm 
the value of what is transmitted, constituting the essence of the scientific experience.
Facts are not science—as the dictionary is not literature.
Martin H. Fischer
…it is worthwhile  rechecking  by new  direct  experience,  and  not necessarily  trusting  the … 
experience from the past.
Richard Feynman

How do physicists do physics?
This  question  is the subject  of heated  debate  in the world  of education.  Some  argue  that  the “doing”  of 
physics  is a set of fixed  steps  to construct  scientific  methods  around  arguments.  Beyond  the debate,  the 
way  scientists  work  and  construct  knowledge  is, in the words  of John  Dewey  more  than  a hundred  years 
ago, “the only method of thinking that has proved fruitful in any subject”.
There is an even simpler summary of how physicists do physics: “Write down the problem, think hard, write 
down  the answer”  (Richard  Feynman).  This—considered  alongside  Albert  Einstein’s  famous 
pronouncement  that  “Imagination  is more  important  than  knowledge”—is  an excellent  overview  of the 
general  features  of a physicist’s  work.  In summary,  they  collect  evidence  to reach  partial  conclusions  that 
eventually might be accepted as laws or explanatory theories.
However,  physicists  also  create  models.  These  could  be mathematical  equations,  analogies  or physical 
representations.  They  take  different  formats,  some  more  abstract  than  others,  but they  all aim at the same 
objective—to mediate and enable understanding.
In laboratories  all over  the world,  physicists  are working  on exploring  the boundaries  of long-established 
disciplines  like mechanics  and  electromagnetism.  Meanwhile,  physicists  explore  new  frontiers  of 
understanding  as varied  as the existence  of gravitational  waves,  the path  to artificial  intelligence, 
sustainable  energy  sources  on earth  and  the expansion  of travel  into  space.  There  are almost  no limits  to 
the areas where physics is relevant today.
Equipped  with  his five senses,  man  explores  the universe  around  him  and  calls  the adventure 
Science.
Edwin Powell Hubble
Physics is really nothing more than a search for ultimate simplicity, but so far all we have is a kind 
of elegant messiness.
Bill Bryson
Distinction between SL and HL
Students at SL and HL share the following.
• An understanding of science through a stimulating experimental programme
• The nature of science as an overarching theme
• The study of a concept-based syllabus
• One piece of internally assessed work, the scientific investigation
• The collaborative sciences project
The SL course  provides  students  with  a fundamental  understanding  of physics  and  experience  of the 
associated  skills.  The HL course  requires  students  to increase  their  knowledge  and  understanding  of the 
subject, and so provides a solid foundation for further study at university level.
The SL course  has a recommended  150 teaching  hours,  compared  to 240 hours  for the HL course.  This 
difference  is reflected  in the additional  content  studied  by HL students.  Some  of the HL content  is 
conceptually  more  demanding  and  explored  in greater  depth.  The distinction  between  SL and  HL is 
therefore  one  of both  breadth  and  depth.  The increased  breadth  and  depth  at HL result  in increased 
networked  knowledge,  requiring  the student  to make  more  connections  between  diverse  areas  of the 
syllabus.
Physics and the core
Physics and theory of knowledge
The TOK  course  plays  a special  role  in the DP by providing  opportunities  for students  to reflect  on the 
nature,  scope  and  limitations  of knowledge  and  the process  of knowing  through  an exploration  of 
knowledge questions.Nature of physics
10 Physics guide
The areas  of knowledge  (AOK)  are specific  branches  of knowledge,  each  of which  can be seen  to have  a 
distinct  nature  and  sometimes  use different  methods  of gaining  knowledge.  In TOK,  students  explore  five 
compulsory AOK: history, the human sciences, the natural sciences, mathematics and the arts.
There are several different ways in which aspects of the physics course can be connected to the exploration 
of knowledge.  During  the teaching  and  learning  of the physics  course,  teachers  and  students  evaluate 
knowledge  claims  by exploring  questions  concerning  their  validity,  reliability,  credibility  and  certainty,  as 
well as individual and cultural perspectives on them.
Exploration  of the relationship  between  knowledge  and  TOK  concepts  can help  students  to deepen  their 
understanding  and  make  connections  between  disciplines.  For example,  while  discussing  the depletion  of 
energy  sources  and  the constant  need  for new  energy  resources  to meet  energy  demands,  students  can 
explore the concepts of responsibility, power and justification.
Many  aspects  of the physics  course  lend  themselves  to the exploration  of knowledge  questions.  Some 
examples are provided in the following table.

Physics and the extended essay
Students who choose to write an EE in physics undertake independent research as part of an in-depth study 
of a focused topic. The topic for study may be generated from the physics course or may relate to a subject 
area  beyond  the syllabus  content.  This  detailed  study  will help  develop  research,  thinking,  self-
management  and  communication  skills,  which  will support  students’  learning  in the physics  course,  and  in 
further studies.
Examples of areas for research topics
• Fluid dynamics: time it takes to empty a water can via a small opening at the bottom of the can.
• Sound waves: analysis of harmonics of a note played with a musical instrument using fast Fourier 
Transform or the waveforms of the same musical note played on different musical instruments.
• Induced emf: maximum emf induced in a small rectangular coil fixed into position between the poles 
of a horseshoe magnet sitting at the centre of a rotating turntable.
Students and supervisors must ensure that an EE does not duplicate other work submitted for the diploma.

Physics and creativity, activity, service
The CAS  component  of the DP core  provides  many  opportunities  for students  to link science  concepts  and 
topics  to practical  experiences.  Teachers  can highlight  how  knowledge  and  understanding  developed 
through  the course  might  inform  meaningful  experiences.  Outside  the classroom,  CAS  experiences  might 
also ignite students’ passion for addressing topics inside the physics classroom.
Some examples of relevant CAS experiences are as follows.
• Organizing a science club for students in lower years
• Implementing environmental initiatives within the school or local community, such as recycling, 
composting and roof gardens
• Organizing or participating in a social media outreach or advocacy campaign, for example, on an 
environmental or health concern
CAS  experiences  can be a single  event  or may  be an extended  series  of events.  It is important  that  CAS 
experiences be distinct from and not submitted as part of a physics assessment.

Physics and international-mindedness
Science has been, and continues to be, a truly international endeavour. From the beginnings of seismology 
in China,  through  material  science  in Mesopotamia  to astronomy  in the Islamic  Golden  Age,  the search  for 
an objective  understanding  of the natural  world  transcends  the limitations  imposed  by national 
boundaries. The scientific process, requiring curiosity, insight and an open-minded approach, benefits from 
the widest possible participation across genders and cultures through inclusivity and diversity.
Given  the global  nature  of many  scientific  issues,  international  organizations  often  have  a focus  on the 
engagement of science with the public domain. The World Health Organization and the Intergovernmental 
Panel  on Climate  Change  are two  well-known  examples  that  model  a responsibility  to inform  nations  of 
scientific  progress  on an equitable  basis.  Underlying  this responsibility  is the interest  of promoting  a 
peaceful and sustainable future.
Advancements  in technology,  along  with  the cost  of modern  research  facilities,  continues  to reinforce  the 
role  of international  collaborative  work.  The project  between  the Joint  Institute  of Nuclear  Research  in 
Russia and the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory in the USA to provide evidence for the existence of 
element 118, oganesson, is a good example of international collaboration.
The importance  of collaboration  in contemporary  science  is reflected  by the large  number  of international 
organizations  tasked  with  collating  and  sharing  data  with  the scientific  community.  Access  to shared 
knowledge  through  websites  and  databases  must  be integrated  into  classroom  teaching  as it plays  an 
important role in validating experimental work.
In addition to integrating technology and collaborative work, the collaborative sciences project provides an 
excellent opportunity for students to engage with global issues.
Physics and the IB learner profile
Each  box provides  an example  of how  each  learner  profile  attribute  could  be modelled  by learners  and 
teachers.
Example attribute
• Learners who best embody the attribute with reference to science.
• Directing teachers with possible routes to develop the attribute in the classroom.
• Practical ways in which learners demonstrate the attribute in the process of “doing” science.Nature of physics
12 Physics guide
Attributes of the IB learner profile
Inquirer
• Inquirers are curious, they actively use research skills, work independently and show enthusiasm 
about the world around them.
• Teachers facilitate skill development and promote inquiry; they provide students with opportunities 
to ask questions, search for answers, and experiment.
• Learners use their inquiry skills to extend their scientific knowledge and engage with research.
Knowledgeable
• Learners explore concepts, ideas and issues related to science in order to broaden and deepen their 
understanding of factual and procedural knowledge.
• Access to a variety of resources and opportunities provides learner agency to develop scientific 
knowledge and understanding.
• Learners apply their knowledge to unfamiliar contexts and make connections between concepts and 
facts to illustrate their understanding of science.
Thinker
• Learners are eager to solve complex problems and reflect on their thinking strategies.
• Teachers provide opportunities for learners to critically analyse their approaches and methods and 
deepen their understanding of science, allowing them to be creative in finding solutions to problems.
• Learners practise reasoning and critical thinking by testing assumptions, formulating hypotheses, 
interpreting data and drawing conclusions from the evidence provided.
Communicator
• Learners collaborate effectively with others and use a variety of modes of communication to express 
their ideas and opinions.
• Teachers facilitate group work, encourage open discussions and the use of the scientific language to 
provide models for successful communication.
• Learners demonstrate effective communication skills as part of collaborative activities through 
listening to others and sharing ideas.
Principled
• Learners take responsibility for their work, promote shared values and act in an ethical manner.
• Teachers can provide opportunities to model principled behaviour including acknowledging the 
work of others and citing sources. The collaborative sciences project provides opportunities for 
learners to take a principled stance.
• Learners appreciate the importance of integrity in data collection and consider all data, even that 
which does not match their original hypothesis.
Open-minded
• Open-minded learners accept that different perspectives, models or hypotheses exist, and these can 
be used to enhance scientific understanding.
• Teachers can provide models that were at the time supported by data or observations, but through 
reasoning, deduction or falsification may be rejected or refined.Nature of physics
13 Physics guide
Open-minded
• Learners need to be prepared to have their perspectives and ideas challenged through the study of 
science.
Caring
• Learners act to protect the environment and to improve the lives of others.
• Teachers can draw attention to how daily choices have consequences by challenging learners to 
adopt sustainable practice and providing support to help fellow learners. Reference should be made 
to the Sciences experimentation guidelines .
• Learners can connect curriculum content to global challenges such as healthcare, energy supply or 
food production. The collaborative sciences project provides an opportunity for learners to support 
each other to enable their group to achieve their goal successfully.
Risk-taker
• Risk-takers seek new opportunities to develop their learning and explore new approaches to solve 
problems. They actively thrive on challenges.
• Teachers can provide support and guidance for learners, encouraging them to explore new 
techniques or methods of learning. This might include scaffolds for the use of language, the design of 
experiments and the analysis of data. As learners grow in confidence, these supports can be phased 
out giving them more freedom to choose their own approach.
• Learners should be prepared for the next set of experimental data to falsify their ideas as uncertainty 
is a feature of science. They understand that this is a step forward in their understanding.
Balanced
• Balanced learners look holistically at all aspects of their development and ensure that various tasks 
are given appropriate attention without focusing on one to the detriment of others.
• Teachers should encourage learners to consider a balanced perspective on scientific issues without 
bias.
• Learners need to organize their own time effectively, giving themselves sufficient time to complete 
all parts of their learning without negatively impacting on the emotional and social aspects of their 
lives.
Reflective
• Reflective learners consider why and how they achieve success, and also how they could change their 
approach when learning is difficult.
• Teachers provide opportunities for learners to continually review strategies, methods, techniques 
and approaches to problem-solving in order to improve their conceptual understandings in science. 
Assessment criteria or checklists can help learners to consider the quality of their work in a guided 
way.
• Learners develop skills and concepts throughout the course, networking their knowledge by 
continually reflecting on their understanding.Nature of physics

The approaches to learning framework
What are approaches to learning skills and why do we teach them?
The approaches  to learning  (ATL)  framework  seeks  to develop  in students  affective,  cognitive  and 
metacognitive  skills  that  will support  their  learning  processes  during  and  beyond  their  IB experience.  The 
development  of ATL skills  is closely  connected  with the IB learner  profile  attributes  and  therefore  helps  to 
advance  the IB mission.  The ATL skills  are an integral  part  of IB learning  and  teaching  that  should  be 
developed  across  the whole  programme—it  is not expected  that  a single  course  should  ever  address  all of 
them.
How are they organized?
The ATL framework  for IB programmes  consists  of five general  skill categories:  thinking  skills, 
communication  skills,  social  skills,  research  skills  and  self-management  skills.  Each  of these  categories 
covers  a broad  range,  as shown  by the examples  presented  in the table  below.  The ATL skill categories  are 
closely linked and interrelated and therefore individual skills may be relevant to more than one category.
How do we teach them?
ATL skills can be learned and taught, improved with practice and developed incrementally. The table below 
illustrates,  through  a number  of examples,  how  the physics  course  can support  ATL skill development.  The 
examples  shown  in the table  are not exhaustive.  Teachers  are encouraged  to adapt  them  for use in their 
school context and collaboratively identify further examples of ATL skill development.
Further  information  on the ATL framework  and  strategies  for the development  of the ATL skills  can be 
found  in the Physics  teacher  support  material  and  the Diploma  Programme  Approaches  to teaching  and 
learning website .

Experimental programme
Integral  to the student  experience  of a physics  course  is the learning  that  takes  place  through  scientific 
inquiry  within  the classroom,  laboratory  or in the field.  Experimentation  through  a variety  of forms  can be 
used  to introduce  a topic,  address  a phenomenon  or allow  students  to consider  and  examine  authentic 
questions and curiosities.
A school’s  experimental  programme  should  allow  students  to experience  the full breadth  and  depth  of the 
course,  develop  scientific  skills  and  demonstrate  safe,  competent  and  methodical  use of a range  of tools, 
techniques and equipment. Students should therefore be encouraged to develop investigations to support 
their  learning  through  open-ended  inquiry  with  a focus  on laboratory  and  fieldwork  experiments, 
databases, simulations and modelling.Approaches to the teaching and learning of physics
16 Physics guide
Conceptual learning
Concept-based teaching and learning is encouraged across the continuum of IB programmes.
Concepts  are mental  representations  of categories.  They  are constructed,  modified  and  activated  by the 
learner  through  learning  experiences.  Concepts  do not exist  in isolation  but are interrelated.  Conceptual 
understanding is always a work in progress—it is continually being developed and refined.
Conceptual  understanding  is therefore  an outcome  of a non-linear,  ongoing  process  of evolving 
understandings,  adapting  previous  understandings,  and  identifying  and  dispelling  misconceptions.  It 
consists  of making  connections  between  prior  and  new  knowledge  to construct  and  build  an awareness  of 
this network of knowledge.
Concepts vary in their level of abstraction and universality.
• They can be organizing ideas that are applicable in many contexts and have relevance both within and 
across subject areas.
• They can provide a deep understanding of specific knowledge fields (or fields of knowledge) and help 
to organize knowledge further, as well as reveal connections between different areas of the subject.
For example, consider the following sequence of three concepts.
Change > Energy > Thermal radiation
Thermal  radiation  is a component  in the understanding  of energy,  which  in turn  helps  to develop  an 
understanding of change in physics.
Outcomes of a concept-based approach
Fostering critical thinking, the outcome of a concept-based approach is that students are able to:
• identify examples of a concept
• organize, reflect on, modify and expand their network of knowledge
• apply concepts to existing and future knowledge
• apply their conceptual understanding as a scientific thinking tool for predicting outcomes, justifying 
conclusions and evaluating knowledge claims.
Structure of the syllabus and conceptual understanding
The structure of this physics syllabus is intended to promote concept-based learning and teaching that can 
be connected  through  three  concepts:  energy,  particles  and  forces.  These  three  concepts  appear 
throughout the physics syllabus in each of the themes.
There are five organizing themes in the physics syllabus.
A. Space, time and motion
B. The particulate nature of matter
C. Wave behaviour
D. Fields
E. Nuclear and quantum physics
The themes have been chosen to represent the main areas of physics relevant for this level of study and do 
not suggest a teaching order.
Each  of these  themes  is subdivided  into  topics.  “Space,  time  and  motion”  includes  the topics  of kinematics 
and  rigid  body  mechanics,  “Fields”  includes  the topics  of gravitational  fields  and  induction,  “Nuclear  and 
quantum physics” includes the topics of radioactive decay and fission. Each of the topics comprises guiding 
questions, recommended teaching hours for each level, a list of understandings that students should know, 
guidance and linking questions.
The topics  can be connected  through  three  concepts:  energy,  particles  and  forces.  Each  topic  is headed  by 
guiding questions to give a sense of what is covered. The purpose of these guiding questions is to promote Approaches to the teaching and learning of physics
17 Physics guide
inquiry: they are therefore not straightforward and best answered once the associated understandings have 
been  acquired.  Teachers  and  students  are encouraged  to create  their  own  guiding  questions  based  on the 
content of units of study.
Linking  questions  strengthen  students’  understanding  by making  connections.  Linking  questions  are 
intended  to promote  the skills  in the study  of physics  and  highlight  links  between  different  topics.  The 
questions  encourage  students  to look  at a topic  from  a range  of different  perspectives,  originating  in 
another  part  of the course.  Linking  questions  are designed  to facilitate  these  connections  and  their  ideal 
outcome  is to promote  a highly  networked  understanding  of physics.  For example,  when  considering  the 
processes  within  a nuclear  fission  plant,  students  can make  the connections  from  the structure  of the 
nucleus  via the release  of kinetic  energy  in the form  of neutrons,  all the way  through  to the generation  of 
electricity.  By looking  at this process  through  the concept  of energy,  transformation  and  conservation  laws 
are also  highlighted,  which  further  connect  to other  areas  of physics.  The linking  questions  found  in the 
guide  are not exhaustive.  Students  and  teachers  may  well  encounter  other  connections  between 
understandings and concepts in the syllabus, leading to additional linking questions.
Teaching physics in context
The study  of physics  enables  constructive  engagement  with  topical  scientific  issues.  By contextualizing 
physics  concepts,  scientific  knowledge  claims  can be evaluated  more  effectively,  and  informed  choices  on 
such  issues  as human  health  and  the environment  can be made.  Physics  research  has brought  innovation 
and  benefit  to many  fields  and  continues  to be at the heart  of seeking  effective  solutions  to many  global 
challenges.  It is therefore  important  to explore  applications  of physics  in our world  while  teaching  the 
course to elicit interest, understanding and curiosity.
Teaching  the content  of the course  in relation  to specific  contexts  supports  the pedagogical  principle  of 
teaching in local and global contexts as part of the approaches to teaching framework and offers a number 
of advantages.  First,  it helps  students  relate  their  learning  to genuine  applications  of physics,  highlighting 
the relevance  to global  issues  as well  as the significance  in students’  own  contexts.  Second,  it develops  an 
appreciation  for the interaction  between  scientific  solutions  and  their  implications,  be it ethical, 
environmental or economic. Third, it helps to illustrate some of the NOS aspects underpinning the course.
The Physics  teacher  support  material  highlights  possible  areas  that  could  be visited  throughout  the course 
and  that  may  provide  context  for some  topics  to stimulate  the application  of ideas  and  problem-solving 
skills.  Consideration  of these  and  related  areas  may  help  provide  ideas  for the scientific  investigation,  the 
collaborative sciences project, TOK exhibition, CAS, or an EE in physics or world studies.
Engaging with sensitive topics
Students  and  teachers  are encouraged  to engage  with  exciting,  stimulating  and  personally  relevant  topics 
and  issues  that  may  be, at times,  sensitive  or personally  challenging.  Teachers  should  be aware  of this and 
provide  guidance  on how  to engage  with  such  topics  in a responsible  manner.  Consideration  should  be 
given to the personal, political and spiritual values of others.
Prior learning
Past experience shows that students will be able to study physics at SL successfully with no background in, 
or previous  knowledge  of, science.  Their  approach  to learning,  characterized  by the IB learner  profile 
attributes, will be significant here.
However,  for most  students  considering  the study  of physics  at HL, while  there  is no intention  to restrict 
access,  some  previous  exposure  to formal  science  education  would  be necessary.  Specific  topic  details  are 
not specified  but students  who  have  undertaken  the IB Middle  Years  Programme  (MYP)  or studied  an 
equivalent national science qualification or a school-based science course would be well prepared for an HL 
subject.Approaches to the teaching and learning of physics
18 Physics guide
Links to the Middle Years Programme
The MYP  sciences  courses  seek  to promote  skills  and  attitudes  needed  to apply  scientific  knowledge  in 
theoretical,  experimental  and  authentic  contexts.  A strong  foundation  is established  for DP sciences  in 
which  learners  will capitalize  on—and  continue  advancing—their  skills  and  attitudes  to develop 
knowledge and understanding commensurate with pre-university level science.
The MYP offers a framework for learning and teaching while maintaining flexibility with curriculum content. 
The content  in MYP  sciences  courses  can therefore  vary  greatly  from  one  school  to another.  Content  in DP 
sciences  courses  is more  prescribed,  and  this is one  of the main  differences  teachers  will notice  when 
comparing the two programmes.
A connected, conceptual curriculum where learning is inquiry-based and contextualized is the pedagogical 
principle  that  underpins  both  programmes  and  indeed  the entire  IB continuum  (International 
Baccalaureate, 2019).
Conceptual  learning  focuses  on organizing  ideas  and  their  interconnections.  A conceptual  approach  is 
encouraged in IB programmes because it promotes deep learning and facilitates the construction of further 
knowledge. Conceptual understanding aids the application of knowledge in unfamiliar and novel contexts. 
This skill is reflected in the aims and assessment objectives of both programmes.
Broad  concepts  frame  MYP  learning  and  teaching  with  the purpose  of unifying  ideas  across  subject  areas. 
Discipline-specific related concepts are intended to provide disciplinary depth (International Baccalaureate, 
2014). Key and related concepts are not required in the DP, although some teachers may find that they wish 
to continue  developing  a curriculum  around  them.  In DP sciences,  overarching  concepts  are manifested  in 
the course  roadmaps  and  the NOS.  DP sciences  seek  to highlight  the interconnectedness  of the course 
understandings.  The intention  is to promote  conceptual  understanding  and  further  the construction  of 
learners’ knowledge networks.
Both  MYP  and  DP teaching  involve  inquiry-based  approaches,  which  foster  a high  degree  of student 
engagement,  collaboration  and  interaction.  The inquiry,  design,  experimental,  analysis,  evaluation  and 
communication  skills  encouraged  by criteria  B and C will serve  students  well  as they  prepare  to undertake 
the scientific  investigation  for the internal  assessment  (IA).  In addition,  MYP  students  will gain  familiarity 
with  criterion-related  assessment  and  the use of assessment  criteria,  which  will further  support  their 
understanding of the DP sciences IA criteria.
IB programmes encourage the exploration of scientific principles in connection to local and global contexts. 
Doing  so helps  students  ground  abstract  concepts  in more  concrete  local  and  global  real-world  situations 
as well  as cultivating  international-mindedness  (see  the “Approaches  to teaching”  section  in Diploma 
Programme Approaches to teaching and learning website ). Teachers should therefore weave opportunities for 
contextualization  into  the curriculum.  MYP  sciences  criterion  D analyses  the real-world  application  of 
science.  In the DP, sciences  teachers  are encouraged  to frequently  anchor  their  teaching  in real-world 
applications that are invoked throughout the course of the programme.
In addition  to equipping  students  with  scientific  knowledge  and  skills,  the MYP  and  DP sciences  courses 
share similar guiding principles that seek to develop in students the learner profile attributes.
Links to the Career-related Programme
In the Career-related  Programme  (CP),  students  study  at least  two  DP subjects,  a core  consisting  of four 
components and a career-related study, which is determined by the local context and aligned with student 
needs.  The CP has been  designed  to add  value  to the students’  career-related  studies.  This provides  the 
context for the choice of DP courses. The physics course can assist CP students planning careers in a variety 
of professional  fields  where,  for example,  a sound  understanding  of science  and  mathematical  skills  are 
important.  This  includes  technological  and  manufacturing  industries,  and  engineering.  While  physics  helps 
students  understand  the underlying  science  in the contemporary  world,  it also  encourages  the 
development of strong problem-solving, critical thinking and ethical approaches that will assist students in 
the global workplace.Approaches to the teaching and learning of physics
19 Physics guide
The collaborative sciences project is an interdisciplinary sciences project, providing a worthwhile challenge 
to DP and  CP students,  addressing  real-world  problems  that  can be explored  through  the sciences.  The 
nature  of the challenge  should  allow  students  to integrate  factual,  procedural  and  conceptual  knowledge 
developed through the study of their disciplines.
Through  the identification  and  research  of complex  issues,  students  can develop  an understanding  of how 
interrelated systems, mechanisms and processes impact a problem. Students will then apply their collective 
understanding  to develop  solution-focused  strategies  that  address  the issue.  With  a critical  lens  they  will 
evaluate and reflect on the inherent complexity of solving real-world problems.
Students  will develop  an understanding  of the extent  of global  interconnectedness  between  regional, 
national,  and  local  communities,  which  will empower  them  to become  active  and  engaged  citizens  of the 
world. While addressing local and global issues, students will appreciate that the issues of today exist across 
national boundaries and can only be solved through collective action and international cooperation.
The collaborative  sciences  project  supports  the development  of students’  ATL skills,  including 
teambuilding,  negotiation  and  leadership.  It facilitates  an appreciation  of the environment,  and  the social 
and ethical implications of science and technology.

Data booklet
The IB publishes  a Physics  data  booklet  which  contains  electrical  symbols,  mathematical  equations, 
constants,  and  physics  equations  relevant  to the course.  Students  must  have  access  to a copy  for the 
duration  of the course  so that  they  can become  familiar  with  its contents.  Direct  reference  is made  to 
relevant  equations  in the understandings  sections  of the guide.  This  helps  to maintain  the emphasis  on 
interpretation and application rather than memorization of symbols, constants and equations. A clean copy

General
Assessment  is an integral  part  of teaching  and  learning.  The most  important  aims  of assessment  in the 
Diploma  Programme  (DP)  are that  it should  support  curricular  goals  and  encourage  appropriate  student 
learning.  Both  external  and  internal  assessments  are used  in the DP. IB examiners  mark  work  produced  for 
external  assessment,  while  work  produced  for internal  assessment  is marked  by teachers  and  externally 
moderated by the IB.
There are two types of assessment identified by the IB.
• Formative assessment informs both teaching and learning. It is concerned with providing accurate and 
helpful feedback to students and teachers on the kind of learning taking place and the nature of 
students’ strengths and weaknesses in order to help develop students’ understanding and capabilities. 
Formative assessment can also help to improve teaching quality, as it can provide information to 
monitor progress towards meeting the course aims and objectives (0404-01).
• Summative assessment gives an overview of previous learning and is concerned with measuring 
student achievement at, or towards the end, of the course of study (0404-04).
A comprehensive  assessment  policy  is viewed  as being  integral  with  teaching,  learning  and  course 
organization. For further information, see the IB Programme standards and practices  publication.
The approach  to assessment  used  by the IB is criterion-related,  not norm-referenced.  This  approach  to 
assessment  judges  students’  work  by their  performance  in relation  to identified  levels  of attainment,  and 
not in relation  to the work  of other  students.  For further  information  on assessment  within  the DP, please 
refer to the publication Assessment principles and practices—Quality assessments in a digital age .
To support  teachers  in the planning,  delivery  and  assessment  of the DP courses,  a variety  of resources  can 
be found  on the Programme  Resource  Centre  or purchased  from  the IB store  (store.ibo.org).  Additional 
publications  such  as specimen  papers  and  markschemes,  teacher  support  material  (TSM),  subject  reports 
and  grade  descriptors  can also  be found  on the Programme  Resource  Centre.  Past  examination  papers  as 
well as markschemes can be purchased from the IB store.
Methods of assessment
The IB uses several methods to assess work produced by students.
Assessment criteria
Assessment  criteria  are used  when  the assessment  task  is open-ended.  Each  criterion  concentrates  on a 
particular  skill that  students  are expected  to demonstrate.  An assessment  objective  describes  what 
students should be able to do, and assessment criteria describe how well they should be able to do it. Using 
assessment criteria allows discrimination between different answers and encourages a variety of responses. 
Each  criterion  comprises  a set of hierarchically  ordered  level  descriptors.  Each  level  descriptor  is worth  one 
or more marks. Each criterion is applied independently using a best-fit model. The maximum marks for each 
criterion may differ according to the criterion’s importance. The marks awarded for each criterion are added 
together to give the total mark for the piece of work.
Markbands
Markbands  are a comprehensive  statement  of expected  performance  against  which  responses  are judged. 
 They represent a single holistic criterion divided into level descriptors. Each level descriptor corresponds to 
a range  of marks  to differentiate  student  performance.  A best-fit  approach  is used  to ascertain  which 
particular mark to use from the possible range for each level descriptor.
Analytic markschemes
Analytic  markschemes  are prepared  for those  examination  questions  that  expect  a particular  kind  of 
response and/or a given final answer from students. They give detailed instructions to examiners on how to 
break down the total mark for each question for different parts of the response.
Marking notes
For some  assessment  components  marked  using  assessment  criteria,  marking  notes  are provided.  Marking 
notes give guidance on how to apply assessment criteria to the particular requirements of a question.
Inclusive access arrangements
Inclusive  access  arrangements  are available  for candidates  with  access  requirements.  Standard  assessment 
conditions may put candidates with assessment access requirements at a disadvantage by preventing them 
from  demonstrating  their  attainment  level.  Inclusive  access  arrangements  enable  candidates  to 
demonstrate their ability under assessment conditions that are as fair as possible.
The IB document  Access  and  inclusion  policy  provides  details  on all the inclusive  access  arrangements 
available  to candidates.  The IB document  Learning  diversity  and  inclusion  in IB programmes:  Removing 
barriers  to learning  outlines  the position  of the IB with  regard  to candidates  with  diverse  learning  needs  in 
the IB programmes. For candidates affected by adverse circumstances, the publication Diploma Programme 
Assessment  procedures  (updated  annually),  which  includes  the general  regulations,  provides  details  on 
access consideration.
Responsibilities of the school
The school  is required  to ensure  that  equal  access  arrangements  and  reasonable  adjustments  are provided 
to candidates  with  learning  support  requirements  that  are in line with  the IB documents  Access  and 
inclusion policy  and Learning diversity and inclusion in IB programmes: Removing barriers to learning . 
The publications  Meeting  student  learning  diversity  in the classroom  and  The  IB guide  to inclusive  education:  a 
resource  for whole  school  development  are available  to support  schools  in the ongoing  process  of increasing 
access and engagement by removing barriers to learning.
Programme standards and practices
The programme  standards  and  practices  are a set of principles  for schools  to ensure  quality  and  fidelity  in 
the implementation  of IB programmes.  Teaching  and  learning  are important  markers  of quality  and 
effective practice in schools; thus the expectations teachers and learners share across all IB programmes can 
be found in the programme standards and practices.
The programme  standards  and  practices  provide  a framework  to help  teachers  understand  their  rights  and 
responsibilities  in IB World  Schools  as they  develop  learning  environments  and  experiences  for their 
students. The IB recognizes that in order for effective teaching to take place, teachers must be supported in 
their  understanding,  well-being,  environment  and  resources.  Teachers  use the core  tenets  of IB philosophy 
and  pedagogy  (approaches  to teaching,  ATL,  the learner  profile  and  international-mindedness)  to design 
learning experiences that prepare learners to fulfil the aims and objectives outlined in this guide.
To learn  more  about  teachers’  rights  and  responsibilities,  please  see the IB publication  Programme 
standards and practices  on the Programme Resource Centre.
Internal assessment criteria—SL and HL
Download: Internal assessment criteria—SL and HL (PDF)
There are four IA criteria for the scientific investigation. The marks and weightings are as follows.
Criterion A: Research design
This criterion assesses the student’s ability to describe the research question, explain its significance, and 
design a method to investigate it. This includes the identification and control of variables, the selection of 
appropriate techniques and equipment, and the development of a detailed and logical plan to collect data.
Criterion B: Data analysis
This criterion assesses the student’s ability to process and analyse the data collected in the investigation. 
This includes the use of appropriate mathematical, statistical, and graphical techniques to describe and 
interpret the data, as well as the identification of patterns, trends, and relationships.
Criterion C: Conclusion
This criterion assesses the student’s ability to evaluate the findings of the investigation in relation to the 
research question. This includes the drawing of valid and justified conclusions, the evaluation of the 
reliability and validity of the data, and the identification of limitations and sources of error.
Criterion D: Evaluation
This criterion assesses the student’s ability to critically evaluate the investigation and suggest 
improvements. This includes the identification of weaknesses and limitations in the design and 
implementation of the investigation, the suggestion of realistic and relevant improvements, and the 
evaluation of the impact of these improvements on the validity and reliability of the data.
