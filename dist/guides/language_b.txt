First assessment 2020Language B guide 2Introduction
The Diploma Programme
The Diploma Programme is a rigorous pre-university course of study designed for students in the 16 to 19 
age range. It is a broad-based two-year course that aims to encourage students to be knowledgeable and inquiring, but also caring and compassionate. There is a strong emphasis on encouraging students to develop intercultural understanding, open-mindedness, and the attitudes necessary for them to respect and evaluate a range of points of view.
The Diploma Programme model
The course is presented as six academic areas enclosing a central core (see figure 1). It encourages the concurrent study of a broad range of academic areas. Students study two modern languages (or a modern language and a classical language), a humanities or social science subject, an experimental science, mathematics and one of the creative arts. It is this comprehensive range of subjects that makes the Diploma Programme a demanding course of study designed to prepare students effectively for university entrance. In each of the academic areas students have flexibility in making their choices, which means they can choose subjects that particularly interest them and that they may wish to study further at university.
Figure 1
Diploma Programme modelThe Diploma Programme  
Language B guide 3Choosing the right combination
Students are required to choose one subject from each of the six academic areas, although they 
can, instead of an arts subject, choose two subjects from another area. Normally, three subjects (and not more than four) are taken at higher level (HL), and the others are taken at standard level (SL). The IB recommends 240 teaching hours for HL subjects and 150 hours for SL. Subjects at HL are studied in greater depth and breadth than at SL.
At both levels, many skills are developed, especially those of critical thinking and analysis. At the end of 
the course, students’ abilities are measured by means of external assessment. Many subjects contain some element of coursework assessed by teachers. 
The core of the Diploma Programme model
All Diploma Programme students participate in the three course elements that make up the core of the model. 
Theory of knowledge (TOK) is a course that is fundamentally about critical thinking and inquiry into the 
process of knowing rather than about learning a specific body of knowledge. The TOK course examines the 
nature of knowledge and how we know what we claim to know. It does this by encouraging students to 
analyse knowledge claims and explore questions about the construction of knowledge. The task of TOK is to emphasize connections between areas of shared knowledge and link them to personal knowledge in such a way that an individual becomes more aware of his or her own perspectives and how they might differ from others.
Creativity, activity, service (CAS) is at the heart of the Diploma Programme. The emphasis in CAS is on 
helping students to develop their own identities, in accordance with the ethical principles embodied in the IB mission statement and the IB learner profile. It involves students in a range of activities alongside 
their academic studies throughout the Diploma Programme. The three strands of CAS are creativity (arts, 
and other experiences that involve creative thinking), activity (physical exertion contributing to a healthy lifestyle) and service (an unpaid and voluntary exchange that has a learning benefit for the student). Possibly, more than any other component in the Diploma Programme, CAS contributes to the IB’s mission to create a better and more peaceful world through intercultural understanding and respect.
The extended essay, including the world studies extended essay, offers the opportunity for IB students to 
investigate a topic of special interest, in the form of a 4,000-word piece of independent research. The area of research undertaken is chosen from one of the students’ six Diploma Programme subjects, or in the case of the inter-disciplinary world studies essay, two subjects, and acquaints them with the independent research 
and writing skills expected at university. This leads to a major piece of formally presented, structured 
writing, in which ideas and findings are communicated in a reasoned and coherent manner, appropriate to the subject or subjects chosen. It is intended to promote high-level research and writing skills, intellectual discovery and creativity. An authentic learning experience, it provides students with an opportunity to engage in personal research on a topic of choice, under the guidance of a supervisor.The Diploma Programme  
Language B guide 4Approaches to teaching and approaches to learning
Approaches to teaching and learning across the Diploma Programme refers to deliberate strategies, 
skills and attitudes which permeate the teaching and learning environment. These approaches and tools, intrinsically linked with the learner profile attributes, enhance student learning and assist student preparation for the Diploma Programme assessment and beyond. The aims of approaches to teaching and learning in the Diploma Programme are to:
• empower teachers as teachers of learners as well as teachers of content
• empower teachers to create clearer strategies for facilitating learning experiences in which students 
are more meaningfully engaged in structured inquiry and greater critical and creative thinking
• promote both the aims of individual subjects (making them more than course aspirations) and linking 
previously isolated knowledge (concurrency of learning)
• encourage students to develop an explicit variety of skills that will equip them to continue to be actively engaged in learning after they leave school, and to help them not only obtain university admission through better grades but also prepare for success during tertiary education and beyond
• enhance further the coherence and relevance of the students’ Diploma Programme experience
• allow schools to identify the distinctive nature of an IB Diploma Programme education, with its blend of idealism and practicality.
The five approaches to learning (developing thinking skills, social skills, communication skills, self-management skills and research skills), along with the six approaches to teaching (teaching that is inquiry-based, conceptually focused, contextualized, collaborative, differentiated and informed by assessment), encompass the key values and principles that underpin IB pedagogy.
The IB mission statement and the IB learner profile
The Diploma Programme aims to develop in students the knowledge, skills and attitudes they will need to fulfill the aims of the IB, as expressed in the organization’s mission statement and the learner profile. Teaching and learning in the Diploma Programme represent the reality in daily practice of the organization’s educational philosophy.
Academic honesty
Academic honesty in the Diploma Programme is a set of values and behaviours informed by the attributes of the learner profile. In teaching, learning and assessment, academic honesty serves to promote personal integrity, engender respect for the integrity of others and their work, and ensure that all students have an equal opportunity to demonstrate the knowledge and skills they acquire during their studies.
All coursework—including work submitted for assessment—is to be authentic, based on the student’s 
individual and original ideas, with the ideas and work of others fully acknowledged. Assessment tasks that require teachers to provide guidance to students, or that require students to work collaboratively, must be completed in full compliance with the detailed guidelines provided by the IB for the relevant subjects.
For further information on academic honesty in the IB and the Diploma Programme, please consult the IB 
publications Academic honesty in the IB educational context , Academic honesty in the Diploma Programme and 
Diploma Programme: From principles into practice. 
Specific information regarding academic honesty as it pertains to external and internal assessment 
components of this Diploma Programme subject can be found in this guide.The Diploma Programme  
Language B guide 5Acknowledging the ideas or work of another person
Coordinators and teachers are reminded that candidates must acknowledge all sources used in work 
submitted for assessment. The following is intended as a clarification of this requirement.
Diploma Programme candidates submit work for assessment in a variety of media that may include audio-
visual material, text, graphs, images and/or data published in print or electronic sources. If a candidate uses the work or ideas of another person, the candidate must acknowledge the source using a standard style of referencing in a consistent manner. A candidate’s failure to acknowledge a source will be investigated by the IB as a potential breach of regulations that may result in a penalty imposed by the IB final award committee.
The IB does not prescribe which style(s) of referencing or in-text citation should be used by candidates; this 
is left to the discretion of appropriate faculty/staff in the candidate’s school. The wide range of subjects, three response languages and the diversity of referencing styles make it impractical and restrictive to insist on particular styles. In practice, certain styles may prove most commonly used, but schools are free to choose a style that is appropriate for the subject concerned and the language in which candidates’ work is 
written. Regardless of the reference style adopted by the school for a given subject, it is expected that the 
minimum information given includes: name of author, date of publication, title of source, and page numbers as applicable.
Candidates are expected to use a standard style and use it consistently so that credit is given to all sources 
used, including sources that have been paraphrased or summarized. When writing text candidates must clearly distinguish between their words and those of others by the use of quotation marks (or other method, such as indentation) followed by an appropriate citation that denotes an entry in the bibliography. If an electronic source is cited, the date of access must be indicated. Candidates are not expected to show faultless expertise in referencing, but are expected to demonstrate that all sources have been acknowledged. 
Candidates must be advised that audio-visual material, text, graphs, images and/or data published in print 
or in electronic sources that is not their own must also attribute the source. Again, an appropriate style of referencing/citation must be used.
Learning diversity and learning support requirements
Schools must ensure that equal access arrangements and reasonable adjustments are provided to candidates with learning support requirements that are in line with the IB documents:
• Candidates with assessment access requirements
• Learning diversity and inclusion in IB programmes .Language B guide 6Introduction
Nature of the subject
Language acquisition
Language acquisition consists of two modern language courses—language ab initio and language B—that 
are offered in a number of languages, and a classical languages course that is offered in Latin and Classical Greek. Owing to the nature of language study in the latter, there are specific aims for classical literature that can be found in the Classical languages guide . Language ab initio and language B are language acquisition 
courses designed to provide students with the necessary skills and intercultural understanding to enable 
them to communicate successfully in an environment where the language studied is spoken. This process 
allows the learner to go beyond the confines of the classroom, expanding their awareness of the world and fostering respect for cultural diversity.
The two modern language courses—language ab initio and language B—develop students’ linguistic 
abilities through the development of receptive, productive and interactive skills (as defined in the “Syllabus 
content” section). The classical languages course focuses on the study of the language, literature and culture 
of the classical world.
Language B SL and language B HL
Language B is a language acquisition course designed for students with some previous experience of the target language. In the language B course, students further develop their ability to communicate in the target language through the study of language, themes and texts. In doing so, they also develop conceptual understandings of how language works, as appropriate to the level of the course.
Most language B subjects are available at both SL and HL. A list of languages offered at language B SL and 
HL is released each year in the Diploma Programme Assessment procedures .
Distinction between SL and HL
At both levels of language B (SL and HL), students learn to communicate in the target language in familiar and unfamiliar contexts. They describe situations, narrate events, make comparisons, explain problems, and state and support their personal opinions on a variety of topics relating to course content. The study of two literary works originally written in the target language is required only at language B HL. The distinction between language B SL and HL can also be seen in the level of competency the student is expected to 
develop in the receptive, productive and interactive skills described below.
Language B SL
Receptive skills:  Students understand a range of written and spoken authentic personal, professional and 
mass media texts on topics of interest. They understand descriptions of events, feelings and wishes; they 
understand comparisons and recognize a straightforward, linear argument. They use context to deduce the meaning of sentences and unknown words and phrases.Nature of the subject 
Language B guide 7Productive skills:  Students write texts for a variety of purposes and make oral presentations on topics of 
interest. They write descriptive texts and personal correspondence; they make comparisons, narrate stories, 
provide detailed accounts, and express their thoughts and opinions on abstract or cultural topics. 
Interactive skills:  Students initiate and maintain the flow of conversations and discussions. They express 
and respond to opinions and feelings on a variety of topics. They use and understand clear speech on a 
variety of topics relating to course content and the culture(s) of the target language. Students use a variety of strategies to negotiate meaning and foster communication.
Language B HL
At HL, students are expected to extend the range and complexity of the language they use and understand in order to communicate. They continue to develop their knowledge of vocabulary and grammar, as well as their conceptual understanding of how language works, in order to construct, analyse and evaluate arguments on a variety of topics relating to course content and the target language culture(s).
Receptive skills:  Students understand and evaluate a wide variety of written and spoken authentic 
personal, professional and mass media texts; they understand fundamental elements of literary texts such 
as theme, plot and character. They analyse arguments, distinguishing main points from relevant supporting details and explanations. They use a variety of strategies to deduce meaning. 
Productive skills:  Students present and develop their ideas and opinions on a variety of topics, both 
orally and in writing. They construct and support arguments with explanations and examples. They speak 
and write at length, and with purpose, in order to meet a wide range of communicative needs: describing, narrating, comparing, explaining, persuading, justifying, evaluating.
Interactive skills:  Students initiate, maintain and close oral exchanges, displaying some ability to make 
adjustments in style or emphasis. They use a variety of strategies to maintain the flow of conversations 
and discussions on a variety of topics relating to course content and the culture(s) of the target language. Students are adept in negotiating meaning and fostering communication.
Language B and the core
Teachers of language acquisition courses need to plan carefully to provide opportunities for students to draw on their experiences in the core. Examples of how this might happen include:
• transferring the critical-thinking process explored in TOK to the development of well-supported 
arguments in written text types, such as a speech or report
• using personal knowledge gained from a CAS experience as a cultural comparison in an individual or 
group oral activity, or as an example in a written response
• developing ideas for CAS activities as a result of themes and topics explored in a language acquisition 
class
• developing a research question for an EE that allows the deeper exploration of a language topic of special interest to the student
• using the opportunity to write an EE in the student’s language of study as a means of personal challenge and skills development.
The following section outlines the nature of the contributions that each element of the core can make to language acquisition lessons.Nature of the subject 
Language B guide 8Language B and theory of knowledge
Theory of knowledge (TOK) is one of the three core elements of the Diploma Programme (DP). It plays a 
special role in the programme by providing an opportunity for students to reflect on the fundamental question of how they know what they know. It aims to help students become more aware of their own perspective, as well as developing an awareness of multiple perspectives. More information on TOK can be found in the Theory of knowledge guide .
Language is itself one of the specific ways of knowing that is identified in the TOK course. In addition to this explicit exploration of language, the skills and wider conceptual understandings that students develop 
in TOK can make an extremely positive contribution to their study of language acquisition. TOK develops 
higher-order thinking skills, such as analysis and evaluation, and also helps students to make connections and comparisons across their subject areas and the DP core. In this way, language acquisition both supports and is supported by TOK.
As well as using the skills developed in TOK in acquiring an additional language, students will also benefit 
from guiding questions that can connect TOK to the five themes of the language B curriculum. The following 
discussion questions are examples and are not meant to be either prescriptive or exhaustive.
• Is it possible to think without language?
• What would be lost if the whole world shared one common language?
• If people speak more than one language, is what they know different in each language?
• Do you think maths, logic or music should be classified as languages?
• In what ways can language be used to influence, persuade or manipulate people?
• Does language describe our experience of the world, or does it actively shape our experience of the 
world?
• How are metaphors used in the construction of knowledge?
• To what extent is our perspective determined by our membership of a particular culture?
• To what extent are we aware of the impact of culture on what we believe or know?
• Is there anything that is true for all cultures?
Language B and creativity, activity, service
Creativity, activity, service (CAS) experiences can be associated with each of the subject groups of the DP .
CAS and language acquisition can complement each other in a variety of ways. Students can enhance 
intercultural understanding through the active and purposeful use of their acquired language within the specific real-life contexts provided by their CAS experiences. Students may also draw on their CAS 
experiences to enrich their involvement in language acquisition both within and outside the classroom.
An important characteristic of the language acquisition courses is the conceptual understandings that 
students develop. Through the five prescribed themes around which the language acquisition courses are 
centred, students might be able to investigate, plan, act and reflect on CAS experiences and projects in a more informed and meaningful way. Similarly, CAS experiences can ignite students’ passion for addressing particular personal, local, national and global issues.
Language acquisition teachers can assist students in making links between their subjects and their CAS 
experiences, where appropriate. This will provide students with relevance in both their subject learning and 
their CAS learning through purposeful discussion and real experiences.
The challenge and enjoyment of CAS can often have a profound effect on language acquisition students, 
who might choose, for example, to engage with CAS in the following ways.Nature of the subject 
Language B guide 9• As a CAS experience, a student can extend engagement with the language acquisition theme of “sharing 
the planet” (for example, environment) by conducting a separate activity in learning the names of organic and human-made materials in the target language. The student could then walk around the school to collect human-made waste (for example, plastic) that is discarded during one day, and then display it.
• In a series of CAS experiences relating to the language acquisition theme of “social organization” (for example, social relationships, community, social engagement), a student interacts with elderly target 
language speakers, over a number of visits, to collect sayings, idioms or adages used by the older 
generations. These could then be shared in an article on the school or programme blog.
• Students can develop a CAS project linked to the language acquisition theme of “experiences” (for example, migration) in which they engage with members of a local refugee population. The students could collaborate in an investigation of how migrants balance negotiating a new culture with maintaining their cultural heritage. An outcome of this interaction could be the creation of a mural 
representing the cultural balance.
It is important to note that a CAS experience can be a single event or may be an extended series of events. 
However, CAS experiences must be distinct from, and may not be included or used in, the student’s diploma course requirements.
Additional suggestions on the links between DP subjects and CAS can be found in the Creativity, activity, 
service teacher support material .
Language B and the extended essay
Writing an extended essay (EE) in a language of acquisition provides students with an excellent opportunity to explore one aspect of their chosen language in greater depth and to increase their intercultural understanding and international-mindedness. In line with the IB’s focus on approaches to teaching and learning (ATL), the EE in a language of acquisition provides opportunities for students to develop their thinking, research and self-management skills while, at the same time, focusing on an aspect of language 
that is of particular personal interest and challenge.
Students must select one of the three distinct categories outlined below in order to develop a manageable 
research question for their EE. A simplified summary, with examples, is provided in the table below. For full details of requirements, teachers and students must refer to the Extended essay guide (first assessment 2018).
• Category 1 (“language”) offers the opportunity to engage with a particular linguistic aspect in greater detail.
• Category 2 (“culture and society”) allows the student to focus on one aspect of the target culture, linked to either a linguistic detail or a cultural artifact, and complements perfectly the learner profile for language acquisition, promoting reflection on the culture of the target language and the learner’s role in the linguistic community.
• Category 3 (“literature”) provides an opportunity for students to explore one or more works of literature in order to widen their understanding of the target language and culture from a literary angle.

3 Literature An analysis of a literary type, based on a specific work or works of literature. All works must originally have been written in the target language.How effective is the use of the first person narrator in the German novel Crazy  by Benjamin Lebert?
Language acquisition and international-mindedness
International-mindedness is central to the IB philosophy and instrumental in aspiring to a more peaceful world. Language acquisition courses do not have as their only goal the development of language skills, but also fostering intercultural understanding and global engagement. The nature of the language acquisition process supports international-mindedness and is, in turn, supported by it. The flexibility of IB course design allows language acquisition teachers to incorporate ideas and resources that encourage students to view 
aspects of the language and culture from different (and sometimes differing) perspectives, to make non-
judgmental comparisons of language and culture, and to view language and culture in a global context.
International-mindedness also provides opportunities for students to progress in the development of IB learner profile traits. Through exposure to, examination of, and reflection on, texts from cultures other than their own, students nurture their curiosity ( inquirers ), engage with issues and ideas of global 
significance ( knowledgeable ), use critical-thinking skills ( thinkers ) and listen carefully to the perspectives 
of other individuals and groups ( communicators ). They learn to show respect for the dignity and rights of 
people everywhere ( principled ), critically appreciate the values and traditions of others ( open-minded ), show 
empathy, compassion and respect ( caring ), recognize their interdependence with other people and the world 
in which they live ( balanced ), consider the world thoughtfully ( reflective ) and explore new ideas ( risk-takers ).
Engaging with sensitive topics
All language acquisition courses will provide the opportunity to engage with a broad range of texts, stimuli and scenarios that address topics of personal, local or national and global significance. Such work may well 
raise issues that challenge learners intellectually, personally and culturally. Engagement with these topics, 
whether intentional or incidental, can be opportunities for development of IB learner profile traits. Teachers should help learners to approach such materials in a sensitive, responsible and reflective manner, bearing in mind the IB’s mission and its commitment to international-mindedness and intercultural respect within the context of the course. Consideration should also be given to the personal and social values of others. As part of the collective consideration of the school, language acquisition students must be supported in maintaining an ethical perspective during their course. Schools must make every reasonable effort to encourage students to respond appropriately (without seeking to offend), to promote respect for their peers and to consider the environment in all their actions.Nature of the subject 
Language B guide 11In selecting texts and preparing materials and tasks for language acquisition courses, teachers are reminded 
to consider the cultural environment and the make-up of the student body, in order to act as role models in demonstrating an awareness of, and sensitivity to, deeply held personal and community values.
Prior learning
Students enter language acquisition courses with varying degrees of exposure to the target language(s). It is, therefore, important that students are placed into a course that is most suited to their language development needs and that will provide them with an appropriate academic challenge. For those students entering DP language acquisition from the Middle Years Programme (MYP), table 1 in the “Language acquisition across the IB continuum” section of the MYP Language acquisition guide  provides indications that 
can be useful for appropriate placement. 
Further placement guidance can be drawn from the study Benchmarking Selected IB Diploma Programme 
Language Courses to the Common European Framework of Reference for Languages . This study suggests that 
students already at CEFR A2 or B1 in the target language can comfortably take language B SL. Students already at CEFR B1 or B2 can comfortably take language B HL.
Links to the Middle Years Programme
The MYP is designed for students aged 11 to 16 and, as an integral part of the IB continuum, can directly lead into the DP . MYP language acquisition provides students with opportunities that prepare them for a DP language acquisition course through the following shared aims.
• Developing communication skills in an additional language
• Developing insights into the features, processes and craft of language, and the concept of culture, 
encouraging students to see that there are diverse ways of living, behaving and viewing the world
• Developing intercultural understanding and global engagement, leading to international-mindedness
• Providing opportunities for learning through inquiry and the development of critical- and creative-thinking skills
• Fostering curiosity and a desire for lifelong learning
• Understanding and respecting other languages and cultures
As with the DP , the MYP holistically addresses students’ intellectual, social, emotional and physical well-being, and provides students with opportunities to develop the knowledge, attitudes and skills they need in order to manage complex ideas and issues, and take responsible action for the future. The MYP requires the study of at least two languages to support students in understanding their own cultures and those of others. 
Additionally, the MYP helps to prepare students for further education, the workplace and lifelong learning. 
These courses also provide the opportunity to develop language skills and learn about  language through 
the conceptual understandings of communication, connections , creativity  and culture . The range of 
conceptual understandings, and factual and procedural knowledge that language acquisition students encounter throughout the MYP , can be directly transferred and developed in DP language acquisition courses, as can related concepts such as audience , purpose, meaning  and context .
Learning takes place within contexts relevant to the student, whether personal, local, national, international or globally significant. This approach—using a range of learning contexts in the MYP—is directly extended through the five prescribed themes of DP language acquisition courses: identities; experiences; human ingenuity; social organization; sharing the planet.Nature of the subject 
Language B guide 12Links to the IB Career-related Programme
The IB Career-related Programme (CP) is a framework of international education that incorporates the vision 
and educational principles of the IB into a unique programme specifically developed for students who wish to engage in career-related learning. The CP’s flexible educational framework allows schools to meet the needs, backgrounds and contexts of students, and is especially relevant for language acquisition.
The core of the CP enables students to enhance their personal and interpersonal development, with an 
emphasis on experiential learning. One of the components of the CP core is language development, which ensures that all CP students have access, and are exposed, to an additional language that will enable them to use the language they have studied, encourage intercultural awareness and gain personal fulfilment. Students are encouraged to begin or extend the study of an additional language that suits their needs, background and context. A minimum of 50 hours is expected to be devoted to language development. CP students must complete a language development portfolio to the satisfaction of the school.
One of the ways in which students can undertake language development in the CP is with an extension to 
their DP language acquisition course. This could be done through a school-designed language development course, through an external provider of language development or through monitored self-directed study. It is essential that the content of the provision of language development is an extension to the DP language acquisition coursework, if both are based on the same target language. The content and outcomes of the extension course may be tailored to the career-related studies of the students, if so desired.
The CP documents Language development guide , General regulations: Career-related Programme , and 
Language development teacher support material provide further guidance regarding language acquisition 
and language development. More information about the CP can be found on the CP website, which can be accessed through the programme resource centre.Language B guide 13Introduction

Syllabus outline
Figure 2
In the language B course, students develop the ability to communicate in the target language through the 
study of language , themes  and texts . In doing so, they also develop conceptual understandings  of how 
language works. Communication is evidenced through receptive, productive and interactive skills across a 
range of contexts and purposes that are appropriate to the level of the course.
The study of language requires careful attention to forms, structures, functions and conceptual 
understandings of language. Knowledge of vocabulary and grammar—the what  of language—is reinforced 
and extended by understanding the why  and how  of language: audience, context, purpose, meaning.
Students expand the range of their communication skills by understanding and producing a wide variety of oral and written texts for audiences, contexts and purposes associated with academic and personal interests. For the development of receptive skills, language B students must study authentic texts that explore the culture(s) of the target language. In addition, the study of two literary works is required at HL.
A key aim of the language B course is to develop international-mindedness through the study of language, culture, and ideas and issues of global significance. Explicit links to TOK strengthen the ability to communicate in the target language by increasing students’ self-awareness as inquirers in their own language learning process. As appropriate to the level of the course, communication skills are reinforced through the other categories of approaches to learning skills: thinking, research, social and self-management skills.
The recommended teaching time is 240 hours to complete HL courses and 150 hours to complete SL courses, 
as stated in the document General regulations: Diploma Programme (2016: 6, article 8.2).Language B guide 18Syllabus

Themes
Prescribed themes
Five prescribed themes are common to the syllabuses of language B and language ab initio; the themes 
provide relevant contexts for study at all levels of language acquisition in the DP , and opportunities for students to communicate about matters of personal, local or national, and global interest.
The five prescribed themes are:
• identities
• experiences
• human ingenuity
• social organization
• sharing the planet.
The themes allow students to compare the target language and culture(s) to other languages and cultures 
with which they are familiar. The themes also provide opportunities for students to make connections to other disciplinary areas in the DP . Students and teachers of language B with experience of the Primary Years Programme (PYP) or the MYP will recognize that the themes are inspired by the transdisciplinary themes of the PYP and the global contexts of the MYP . In this way, the DP language B course can enhance the continuity of the educational experience of long-standing IB students, while also being suitable for students who are new to the IB.
Recommended topics
The five prescribed themes must all be addressed equally in the language B course; beyond that, teachers are free to work with the themes in a way that best helps them to organize a course plan and build upon students’ interests in the target language and its cultures, and that best helps students to meet the expectations of the syllabus with regard to language and texts.
The following lists of recommended topics for each theme are appropriate for students to achieve the 
aims and objectives of the course. The recommended topics are to be considered indicative content , not 
prescribed content, for the language B course. The themes are prescribed, but the recommended topics and possible questions for each theme are not prescribed.Syllabus content

Texts
In theory, a text is anything from which information can be extracted, including the wide range of oral, written and visual materials present in society. For example:
• single and multiple images, with or without written text
• non-literary and literary written texts and extracts
• broadcast media texts: films, radio and television programmes, and their scripts
• oral texts: presentations, debates, interviews, speeches, recorded conversations, and their transcripts
• electronic texts that share aspects of the above areas: text messaging, web pages and blogs, social 
media and video-sharing websites.Syllabus content  
Language B guide 21For the purposes of teaching and learning in a language acquisition course, the language B and language 
ab initio syllabuses organize written, visual, audio and audio-visual texts into three broad categories: personal , professional  and mass media texts . The guiding principle for using texts in the DP language 
acquisition courses is to develop students’ receptive, productive and interactive skills in the target language by focusing their attention on the ways in which good communicators consider the audience, context and 
purpose of what they want to say or write in the process of choosing and developing an appropriate text 
type to convey a message.
Teachers should provide frequent opportunities for students to understand and use a variety of text types 
in relation to the prescribed themes and related course content. The categories are described below, and the table that follows provides examples of text types for each category. The examples shown are neither prescriptive nor exhaustive.
Personal texts
Personal texts are shared by the person creating the message and an audience who may be family members, friends or groups with a common interest; a personal text may also be directed to oneself. Personal texts tend to be characterized by attention to the everyday interests or the affective needs of individuals rather than the analysis of information. Personal texts have a variety of functions including, but not limited to, describing, narrating, entertaining, recommending and persuading. The level of formality in the register of 
these texts will vary according to the linguistic and sociocultural norms of the target language.
Professional texts
Professional texts are created for an intended audience in contexts where no personal relationship is 
assumed between the producer of the text and the recipient(s); however, the producer of the text can assume that the recipient(s) will have an interest in receiving and understanding the message. Professional texts tend to be characterized by attention to the cognitive needs of individuals, the transfer of knowledge and the logical presentation of information; these texts employ clear, factual language and a formal register. 
Professional texts have a variety of functions including, but not limited to, informing, instructing, explaining, 
analysing, convincing, interpreting and evaluating.
Mass media texts
Mass media texts are created for distribution to a large audience that is targeted because of an interest that, at least initially, lies primarily with the producer of the text, since the person or entity responsible for a mass media text has no way of knowing exactly who will take the time and interest to understand the message or who will ignore it. Mass media texts tend to be characterized by the need of the producer of the text to project authority, desirability or exclusivity, and the conscious choice of a particular medium or technology 
that is appropriate to reach the targeted audience. The level of formality in the register of these texts will 
vary according to the linguistic and sociocultural norms of the target language.Syllabus content

* Teachers are reminded that the study of at least two literary texts (originally written in the target language) 
is compulsory for language B at HL, and that one of the literary texts studied during the course must serve 
as the stimulus for the individual oral assessment at HL.
Literature
Reading literature in the target language can be an enjoyable journey into cultures where the target language is spoken. Literature can exemplify one or more of the prescribed themes of the language B course, and can help students to broaden their vocabulary and use language to express opinions and explore ideas. Reading literature helps students to develop fluent reading skills as they progress from comprehension to interpretation and inference. Literature is also an especially appropriate vehicle for 
promoting the development of international-mindedness, which is a key aim of the DP language acquisition 
courses.
The use of literary works to develop students’ receptive and productive skills is encouraged at all levels of 
language acquisition in the DP; however, in terms of formal requirements of the syllabus and assessment outline, the study of two literary works originally written in the target language is a requirement at 
HL in language  B. HL students are expected to understand fundamental elements of the literary works 
studied, such as themes, plot and characters. It must be emphasized that literary criticism is not an objective Syllabus content  
Language B guide 23of the language B course; literary criticism lies within the remit of the DP studies in language and literature 
courses. In language acquisition courses, specifically language B HL, literature is intended as a stimulus for ideas to be explored, principally through oral assessment.
The term “literary works” refers to works of prose fiction, prose non-fiction, poetry and drama. When 
choosing literary works, teachers should consider carefully how to use literature in relation to one or more of the prescribed themes, and they should also bear in mind the interests and general language proficiency of their students. The term “literary text” refers to an extract from a complete literary work, for example, a scene from a play, several paragraphs from a novel or a single poem from a larger collection.
As with any resources used in the classroom, literary works should be chosen in order to allow students to 
achieve the aims and objectives of the course, be culturally relevant to the target language and linguistically accessible for language acquisition students. Literary works that feature a high degree of linguistic complexity, arcane language or an enigmatic subject matter are not appropriate in the DP language acquisition classroom context. Works in translation or “easy reader” versions of literary texts are not helpful for students to achieve the aims and objectives of the course and must be avoided.
Conceptual understanding
Concerning the importance of “significant content” that allows students to develop both disciplinary and interdisciplinary understandings, the document What is an IB education? states that “Each of the four IB programmes provides a detailed and developmentally appropriate curriculum or curriculum framework that is broad, balanced, conceptual and connected.” The explicit integration of conceptual understanding into the curriculum focuses on “powerful organizing ideas that are relevant across subject areas” (2013, 
updated June 2015, May 2017: 5).
All DP language programme subject groups promote a vision of learning in which the development of 
language skills and conceptual understandings of language are complementary to each other, so that the total learning experience of the student is as robust as possible. Thus, DP students become more accomplished communicators in the languages they study when their abilities to read, write and speak about course content are reinforced and extended by an understanding of why  and how  people use language to communicate.
In particular, the approach to developing conceptual understandings of language in the DP languages 
programme is designed using the following guiding principles.
• DP students with experience of the PYP or the MYP are provided with frequent opportunities to 
develop further their conceptual understandings of language (PYP) or their understanding of the key and related concepts in the MYP language and literature and language acquisition courses.
• DP students are encouraged to apply what they already know about other languages and cultures—
through formal study or personal experience—in order to enhance their overall learning process.
• DP students are encouraged to consider broad questions about language and culture, as appropriate 
to their course of study, in order to develop international-mindedness and increase their self-awareness as inquirers in their own learning process.
Conceptual understanding in language acquisition courses
For language acquisition courses, it is important to note that the approach presented here for developing conceptual understanding recognizes that DP students are not beginning students, even when they are beginning learners of a language or do not demonstrate a high level of language proficiency. At all levels of language acquisition, therefore, DP students are encouraged to make use of the thinking, communication and research skills they have developed over years of experience in school, and to transfer those skills to 
the target language at the pace—and within the contexts and for the purposes—that their language skills 
development will allow.Syllabus content  
Language B guide 24Certain conceptual understandings of language are fundamental to successful communication and should 
be developed in all DP language acquisition courses. Following the description of each are some stimulus questions that may encourage exploration of these conceptual understandings while calling attention to language skills. Teachers should feel free to use or adapt these questions—or create their own questions—for use in class so that they are comprehensible to students and relevant to course content. It is important 
to note that these are not questions for examination papers ; rather, they are included in the syllabus as 
a tool for teachers to use in order to encourage students to think about  language and culture as part of their 
language study in the DP and, in doing so, to become more effective and knowledgeable communicators.
• Audience:  Students understand that language should be appropriate for the person(s) with whom 
one is communicating.
Stimulus questions
 – How can the perceived needs and interests, or previous knowledge, of the recipients of a text 
influence its production?
 – How would the language used in a given text need to change if the same basic message needed to be communicated to a different audience?
• Context:  Students understand that language should be appropriate to the situation in which one is 
communicating.
Stimulus questions
 – How does the situation or setting influence the production or reception of a text?
 – How is the relationship between the producer and the recipient(s) of a text (or the relationship of 
interlocutors in a conversation) reflected in language use?
• Purpose:  Students understand that language should be appropriate to achieve a desired intention, 
goal or result when communicating.
Stimulus questions
 – When I read or listen to a text, what helps me to understand the intention of the person who 
produced the text?
 – When I need to communicate for a specific reason, how do I plan my message and language use in order to achieve my goal?
• Meaning:  Students understand that language is used in a range of ways to communicate a message.
Stimulus questions
 – How are literal and figurative (non-literal) language used by producers of texts to create desired effects?
 – What does the producer of a text do to make the message clear (or, on the contrary, to make it ambiguous) when there is no opportunity for the recipient(s) to reply to the text?
• Variation:  Students understand that differences exist within a given language, and that speakers of a 
given language are generally able to understand each other.
Stimulus questions
 – How or why does a language change over time, across geographical boundaries or from one 
social or cultural group to another?
 – What does it mean to say that aspects of a text are “lost in translation” from one language to 
another?Syllabus content  
Language B guide 25Principles of course design
The IB recognizes that, owing to differences in language teaching traditions, it might be easier for the 
teachers of particular languages to find textbooks to suit their specific language. However, should appropriate textbooks not be available, the syllabus has been designed to allow teachers the freedom to construct their own course of study and schemes of work based on a range of texts linked to one or more of the prescribed themes in the syllabus. Teachers must use authentic materials as much as possible in the 
classroom, as this is necessary in order for students to meet the expectations of the course. This includes 
exposing students to the full range of varieties of the target language, both in written and spoken form, so that students become familiar with different accents as well as significant differences in vocabulary and structures. Such language experiences will encourage students to become open-minded, reflective communicators with a heightened sense of international-mindedness.
In designing a language B course of study, teachers should pay particular attention to three important 
principles: variety , integration  and transparency .
Variety
Teachers should ensure that their students:
• develop their receptive, productive and interactive skills in the target language through a wide range 
of individual, pair and group activities in class
• practise the target language through a wide range of individual, pair and group tasks
• are introduced to the full range of text types appropriate to the level of the course
• are exposed to a range of regional and national accents.
Integration
In order to integrate all the relevant aspects of the course and to encourage autonomy, it is necessary for teachers to help their students develop strategies for dealing with unfamiliar situations and unfamiliar language. To achieve this, teachers should provide:
• an environment that promotes the use of the target language in the classroom and prepares the 
students to communicate in a variety of contexts and for a variety of purposes that are appropriate to 
the level of the course
• authentic and modified authentic materials for study that have originally been produced for everyday 
users of the target language.
Teachers should also ensure that their course provides opportunities for students to:
• move easily from one language skill to another (for example, a discussion after reading a text)
• interact in the target language through active participation in oral exchanges, by both listening and 
speaking, or responding to a text, either in writing or orally
• consider and explore links with other disciplinary areas in the DP and with the TOK course
• reinforce their communication skills by using the other categories of approaches to learning skills: thinking, research, social and self-management skills
• be involved in the selection of materials to be studied.Syllabus content  
Language B guide 26Teachers are reminded that no single part of the syllabus—language, themes, texts, conceptual 
understandings—is an end in itself, but that all parts should complement each other and must be integrated in the course design. The ability of students to communicate in the target language should be developed through the study of materials that reflect the culture(s) concerned. This consideration also applies to the selection of literary works for language B HL.
Transparency
Teachers must ensure that their students are given clear information about the aims and objectives, the syllabus requirements and the assessment criteria for the course. Students should be made aware of what is expected of them regarding classwork and homework, as well as receiving regular feedback on their progress throughout the course.Language B guide 27Assessment
Assessment in the Diploma Programme
General
Assessment is an integral part of teaching and learning. The most important aims of assessment in the DP 
are that it should support curricular goals and encourage appropriate student learning. Both external and internal assessments are used in the DP . IB examiners mark work produced for external assessment, while work produced for internal assessment is marked by teachers and externally moderated by the IB.
There are two types of assessment identified by the IB.
• An integral component of ATL, formative assessment informs both teaching and learning. It is 
concerned with providing accurate and helpful feedback to students and teachers on the kind of learning taking place and the nature of students’ strengths and weaknesses in order to help develop students’ understanding and capabilities. Formative assessment can also help to improve teaching quality, as it can provide information to monitor progress towards meeting the course aims and objectives.
• Summative assessment gives an overview of previous learning and is concerned with measuring student achievement.
The DP primarily focuses on summative assessment designed to record student achievement at, or towards, the end of the course of study. However, many of the assessment instruments can, and should, also be used formatively during the course of teaching and learning. A comprehensive assessment plan is viewed 
as being integral with teaching, learning and course organization. For further information, see the IB 
Programme standards and practices document.
The approach to assessment used by the IB is criterion-related, not norm-referenced. This approach to 
assessment judges students’ work by their performance in relation to identified levels of attainment, and not in relation to the work of other students. For further information on assessment within the DP , please refer to the publication Diploma Programme assessment: Principles and practice .
To support teachers in the planning, delivery and assessment of the DP courses, a variety of resources can 
be found on the programme resource centre. Additional publications, such as specimen papers and the 
corresponding markschemes, teacher support materials, subject reports and grade descriptors, can also be found on the programme resource centre. Past examination papers and the corresponding markschemes are made available for purchase through the IB store.
Methods of assessment
The IB uses the following methods to assess work produced by students.
Assessment criteria
Assessment criteria are used when the assessment task is open-ended. Each criterion concentrates on a particular skill that students are expected to demonstrate. An assessment objective describes what students should be able to do, and assessment criteria describe how well they should be able to do it. Using assessment criteria allows discrimination between different answers and encourages a variety of responses. Assessment in the Diploma Programme 
Language B guide 28Each criterion comprises a set of hierarchically ordered level descriptors. Each level descriptor is worth one 
or more marks. Each criterion is applied independently using a best-fit model. The maximum marks for each criterion may differ according to the criterion’s importance. The marks awarded for each criterion are added together to give the total mark for the piece of work.
Markbands
Markbands are a comprehensive statement of expected performance against which responses are judged. They represent a single holistic criterion divided into level descriptors. Each level descriptor corresponds to a range of marks to differentiate student performance. A best-fit approach is used to ascertain which particular mark to use from the possible range for each level descriptor.
Analytic markschemes
Analytic markschemes are prepared for those examination questions that expect a particular kind of response and/or a given final answer from students. They give detailed instructions to examiners on how to break down the total mark for each question for different parts of the response.
Marking notes
For some assessment components marked using assessment criteria, marking notes are provided. Marking notes give guidance on how to apply assessment criteria to the particular requirements of a question.
Inclusive assessment arrangements
Inclusive assessment arrangements are available for candidates with assessment access requirements. These arrangements enable candidates with diverse needs to access the examinations and demonstrate their knowledge and understanding of the constructs being assessed.
The IB document Candidates with assessment access requirements provides details on all the inclusive 
assessment arrangements available to candidates with learning support requirements. The IB document 
Learning diversity and inclusion in IB programmes outlines the position of the IB with regard to candidates with diverse learning needs in the IB programmes. For candidates affected by adverse circumstances, the IB documents General regulations: Diploma Programme  and Diploma Programme Assessment procedures  
provide details on access considerations.
Responsibilities of the school
Schools must ensure that equal access arrangements and reasonable adjustments are provided to candidates with learning support requirements, in line with the IB documents Candidates with assessment access requirements and Learning diversity and inclusion in IB programmes .
The documents Meeting student learning diversity in the classroom and The IB guide to inclusive education: a resource for whole school development  are available to support schools in the ongoing process of increasing 
access and engagement by removing barriers to learning.Language B guide 29Assessment

This examination is externally set and externally assessed. It consists of a choice from three tasks with a 
variety of audiences, contexts and purposes. Each task is based on a different theme from the syllabus. Students write a response of 250–400 words to one of the tasks, choosing a text type from among those listed in the examination instructions.
The aim of this component is to assess the ability to communicate in writing for a variety of purposes. In 
order to fulfill the requirements of this assessment component, students need to show, through their use of text type, register and style, that they understand the concepts of audience, context, purpose, meaning and variation, and can apply them to their written language.
Paper 1 assesses the degree to which students are able to:
• communicate clearly and effectively in a range of contexts and for a variety of purposes
• understand and use language appropriate to a range of interpersonal and/or intercultural contexts 
and audiencesExternal assessment  
Language B guide 32• understand and use language to express and respond to a range of ideas with fluency and accuracy
• identify, organize and present ideas on a range of topics.
Students’ factual knowledge of topics within the themes will not be tested; however, it can be used to 
support any ideas that the student wishes to communicate.
Paper 2: Receptive skills—listening and reading
Duration: 1 hour 45 minutes
Weighting: 50%Paper 2 is based on the five themes: identities, experiences, human ingenuity, social organization, sharing the planet.
This examination is externally set and externally assessed. It is divided into two separate sections: listening 
(three audio passages) and reading (three written passages) covering different topics drawn from the five themes. The students’ understanding of the six passages is assessed in this examination; it does not test the students’ knowledge of any factual content of a specific topic. All audio and written passages are in the target language and all answers must be provided in the target language.
Note:  International-mindedness is central to the IB philosophy. It is expected that students will 
have been exposed to a variety of texts, both oral and written, that demonstrate linguistic variation and regional accents. Linguistic variation and regional accents appearing in texts used for external assessment are intended to reflect this expectation while also being comprehensible to the students.

The Diploma Programme
The Diploma Programme is a rigorous pre-university course of study designed for students in the 16 to 19 
age range. It is a broad-based two-year course that aims to encourage students to be knowledgeable and inquiring, but also caring and compassionate. There is a strong emphasis on encouraging students to develop intercultural understanding, open-mindedness, and the attitudes necessary for them to respect and evaluate a range of points of view.
The Diploma Programme model

The course is presented as six academic areas enclosing a central core (see figure 1). It encourages the concurrent study of a broad range of academic areas. Students study two modern languages (or a modern language and a classical language), a humanities or social science subject, an experimental science, mathematics and one of the creative arts. It is this comprehensive range of subjects that makes the Diploma Programme a demanding course of study designed to prepare students effectively for university entrance. In each of the academic areas students have flexibility in making their choices, which means they can choose subjects that particularly interest them and that they may wish to study further at university.
Figure 1
Diploma Programme modelThe Diploma Programme  
Language B guide 3Choosing the right combination
Students are required to choose one subject from each of the six academic areas, although they 
can, instead of an arts subject, choose two subjects from another area. Normally, three subjects (and not more than four) are taken at higher level (HL), and the others are taken at standard level (SL). The IB recommends 240 teaching hours for HL subjects and 150 hours for SL. Subjects at HL are studied in greater depth and breadth than at SL.
At both levels, many skills are developed, especially those of critical thinking and analysis. At the end of 
the course, students’ abilities are measured by means of external assessment. Many subjects contain some element of coursework assessed by teachers. 
The core of the Diploma Programme model
All Diploma Programme students participate in the three course elements that make up the core of the model. 
Theory of knowledge (TOK) is a course that is fundamentally about critical thinking and inquiry into the 
process of knowing rather than about learning a specific body of knowledge. The TOK course examines the 
nature of knowledge and how we know what we claim to know. It does this by encouraging students to 
analyse knowledge claims and explore questions about the construction of knowledge. The task of TOK is to emphasize connections between areas of shared knowledge and link them to personal knowledge in such a way that an individual becomes more aware of his or her own perspectives and how they might differ from others.
Creativity, activity, service (CAS) is at the heart of the Diploma Programme. The emphasis in CAS is on 
helping students to develop their own identities, in accordance with the ethical principles embodied in the IB mission statement and the IB learner profile. It involves students in a range of activities alongside 
their academic studies throughout the Diploma Programme. The three strands of CAS are creativity (arts, 
and other experiences that involve creative thinking), activity (physical exertion contributing to a healthy lifestyle) and service (an unpaid and voluntary exchange that has a learning benefit for the student). Possibly, more than any other component in the Diploma Programme, CAS contributes to the IB’s mission to create a better and more peaceful world through intercultural understanding and respect.
The extended essay, including the world studies extended essay, offers the opportunity for IB students to 
investigate a topic of special interest, in the form of a 4,000-word piece of independent research. The area of research undertaken is chosen from one of the students’ six Diploma Programme subjects, or in the case of the inter-disciplinary world studies essay, two subjects, and acquaints them with the independent research 
and writing skills expected at university. This leads to a major piece of formally presented, structured 
writing, in which ideas and findings are communicated in a reasoned and coherent manner, appropriate to the subject or subjects chosen. It is intended to promote high-level research and writing skills, intellectual discovery and creativity. An authentic learning experience, it provides students with an opportunity to engage in personal research on a topic of choice, under the guidance of a supervisor.The Diploma Programme  
Language B guide 4Approaches to teaching and approaches to learning
Approaches to teaching and learning across the Diploma Programme refers to deliberate strategies, 
skills and attitudes which permeate the teaching and learning environment. These approaches and tools, intrinsically linked with the learner profile attributes, enhance student learning and assist student preparation for the Diploma Programme assessment and beyond. The aims of approaches to teaching and learning in the Diploma Programme are to:
• empower teachers as teachers of learners as well as teachers of content
• empower teachers to create clearer strategies for facilitating learning experiences in which students 
are more meaningfully engaged in structured inquiry and greater critical and creative thinking
• promote both the aims of individual subjects (making them more than course aspirations) and linking 
previously isolated knowledge (concurrency of learning)
• encourage students to develop an explicit variety of skills that will equip them to continue to be actively engaged in learning after they leave school, and to help them not only obtain university admission through better grades but also prepare for success during tertiary education and beyond
• enhance further the coherence and relevance of the students’ Diploma Programme experience
• allow schools to identify the distinctive nature of an IB Diploma Programme education, with its blend of idealism and practicality.
The five approaches to learning (developing thinking skills, social skills, communication skills, self-management skills and research skills), along with the six approaches to teaching (teaching that is inquiry-based, conceptually focused, contextualized, collaborative, differentiated and informed by assessment), encompass the key values and principles that underpin IB pedagogy.
The IB mission statement and the IB learner profile
The Diploma Programme aims to develop in students the knowledge, skills and attitudes they will need to fulfill the aims of the IB, as expressed in the organization’s mission statement and the learner profile. Teaching and learning in the Diploma Programme represent the reality in daily practice of the organization’s educational philosophy.
Academic honesty
Academic honesty in the Diploma Programme is a set of values and behaviours informed by the attributes of the learner profile. In teaching, learning and assessment, academic honesty serves to promote personal integrity, engender respect for the integrity of others and their work, and ensure that all students have an equal opportunity to demonstrate the knowledge and skills they acquire during their studies.
All coursework—including work submitted for assessment—is to be authentic, based on the student’s 
individual and original ideas, with the ideas and work of others fully acknowledged. Assessment tasks that require teachers to provide guidance to students, or that require students to work collaboratively, must be completed in full compliance with the detailed guidelines provided by the IB for the relevant subjects.
For further information on academic honesty in the IB and the Diploma Programme, please consult the IB 
publications Academic honesty in the IB educational context , Academic honesty in the Diploma Programme and 
Diploma Programme: From principles into practice. 
Specific information regarding academic honesty as it pertains to external and internal assessment 
components of this Diploma Programme subject can be found in this guide.The Diploma Programme  
Language B guide 5Acknowledging the ideas or work of another person
Coordinators and teachers are reminded that candidates must acknowledge all sources used in work 
submitted for assessment. The following is intended as a clarification of this requirement.
Diploma Programme candidates submit work for assessment in a variety of media that may include audio-
visual material, text, graphs, images and/or data published in print or electronic sources. If a candidate uses the work or ideas of another person, the candidate must acknowledge the source using a standard style of referencing in a consistent manner. A candidate’s failure to acknowledge a source will be investigated by the IB as a potential breach of regulations that may result in a penalty imposed by the IB final award committee.
The IB does not prescribe which style(s) of referencing or in-text citation should be used by candidates; this 
is left to the discretion of appropriate faculty/staff in the candidate’s school. The wide range of subjects, three response languages and the diversity of referencing styles make it impractical and restrictive to insist on particular styles. In practice, certain styles may prove most commonly used, but schools are free to choose a style that is appropriate for the subject concerned and the language in which candidates’ work is 
written. Regardless of the reference style adopted by the school for a given subject, it is expected that the 
minimum information given includes: name of author, date of publication, title of source, and page numbers as applicable.
Candidates are expected to use a standard style and use it consistently so that credit is given to all sources 
used, including sources that have been paraphrased or summarized. When writing text candidates must clearly distinguish between their words and those of others by the use of quotation marks (or other method, such as indentation) followed by an appropriate citation that denotes an entry in the bibliography. If an electronic source is cited, the date of access must be indicated. Candidates are not expected to show faultless expertise in referencing, but are expected to demonstrate that all sources have been acknowledged. 
Candidates must be advised that audio-visual material, text, graphs, images and/or data published in print 
or in electronic sources that is not their own must also attribute the source. Again, an appropriate style of referencing/citation must be used.
Learning diversity and learning support requirements
Schools must ensure that equal access arrangements and reasonable adjustments are provided to candidates with learning support requirements that are in line with the IB documents:
• Candidates with assessment access requirements
• Learning diversity and inclusion in IB programmes .Language B guide 6Introduction
Nature of the subject
Language acquisition
Language acquisition consists of two modern language courses—language ab initio and language B—that 
are offered in a number of languages, and a classical languages course that is offered in Latin and Classical Greek. Owing to the nature of language study in the latter, there are specific aims for classical literature that can be found in the Classical languages guide . Language ab initio and language B are language acquisition 
courses designed to provide students with the necessary skills and intercultural understanding to enable 
them to communicate successfully in an environment where the language studied is spoken. This process 
allows the learner to go beyond the confines of the classroom, expanding their awareness of the world and fostering respect for cultural diversity.
The two modern language courses—language ab initio and language B—develop students’ linguistic 
abilities through the development of receptive, productive and interactive skills (as defined in the “Syllabus 
content” section). The classical languages course focuses on the study of the language, literature and culture 
of the classical world.
Language B SL and language B HL
Language B is a language acquisition course designed for students with some previous experience of the target language. In the language B course, students further develop their ability to communicate in the target language through the study of language, themes and texts. In doing so, they also develop conceptual understandings of how language works, as appropriate to the level of the course.
Most language B subjects are available at both SL and HL. A list of languages offered at language B SL and 
HL is released each year in the Diploma Programme Assessment procedures .
Distinction between SL and HL
At both levels of language B (SL and HL), students learn to communicate in the target language in familiar and unfamiliar contexts. They describe situations, narrate events, make comparisons, explain problems, and state and support their personal opinions on a variety of topics relating to course content. The study of two literary works originally written in the target language is required only at language B HL. The distinction between language B SL and HL can also be seen in the level of competency the student is expected to 
develop in the receptive, productive and interactive skills described below.
Language B SL
Receptive skills:  Students understand a range of written and spoken authentic personal, professional and 
mass media texts on topics of interest. They understand descriptions of events, feelings and wishes; they 
understand comparisons and recognize a straightforward, linear argument. They use context to deduce the meaning of sentences and unknown words and phrases.Nature of the subject 
Language B guide 7Productive skills:  Students write texts for a variety of purposes and make oral presentations on topics of 
interest. They write descriptive texts and personal correspondence; they make comparisons, narrate stories, 
provide detailed accounts, and express their thoughts and opinions on abstract or cultural topics. 
Interactive skills:  Students initiate and maintain the flow of conversations and discussions. They express 
and respond to opinions and feelings on a variety of topics. They use and understand clear speech on a 
variety of topics relating to course content and the culture(s) of the target language. Students use a variety of strategies to negotiate meaning and foster communication.
Language B HL
At HL, students are expected to extend the range and complexity of the language they use and understand in order to communicate. They continue to develop their knowledge of vocabulary and grammar, as well as their conceptual understanding of how language works, in order to construct, analyse and evaluate arguments on a variety of topics relating to course content and the target language culture(s).
Receptive skills:  Students understand and evaluate a wide variety of written and spoken authentic 
personal, professional and mass media texts; they understand fundamental elements of literary texts such 
as theme, plot and character. They analyse arguments, distinguishing main points from relevant supporting details and explanations. They use a variety of strategies to deduce meaning. 
Productive skills:  Students present and develop their ideas and opinions on a variety of topics, both 
orally and in writing. They construct and support arguments with explanations and examples. They speak 
and write at length, and with purpose, in order to meet a wide range of communicative needs: describing, narrating, comparing, explaining, persuading, justifying, evaluating.
Interactive skills:  Students initiate, maintain and close oral exchanges, displaying some ability to make 
adjustments in style or emphasis. They use a variety of strategies to maintain the flow of conversations 
and discussions on a variety of topics relating to course content and the culture(s) of the target language. Students are adept in negotiating meaning and fostering communication.
Language B and the core
Teachers of language acquisition courses need to plan carefully to provide opportunities for students to draw on their experiences in the core. Examples of how this might happen include:
• transferring the critical-thinking process explored in TOK to the development of well-supported 
arguments in written text types, such as a speech or report
• using personal knowledge gained from a CAS experience as a cultural comparison in an individual or 
group oral activity, or as an example in a written response
• developing ideas for CAS activities as a result of themes and topics explored in a language acquisition 
class
• developing a research question for an EE that allows the deeper exploration of a language topic of special interest to the student
• using the opportunity to write an EE in the student’s language of study as a means of personal challenge and skills development.
The following section outlines the nature of the contributions that each element of the core can make to language acquisition lessons.Nature of the subject 
Language B guide 8Language B and theory of knowledge
Theory of knowledge (TOK) is one of the three core elements of the Diploma Programme (DP). It plays a 
special role in the programme by providing an opportunity for students to reflect on the fundamental question of how they know what they know. It aims to help students become more aware of their own perspective, as well as developing an awareness of multiple perspectives. More information on TOK can be found in the Theory of knowledge guide .
Language is itself one of the specific ways of knowing that is identified in the TOK course. In addition to this explicit exploration of language, the skills and wider conceptual understandings that students develop 
in TOK can make an extremely positive contribution to their study of language acquisition. TOK develops 
higher-order thinking skills, such as analysis and evaluation, and also helps students to make connections and comparisons across their subject areas and the DP core. In this way, language acquisition both supports and is supported by TOK.
As well as using the skills developed in TOK in acquiring an additional language, students will also benefit 
from guiding questions that can connect TOK to the five themes of the language B curriculum. The following 
discussion questions are examples and are not meant to be either prescriptive or exhaustive.
• Is it possible to think without language?
• What would be lost if the whole world shared one common language?
• If people speak more than one language, is what they know different in each language?
• Do you think maths, logic or music should be classified as languages?
• In what ways can language be used to influence, persuade or manipulate people?
• Does language describe our experience of the world, or does it actively shape our experience of the 
world?
• How are metaphors used in the construction of knowledge?
• To what extent is our perspective determined by our membership of a particular culture?
• To what extent are we aware of the impact of culture on what we believe or know?
• Is there anything that is true for all cultures?
Language B and creativity, activity, service
Creativity, activity, service (CAS) experiences can be associated with each of the subject groups of the DP .
CAS and language acquisition can complement each other in a variety of ways. Students can enhance 
intercultural understanding through the active and purposeful use of their acquired language within the specific real-life contexts provided by their CAS experiences. Students may also draw on their CAS 
experiences to enrich their involvement in language acquisition both within and outside the classroom.
An important characteristic of the language acquisition courses is the conceptual understandings that 
students develop. Through the five prescribed themes around which the language acquisition courses are 
centred, students might be able to investigate, plan, act and reflect on CAS experiences and projects in a more informed and meaningful way. Similarly, CAS experiences can ignite students’ passion for addressing particular personal, local, national and global issues.
Language acquisition teachers can assist students in making links between their subjects and their CAS 
experiences, where appropriate. This will provide students with relevance in both their subject learning and 
their CAS learning through purposeful discussion and real experiences.
The challenge and enjoyment of CAS can often have a profound effect on language acquisition students, 
who might choose, for example, to engage with CAS in the following ways.Nature of the subject 
Language B guide 9• As a CAS experience, a student can extend engagement with the language acquisition theme of “sharing 
the planet” (for example, environment) by conducting a separate activity in learning the names of organic and human-made materials in the target language. The student could then walk around the school to collect human-made waste (for example, plastic) that is discarded during one day, and then display it.
• In a series of CAS experiences relating to the language acquisition theme of “social organization” (for example, social relationships, community, social engagement), a student interacts with elderly target 
language speakers, over a number of visits, to collect sayings, idioms or adages used by the older 
generations. These could then be shared in an article on the school or programme blog.
• Students can develop a CAS project linked to the language acquisition theme of “experiences” (for example, migration) in which they engage with members of a local refugee population. The students could collaborate in an investigation of how migrants balance negotiating a new culture with maintaining their cultural heritage. An outcome of this interaction could be the creation of a mural 
representing the cultural balance.
It is important to note that a CAS experience can be a single event or may be an extended series of events. 
However, CAS experiences must be distinct from, and may not be included or used in, the student’s diploma course requirements.
Additional suggestions on the links between DP subjects and CAS can be found in the Creativity, activity, 
service teacher support material .
Language B and the extended essay
Writing an extended essay (EE) in a language of acquisition provides students with an excellent opportunity to explore one aspect of their chosen language in greater depth and to increase their intercultural understanding and international-mindedness. In line with the IB’s focus on approaches to teaching and learning (ATL), the EE in a language of acquisition provides opportunities for students to develop their thinking, research and self-management skills while, at the same time, focusing on an aspect of language 
that is of particular personal interest and challenge.
Students must select one of the three distinct categories outlined below in order to develop a manageable 
research question for their EE. A simplified summary, with examples, is provided in the table below. For full details of requirements, teachers and students must refer to the Extended essay guide (first assessment 2018).
• Category 1 (“language”) offers the opportunity to engage with a particular linguistic aspect in greater detail.
• Category 2 (“culture and society”) allows the student to focus on one aspect of the target culture, linked to either a linguistic detail or a cultural artifact, and complements perfectly the learner profile for language acquisition, promoting reflection on the culture of the target language and the learner’s role in the linguistic community.
• Category 3 (“literature”) provides an opportunity for students to explore one or more works of literature in order to widen their understanding of the target language and culture from a literary angle.

3 Literature An analysis of a literary type, based on a specific work or works of literature. All works must originally have been written in the target language.How effective is the use of the first person narrator in the German novel Crazy  by Benjamin Lebert?
Language acquisition and international-mindedness
International-mindedness is central to the IB philosophy and instrumental in aspiring to a more peaceful world. Language acquisition courses do not have as their only goal the development of language skills, but also fostering intercultural understanding and global engagement. The nature of the language acquisition process supports international-mindedness and is, in turn, supported by it. The flexibility of IB course design allows language acquisition teachers to incorporate ideas and resources that encourage students to view 
aspects of the language and culture from different (and sometimes differing) perspectives, to make non-
judgmental comparisons of language and culture, and to view language and culture in a global context.
International-mindedness also provides opportunities for students to progress in the development of IB learner profile traits. Through exposure to, examination of, and reflection on, texts from cultures other than their own, students nurture their curiosity ( inquirers ), engage with issues and ideas of global 
significance ( knowledgeable ), use critical-thinking skills ( thinkers ) and listen carefully to the perspectives 
of other individuals and groups ( communicators ). They learn to show respect for the dignity and rights of 
people everywhere ( principled ), critically appreciate the values and traditions of others ( open-minded ), show 
empathy, compassion and respect ( caring ), recognize their interdependence with other people and the world 
in which they live ( balanced ), consider the world thoughtfully ( reflective ) and explore new ideas ( risk-takers ).
Engaging with sensitive topics
All language acquisition courses will provide the opportunity to engage with a broad range of texts, stimuli and scenarios that address topics of personal, local or national and global significance. Such work may well 
raise issues that challenge learners intellectually, personally and culturally. Engagement with these topics, 
whether intentional or incidental, can be opportunities for development of IB learner profile traits. Teachers should help learners to approach such materials in a sensitive, responsible and reflective manner, bearing in mind the IB’s mission and its commitment to international-mindedness and intercultural respect within the context of the course. Consideration should also be given to the personal and social values of others. As part of the collective consideration of the school, language acquisition students must be supported in maintaining an ethical perspective during their course. Schools must make every reasonable effort to encourage students to respond appropriately (without seeking to offend), to promote respect for their peers and to consider the environment in all their actions.Nature of the subject 
Language B guide 11In selecting texts and preparing materials and tasks for language acquisition courses, teachers are reminded 
to consider the cultural environment and the make-up of the student body, in order to act as role models in demonstrating an awareness of, and sensitivity to, deeply held personal and community values.
Prior learning
Students enter language acquisition courses with varying degrees of exposure to the target language(s). It is, therefore, important that students are placed into a course that is most suited to their language development needs and that will provide them with an appropriate academic challenge. For those students entering DP language acquisition from the Middle Years Programme (MYP), table 1 in the “Language acquisition across the IB continuum” section of the MYP Language acquisition guide  provides indications that 
can be useful for appropriate placement. 
Further placement guidance can be drawn from the study Benchmarking Selected IB Diploma Programme 
Language Courses to the Common European Framework of Reference for Languages . This study suggests that 
students already at CEFR A2 or B1 in the target language can comfortably take language B SL. Students already at CEFR B1 or B2 can comfortably take language B HL.
Links to the Middle Years Programme
The MYP is designed for students aged 11 to 16 and, as an integral part of the IB continuum, can directly lead into the DP . MYP language acquisition provides students with opportunities that prepare them for a DP language acquisition course through the following shared aims.
• Developing communication skills in an additional language
• Developing insights into the features, processes and craft of language, and the concept of culture, 
encouraging students to see that there are diverse ways of living, behaving and viewing the world
• Developing intercultural understanding and global engagement, leading to international-mindedness
• Providing opportunities for learning through inquiry and the development of critical- and creative-thinking skills
• Fostering curiosity and a desire for lifelong learning
• Understanding and respecting other languages and cultures
As with the DP , the MYP holistically addresses students’ intellectual, social, emotional and physical well-being, and provides students with opportunities to develop the knowledge, attitudes and skills they need in order to manage complex ideas and issues, and take responsible action for the future. The MYP requires the study of at least two languages to support students in understanding their own cultures and those of others. 
Additionally, the MYP helps to prepare students for further education, the workplace and lifelong learning. 
These courses also provide the opportunity to develop language skills and learn about  language through 
the conceptual understandings of communication, connections , creativity  and culture . The range of 
conceptual understandings, and factual and procedural knowledge that language acquisition students encounter throughout the MYP , can be directly transferred and developed in DP language acquisition courses, as can related concepts such as audience , purpose, meaning  and context .
Learning takes place within contexts relevant to the student, whether personal, local, national, international or globally significant. This approach—using a range of learning contexts in the MYP—is directly extended through the five prescribed themes of DP language acquisition courses: identities; experiences; human ingenuity; social organization; sharing the planet.Nature of the subject 
Language B guide 12Links to the IB Career-related Programme
The IB Career-related Programme (CP) is a framework of international education that incorporates the vision 
and educational principles of the IB into a unique programme specifically developed for students who wish to engage in career-related learning. The CP’s flexible educational framework allows schools to meet the needs, backgrounds and contexts of students, and is especially relevant for language acquisition.
The core of the CP enables students to enhance their personal and interpersonal development, with an 
emphasis on experiential learning. One of the components of the CP core is language development, which ensures that all CP students have access, and are exposed, to an additional language that will enable them to use the language they have studied, encourage intercultural awareness and gain personal fulfilment. Students are encouraged to begin or extend the study of an additional language that suits their needs, background and context. A minimum of 50 hours is expected to be devoted to language development. CP students must complete a language development portfolio to the satisfaction of the school.
One of the ways in which students can undertake language development in the CP is with an extension to 
their DP language acquisition course. This could be done through a school-designed language development course, through an external provider of language development or through monitored self-directed study. It is essential that the content of the provision of language development is an extension to the DP language acquisition coursework, if both are based on the same target language. The content and outcomes of the extension course may be tailored to the career-related studies of the students, if so desired.
The CP documents Language development guide , General regulations: Career-related Programme , and 
Language development teacher support material provide further guidance regarding language acquisition 
and language development. More information about the CP can be found on the CP website, which can be accessed through the programme resource centre.Language B guide 13Introduction

global significance.
2. Enable students to communicate in the language they have studied in a range of contexts and for a variety of purposes.
3. Encourage, through the study of texts and through social interaction, an awareness and appreciation of a variety of perspectives of people from diverse cultures.
4. Develop students’ understanding of the relationship between the languages and cultures with which they are familiar.
5. Develop students’ awareness of the importance of language in relation to other areas of knowledge.
6. Provide students, through language learning and the process of inquiry, with opportunities for intellectual engagement and the development of critical- and creative-thinking skills.
7. Provide students with a basis for further study, work and leisure through the use of an additional language.
8. Foster curiosity, creativity and a lifelong enjoyment of language learning.Language B guide 14Introduction
Assessment objectives
The following assessment objectives are common to both language B and language ab initio. The level 
of difficulty of the assessments, and the expectations of student performance on the tasks, are what distinguishes the three modern language acquisition courses.
1. Communicate clearly and effectively in a range of contexts and for a variety of purposes.
2. Understand and use language appropriate to a range of interpersonal and/or intercultural contexts 
and audiences.
3. Understand and use language to express and respond to a range of ideas with fluency and accuracy.
4. Identify, organize and present ideas on a range of topics.
5. Understand, analyse and reflect upon a range of written, audio, visual and audio-visual texts.Language B guide 15Introduction

Syllabus outline
Figure 2
In the language B course, students develop the ability to communicate in the target language through the 
study of language , themes  and texts . In doing so, they also develop conceptual understandings  of how 
language works. Communication is evidenced through receptive, productive and interactive skills across a 
range of contexts and purposes that are appropriate to the level of the course.
The study of language requires careful attention to forms, structures, functions and conceptual 
understandings of language. Knowledge of vocabulary and grammar—the what  of language—is reinforced 
and extended by understanding the why  and how  of language: audience, context, purpose, meaning.
Students expand the range of their communication skills by understanding and producing a wide variety of oral and written texts for audiences, contexts and purposes associated with academic and personal interests. For the development of receptive skills, language B students must study authentic texts that explore the culture(s) of the target language. In addition, the study of two literary works is required at HL.
A key aim of the language B course is to develop international-mindedness through the study of language, culture, and ideas and issues of global significance. Explicit links to TOK strengthen the ability to communicate in the target language by increasing students’ self-awareness as inquirers in their own language learning process. As appropriate to the level of the course, communication skills are reinforced through the other categories of approaches to learning skills: thinking, research, social and self-management skills.
The recommended teaching time is 240 hours to complete HL courses and 150 hours to complete SL courses, 
as stated in the document General regulations: Diploma Programme (2016: 6, article 8.2).Language B guide 18Syllabus
Syllabus content
Themes
Prescribed themes
Five prescribed themes are common to the syllabuses of language B and language ab initio; the themes 
provide relevant contexts for study at all levels of language acquisition in the DP , and opportunities for students to communicate about matters of personal, local or national, and global interest.
The five prescribed themes are:
• identities
• experiences
• human ingenuity
• social organization
• sharing the planet.
The themes allow students to compare the target language and culture(s) to other languages and cultures 
with which they are familiar. The themes also provide opportunities for students to make connections to other disciplinary areas in the DP . Students and teachers of language B with experience of the Primary Years Programme (PYP) or the MYP will recognize that the themes are inspired by the transdisciplinary themes of the PYP and the global contexts of the MYP . In this way, the DP language B course can enhance the continuity of the educational experience of long-standing IB students, while also being suitable for students who are new to the IB.
Recommended topics
The five prescribed themes must all be addressed equally in the language B course; beyond that, teachers are free to work with the themes in a way that best helps them to organize a course plan and build upon students’ interests in the target language and its cultures, and that best helps students to meet the expectations of the syllabus with regard to language and texts.
The following lists of recommended topics for each theme are appropriate for students to achieve the 
aims and objectives of the course. The recommended topics are to be considered indicative content , not 
prescribed content, for the language B course. The themes are prescribed, but the recommended topics and possible questions for each theme are not prescribed.Syllabus content

Texts
In theory, a text is anything from which information can be extracted, including the wide range of oral, written and visual materials present in society. For example:
• single and multiple images, with or without written text
• non-literary and literary written texts and extracts
• broadcast media texts: films, radio and television programmes, and their scripts
• oral texts: presentations, debates, interviews, speeches, recorded conversations, and their transcripts
• electronic texts that share aspects of the above areas: text messaging, web pages and blogs, social 
media and video-sharing websites.Syllabus content  
Language B guide 21For the purposes of teaching and learning in a language acquisition course, the language B and language 
ab initio syllabuses organize written, visual, audio and audio-visual texts into three broad categories: personal , professional  and mass media texts . The guiding principle for using texts in the DP language 
acquisition courses is to develop students’ receptive, productive and interactive skills in the target language by focusing their attention on the ways in which good communicators consider the audience, context and 
purpose of what they want to say or write in the process of choosing and developing an appropriate text 
type to convey a message.
Teachers should provide frequent opportunities for students to understand and use a variety of text types 
in relation to the prescribed themes and related course content. The categories are described below, and the table that follows provides examples of text types for each category. The examples shown are neither prescriptive nor exhaustive.
Personal texts
Personal texts are shared by the person creating the message and an audience who may be family members, friends or groups with a common interest; a personal text may also be directed to oneself. Personal texts tend to be characterized by attention to the everyday interests or the affective needs of individuals rather than the analysis of information. Personal texts have a variety of functions including, but not limited to, describing, narrating, entertaining, recommending and persuading. The level of formality in the register of 
these texts will vary according to the linguistic and sociocultural norms of the target language.
Professional texts
Professional texts are created for an intended audience in contexts where no personal relationship is 
assumed between the producer of the text and the recipient(s); however, the producer of the text can assume that the recipient(s) will have an interest in receiving and understanding the message. Professional texts tend to be characterized by attention to the cognitive needs of individuals, the transfer of knowledge and the logical presentation of information; these texts employ clear, factual language and a formal register. 
Professional texts have a variety of functions including, but not limited to, informing, instructing, explaining, 
analysing, convincing, interpreting and evaluating.
Mass media texts
Mass media texts are created for distribution to a large audience that is targeted because of an interest that, at least initially, lies primarily with the producer of the text, since the person or entity responsible for a mass media text has no way of knowing exactly who will take the time and interest to understand the message or who will ignore it. Mass media texts tend to be characterized by the need of the producer of the text to project authority, desirability or exclusivity, and the conscious choice of a particular medium or technology 
that is appropriate to reach the targeted audience. The level of formality in the register of these texts will 
vary according to the linguistic and sociocultural norms of the target language.Syllabus content

* Teachers are reminded that the study of at least two literary texts (originally written in the target language) 
is compulsory for language B at HL, and that one of the literary texts studied during the course must serve 
as the stimulus for the individual oral assessment at HL.
Literature
Reading literature in the target language can be an enjoyable journey into cultures where the target language is spoken. Literature can exemplify one or more of the prescribed themes of the language B course, and can help students to broaden their vocabulary and use language to express opinions and explore ideas. Reading literature helps students to develop fluent reading skills as they progress from comprehension to interpretation and inference. Literature is also an especially appropriate vehicle for 
promoting the development of international-mindedness, which is a key aim of the DP language acquisition 
courses.
The use of literary works to develop students’ receptive and productive skills is encouraged at all levels of 
language acquisition in the DP; however, in terms of formal requirements of the syllabus and assessment outline, the study of two literary works originally written in the target language is a requirement at 
HL in language  B. HL students are expected to understand fundamental elements of the literary works 
studied, such as themes, plot and characters. It must be emphasized that literary criticism is not an objective Syllabus content  
Language B guide 23of the language B course; literary criticism lies within the remit of the DP studies in language and literature 
courses. In language acquisition courses, specifically language B HL, literature is intended as a stimulus for ideas to be explored, principally through oral assessment.
The term “literary works” refers to works of prose fiction, prose non-fiction, poetry and drama. When 
choosing literary works, teachers should consider carefully how to use literature in relation to one or more of the prescribed themes, and they should also bear in mind the interests and general language proficiency of their students. The term “literary text” refers to an extract from a complete literary work, for example, a scene from a play, several paragraphs from a novel or a single poem from a larger collection.
As with any resources used in the classroom, literary works should be chosen in order to allow students to 
achieve the aims and objectives of the course, be culturally relevant to the target language and linguistically accessible for language acquisition students. Literary works that feature a high degree of linguistic complexity, arcane language or an enigmatic subject matter are not appropriate in the DP language acquisition classroom context. Works in translation or “easy reader” versions of literary texts are not helpful for students to achieve the aims and objectives of the course and must be avoided.
Conceptual understanding
Concerning the importance of “significant content” that allows students to develop both disciplinary and interdisciplinary understandings, the document What is an IB education? states that “Each of the four IB programmes provides a detailed and developmentally appropriate curriculum or curriculum framework that is broad, balanced, conceptual and connected.” The explicit integration of conceptual understanding into the curriculum focuses on “powerful organizing ideas that are relevant across subject areas” (2013, 
updated June 2015, May 2017: 5).
All DP language programme subject groups promote a vision of learning in which the development of 
language skills and conceptual understandings of language are complementary to each other, so that the total learning experience of the student is as robust as possible. Thus, DP students become more accomplished communicators in the languages they study when their abilities to read, write and speak about course content are reinforced and extended by an understanding of why  and how  people use language to communicate.
In particular, the approach to developing conceptual understandings of language in the DP languages 
programme is designed using the following guiding principles.
• DP students with experience of the PYP or the MYP are provided with frequent opportunities to 
develop further their conceptual understandings of language (PYP) or their understanding of the key and related concepts in the MYP language and literature and language acquisition courses.
• DP students are encouraged to apply what they already know about other languages and cultures—
through formal study or personal experience—in order to enhance their overall learning process.
• DP students are encouraged to consider broad questions about language and culture, as appropriate 
to their course of study, in order to develop international-mindedness and increase their self-awareness as inquirers in their own learning process.
Conceptual understanding in language acquisition courses
For language acquisition courses, it is important to note that the approach presented here for developing conceptual understanding recognizes that DP students are not beginning students, even when they are beginning learners of a language or do not demonstrate a high level of language proficiency. At all levels of language acquisition, therefore, DP students are encouraged to make use of the thinking, communication and research skills they have developed over years of experience in school, and to transfer those skills to 
the target language at the pace—and within the contexts and for the purposes—that their language skills 
development will allow.Syllabus content  
Language B guide 24Certain conceptual understandings of language are fundamental to successful communication and should 
be developed in all DP language acquisition courses. Following the description of each are some stimulus questions that may encourage exploration of these conceptual understandings while calling attention to language skills. Teachers should feel free to use or adapt these questions—or create their own questions—for use in class so that they are comprehensible to students and relevant to course content. It is important 
to note that these are not questions for examination papers ; rather, they are included in the syllabus as 
a tool for teachers to use in order to encourage students to think about  language and culture as part of their 
language study in the DP and, in doing so, to become more effective and knowledgeable communicators.
• Audience:  Students understand that language should be appropriate for the person(s) with whom 
one is communicating.
Stimulus questions
 – How can the perceived needs and interests, or previous knowledge, of the recipients of a text 
influence its production?
 – How would the language used in a given text need to change if the same basic message needed to be communicated to a different audience?
• Context:  Students understand that language should be appropriate to the situation in which one is 
communicating.
Stimulus questions
 – How does the situation or setting influence the production or reception of a text?
 – How is the relationship between the producer and the recipient(s) of a text (or the relationship of 
interlocutors in a conversation) reflected in language use?
• Purpose:  Students understand that language should be appropriate to achieve a desired intention, 
goal or result when communicating.
Stimulus questions
 – When I read or listen to a text, what helps me to understand the intention of the person who 
produced the text?
 – When I need to communicate for a specific reason, how do I plan my message and language use in order to achieve my goal?
• Meaning:  Students understand that language is used in a range of ways to communicate a message.
Stimulus questions
 – How are literal and figurative (non-literal) language used by producers of texts to create desired effects?
 – What does the producer of a text do to make the message clear (or, on the contrary, to make it ambiguous) when there is no opportunity for the recipient(s) to reply to the text?
• Variation:  Students understand that differences exist within a given language, and that speakers of a 
given language are generally able to understand each other.
Stimulus questions
 – How or why does a language change over time, across geographical boundaries or from one 
social or cultural group to another?
 – What does it mean to say that aspects of a text are “lost in translation” from one language to 
another?Syllabus content  
Language B guide 25Principles of course design
The IB recognizes that, owing to differences in language teaching traditions, it might be easier for the 
teachers of particular languages to find textbooks to suit their specific language. However, should appropriate textbooks not be available, the syllabus has been designed to allow teachers the freedom to construct their own course of study and schemes of work based on a range of texts linked to one or more of the prescribed themes in the syllabus. Teachers must use authentic materials as much as possible in the 
classroom, as this is necessary in order for students to meet the expectations of the course. This includes 
exposing students to the full range of varieties of the target language, both in written and spoken form, so that students become familiar with different accents as well as significant differences in vocabulary and structures. Such language experiences will encourage students to become open-minded, reflective communicators with a heightened sense of international-mindedness.
In designing a language B course of study, teachers should pay particular attention to three important 
principles: variety , integration  and transparency .
Variety
Teachers should ensure that their students:
• develop their receptive, productive and interactive skills in the target language through a wide range 
of individual, pair and group activities in class
• practise the target language through a wide range of individual, pair and group tasks
• are introduced to the full range of text types appropriate to the level of the course
• are exposed to a range of regional and national accents.
Integration
In order to integrate all the relevant aspects of the course and to encourage autonomy, it is necessary for teachers to help their students develop strategies for dealing with unfamiliar situations and unfamiliar language. To achieve this, teachers should provide:
• an environment that promotes the use of the target language in the classroom and prepares the 
students to communicate in a variety of contexts and for a variety of purposes that are appropriate to 
the level of the course
• authentic and modified authentic materials for study that have originally been produced for everyday 
users of the target language.
Teachers should also ensure that their course provides opportunities for students to:
• move easily from one language skill to another (for example, a discussion after reading a text)
• interact in the target language through active participation in oral exchanges, by both listening and 
speaking, or responding to a text, either in writing or orally
• consider and explore links with other disciplinary areas in the DP and with the TOK course
• reinforce their communication skills by using the other categories of approaches to learning skills: thinking, research, social and self-management skills
• be involved in the selection of materials to be studied.Syllabus content  
Language B guide 26Teachers are reminded that no single part of the syllabus—language, themes, texts, conceptual 
understandings—is an end in itself, but that all parts should complement each other and must be integrated in the course design. The ability of students to communicate in the target language should be developed through the study of materials that reflect the culture(s) concerned. This consideration also applies to the selection of literary works for language B HL.
Transparency
Teachers must ensure that their students are given clear information about the aims and objectives, the syllabus requirements and the assessment criteria for the course. Students should be made aware of what is expected of them regarding classwork and homework, as well as receiving regular feedback on their progress throughout the course.Language B guide 27Assessment
Assessment in the Diploma Programme
General
Assessment is an integral part of teaching and learning. The most important aims of assessment in the DP 
are that it should support curricular goals and encourage appropriate student learning. Both external and internal assessments are used in the DP . IB examiners mark work produced for external assessment, while work produced for internal assessment is marked by teachers and externally moderated by the IB.
There are two types of assessment identified by the IB.
• An integral component of ATL, formative assessment informs both teaching and learning. It is 
concerned with providing accurate and helpful feedback to students and teachers on the kind of learning taking place and the nature of students’ strengths and weaknesses in order to help develop students’ understanding and capabilities. Formative assessment can also help to improve teaching quality, as it can provide information to monitor progress towards meeting the course aims and objectives.
• Summative assessment gives an overview of previous learning and is concerned with measuring student achievement.
The DP primarily focuses on summative assessment designed to record student achievement at, or towards, the end of the course of study. However, many of the assessment instruments can, and should, also be used formatively during the course of teaching and learning. A comprehensive assessment plan is viewed 
as being integral with teaching, learning and course organization. For further information, see the IB 
Programme standards and practices document.
The approach to assessment used by the IB is criterion-related, not norm-referenced. This approach to 
assessment judges students’ work by their performance in relation to identified levels of attainment, and not in relation to the work of other students. For further information on assessment within the DP , please refer to the publication Diploma Programme assessment: Principles and practice .
To support teachers in the planning, delivery and assessment of the DP courses, a variety of resources can 
be found on the programme resource centre. Additional publications, such as specimen papers and the 
corresponding markschemes, teacher support materials, subject reports and grade descriptors, can also be found on the programme resource centre. Past examination papers and the corresponding markschemes are made available for purchase through the IB store.
Methods of assessment
The IB uses the following methods to assess work produced by students.
Assessment criteria
Assessment criteria are used when the assessment task is open-ended. Each criterion concentrates on a particular skill that students are expected to demonstrate. An assessment objective describes what students should be able to do, and assessment criteria describe how well they should be able to do it. Using assessment criteria allows discrimination between different answers and encourages a variety of responses. Assessment in the Diploma Programme 
Language B guide 28Each criterion comprises a set of hierarchically ordered level descriptors. Each level descriptor is worth one 
or more marks. Each criterion is applied independently using a best-fit model. The maximum marks for each criterion may differ according to the criterion’s importance. The marks awarded for each criterion are added together to give the total mark for the piece of work.
Markbands
Markbands are a comprehensive statement of expected performance against which responses are judged. They represent a single holistic criterion divided into level descriptors. Each level descriptor corresponds to a range of marks to differentiate student performance. A best-fit approach is used to ascertain which particular mark to use from the possible range for each level descriptor.
Analytic markschemes
Analytic markschemes are prepared for those examination questions that expect a particular kind of response and/or a given final answer from students. They give detailed instructions to examiners on how to break down the total mark for each question for different parts of the response.
Marking notes
For some assessment components marked using assessment criteria, marking notes are provided. Marking notes give guidance on how to apply assessment criteria to the particular requirements of a question.
Inclusive assessment arrangements
Inclusive assessment arrangements are available for candidates with assessment access requirements. These arrangements enable candidates with diverse needs to access the examinations and demonstrate their knowledge and understanding of the constructs being assessed.
The IB document Candidates with assessment access requirements provides details on all the inclusive 
assessment arrangements available to candidates with learning support requirements. The IB document 
Learning diversity and inclusion in IB programmes outlines the position of the IB with regard to candidates with diverse learning needs in the IB programmes. For candidates affected by adverse circumstances, the IB documents General regulations: Diploma Programme  and Diploma Programme Assessment procedures  
provide details on access considerations.
Responsibilities of the school
Schools must ensure that equal access arrangements and reasonable adjustments are provided to candidates with learning support requirements, in line with the IB documents Candidates with assessment access requirements and Learning diversity and inclusion in IB programmes .
The documents Meeting student learning diversity in the classroom and The IB guide to inclusive education: a resource for whole school development  are available to support schools in the ongoing process of increasing 
access and engagement by removing barriers to learning.Language B guide 29Assessment

This examination is externally set and externally assessed. It consists of a choice from three tasks with a 
variety of audiences, contexts and purposes. Each task is based on a different theme from the syllabus. Students write a response of 250–400 words to one of the tasks, choosing a text type from among those listed in the examination instructions.
The aim of this component is to assess the ability to communicate in writing for a variety of purposes. In 
order to fulfill the requirements of this assessment component, students need to show, through their use of text type, register and style, that they understand the concepts of audience, context, purpose, meaning and variation, and can apply them to their written language.

• communicate clearly and effectively in a range of contexts and for a variety of purposes
• understand and use language appropriate to a range of interpersonal and/or intercultural contexts 
and audiencesExternal assessment  
Language B guide 32• understand and use language to express and respond to a range of ideas with fluency and accuracy
• identify, organize and present ideas on a range of topics.
Students’ factual knowledge of topics within the themes will not be tested; however, it can be used to 
support any ideas that the student wishes to communicate.
Paper 2: Receptive skills—listening and reading
Duration: 1 hour 45 minutes
Weighting: 50%Paper 2 is based on the five themes: identities, experiences, human ingenuity, social organization, sharing the planet.
This examination is externally set and externally assessed. It is divided into two separate sections: listening 
(three audio passages) and reading (three written passages) covering different topics drawn from the five themes. The students’ understanding of the six passages is assessed in this examination; it does not test the students’ knowledge of any factual content of a specific topic. All audio and written passages are in the target language and all answers must be provided in the target language.
Note:  International-mindedness is central to the IB philosophy. It is expected that students will 
have been exposed to a variety of texts, both oral and written, that demonstrate linguistic variation and regional accents. Linguistic variation and regional accents appearing in texts used for external assessment are intended to reflect this expectation while also being comprehensible to the students.

• To what extent does the accuracy of the language contribute to effective communication?
Marks Level descriptor
0 The work does not reach a standard described by the descriptors below.
1–3 Command of the language is limited.
Vocabulary is sometimes appropriate to the task.
Basic grammatical structures are used.
Language contains errors in basic structures. Errors interfere with communication.
4–6 Command of the language is partially effective.Vocabulary is appropriate to the task.Some basic grammatical structures are used, with some attempts to use more complex 
structures.
Language is mostly accurate for basic structures, but errors occur in more complex 
structures. Errors at times interfere with communication.
7–9 Command of the language is effective and mostly accurate.
Vocabulary is appropriate to the task, and varied.
A variety of basic and more complex grammatical structures is used.
Language is mostly accurate. Occasional errors in basic and in complex grammatical 
structures do not interfere with communication.
10 –12 Command of the language is mostly accurate and very effective.
Vocabulary is appropriate to the task, and varied, including the use of idiomatic 
expressions.
A variety of basic and more complex grammatical structures is used effectively.Language is mostly accurate. Minor errors in more complex grammatical structures do not 
interfere with communication.

difficult to determine.
4–6 The task is generally fulfilled.
Some ideas are relevant to the task.Ideas are outlined, but are not fully developed.Ideas are generally clearly presented and the response is generally structured in a logical 
manner, leading to a mostly successful delivery of the message.
