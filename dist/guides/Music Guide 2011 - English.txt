Introduction

The Diploma Programme

The Diploma Programme is a rigorous pre-university course of study designed for students in the 16 to 19
age range. It is a broad-based two-year course that aims to encourage students to be knowledgeable and
inquiring, but also caring and compassionate. There is a strong emphasis on encouraging students to
develop intercultural understanding, open-mindedness, and the attitudes necessary for them to respect
and evaluate a range of points of view.

The Diploma Programme hexagon
The course is presented as six academic areas enclosing a central core. It encourages the concurrent
study of a broad range of academic areas. Students study: two modern languages (or a modern language
and a classical language); a humanities or social science subject; an experimental science; mathematics;
one of the creative arts. It is this comprehensive range of subjects that makes the Diploma Programme a
demanding course of study designed to prepare students effectively for university entrance. In each of the
academic areas students have flexibility in making their choices, which means they can choose subjects that
particularly interest them and that they may wish to study further at university.

Music guide

The Diploma Programme

Choosing the right combination
Students are required to choose one subject from each of the six academic areas, although they can choose
a second subject from groups 1 to 5 instead of a group 6 subject. Normally, three subjects (and not more
than four) are taken at higher level (HL), and the others are taken at standard level (SL). The IB recommends
240 teaching hours for HL subjects and 150 hours for SL. Subjects at HL are studied in greater depth and
breadth than at SL.
At both levels, many skills are developed, especially those of critical thinking and analysis. At the end of
the course, students’ abilities are measured by means of external assessment. Many subjects contain some
element of coursework assessed by teachers. The course is available for examinations in English, French and
Spanish.

The core of the hexagon
All Diploma Programme students participate in the three course requirements that make up the core of
the hexagon. Reflection on all these activities is a principle that lies at the heart of the thinking behind the
Diploma Programme.
The theory of knowledge course encourages students to think about the nature of knowledge, to reflect
on the process of learning in all the subjects they study as part of their Diploma Programme course, and
to make connections across the academic areas. The extended essay, a substantial piece of writing of up to
4,000 words, enables students to investigate a topic of special interest that they have chosen themselves.
It also encourages them to develop the skills of independent research that will be expected at university.
Creativity, action, service involves students in experiential learning through a range of artistic, sporting,
physical and service activities.

The IB mission statement and the IB learner profile
The Diploma Programme aims to develop in students the knowledge, skills and attitudes they will need
to fulfill the aims of the IB, as expressed in the organization’s mission statement and the learner profile.
Teaching and learning in the Diploma Programme represent the reality in daily practice of the organization’s
educational philosophy.

Introduction

Nature of the subject

Music functions as a means of personal and communal identity and expression, and embodies the social
and cultural values of individuals and communities. This scenario invites exciting exploration and sensitive
study.
Music, and all of its associations, may vary considerably from one musical culture to another: yet music may
share similarities. Such richness offers a variety of ways to encounter and engage with a constantly changing
world.
A vibrant musical education fosters curiosity and openness to both familiar and unfamiliar musical worlds.
Through such a study of music we learn to hear relationships of pitch in sound, pattern in rhythm and
unfolding sonic structures. Through participating in the study of music we are able to explore the similarities,
differences and links in music from within our own culture and that of others across time. Informed and active
musical engagement allows us to explore and discover relationships between lived human experience and
specific sound combinations and technologies, thus informing us more fully of the world around us, and the
nature of humanity.
The Diploma Programme music course provides an appropriate foundation for further study in music at
university level or in music career pathways. It also provides an enriching and valuable course of study
for students who may pursue other careers. This course also provides all students with the opportunity to
engage in the world of music as lifelong participants.

Distinction between SL and HL
Both standard level (SL) and higher level (HL) music students are required to study musical perception. All
students therefore submit a musical links investigation and also respond to a listening examination paper.
In the latter, HL students are required to answer one further question. This question requires students to
investigate significant musical links through a comparative analysis of two pieces of music prescribed by the
IB.
SL students in music are required to choose one of three options:
•

SL creating (SLC)

•

SL solo performing (SLS)

•

SL group performing (SLG).

HL students are required to present both creating and solo performing.
This is a significant difference in expectation. By pursuing both creating and performing, this enables HL
students to bring to their musical studies a wider perspective. It also allows them to pursue some work
in more depth. The study of three components in an integrated way allows HL students to make not only
more connections but, potentially, these connections may carry more importance and have more influence
during their musical studies. This path of study allows HL students the opportunity to engage in music in a
more complete way.

4

Music guide

Nature of the subject

For creating, SLC students are required to present two pieces of coursework, while HL students present
three. This allows HL students to present work that either demonstrates contrasts in content, nature and
intention or comes from a wider, and therefore more challenging, choice of creating options.
For solo performing, SLS students are required to present 15 minutes, while HL students present 20
minutes. This challenges HL students to present a performing programme that features more music of a
contrasting nature.
For those students (SLG) presenting group performing, the requirement is 20–30 minutes.

Prior learning
The Diploma Programme music course is designed to offer students the opportunity to build on prior
experience in music while encouraging a broad approach to the subject and developing new skills,
techniques and ideas.
While prior music experience is not mandatory at SL, it is recommended. At HL it is very strongly
recommended.

Links to the Middle Years Programme
Those students who have completed the IB Middle Years Programme (MYP) will already have engaged
in a structured learning process in the performing and visual arts. MYP students will have developed an
inquiring, reflective approach to their work as well as an understanding of the role of the arts in society, in
the world and in their own lives. This will allow them to develop further their experiences, skills, knowledge
and conceptual understanding in music at Diploma Programme level. Reflection pursued in a sense of
inquiry; evaluation; artistic self-expression; collaboration; and communication are all intrinsic to the beliefs
and values that inspire IB arts courses.

Music and theory of knowledge
Students of group 6 subjects study the various artistic ways through which knowledge, skills and attitudes
from different cultural traditions are developed and transmitted. These subjects, known collectively as “the
arts” allow students to investigate and reflect on the complexities of the human condition. By exploring a
range of materials and technologies, students should aim to develop an understanding of the technical,
creative, expressive and communicative aspects of the arts.
Students of group 6 subjects analyse knowledge from various perspectives, and they acquire this knowledge
through experiential means as well as more traditional academic methods. The nature of the arts is such that
an exploration of the areas of knowledge in general, and knowledge of the different art forms specifically,
can combine to help us understand ourselves, our patterns of behaviour and our relationship to each other
and our wider environment.
Group 6 subjects complement the theory of knowledge (TOK) ethos by revealing interdisciplinary
connections and allowing students to explore the strengths and limitations of individual and cultural
perspectives. Studying the arts requires students to reflect on and question their own bases of knowledge.
In addition, by exploring other Diploma Programme subjects in an artistic fashion, students can gain
an understanding of the interdependent nature of knowledge and are encouraged to become “active,
compassionate and lifelong learners who understand that other people, with their differences, can also be
right” (IB mission statement).

Nature of the subject

Whether music be personal or communal expression, recreation, ritual, entertainment or commercial
enterprise, it shares the educational concerns of TOK. Teachers are encouraged to refer to the Theory of
knowledge guide for further guidance and information.
Questions related to TOK activities that a music student might consider include the following.
•

Why are the arts important?

•

What do the subjects that make up the arts have in common?

•

What are the roles of emotion and reason in the arts?

•

To what extent do the other Diploma Programme subjects have “artistic” qualities?

•

What are the standards by which we judge art? Can we justify these standards and, if so, how?

•

What moral responsibilities does the artist have? Are they different from those of any other “knower”?

•

It has been said that there is a difference between the condition of humans and the human condition,
and that the sciences can tell us about the former, but we need the arts to tell us about the latter.
Would you agree?

•

What is the function of music? Is this the same throughout the world, time and place?

•

To what extent does music reflect the values, beliefs and attitudes of the time and place in which it is
made?

•

To what extent can the music of one culture be understood by others?

•

To what extent does the work of the musician influence an existing culture? To what extent does an
existing culture influence a musician working within it?

•

What makes an artistic piece “great”? Does this vary within and across time and culture?

•

Can it be said that one musical scale is more natural than another?

•

To what extent does the knowledge gained in a musical performance differ from other types of
knowledge?

•

Is the composer’s intention important to the listener? To what extent would this affect the
performance?

•

How can music evoke an emotional response from the listener? Is this a way of knowing?

•

Why has some music been feared by the political establishment?

Approaches to the teaching of music

Teachers should discuss all sections of this guide with the students throughout the music course. Although
the subject content is divided into two compulsory parts at SL and three at HL, these are integral to one
another. The recommended hours for each section should therefore be interpreted with sufficient flexibility
to allow integration of the various parts throughout the course of study.
While the syllabus sets out specific, formal requirements of study, the flexibility of the music course allows
for a variety of approaches and teaching styles. However, it is important that students become responsible
for their own learning through an active approach. The interaction between students and their music
teachers is therefore a crucial one. Teachers need to engage their students through instruction and activities
that challenge and develop understanding, while all the time encouraging students to make creative
connections in their work.
Throughout the course students should be encouraged to engage with music that is familiar and unfamiliar
to them, from a range of times, places and cultures. During their study of the various parts of the course
students need to be supported in developing their understanding of music as a whole. Students will need
substantially more guidance on the content of the course during the early stages. However, throughout the
teaching of the course they should be encouraged to develop critical thinking and participate in inquirybased learning. Students should work both individually and collaboratively, working towards informed
engagement. It is important that both teachers and students refer to the IB learner profile.
A varied range of activities should be introduced to encourage students to:
•

engage with music from different times, places and cultures

•

critically appraise music and use appropriate musical terminology

•

develop techniques for comparative analysis

•

develop investigative and thinking skills

•

learn to create music

•

learn to perform music

•

work both independently and collaboratively

•

develop reflection techniques for monitoring their work over time.

Teachers support students throughout their studies, offering expertise and guidance on the preparation of
submissions. Teachers may enable interconnections, as in the following example.
•

A student presents a “working” performance of a short piece.

•

The students engage in assessing the performance.

•

The performer analyses a section of the piece and presents this to the group.

•

Students find a piece which is unfamiliar to them that uses a similar musical device to the one
performed.

•

Students (individually or collaboratively) create a short section of music using this particular musical
device, then perform and discuss it.

•

Students make a list of significant musical connections between the familiar and unfamiliar pieces.

•

Students listen to a similar extract and build an answer in the format of a formal response suitable for
the listening paper.

Music guide

11

Approaches to the teaching of music

All teachers of the music course are strongly encouraged to access the online curriculum centre (OCC) at
http://occ.ibo.org on a regular basis. The OCC is a forum by which all teachers may post inquiries, present
examples of good practice, ask for general advice and access exemplar materials. The content of the Diploma
Programme music forum on the OCC is created by teachers of music for teachers of music. The forum also
includes updates on resources and frequently asked questions.
In addition to the OCC, the music course is supported by teacher support material and workshops.

Health and safety guidelines
All schools are required to follow health and safety guidelines during their music making, as appropriate.
Each school should recognize and accept its responsibilities and obligations as an institution offering music
to provide a safe and healthy working environment, and is ultimately responsible for the health and safety
of students and staff in all music work.

12

Music guide

Syllabus

Syllabus content

Musical perception—SL and HL
This part of the syllabus forms an essential part of SL and HL courses and is compulsory for all students.

Study, analysis and examination, comparing and contrasting of
musical cultures
Students should actively listen to a wide range of music from different:
•

parts of the world

•

musical cultures

•

time periods.

Through this study, students develop their aural perception and understanding of music by learning about:
•

musical elements, including form and structure

•

notations

•

musical terminology

•

context.

Students should endeavour to make connections between the music they engage with and study. They
should also seek, where possible, to establish significant musical links between the works they study.
Musical elements include duration, pitch, tonality, timbre/tone colour, texture, dynamics, form and structure.
Form and structure include consideration of the overall shape and the parts therein. Articulation and other
expressive and production techniques might also be discussed.
Notations may be from a range of musical cultures. Context includes cultural, historical and stylistic aspects
of the music.
Students should develop the use of appropriate musical terminology when addressing the musical elements
(including form and structure) and context.
Students should learn to provide the precise location of their musical evidence (for example, by citing bar
numbers and stating instrument/voice).
Where a musical work includes text it should be considered in relation to the music.
Teachers must refer to the assessment details and assessment criteria, and to the specimen listening paper,
for further guidance on the number of examples and depth of study. Teachers must also refer to the “Glossary
of command terms” at the end of this guide. Teachers should also refer to the published examination papers,
scores, compact discs (CDs) and markschemes for the listening paper.

Music guide

13

Syllabus content

Study of two prescribed works
An important part of musical perception is the study of the prescribed work(s). Two pieces of music are
studied at HL. A choice of one of the two prescribed works is studied at SL. These pieces represent key
features from two different times, places and/or musical cultures. All students are required to analyse and
examine the prescribed work(s). HL students are further required to investigate significant musical links by
comparing and/or contrasting the two prescribed works.
In the case of a prescribed work in which the prescribed movement/section is from a larger work, this should
be presented by the teacher within the context of the whole work. However, the examination question(s)
will be on the specific movement/section. Teachers are encouraged to explore with their students different
recordings of the same work.
Details of the two works, prescribed for two consecutive years’ examinations, are published in the Handbook
of procedures for the Diploma Programme, which is updated annually.

Investigating musical links
Through the study of pieces from different musical cultures students are encouraged to explore, analyse
and examine the musical connections existing between two (or more) pieces of music from two distinct
musical cultures*. Through investigative study and analysis of the similarities and differences between the
selected pieces of music, students learn to demonstrate significant musical links.
When investigating musical links students will need to develop depth of argument in demonstrating the
links that exist. For instance, the mere citation of similar instrumentation in two (or more) pieces of music is
not sufficient. While establishing convincing musical links, students must also learn to take into consideration
how these instruments are used (for example, melodically, harmonically, structurally, rhythmically) in order
to present arguments of more depth. Similarly, during an investigation of the link between the opera Madam
Butterfly (Puccini) and the musical Miss Saigon (Claude-Michel Schönberg), a mere citation of similarities in
the plot does not satisfy the requirements. The links must be musical (that is to say, based on musical
elements, not instruments/voices or functions of music). Examples of inappropriate links include “both are
dance music”, “both use religious texts”. Students would be better advised to develop depth of argument
by, for example, comparing the use of predominantly small intervals within an octave range and repetitious
phrases in the two lullabies “Wiegenlied” (Brahms) and “Bånsull” (Norwegian).
Students need also to be aware that language describing an instrument, for example, is not the technical
language required in the music course (that is, terminology that explains music and its processes).
While students must use primary sources, and are strongly encouraged to support their work by also using
secondary sources, the vast majority of their investigation should be their own work and ideas and not a
summary of other sources.

14

Music guide

Syllabus content

For the purposes of investigating musical links the definition of a distinct musical culture is as follows.
*Musical culture refers to a learned way of making and using music, which is shared by a group of
people, and is usually passed down from generation to generation. Music plays different roles within
a culture (for example, entertainment, ceremony, work).
A single musical culture may spread widely across time and place, and many creative changes can be
found within a single musical culture while maintaining its essence (this is known as musical style).
For example, the difference between ska and reggae is a creative change within a single musical
culture (music of the Caribbean), hence two musical styles within a single musical culture. Similarly
swing and be-bop styles (jazz) are part of a single distinct musical culture, as are renaissance and
romantic (western art/classical music).
Musical culture is not necessarily defined by time or by geography. Palestrina from the 16th century
and Schoenberg from the 20th century, Villa-Lobos from Brazil and Penderecki from Poland are all
composers of western art/classical music, and therefore part of the same musical culture.
The same geographical region does not necessarily imply the same musical culture. For example,
western-style pop music created in Japan and kabuki music, also from Japan, are not part of the
same musical culture.
On the other hand, musical style refers to particular characteristic musical features such as melodic
structure, form, improvisation, harmony, articulation, duration, which are common to a set of musical
pieces.

Creating—SLC, HL
During this study students should aim to develop creative skills through exploration, control and
development of musical elements. Creativity demands self-discipline and focus on the part of students as
they shape and assemble the musical elements to express a particular mood, character or other intended
meaning.
SLC students are required to submit two pieces of coursework; HL students must submit three.
The following options are available:
•

composing

•

music technology composing

•

arranging

•

improvising

•

stylistic techniques.

For further details on selecting combinations, please refer to the “Creating options” table.

If students choose two (at SL) or three (at HL) music compositions and/or music technology compositions as
an option, teachers are encouraged to support their students in demonstrating contrasts in content, nature
and intention.
The number and types of exercises involved (for example, “sketches” or finished pieces) are not prescribed;
the course of study devised by teachers should enable students to develop their knowledge and skills in
creating. However, students will be assessed on their final submissions. Students and teachers are also
reminded that the final assessment is of the individual student’s own work.
Students choosing composing and arranging are strongly encouraged to present live performances of their
pieces. However, where this is not possible an electronically generated recording is acceptable. (Recordings
of coursework in composing, music technology composing, arranging and improvising must be submitted—
the only exception is work in stylistic techniques. Nevertheless students are strongly encouraged to try out
their work in stylistic techniques.)
Ideas, sources, working drafts and commentary on the nature and the process of creating should be kept
in students’ notebooks or files. These materials will be used to develop each student’s written reflective
statements, which is a required part of the assessment at the end of the course. (These materials must not
be submitted; teachers and examiners will not look at student notebooks or files when marking the final
submission.)
The work must be supervised by the teacher to ensure that it is the authentic work of the student.

Composing
Composing is the creating of music through the manipulation of musical elements. It can begin from
imitating other music, or from improvising. Students can choose to compose in many different ways: each

16

Music guide

Syllabus content

music composition can be purely functional, purely traditional, purely abstract, a combination of these, or
designed to fulfill any other expressive purpose.
Students may choose sounds from a wide range of media, including traditional instruments, voices and/or
electronically or computer-generated sounds. Students must demonstrate understanding of the technical
capabilities (and limitations) of chosen instruments. Students who compose for voices and traditional
instruments must demonstrate understanding of vocal and instrumental ranges, transpositions and other
characteristics.
Each music composition must be completed with notation. This may be handwritten or notated using a
suitable computer software program.
Students must submit the final notated version of each music composition and a recording.
SL students may submit one or two music compositions; HL students may submit one, two or three. (Please
refer to the “Creating options” table.)
A music composition must be 3–6 minutes in length.
In addition to the music composition, students are required to provide evidence of a reflective process.
The written reflective statement requires the student to convey an understanding of the intention, process
and outcome of the piece.

Music technology composing
A music technology composition uses computers together with a variety of software programs and/or
hardware.
Music technology compositions will demonstrate skills and creativity in using some or all of the following:
•

MIDI (musical instrument digital interface)-based programs

•

sequence-based programs

•

sound-generating software

•

recorded audio

•

analogue synthesizers

•

concrete sounds

•

assorted hardware.

The use of pre-recorded loops (including pre-recorded drum loops) is not permitted in the final
compositions.
If part of the work is undertaken outside the school environment the teacher is still required to confirm the
authenticity of the work.
A music technology composition may be created for (but is not restricted to) film, video/DVD, or as an
independent original audio piece. (However, the music and reflective statement only must be submitted:
teachers and examiners will not look at other material.)
Students must submit a recording of each music technology composition.
SL students may submit one or two music technology pieces; HL students may submit one, two or three.
(Please refer to the “Creating options” table.)
A music technology composition must be 3–6 minutes in length.

Syllabus content

In addition to the music technology composition, students are required to provide evidence of a reflective
process. The written reflective statement requires the student to describe the intention, process and
outcome of the piece.

Arranging
Arranging is the process of drawing on music that is already in existence, and re-manipulating it.
Students are required to arrange a pre-existing piece of music for a variety of instruments, voices, electronic
media, or any combination of these. A straightforward transcription is not acceptable. The arrangement
should display originality through a variety of deliberate creative decisions, as well as through manipulation
and re-manipulation of musical elements present in the original piece. Introducing new elements can be
appropriate, but it is important that the original music be recognizable.
While the original piece may come from any musical culture the arrangement must be presented using
traditional western staff notation. This may be handwritten or notated using suitable music-writing
software.
In addition to the notated version and recording of the arrangement students must also submit the notated
version of the original. (A recording of the original piece is acceptable should the notated version not exist.)
Students may submit one arrangement only. (Please refer to the “Creating options” table.)
The arrangement must be 3–6 minutes in length.
In addition to the arrangement, students are required to provide evidence of a reflective process. The written
reflective statement requires the student to describe the intention, process and outcome of the piece.

Improvising
Improvisation is a spontaneous musical expression in response to a musical or non-musical stimulus. It can
begin by imitating other styles of music, or develop from other stimuli. A successful improvisation will have
shape, direction and originality, and may be inspired in a variety of ways. Manipulating a diverse range
of musical elements will reflect a developed understanding of musical possibilities. The use of a range of
instrumental/vocal techniques can also enhance the resulting improvisation.
The improvisation can take many forms, including, but not limited to:
•

improvisation during performance of a jazz band or combo

•

free improvisation with other musicians

•

solo improvisation.

Improvisation could be one continuous piece, or may consist of several sections. However, the total time of
actual improvisation by the student must be 3–6 minutes in length. In the case of improvisation in several
sections, although only the improvisation sections will be assessed, the teacher must record the entire
performance of the piece.
Students may submit one improvisation only. (Please refer to the “Creating options” table.)
A recording of the improvisation must be submitted. In the case of improvisation with other players, the
student’s contribution must be clearly identifiable on the recording.
In addition to the improvisation, students are required to provide evidence of a reflective process. The
written reflective statement requires the student to describe the intention, process and outcome of the
piece.

Syllabus content

Stylistic techniques
Stylistic techniques is the study of the compositional styles of others.
Students are required to choose two different exercises from a to g. For example, a student may choose b
and d; this would constitute one piece of coursework.
The other submission(s) in creating must be chosen from composing, music technology composing,
arranging and/or improvising. (Please refer to the “Creating options” table.)
Students must demonstrate understanding of instrumental and vocal ranges, transpositions and other
characteristics, appropriate to the stylistic techniques chosen.
No expressive or dynamic indications are to be included, except in the following cases:
•

18th-century string quartet (e)

•

19th-century song accompaniment (f)

•

12-note/tone techniques (g).

Additionally, 18th-century string quartet (e) must include articulation.
All exercises must be presented using traditional western staff notation. This may be handwritten or notated
using suitable music-writing software.
a.

Renaissance vocal counterpoint (for example, Lassus, Morley, Palestrina) (16–24 bars): This may be
either a two-part exercise, where one part must be given in full by the teacher, or a three- to five-part
texture, which is given by the teacher with one part omitted. In either case the first two or three notes
of the omitted part must be given. The omitted part must be created by the student. All parts must
include text. The completed exercise must include points of imitation. The student’s work must be
clearly identifiable and the extract cited (both work and composer).

b.

Bach chorale: A complete chorale melody (minimum 16 bars) is given by the teacher to the student
and must be cited. The student must create the lower three parts. Modulation must be included.

c.

Figured bass in the baroque style (16–24 bars): The figured bass, together with the melodic
instrumental/vocal part, is given by the teacher. Both of these must be given in full. The figured bass
must be realized by the student. Modulation must be included. The student’s work must be clearly
identifiable and the extract cited (both work and composer).

d.

Two-part 18th-century instrumental counterpoint (for example, Bach, Handel) (16–24 bars): The
opening, which is given by the teacher, must be 2–5 bars. The chosen exercise must include points of
imitation, and modulation must be included. The student’s work must be clearly identifiable and the
extract cited (both work and composer).

e.

18th-century string quartet (for example, Haydn, Mozart) (16–24 bars): The exercise could be, but is
not limited to, an exposition of a first movement or a minuet. The first violin part in full is given by the
teacher to the student. The student must create the other three parts. Modulation must be included.
The student’s work must be clearly identifiable and the extract cited (both work and composer).

f.

19th-century song accompaniment (for example, Schubert, Schumann) (minimum of 16 bars): The
exercise must be either a complete song or part of one. The vocal part, including text, is given by the
teacher to the student, who must create a piano accompaniment. Modulation must be included. The
extract must be cited (both work and composer).

g.

12-note/tone techniques (16–24 bars): A complete statement of a row is given by the teacher and
must be cited (both work and composer), or created by the teacher and clearly indicated as such. The
row and its permutations must be indicated throughout the exercise. The exercise is for two orchestral
instruments or for keyboard only.

Music guide

19

Syllabus content

In addition to the two exercises in stylistic techniques, students are required to provide evidence of a
reflective process. The written reflective statements require the student to describe the intention, process
and outcome for both of the exercises submitted.

Performing
During this study students should aim to develop performance skills through solo or group music making.
Performance demands self-discipline and focus on the part of students as they learn to recreate music.

Solo performing—SLS, HL
The student is required to submit a recording selected from pieces presented during one or more public
performance(s). The total performance time must be:
•

SL—15 minutes

•

HL—20 minutes.

The purpose of recording performances is to allow students subsequently to select a number of contrasting
pieces to represent their best work for internal assessment. The Diploma Programme music teacher must be
able to verify that the recording is the authentic performance of each student.
In performing their pieces students may use:
1.

any instrument and/or voice, or

2.

the computer as a musical instrument.

Students may not present a combination of 1 and 2.
Any musical style is permitted. However, the submission should consist of contrasting pieces and should
display the student’s strengths. The submission should reflect the best that the student has achieved
throughout the course.

Music technology
Students choosing music technology must use pre-existing pieces and present them as recorded
performances that show interpretative and stylistic qualities. This means that close attention must be paid
to aspects of articulation, dynamics, phrasing, tempo, timbre/tone colour, part balance and other pertinent
musical characteristics, just as in a traditional instrumental performance.
Each performance of a pre-existing piece for music technology purposes must involve a minimum of four
simultaneously sounding parts. The use of the drum kit constitutes a single part. Conversely, the performance
of a four-part fugue for keyboard or a string quartet fulfills the requirement, as would a jazz combo of bass,
piano, drum kit and saxophone.
All parts must be MIDI-entered—sampled parts and drum loops are only acceptable if the teacher is able to
verify that the samples have been performed by the student.

Small group
Students may also choose to include one example of work as a member of a small group. However, the
student’s contribution to this small group must be clearly identifiable, with, if any, limited doubling by
another instrument/voice, and must be a substantial part of the piece. This piece may not exceed five
minutes in duration.
As solo performance in music technology already involves a minimum of four instruments, music technology
students may not present a small group piece.

20

Music guide

Syllabus content

Accompaniment
With reference to accompaniment, submissions must be presented according to musical convention. For
example, if a piece is composed for flute with piano accompaniment then it is expected that the presentation
will feature both the soloist and the accompanist. Backing tracks of accompaniments not conceived as such
are strongly discouraged.
In some cases, musical conventions will dictate more than one performer as part of the accompaniment. For
example, a jazz saxophonist may traditionally perform along with piano, guitar, string bass and drum kit.
Another example is a singer in a rock band, who may have the backing of an electric guitar, bass guitar and
drum kit. Despite the number of musicians providing the accompaniment in these cases, it can be said that
the structure of the groups is still solo and accompaniment. In these particular cases the piece will still be
considered as a solo piece. Piano reductions are also acceptable—as, for example, in the case of a concerto.

Group performing—SLG
Students following this SL option are expected to be active, participating members of a musical group that
performs on a regular basis in public during the course.
The Diploma Programme music teacher should advise students on the appropriateness of a group and its
repertoire, paying special regard to the student’s interests and abilities in relation to those of the rest of the
group.
Students should not necessarily be limited to groups organized by the Diploma Programme music teacher,
or offered in the school.
A group may be composed entirely or partially of Diploma Programme music students, with a scheme of
rehearsal and performance designed to meet the criteria for this option.
A group could be as small as two people. However, the participating role of each performer must be of
equal musical importance. A soloist being accompanied by another student does not constitute a group.
Using the computer as a musical instrument (as defined in the solo performing option) is not permitted in
the group performing option.
Examples of musical groups (any size or style) include, but are not limited to:
•

choir

•

orchestra

•

concert/wind band

•

rock/pop band

•

chamber group.

For assessment purposes, the recordings must be of the same group in two or more public performances.
The total performance time must be:
•

20–30 minutes.

Requirements
Each student will be assessed on the work done in one group only and each Diploma Programme music
student following this SL option who is a member of this group will receive the same mark.
Students will need to commit to sustained practice and rehearsal, as traditionally associated with group
performing, and perform on a regular basis in public.

Music guide

21

Syllabus content

The group is required to submit a selection of pieces recorded from two or more public performances
during the course of study.
When the Diploma Programme music teacher is not the conductor or leader of the group (such as groups
led by other teachers in the school, or by musicians either in or out of the school), the teacher must be able
to verify that the recording is the authentic performance of each student.
Teachers may be the conductors, leaders and/or accompanists of groups. An accompanist is also permitted
for larger-scale vocal groups. However, no music teacher or professional musician may have any other
performing role in the musical group to be assessed.
The chosen group may or may not be accompanied, depending on the nature of the group and
the repertoire. For example, a vocal group might present pieces a cappella, and/or pieces with piano/
instrumental accompaniment. However, groups must be accompanied according to standard musical
practice. Nevertheless it is the group that is assessed and not the accompanist(s).

Assessment in the Diploma Programme

General
Assessment is an integral part of teaching and learning. The most important aims of assessment in the
Diploma Programme are that it should support curricular goals and encourage appropriate student
learning. Both external and internal assessment are used in the Diploma Programme. IB examiners mark
work produced for external assessment, while work produced for internal assessment is marked by teachers
and externally moderated by the IB.
There are two types of assessment identified by the IB.
•

Formative assessment informs both teaching and learning. It is concerned with providing accurate
and helpful feedback to students and teachers on the kind of learning taking place and the nature of
students’ strengths and weaknesses in order to help develop students’ understanding and capabilities.
Formative assessment can also help to improve teaching quality, as it can provide information to
monitor progress towards meeting the course aims and objectives.

•

Summative assessment gives an overview of previous learning and is concerned with measuring
student achievement.

The Diploma Programme primarily focuses on summative assessment designed to record student
achievement at, or towards the end of, the course of study. However, many of the assessment instruments
can also be used formatively during the course of teaching and learning, and teachers are encouraged to
do this. A comprehensive assessment plan is viewed as being integral with teaching, learning and course
organization. For further information, see the IB Programme standards and practices document.
The approach to assessment used by the IB is criterion-related, not norm-referenced. This approach to
assessment judges students’ work by their performance in relation to identified levels of attainment, and
not in relation to the work of other students. For further information on assessment within the Diploma
Programme please refer to the publication Diploma Programme assessment: Principles and practice.
To support teachers in the planning, delivery and assessment of the Diploma Programme courses a variety
of resources can be found on the OCC or purchased from the IB store (http://store.ibo.org). Teacher support
materials, subject reports, internal assessment guidance, grade descriptors, as well as resources from other
teachers, can be found on the OCC. Specimen and past examination papers as well as markschemes can be
purchased from the IB store.

Methods of assessment
The IB uses several methods to assess work produced by students.

Assessment criteria
Assessment criteria are used when the assessment task is open-ended. Each criterion concentrates on
a particular skill that students are expected to demonstrate. An assessment objective describes what
students should be able to do and assessment criteria describe how well they should be able to do it. Using
assessment criteria allows discrimination between different answers and encourages a variety of responses.

Music guide

23

Assessment in the Diploma Programme

Each criterion comprises a set of hierarchically ordered level descriptors. Each level descriptor is worth one
or more marks. Each criterion is applied independently using a best-fit model. The maximum marks for each
criterion may differ according to the criterion’s importance. The marks awarded for each criterion are added
together to give the total mark for the piece of work.

Markbands
Markbands are a comprehensive statement of expected performance against which responses are judged.
They represent a single holistic criterion divided into level descriptors. Each level descriptor corresponds
to a range of marks to differentiate student performance. A best-fit approach is used to ascertain which
particular mark to use from the possible range for each level descriptor.

Markschemes
This generic term is used to describe analytic markschemes that are prepared for specific examination
papers. Analytic markschemes are prepared for those examination questions that expect a particular kind
of response and/or a given final answer from the students. They give detailed instructions to examiners
on how to break down the total mark for each question for different parts of the response. A markscheme
may include the content expected in the responses to questions or may be a series of marking notes giving
guidance on how to apply criteria.

Marking notes
For some assessment components marked using assessment criteria, marking notes are provided. Marking
notes give guidance on how to apply assessment criteria to the particular requirements of a question.

External assessment details—SL and HL
Listening paper
Duration: SL—2 hours; HL—2 hours 30 minutes
Weighting: 30%
The IB recommends 45 teaching hours to prepare students for the listening paper at SL, and 60 hours at HL.
The listening paper is based on musical perception—analysis and examination at SL and HL, as well as
comparing and contrasting at HL. It consists of two compulsory sections (A and B).
SL students must answer four questions, HL students must answer five. Students may choose to answer the
sections (and questions) in any order.
The maximum mark for each question in each section is 20. The maximum marks for the listening paper are:
80 (SL), and 100 (HL).
Students are expected to present a case. A bulleted list may be used but not at the expense of reasoned
musical arguments. In preparation, attention must be paid to the glossary of command terms.
All questions are externally assessed using the external assessment criteria (see “External assessment
criteria—SL and HL” in this guide). Section A is assessed by applying markbands. Section B is assessed by
applying assessment criteria. In addition there will be a specific markscheme for the listening paper at each
examination session.
The listening paper assesses students’ work in assessment objectives 1, 2, and 6 of the course, as well as
assessment objective 3 for HL only.
In common with all examination papers, students at SL and HL are given five minutes of reading time before
they begin answering the paper. Students may also begin to listen to the music extracts presented on the
examination CD during this period.

must be supplied by the school.

Section A—SL and HL
Section A focuses on the two works prescribed by the IB in the Handbook of procedures for the Diploma
Programme.
Students at SL must answer one question from questions 1 and 2.
•

Questions 1 and 2 will be analyse and examine questions, one based on each of the two prescribed
works. Students must answer one of the two questions.

Students at HL must answer two questions: one question from questions 1 and 2 as well as question 3.
•

Questions 1 and 2 will be analyse and examine questions, one based on each of the two prescribed
works. Students must answer one of the two questions.

•

Question 3 will require students to compare and/or contrast the two prescribed works, emphasizing
the presence of any significant musical links.

Details of the two works, prescribed for two consecutive years’ examinations, will be published in the
Handbook of procedures for the Diploma Programme, which is updated annually.
The school must ensure that each student has clean, unmarked scores of the prescribed works to take into
the examination room. (Some scores may contain additional information, for example, a written foreword,

28

Music guide

External assessment

which may include information useful to the student during the examination. Schools are required to ensure
that any such pages are securely fastened so they cannot be used during the examination.)

Section B—SL and HL
Students will be required to answer three analyse and examine questions on music from different times and
places, encompassing:
•

jazz/pop

•

western art music

•

world music.

As one of their three questions in this section, students will be required to choose one of two western art
music extracts to respond to.
Section B is based on extracts that are taken from a wide range of music from different times, places and
musical cultures. Extracts may or may not be identified; scores may or may not be included.
Using the knowledge they have gained in their musical perception study in relation to features of the
recorded extracts, all students are expected to:
•

analyse

•

examine

•

discuss (including arguments and hypotheses) in detail what they hear in each extract.

Where a score is included, students are expected to make clear reference to the extracts by using bar/
measure number(s), rehearsal number(s), and/or instrument(s) where a score is provided, and by using
timings (minutes and seconds) when no score is included.
In their answers students should address both the musical elements (including structure) and the context
(cultural, historical and stylistic aspects) of the music. Students should use appropriate musical terminology
when addressing the musical elements and context.
Musical notation may be used as a means of illustrating and supporting answers.
Where a musical work includes text it should be considered in relation to the music.

Musical links investigation—SL and HL
Weighting: 20%
The IB recommends that 30 teaching hours should be undertaken at both SL and HL during the student’s
course of study in preparation for the musical links investigation.
The musical links investigation will be externally assessed using the external assessment criteria (see
“External assessment criteria—SL and HL” in this guide).
The musical links investigation requires the student to engage in a sustained investigation that is self-directed.
It is designed to allow the student the opportunity to investigate the musical connections between pieces
from two distinct musical cultures by exploring one (or more) musical piece(s) from each musical culture.
Through comparative exploration, analysis and examination of these pieces, the student is required to
demonstrate two or more significant musical links—that is to say, links concerning musical elements.
These musical links must be stated both on the musical links investigation coversheet and at the beginning
of the script.
In order to demonstrate musical links through convincing arguments the student should engage in accurate
description, analysis and examination of differences and similarities between one (or more) musical piece(s)

Music guide

29

External assessment

from each of two identifiable and distinct musical cultures. The student should take care to maintain an
even balance of attention between the two musical cultures when writing the musical links investigation.
The two musical cultures chosen for study should be sufficiently distinct: the musical pieces chosen should
therefore be clearly definable as belonging to distinct musical cultures. (Students are advised not to choose
two pieces where one has influenced the other—for example, the Beatles’ music reflecting Indian influences).
The student should investigate the compositional features found in the music, such as, but not limited to,
duration, pitch, tonality, timbre/tone colour, texture, dynamics, and form/structure. Where a musical work
includes text it should be considered in relation to the music.
The student should also note that large-scale pieces, such as a whole opera or symphony, are unlikely to be
analysed in sufficient detail in the scope of an investigation. Therefore, in certain cases it is acceptable to
analyse a section or a fragment of a whole opera or symphony. Nevertheless, the section/fragment should
be long enough to support the arguments presented by the student. Similarly, the use of too many pieces of
music may produce a less convincing argument.
If the same topic is chosen for different assessment components, that topic must be treated completely
differently—otherwise it may be considered as a breach of regulations. Students who choose to write an
extended essay in music should focus on a research question that has no common ground with the material
of their musical links investigation. (Please refer to the General regulations: Diploma Programme.) The current
prescribed works may not be chosen for the musical links investigation.

Format
The musical links investigation must be submitted as a media script of no more than 2,000 words.
Mass media communication in the 21st century has many formats, such as radio, television, CD-ROM,
internet, printed article, or lecture. The musical links investigation should be conceived for any form of
mass media communication. A range of possibilities could include straightforward narration, interview or
dramatization. However, the focus must be on the music itself and not on peripheries such as biography
or social discourses that may detract from the musical links investigation. Scripts that concentrate on such
peripheries at the expense of content will not successfully fulfill the assessment requirements.
The length of the media script, not including quotations and citations of sources, must be no more than
2,000 words at both SL and HL. The variety of styles of media script may affect the length of the student’s
musical links investigation. For example, a student who presents similarities and differences in a tabular
form as part of a website could achieve the same outcome in fewer words than a student who writes in a
more narrative form, such as a magazine article or a radio show. Both approaches are equally acceptable for
the musical links investigation. Therefore, there is a degree of flexibility in the number of words used.
If students exceed 2,000 words, the examiner’s assessment must be based on the first 2,000 words.
In case of doubt, examiners are instructed to determine when the word limit has been exceeded.
The following elements should not be included in the word count.
•

Quotations (the actual text taken from a source and used in the body of the script)

•

Citations of sources

•

Bibliography

•

Discography

A computer word-count tool is to be discouraged because of these parameters: a manual count is
required.

30

Music guide

External assessment

For the purposes of external assessment, students must submit a paper copy of the media script,
regardless of the medium chosen. For example, if a student chooses to present the information as a
website, the screenshots must be printed out in order for the submission to be examined. If students have
the opportunity to submit the musical links investigation in an electronic format, schools will be notified in
advance of the examination session.
Relevant supporting materials may include a CD recording of musical extracts illustrating points raised (five
minutes maximum) and/or papers, such as musical notation, photographs and diagrams.

Sources
In the written media script, the student must cite both primary and secondary sources used. Sources of
information must be acknowledged and a consistent format used (for example, the Harvard author–date
system).
In accordance with the style manual used, internet sources must be accurately and completely cited. It is not
enough to simply cite the web address. Students must cite the author, title of the article or entry, and date
of access to the site.
Primary sources must be used and may include live performance and recordings, website streaming, musical
notation, interviews and discussion with practitioners in the field. Secondary sources may include textbooks,
documentaries and articles (either in paper or electronic form).
As the sources must be acknowledged, if the choice of media script does not lend itself to the inclusion of
references within the text, footnotes should be used.
Students will receive credit for their own work, which must include an apt selection of references and
quotations, intelligent and persuasive links, and effective questioning. Care must be taken to ensure that the
majority of the script represents the student’s own ideas and not a summary of other sources. A bibliography
and discography are required.

The role of the teacher
Prior to the student’s completion of the first draft, the teacher is expected to:
•

inform students of the characteristics of the musical links investigation media script, making sure that
the concept of significant musical links is understood

•

make the assessment criteria available to students at all times

•

assist each student in choosing the musical cultures and pieces; however, the student is ultimately
responsible for these decisions

•

require each student in the early stages of the investigation to provide a conceptual framework
detailing the proposed musical links, similarities and differences, and primary and secondary sources

•

Advice
During the process of completing the musical links investigation, the student should submit a comprehensive
draft of the final version to enable the teacher to give appropriate feedback. As part of this process, teachers
can give advice to students on this draft only. This advice can be either verbal or written, and can indicate
the way in which the work could be improved. If the advice is written, the teacher must not heavily annotate
or edit the student’s draft. The next version handed to the teacher after the first version must be the final
one.

Discussion and support
Students must not be penalized for seeking guidance. However, if a student could not have completed the
musical links investigation without substantial support from the teacher, this should be recorded on the
appropriate form from the Handbook of procedures for the Diploma Programme.

Academic honesty
Teachers must ensure that material submitted is the student’s own work. Students are ultimately responsible
for ensuring that all work submitted for assessment is authentic, with the work or ideas of others fully and
correctly acknowledged. Every student must also sign a declaration on the coversheet that is attached
to their work. In addition, teachers are also required to sign the musical links investigation coversheet to
confirm that, to the best of their knowledge, the work of each student is his or her own work and constitutes
the final version of that work. For further information about academic honesty, teachers should refer to the
latest edition of the IB publication Academic honesty.

Assessment

Internal assessment

Purpose of internal assessment
Internal assessment is an integral part of the course and is compulsory for both SL and HL students. It
enables students to demonstrate the application of their skills and knowledge, and to pursue their personal
interests, without the time limitations and other constraints that are associated with written examinations.
The internal assessment should, as far as possible, be woven into normal classroom teaching and not be a
separate activity conducted after a course has been taught.
The internal assessment requirements at SL and at HL are different. SL students are required to present one
of three options—creating, solo performing or group performing—whereas HL students are required to
present both creating and solo performing. HL students are also required to submit more work for each of
their two components.

Guidance and authenticity
The components submitted for internal assessment at SL and HL must be the student’s own work. However,
it is not the intention that students should decide upon a title, topic, idea or particular piece and be left to
work on the internal assessment component without any further support from the teacher. The teacher
should play an important role during both the planning stage and the period when the student is working
on the internally assessed work. It is the responsibility of the teacher to ensure that students are familiar
with:
•

the requirements of the type of work to be internally assessed

•

the assessment criteria; students must understand that the work submitted for assessment must
address these criteria effectively.

Teachers and students must discuss the internally assessed work. Students should be encouraged to initiate
discussions with the teacher to obtain advice and information, and students must not be penalized for
seeking guidance. However, if a student could not have completed the work without substantial support
from the teacher, this should be recorded on the appropriate form from the Handbook of procedures for the
Diploma Programme.
It is the responsibility of teachers to ensure that all students understand the basic meaning and significance
of concepts that relate to academic honesty, especially authenticity and intellectual property. Teachers must
ensure that all student work for assessment is prepared according to the requirements and must explain
clearly to students that the internally assessed work must be entirely their own.
As part of the learning process, teachers can give advice to students on a first draft/performance of the
internally assessed work. This advice should be in terms of the way the work could be improved. If responding
to written work, this first draft must not be heavily annotated or edited by the teacher; if responding to work
of an aural nature then this must not be an extensive response. The next version handed to the teacher after
the first draft/performance must be the final one.

Music guide

39

Internal assessment

All work submitted to the IB for moderation or assessment must be authenticated by a teacher, and must
not include any known instances of suspected or confirmed malpractice. Each student must sign the
coversheet for internal assessment to confirm that the work is his or her authentic work and constitutes the
final version of that work. Once a student has officially submitted the final version of the work to a teacher
(or the coordinator) for internal assessment, together with the signed coversheet, it cannot be retracted.
Authenticity may be checked by discussion with the student on the content of the work, and scrutiny of one
or more of the following:
•

the student’s initial proposal

•

the first draft/performance

•

the style of writing/performing compared with work known to be that of the student.

The requirement for teachers and students to sign the coversheet for internal assessment applies to the
work of all students, not just the sample work that will be submitted to an examiner for the purpose of
moderation. If the teacher and student sign a coversheet, but there is a comment to the effect that the
work may not be authentic, the student will not be eligible for a mark in that component and no grade will
be awarded. For further details refer to the IB publication Academic honesty and the relevant articles in the
General regulations: Diploma Programme.
The same piece of work cannot be submitted to meet the requirements of both the internal assessment
and the extended essay. A student may not include music from the prescribed works in the performing
(solo/group) components. Neither may an HL student submit any of his or her creating coursework for
both the creating and performing components. If the student decides to submit any creating coursework
for the performing component then this may not be used as part of the final submission for the creating
component.
For further details refer to the Handbook of procedures for the Diploma Programme.

Group work
Please refer to the details regarding group work for the solo performing and group performing components
in “Internal assessment details—SL and HL” in this guide.

Time allocation
Internal assessment is an integral part of the music course, contributing 50% to the final assessment in
the SL and the HL courses. This weighting should be reflected in the time that is allocated to teaching the
knowledge, skills and understanding required to undertake the work as well as the total time allocated to
carry out the work.
It is recommended that a total of approximately 75 hours at SL and 150 hours (75 hours each for 2
components) at HL should be allocated to the work. This should include:
•

time for the teacher to explain to students the requirements of the internal assessment

•

class time for students to work on the internal assessment component(s)

•

time for consultation between the teacher and each student

•

time to review and monitor progress, and to check authenticity.

40

Music guide

Internal assessment

Requirements and recommendations
It is important for the integrity of the moderation process that the internal assessment by the teacher
is based on the same evidence as that available to the moderator (for example, recordings or written
documentation).
All recordings must be submitted on compact disc (CD) or other digital format specified by the IB and
notified to schools.
Teachers must ensure that the submitted material has been replayed successfully on a machine other than
that on which it was recorded. The case and accompanying legend must identify both the school and
student, and teachers must ensure that only good-quality recordings are submitted.

Using assessment criteria for internal assessment
For internal assessment, a number of assessment criteria have been identified. Each assessment criterion
has level descriptors describing specific levels of achievement together with an appropriate range of marks.
The level descriptors concentrate on positive achievement, although for the lower levels failure to achieve
may be included in the description.
Teachers must judge the internally assessed work at SL and at HL against the criteria using the level
descriptors.
•

The same assessment criteria are provided for SL and HL.

•

The aim is to find, for each criterion, the descriptor that conveys most accurately the level attained
by the student, using the best-fit model. A best-fit approach means that compensation should be
made when a piece of work matches different aspects of a criterion at different levels. The mark
awarded should be one that most fairly reflects the balance of achievement against the criterion. It is
not necessary for every single aspect of a level descriptor to be met for that mark to be awarded.

•

When assessing a student’s work, teachers should read the level descriptors for each criterion until
they reach a descriptor that most appropriately describes the level of the work being assessed. If a
piece of work seems to fall between two descriptors, both descriptors should be read again and the
one that more appropriately describes the student’s work should be chosen.

•

Where there are two or more marks available within a level, teachers should award the upper marks if
the student’s work demonstrates the qualities described to a great extent. Teachers should award the
lower marks if the student’s work demonstrates the qualities described to a lesser extent.

•

Only whole numbers should be recorded; partial marks, that is fractions and decimals, are not
acceptable.

•

Teachers should not think in terms of a pass or fail boundary, but should concentrate on identifying
the appropriate descriptor for each assessment criterion.

•

The highest level descriptors do not imply faultless performance but should be achievable by a
student. Teachers should not hesitate to use the extremes if they are appropriate descriptions of the
work being assessed.

•

A student who attains a high level of achievement in relation to one criterion will not necessarily
attain high levels of achievement in relation to the other criteria. Similarly, a student who attains a low
level of achievement for one criterion will not necessarily attain low achievement levels for the other
criteria. Teachers should not assume that the overall assessment of the students will produce any
particular distribution of marks.

•

It is recommended that the assessment criteria be made available to students.

Internal assessment

Internal assessment details—SL and HL
Creating—SLC, HL
Weighting: SLC—50%; HL—25%
The IB recommends 75 teaching hours at both SL and HL to be undertaken during the student’s course of
study.
There are five options available to students of creating. Students choose a combination of options to fulfill
the requirements of this component. SL students are required to submit two pieces of coursework; HL
students are required to submit three. (For further details on selecting combinations refer to the “Creating
options” table in the “Syllabus content” section of this guide.) The work must be supervised by the teacher.
Students and teachers are reminded that the final assessment is of the individual student’s own work.
The final submissions (recordings, scores, written reflective statements) must be headed with the name and
candidate session number of the student and the correct title of the work.

Composing, music technology composing, arranging, improvising
If the time limit is exceeded, the assessment must be based on the first six minutes of each piece.
In case of doubt, teachers and examiners are instructed to determine when a time limit has been
exceeded.

Stylistic techniques—b and f
The assessment of (b) Bach chorale must be of no more than one chorale.
The assessment of (f) 19th-century song accompaniment must be of no more than one song.
In case of doubt, teachers and examiners are instructed to check with the original composer’s work.

Stylistic techniques—a, c, d, e, g
The assessment of the following techniques must be based on the first 24 bars:
a.

Renaissance vocal counterpoint

c.

figured bass in the baroque style

d.

two-part 18th-century instrumental counterpoint

e.

18th-century string quartet

g.

12-note/tone techniques.

In case of doubt, teachers and examiners are instructed to determine when the bar limit has been
exceeded.

The work of each student in creating will be internally assessed by the teacher and externally moderated
by the IB. When there is more than one music teacher teaching students in this component, internal
standardization must take place. The criteria should be applied in the same way to the work of both SL and
HL students.

42

Music guide

Internal assessment

The reflection
In addition, all students must present a written reflective statement for each presented piece.
Each reflection must be up to (and no more than) 300 words. If the word limit for the reflection is
exceeded, the assessment must be based on the first 300 words. In case of doubt, teachers and
examiners are instructed to determine when the word count has been exceeded.

The statement must reflect the creative process over time. Each reflection must include documentation by
the student of the following.
•

Intention—what was the intention behind the piece?

•

Process—what steps did the student take to achieve the final version of the piece?

•

––

How were the musical elements developed?

––

What musical successes and difficulties were encountered?

––

What equipment was used (if any)? (In the case of music technology compositions students must
refer to the name and source of all sampled and/or imported material.)

Outcome—what did the student learn musically during the creating of this piece?

Solo performing—SLS, HL
Weighting: SL—50%; HL—25%
The IB recommends 75 teaching hours at both SL and HL to be undertaken during the student’s course of
study.
The student is required to submit a recording of pieces performed during one or more public performance(s).
It is recommended that the teacher be present at the live performance(s) to confirm that the recording is of
the student’s own performance(s).
The total performance time must be:
•

SL—15 minutes

•

HL—20 minutes.

For musical reasons submissions will be allowed to be up to one minute (at SL) or up to two minutes (at HL)
longer or shorter than the stipulated time requirement.
As part of the SL and HL solo performing submission, the following may be included:
•

one piece as a member of a small group (up to five minutes in length).

The student must be performing a line that is clearly identifiable, with, if any, limited doubling, and forms a
substantial part of the piece.
A student using music technology for his or her solo performing may not submit a small group piece.
Students may perform in any musical style. Any instrument and/or voice is permitted. (Instrumentalists may
choose to perform on more than one instrument.) Solo performers must be accompanied in accordance
with standard musical practice. Furthermore, students must present their solo performing on either
instrument(s)/voice or by using music technology: they may not present a combination.
In some cases, musical conventions will dictate more than one performer as part of the accompaniment. For
example, a jazz saxophonist may traditionally perform along with piano, guitar, string bass and drum kit. Another
example is a singer in a rock band, who may have the backing of an electric guitar, bass guitar and drum kit.

Music guide

43

Internal assessment

If a student chooses to accompany himself or herself, it is important that the solo line to be assessed is noted
on the coversheet. For example, a singer accompanying himself or herself on the guitar would probably
count the solo line as the vocal one.
The course of study must build towards a presentation of one or more public performances. From these the
student must select contrasting pieces that reflect the best the student has achieved throughout the course.
While the teacher is expected to provide support and guidance, the student is responsible for making the
final choice of material.

If the time limit is exceeded, the assessment must be based on the first:
•

15 minutes (16 minutes) at SL

•

20 minutes (22 minutes) at HL.

In case of doubt, teachers and examiners are instructed to determine when the time limit has been
exceeded.

The work of each student in solo performing will be internally assessed by the teacher and externally
moderated by the IB. When there is more than one music teacher teaching students in this component,
internal standardization must take place. The criteria should be applied in the same way to the work of both
SL and HL students.

Group performing—SLG
Weighting: 50%
The IB recommends 75 teaching hours to be undertaken during the student’s course of study.
A student may perform in any musical group but must choose which musical group to use for assessment.
For example, a bass guitarist who plays in two groups must choose only one for submission.
Only the musical outcomes on the final recordings are to be used for assessment purposes. No other factors
should be considered.
Submissions must be:
•

between 20 and 30 minutes in total length.

If the time limit is exceeded, the assessment must be based on the first 30 minutes. In case of doubt,
teachers and examiners are instructed to determine when the time limit has been exceeded.

The course of study must build towards a presentation of two or more recorded public performances of
different programmes by the group. It is recommended that the teacher be present at the live performances
to ensure that the recordings are of the student’s own performances.
The teacher, in consultation with the students who have chosen this group option, is responsible for making
the final choice of material to be assessed. From two or more of these performances a selection of at least
two contrasting pieces must be made. The selection should reflect the best that the group has achieved
throughout the course.
The work of the group will be internally assessed by the teacher and externally moderated by the IB. When
there is more than one teacher teaching students in this component, internal standardization must take place.
Note: All students who are members of the group receive the same mark.

An appropriate example would be a vocal quartet written for soprano, alto, tenor, bass (SATB) voices, which
uses the correct ranges and registers, and which is sensitive to balance and blend between sections. An
inappropriate example would be a work written for large brass band playing fortissimo accompanied by
harp playing pianissimo.
For music technology compositions an appropriate example would be a composition that demonstrates
a full understanding and competent use of the software and/or hardware capabilities. An inappropriate
example would be a work where the student makes only partial use of the potential offered by the software
and/or hardware.
In the case of improvising, this criterion concerns the student’s understanding and ability to perform
with appropriate technique for the chosen instrument. An appropriate example would be a work that
demonstrates fluency in articulation.
