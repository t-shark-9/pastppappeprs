Introduction
Purpose of this document
1 Chemistry guide
The Diploma  Programme  (DP)  is a rigorous  pre-university  course  of study  designed  for students  in the 
16 to 19 age range.  It is a broad-based  two-year  course  that  aims  to encourage  students  to be 
knowledgeable  and  inquiring,  but also  caring  and  compassionate.  There  is a strong  emphasis  on 
encouraging  students  to develop  intercultural  understanding,  open-mindedness,  and  the attitudes 
necessary for them to respect and evaluate a range of points of view.
The Diploma Programme model
The course  is presented  as six academic  areas  enclosing  a central  core  (see  figure  1). It encourages  the 
concurrent  study  of a broad  range  of academic  areas.  Students  study  two  modern  languages  (or a modern 
language  and  a classical  language),  a humanities  or social  science  subject,  an experimental  science, 
mathematics  and  one  of the creative  arts.  It is this comprehensive  range  of subjects  that  makes  the DP a 
demanding  course  of study  designed  to prepare  students  effectively  for university  entrance.  In each  of the 
academic  areas  students  have  flexibility  in making  their  choices,  which  means  they  can choose  subjects 
that particularly interest them and that they may wish to study further at university.

Introduction
The Diploma Programme
2 Chemistry guide
Choosing the right combination
Students are required to choose one subject from each of the six academic areas, although they can, 
instead  of an arts  subject,  choose  two  subjects  from  another  area.  Normally,  three  subjects  (and  not 
more  than  four)  are taken  at higher  level  (HL),  and  the others  are taken  at standard  level  (SL).  The IB 
recommends 240 teaching hours for HL subjects and 150 hours for SL. Subjects at HL are studied in greater 
depth and breadth than at SL.
At both levels, many skills are developed, especially those of critical thinking and analysis. At the end of the 
course,  students’  abilities  are measured  by means  of external  assessment.  Many  subjects  contain  some 
element of coursework assessed by teachers.
The core of the Diploma Programme model
All DP students participate in the three course elements that make up the core of the model.
Theory  of knowledge  (TOK)  is a course  that  is fundamentally  about  critical  thinking  and  inquiry  into  the 
process of knowing rather than about learning a specific body of knowledge. The TOK course examines the 
nature  of knowledge  and  how  we know  what  we claim  to know.  It does  this by encouraging  students  to 
analyse  knowledge  claims  and  explore  questions  about  the construction  of knowledge.  The task  of TOK  is 
to emphasize  connections  between  areas  of shared  knowledge  and  link them  to personal  knowledge  in 
such  a way  that  an individual  becomes  more  aware  of their  own  perspectives  and  how  they  might  differ 
from others.
In TOK, students explore the means of producing knowledge within the core theme of “knowledge and the 
knower”  as well  as within  various  optional  themes  (knowledge  and  technology,  knowledge  and  politics, 
knowledge  and  language,  knowledge  and  religion,  and  knowledge  and  indigenous  societies)  and  areas  of 
knowledge  (the  arts,  natural  sciences,  human  sciences,  history  and  mathematics).  The course  also 
encourages  students  to make  comparisons  between  different  areas  of knowledge  and  reflect  on how 
knowledge is arrived at in the various disciplines, what the disciplines have in common, and the differences 
between them.
Creativity,  activity,  service  (CAS)  is at the heart  of the DP. The emphasis  in CAS  is on helping  students  to 
develop  their  own  identities,  in accordance  with  the ethical  principles  embodied  in the IB mission 
statement  and  the IB learner  profile.  It involves  students  in a range  of activities  alongside  their  academic 
studies  throughout  the DP. The three  strands  of CAS  are creativity  (arts  and  other  experiences  that  involve 
creative  thinking),  activity  (physical  exertion  contributing  to a healthy  lifestyle)  and  service  (an unpaid  and 
voluntary  exchange  that  has a learning  benefit  for the student).  Possibly,  more  than  any other  component 
in the DP, CAS  contributes  to the IB’s mission  to create  a better  and  more  peaceful  world  through 
intercultural understanding and respect.
The extended  essay  (EE),  including  the world  studies  extended  essay,  offers  the opportunity  for IB students 
to investigate  a topic  of special  interest,  in the form  of a 4,000-word  piece  of independent  research.  The 
area  of research  undertaken  is chosen  from  one  of the students’  six DP subjects,  or in the case  of the 
interdisciplinary  world  studies  essay,  two  subjects,  and  acquaints  them  with  the independent  research  and 
writing skills expected at university. This leads to a major piece of formally presented, structured writing, in 
which ideas and findings are communicated in a reasoned and coherent manner, appropriate to the subject 
or subjects  chosen.  It is intended  to promote  high-level  research  and  writing  skills,  intellectual  discovery 
and  creativity.  An authentic  learning  experience,  it provides  students  with  an opportunity  to engage  in 
personal research on a topic of choice, under the guidance of a supervisor.
Approaches to teaching and approaches to 
learning
Approaches to teaching and approaches to learning (ATL) across the DP refers to deliberate strategies, skills 
and  attitudes  that  permeate  the teaching  and  learning  environment.  These  approaches  and  tools, 
intrinsically  linked  with  the learner  profile  attributes,  enhance  student  learning  and  assist  student The Diploma Programme
3 Chemistry guide
preparation for the DP assessment and beyond. The aims of approaches to teaching and learning in the DP 
are to:
• empower teachers as teachers of learners as well as teachers of content
• empower teachers to create clearer strategies for facilitating learning experiences in which students 
are more meaningfully engaged in structured inquiry and greater critical and creative thinking
• promote both the aims of individual subjects (making them more than course aspirations) and linking 
previously isolated knowledge (concurrency of learning)
• encourage students to develop an explicit variety of skills that will equip them to continue to be 
actively engaged in learning after they leave school, and to help them not only obtain university 
admission through better grades but also prepare for success during tertiary education and beyond
• enhance further the coherence and relevance of the students’ DP experience
• allow schools to identify the distinctive nature of an IB DP education, with its blend of idealism and 
practicality.
The five ATL (developing  thinking  skills,  social  skills,  communication  skills,  self-management  skills  and 
research  skills)  along  with  the six approaches  to teaching  (teaching  that  is inquiry-based,  conceptually 
focused,  contextualized,  collaborative,  differentiated  and  informed  by assessment)  encompass  the key 
values and principles that underpin IB pedagogy.
The IB mission statement and the IB learner profile
The DP aims  to develop  in students  the knowledge,  skills  and  attitudes  they  will need  to fulfil  the aims  of 
the IB, as expressed  in the organization’s  mission  statement  and  the learner  profile.  Teaching  and  learning 
in the DP represent the reality in daily practice of the organization’s educational philosophy.
Academic integrity
Academic  integrity  in the DP is a set of values  and  behaviours  informed  by the attributes  of the learner 
profile.  In teaching,  learning  and  assessment,  academic  integrity  serves  to promote  personal  integrity, 
engender  respect  for the integrity  of others  and  their  work,  and  ensure  that  all students  have  an equal 
opportunity to demonstrate the knowledge and skills they acquire during their studies.
All coursework—including  work  submitted  for assessment—is  to be authentic,  based  on the student’s 
individual  and  original  ideas  with  the ideas  and  work  of others  fully  acknowledged.  Assessment  tasks  that 
require  teachers  to provide  guidance  to students  or that  require  students  to work  collaboratively  must  be 
completed in full compliance with the detailed guidelines provided by the IB for the relevant subjects.
For further  information  on academic  integrity  in the IB and  the DP, please  consult  the IB publications 
Academic  integrity  policy , Effective  citing  and  referencing , Diploma  Programme:  From  principles  into  practice 
and  the general  regulations  in Diploma  Programme  Assessment  procedures  (updated  annually).  Specific 
information  regarding  academic  integrity  as it pertains  to external  and  internal  assessment  components  of 
this DP subject can be found in this guide.
Acknowledging the ideas or work of another 
person
Coordinators  and  teachers  are reminded  that  candidates  must  acknowledge  all sources  used  in work 
submitted for assessment. The following is intended as a clarification of this requirement.
DP candidates submit work for assessment in a variety of media that may include audiovisual material, text, 
graphs, images and/or data published in print or electronic sources. If a candidate uses the work or ideas of 
another  person,  the candidate  must  acknowledge  the source  using  a standard  style  of referencing  in a 
consistent  manner.  A candidate’s  failure  to acknowledge  a source  will be investigated  by the IB as a 
potential breach of regulations that may result in a penalty imposed by the IB final award committee.The Diploma Programme
4 Chemistry guide
The IB does not prescribe which style(s) of referencing or in-text citation should be used by candidates; this 
is left to the discretion  of appropriate  faculty/staff  in the candidate’s  school.  The wide  range  of subjects, 
response  languages  and  the diversity  of referencing  styles  make  it impractical  and  restrictive  to insist  on 
particular styles. In practice, certain styles may prove most commonly used, but schools are free to choose a 
style  that  is appropriate  for the subject  concerned  and  the language  in which  candidates’  work  is written. 
Regardless of the reference style adopted by the school for a given subject, it is expected that the minimum 
information  given  includes:  name  of author,  date  of publication,  title  of source,  and  page  numbers  as 
applicable.
Candidates  are expected  to use a standard  style  and  use it consistently  so that  credit  is given  to all sources 
used,  including  sources  that  have  been  paraphrased  or summarized.  When  writing  text  candidates  must 
clearly  distinguish  between  their  words  and  those  of others  by the use of quotation  marks  (or other 
method, such as indentation) followed by an appropriate citation that denotes an entry in the bibliography. 
If an electronic  source  is cited,  the date  of access  must  be indicated.  Candidates  are not expected  to show 
faultless  expertise  in referencing,  but are expected  to demonstrate  that  all sources  have  been 
acknowledged.  Candidates  must  be advised  that  audiovisual  material,  text,  graphs,  images  and/or  data 
published  in print  or in electronic  sources  that  is not their  own  must  also  attribute  the source.  Again,  an 
appropriate style of referencing/citation must be used.
Learning diversity and learning support 
requirements
Schools  must  ensure  that  equal  access  arrangements  and  reasonable  adjustments  are provided  to 
candidates  with  learning  support  requirements  that  are in line with  the IB documents  Access  and  inclusion 
policy  and Learning diversity and inclusion in IB programmes: Removing barriers to learning . 
The publications  Meeting  student  learning  diversity  in the classroom  and  The  IB guide  to inclusive  education:  a 
resource  for whole  school  development  are available  to support  schools  in the ongoing  process  of increasing 
access and engagement by removing barriers to learning.
Programme standards and practices
The programme  standards  and  practices  are a set of principles  for schools  to ensure  quality  and  fidelity  in 
the implementation  of IB programmes.  Teaching  and  learning  are important  markers  of quality  and 
effective practice in schools; thus the expectations teachers and learners share across all IB programmes can 
be found in the programme standards and practices.
The programme  standards  and  practices  provide  a framework  to help  teachers  understand  their  rights  and 
responsibilities  in IB World  Schools  as they  develop  learning  environments  and  experiences  for their 
students. The IB recognizes that in order for effective teaching to take place, teachers must be supported in 
their  understanding,  well-being,  environment  and  resources.  Teachers  use the core  tenets  of IB philosophy 
and  pedagogy  (approaches  to teaching,  ATL,  the learner  profile  and  international-mindedness)  to design 
learning experiences that prepare learners to fulfil the aims and objectives outlined in this guide.
To learn  more  about  teachers’  rights  and  responsibilities,  please  see the IB publication  Programme 
standards and practices  on the Programme Resource Centre.The Diploma Programme
5 Chemistry guide
What is nature of science?
Nature of science (NOS) is an overarching theme in the biology, chemistry and physics courses that seeks to 
explore conceptual understandings related to the purpose, features and impact of scientific knowledge.
What do we want to know in science?
Nobel  laureate  and  influential  popularizer  of science,  Richard  Feynman,  once  described  the process  of 
science  using  the analogy  of watching  an unknown  board  game  being  played  “... and  you don’t  know  the 
rules  of the game,  but you’re  allowed  to look  at the board  from  time  to time.  And  from  these  observations, 
you try to figure  out what  the rules  are of the game,  [and]  the rules  of the pieces  moving”  (Feynman  et al., 
1963).
What is the scientific endeavour?
Classifying  such  observations  and  underlying  patterns  in the natural  world  is the essence  of what  scientists 
do, underpinned  by the assumption  that  the universe  exists  as an external  reality  accessible  to the human 
experience.  The varied  and  often  non-linear  processes  used  in scientific  methodologies  have  several  key 
features  in common  to maximize  the validity  and  reliability  of knowledge  produced.  The development  of 
falsifiable  hypotheses,  a requirement  for replicable  data,  and  the utilization  of peer-review  may  be among 
the most  essential  of these  and  help  differentiate  a scientific  process  from  a pseudoscientific  one.  The 
communal  and  collaborative  nature  of this approach  further  strengthens  the objectivity  of science  by 
ensuring the inclusion of diverse perspectives and shared responsibility for its outcomes.
What type of knowledge do we produce?
Formal  scientific  knowledge  may  encompass  several  categories  including  representative  models, 
explanatory  theories  and  descriptive  laws.  As the focus  of each  discipline  of natural  science  differs,  so too 
does  the balance  of their  contributions  to each  category.  What  remains  constant,  however,  is the 
acknowledgement  of assumptions,  exceptions  and  limitations  of scientific  knowledge  to provide  realistic 
parameters  to our understanding  of the natural  world.  Claims  of certainty  are treated  with  caution  given 
the presence of paradigmatic shifts throughout the history of science.
What is the impact of scientific knowledge?
As well  as the pursuit  of knowledge  for its own  sake,  it is useful  to consider  the interplay  of science  with 
other  areas  of society.  Although  advances  in technology  traditionally  fuelled  great  leaps  in scientific 
understanding,  in recent  times  it may  be more  common  to see science  as a driver  of technological 
development.  In addition,  the implications  of science  within  environmental,  political,  social,  cultural  and 
economic domains can also be profound. These connections illustrate the importance of local, national and 
international  scientific  bodies  that  engage  with  the public  understanding  of science  and  heighten  the 
responsibility of scientists to adhere to principles of academic integrity in their research.
Introduction
Nature of science
6 Chemistry guide
Table 1
Aspects of nature of science
Aspects How are scientific knowledge claims generated, tested, communicated, 
evaluated and used? What issues arise from these actions?
Observations Scientists act as observers, looking at Earth and all other parts of the universe, to 
obtain data about natural phenomena. Observations can be made directly using 
human senses, or with the aid of instruments such as electronic sensors. 
Unexpected or unplanned observations can open up new research fields.
Patterns and trends Scientists analyse their observations, looking for patterns or trends, and try to draw 
general conclusions by inductive reasoning. They also look for discrepancies. 
Scientists classify objects through pattern recognition. A trend may take the form 
of a positive or negative correlation between variables. Correlations may be based 
on a causal relationship, but correlation does not prove causation.
Hypotheses Scientists make provisional explanations for the patterns that they have observed 
in natural phenomena. These hypotheses can be tested, with further observations 
or experiments, to obtain support for a hypothesis or show that it is false.
Experiments Scientists design and perform experiments to obtain data, which can be used to 
test hypotheses. The quality of experimental evidence depends on careful control 
of variables and on the quantity of data generated. Progress in science often 
follows technological developments that allow new experimental techniques. 
Creativity and imagination play a role in experimental design, interpretation and 
conclusion.
Measurement Quantitative measurements are more objective than qualitative observations, but 
all measurements are limited in precision and accuracy. Measurements are 
repeated to strengthen the reliability of data. Random errors in measurement due 
to unknown or unpredictable differences lead to imprecision and uncertainty, 
whereas systematic errors lead to inaccuracy.
Models Scientists construct models as artificial representations of natural phenomena. 
They are useful when direct observation or experimentation is difficult. Models are 
simplifications of complex systems and can be physical representations, abstract 
diagrams, mathematical equations or algorithms. All models have limitations that 
need to be considered in their application.
Evidence Scientists adopt a sceptical attitude to claims and evaluate them using evidence. 
Some claims cannot be tested using verifiable evidence, so cannot be falsified. 
They are therefore not scientific. Scientific knowledge must be supported by 
evidence.
Theories Scientists develop general explanations that are widely applicable, based on 
observed patterns or tested hypotheses. Predictions can be generated from these 
theories by deductive reasoning. If these predictions are tested, they may 
corroborate a theory or show that it is false and should be rejected. Paradigm shifts 
take place when a new theory replaces an old one. The term “law” is sometimes 
used for statements that allow predictions to be made about natural phenomena 
without explaining them.
Falsification Scientists can use evidence to falsify a claim formulated as a hypothesis, theory or 
model, but they cannot prove with certainty that such a claim is true. There is 
therefore inherent uncertainty in all scientific knowledge. Nonetheless, many 
theories in science are corroborated by strong evidence and allow for prediction 
and explanation. Scientists must remain open-minded with respect to new 
evidence.Nature of science
7 Chemistry guide
Aspects How are scientific knowledge claims generated, tested, communicated, 
evaluated and used? What issues arise from these actions?
Science as a shared 
endeavourScientists communicate and collaborate throughout the world. Agreed 
conventions and common terminology facilitate unambiguous communication. 
Peer review is essential to verify the research methods of knowledge claims prior 
to their publication in journals.
Global impact of 
scienceScientists have an obligation to assess the risks associated with their work and 
must aim to do no harm. Developments in science may have ethical, 
environmental, political, social, cultural and economic consequences that must be 
considered during decision-making. The pursuit of science may have unintended 
consequences. Research proposals are often filtered through ethics boards. 
Scientists have a responsibility to communicate their findings to the public with 
honesty and clarity.
How is NOS different from TOK?
In contrast  to the specificity  of understanding  of science,  the TOK  course  encourages  students  to think 
critically  about  the concepts  that  underpin  knowledge  production.  For example,  peer  review  is used  as a 
tool  to support  objectivity  in scientific  research.  Through  the study  of TOK,  students  question  the 
limitations  of the peer  review  process  and  extend  their  thinking  to an assessment  of objectivity  in other 
areas of knowledge.Nature of science
8 Chemistry guide
What is the purpose of studying chemistry?
As one  of the three  natural  sciences  in the IB Diploma  Programme,  chemistry  is primarily  concerned  with 
identifying  patterns  that  allow  us to explain  matter  at the microscopic  level.  This  then  allows  us to predict 
and  control  matter’s  behaviour  at a macroscopic  level.  The subject  therefore  emphasizes  the development 
of representative  models  and  explanatory  theories,  both  of which  rely heavily  on creative  but rational 
thinking.  Given  the pattern-seeking  nature  of chemistry,  the development  of generalized  rules  and 
principles  also  plays  an important  part  in knowledge  production,  as do the concrete  statements  provided 
by mathematical laws.
How is knowledge acquired in chemistry?
With  its roots  in the practice  of alchemy,  chemistry  maintains  a strong  emphasis  on empirical 
experimentation.  However,  with  advances  in technology,  it now  extends  its reach  beyond  the limits  of the 
human  senses  at a macroscopic  level  and  into  fields  such  as spectroscopy  and  computer  molecular 
modelling.  Insights  from  these  technologies  often  require  thorough  mathematical  analysis  before  being 
accepted  as valid  justifications  for scientific  claims.  In all their  investigative  work,  chemists  must  qualify 
confidence  in their  discoveries  by considering  potential  errors  related  to methodology  or limitations  in 
measuring equipment.
What is the impact of chemistry?
As outlined  in the “Nature  of science ” section,  the pursuit  of scientific  knowledge  does  not occur  in 
isolation.  In chemistry,  developments  in fields  such  as biofuels  or catalysis  often  have  impacts  far beyond 
the boundaries  of academic  research.  Honest  and  clear  communication  to audiences  beyond  the scientific 
domain  is therefore  essential.  The retraction  of a 2019  research  paper  by Dr Frances  Arnold,  a Nobel 
laureate  in chemistry,  due  to unreproducible  data  is a good  example  of embracing  this ethical 
responsibility.
How is the nature of chemistry engaged with?
The Diploma Programme chemistry course supports teaching through:
• approaches to learning
• nature of science
• skills in the study of chemistry.
The Diploma Programme chemistry course supports learning in several ways.
• It offers a balanced experimental programme—Students are encouraged to become familiar with 
traditional experimentation techniques, as well as the application of technology where possible. These 
opportunities help them to develop their investigative skills and evaluate the impact of error in 
scientific inquiry.
• The scientific investigation—This places a specific emphasis on inquiry-based skills and the formal 
communication of scientific knowledge.
• The collaborative sciences project—This extends the development of scientific communication in a 
collaborative and interdisciplinary context, allowing students to work together beyond the confines of 
one specific syllabus.

Distinction between SL and HL
Students at SL and HL share the following.
• An understanding of science through a stimulating experimental programme
• The nature of science as an overarching theme
• The study of a concept-based syllabus
• One piece of internally assessed work, the scientific investigation
• The collaborative sciences project
The SL course  provides  students  with  a fundamental  understanding  of chemistry  and  experience  of the 
associated  skills.  The HL course  requires  students  to increase  their  knowledge  and  understanding  of the 
subject,  including  additional  mathematical  skills,  and  so provides  a solid  foundation  for further  study  at 
university level.
The SL course  has a recommended  150 teaching  hours,  compared  to 240 hours  for the HL course.  This 
difference  is reflected  in the additional  content  studied  by HL students.  Some  of the HL content  is 
conceptually  more  demanding  and  explored  in greater  depth.  The distinction  between  SL and  HL is 
therefore  one  of both  breadth  and  depth.  The increased  breadth  and  depth  at HL result  in increased 
networked  knowledge,  requiring  the student  to make  more  connections  between  diverse  areas  of the 
syllabus.
Chemistry and the core
Chemistry and theory of knowledge
The TOK  course  plays  a special  role  in the DP by providing  opportunities  for students  to reflect  on the 
nature,  scope  and  limitations  of knowledge  and  the process  of knowing  through  an exploration  of 
knowledge questions.
The areas  of knowledge  (AOK)  are specific  branches  of knowledge,  each  of which  can be seen  to have  a 
distinct  nature  and  sometimes  use different  methods  of gaining  knowledge.  In TOK,  students  explore  five 
compulsory AOK: history, the human sciences, the natural sciences, mathematics and the arts.
There  are several  different  ways  in which  aspects  of the chemistry  course  can be connected  to the 
exploration of knowledge. During the teaching and learning of the chemistry course, teachers and students 
evaluate  knowledge  claims  by exploring  questions  concerning  their  validity,  reliability,  credibility  and 
certainty, as well as individual and cultural perspectives on them.
Exploration  of the relationship  between  knowledge  and  TOK  concepts  can help  students  to deepen  their 
understanding  and  make  connections  between  disciplines.  For example,  while  discussing  the depletion  of 
energy  sources  and  the constant  need  for new  energy  resources  to meet  energy  demands,  students  can 
explore the concepts of responsibility, power and justification.
Many  aspects  of the chemistry  course  lend  themselves  to the exploration  of knowledge  questions.  Some 
examples are provided in the following table.

Chemistry and the extended essay
Students  who  choose  to write  an EE in chemistry  undertake  independent  research  as part  of an in-depth 
study of a focused topic. The topic for study may be generated from the chemistry course or may relate to a 
subject  area  beyond  the syllabus  content.  This  detailed  study  will help  develop  research,  thinking,  self-
management  and  communication  skills,  which  will support  students’  learning  in the chemistry  course,  and 
in further studies.
Examples of areas for research topics
• Environmental chemistry—removing heavy metals or pesticides from the soil or water sources; 
measuring the amount of and effects of acid deposition.
• Food chemistry—investigating the stability of certain pigments or vitamins and the shelf life of certain 
molecules in food.
• Materials chemistry—assessing the durability or other chemical/physical properties of compounds, 
mixtures or metals.
Students and supervisors must ensure that an EE does not duplicate other work submitted for the diploma.
For more  information,  please  refer  to the Extended  essay  guide  and  the  Extended  essay  teacher  support 
material .
Chemistry and creativity, activity, service
The CAS  component  of the DP core  provides  many  opportunities  for students  to link science  concepts  and 
topics  to practical  experiences.  Teachers  can highlight  how  knowledge  and  understanding  developed 
through  the course  might  inform  meaningful  experiences.  Outside  the classroom,  CAS  experiences  might 
also ignite students’ passion for addressing topics inside the chemistry classroom.
Some examples of relevant CAS experiences are as follows.
• Organizing a science club for students in lower years
• Implementing environmental initiatives within the school or local community, such as recycling, 
composting and roof gardens
• Organizing or participating in a social media outreach or advocacy campaign, for example, on an 
environmental or health concern
CAS  experiences  can be a single  event  or may  be an extended  series  of events.  It is important  that  CAS 
experiences be distinct from and not submitted as part of a chemistry assessment.
For more  information,  please  refer  to the Creativity,  activity,  service  guide  and  the  Creativity,  activity,  service

Chemistry and international-mindedness
Science has been, and continues to be, a truly international endeavour. From the beginnings of seismology 
in China,  through  material  science  in Mesopotamia  to astronomy  in the Islamic  Golden  Age,  the search  for 
an objective  understanding  of the natural  world  transcends  the limitations  imposed  by national 
boundaries. The scientific process, requiring curiosity, insight and an open-minded approach, benefits from 
the widest possible participation across genders and cultures through inclusivity and diversity.Nature of chemistry
11 Chemistry guide
Given  the global  nature  of many  scientific  issues,  international  organizations  often  have  a focus  on the 
engagement of science with the public domain. The World Health Organization and the Intergovernmental 
Panel  on Climate  Change  are two  well-known  examples  that  model  a responsibility  to inform  nations  of 
scientific  progress  on an equitable  basis.  Underlying  this responsibility  is the interest  of promoting  a 
peaceful and sustainable future.
Advancements  in technology,  along  with  the cost  of modern  research  facilities,  continues  to reinforce  the 
role  of international  collaborative  work.  The project  between  the Joint  Institute  of Nuclear  Research  in 
Russia and the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory in the USA to provide evidence for the existence of 
element 118, oganesson, is a good example of international collaboration.
The importance  of collaboration  in contemporary  science  is reflected  by the large  number  of international 
organizations  tasked  with  collating  and  sharing  data  with  the scientific  community.  Access  to shared 
knowledge  through  websites  and  databases  must  be integrated  into  classroom  teaching  as it plays  an 
important role in validating experimental work.
In addition to integrating technology and collaborative work, the collaborative sciences project provides an 
excellent opportunity for students to engage with global issues.
Teachers  are encouraged  to consider  the questions  posed  in the “Teaching  in context”  section  in the TSM, 
to allow students to reflect on where and how science might interact with society. These conversations may 
also introduce ethical questions such as those identified in the TOK syllabus.
Chemistry and the IB learner profile
Each  box provides  an example  of how  each  learner  profile  attribute  could  be modelled  by learners  and 
teachers.
Example attribute
• Learners who best embody the attribute with reference to science.
• Directing teachers with possible routes to develop the attribute in the classroom.
• Practical ways in which learners demonstrate the attribute in the process of “doing” science.
Attributes of the IB learner profile
Inquirer
• Inquirers are curious, they actively use research skills, work independently and show enthusiasm 
about the world around them.
• Teachers facilitate skill development and promote inquiry; they provide students with opportunities 
to ask questions, search for answers, and experiment.
• Learners use their inquiry skills to extend their scientific knowledge and engage with research.
Knowledgeable
• Learners explore concepts, ideas and issues related to science in order to broaden and deepen their 
understanding of factual and procedural knowledge.

knowledge and understanding.
• Learners apply their knowledge to unfamiliar contexts and make connections between concepts and 
facts to illustrate their understanding of science.
Thinker
• Learners are eager to solve complex problems and reflect on their thinking strategies.Nature of chemistry
12 Chemistry guide
Thinker
• Teachers provide opportunities for learners to critically analyse their approaches and methods and 
deepen their understanding of science, allowing them to be creative in finding solutions to problems.
• Learners practise reasoning and critical thinking by testing assumptions, formulating hypotheses, 
interpreting data and drawing conclusions from the evidence provided.
Communicator
• Learners collaborate effectively with others and use a variety of modes of communication to express 
their ideas and opinions.
• Teachers facilitate group work, encourage open discussions and the use of the scientific language to 
provide models for successful communication.
• Learners demonstrate effective communication skills as part of collaborative activities through 
listening to others and sharing ideas.
Principled
• Learners take responsibility for their work, promote shared values and act in an ethical manner.
• Teachers can provide opportunities to model principled behaviour including acknowledging the 
work of others and citing sources. The collaborative sciences project provides opportunities for 
learners to take a principled stance.
• Learners appreciate the importance of integrity in data collection and consider all data, even that 
which does not match their original hypothesis.
Open-minded
• Open-minded learners accept that different perspectives, models or hypotheses exist, and these can 
be used to enhance scientific understanding.
• Teachers can provide models that were at the time supported by data or observations, but through 
reasoning, deduction or falsification may be rejected or refined.
• Learners need to be prepared to have their perspectives and ideas challenged through the study of 
science.
Caring
• Learners act to protect the environment and to improve the lives of others.
• Teachers can draw attention to how daily choices have consequences by challenging learners to 
adopt sustainable practice and providing support to help fellow learners. Reference should be made 
to the Sciences experimentation guidelines .
• Learners can connect curriculum content to global challenges such as healthcare, energy supply or 
food production. The collaborative sciences project provides an opportunity for learners to support 
each other to enable their group to achieve their goal successfully.
Risk-taker
• Risk-takers seek new opportunities to develop their learning and explore new approaches to solve 
problems. They actively thrive on challenges.
• Teachers can provide support and guidance for learners, encouraging them to explore new 
techniques or methods of learning. This might include scaffolds for the use of language, the design of 
experiments and the analysis of data. As learners grow in confidence, these supports can be phased 
out giving them more freedom to choose their own approach.Nature of chemistry
13 Chemistry guide
Risk-taker
• Learners should be prepared for the next set of experimental data to falsify their ideas as uncertainty 
is a feature of science. They understand that this is a step forward in their understanding.
Balanced
• Balanced learners look holistically at all aspects of their development and ensure that various tasks 
are given appropriate attention without focusing on one to the detriment of others.
• Teachers should encourage learners to consider a balanced perspective on scientific issues without 
bias.
• Learners need to organize their own time effectively, giving themselves sufficient time to complete 
all parts of their learning without negatively impacting on the emotional and social aspects of their 
lives.
Reflective
• Reflective learners consider why and how they achieve success, and also how they could change their 
approach when learning is difficult.
• Teachers provide opportunities for learners to continually review strategies, methods, techniques 
and approaches to problem-solving in order to improve their conceptual understandings in science. 
Assessment criteria or checklists can help learners to consider the quality of their work in a guided 
way.
• Learners develop skills and concepts throughout the course, networking their knowledge by 
continually reflecting on their understanding.Nature of chemistry
14 Chemistry guide
The approaches to learning framework
What are approaches to learning skills and why do we teach them?
The approaches  to learning  (ATL)  framework  seeks  to develop  in students  affective,  cognitive  and 
metacognitive  skills  that  will support  their  learning  processes  during  and  beyond  their  IB experience.  The 
development  of ATL skills  is closely  connected  with  the IB learner  profile  attributes  and  therefore  helps  to 
advance  the IB mission.  The ATL skills  are an integral  part  of IB learning  and  teaching  that  should  be 
developed  across  the whole  programme—it  is not expected  that  a single  course  should  ever  address  all of 
them.
How are they organized?
The ATL framework  for IB programmes  consists  of five general  skill categories:  thinking  skills, 
communication  skills,  social  skills,  research  skills  and  self-management  skills.  Each  of these  categories 
covers  a broad  range,  as shown  by the examples  presented  in the table  below.  The ATL skill categories  are 
closely linked and interrelated and therefore individual skills may be relevant to more than one category.
How do we teach them?
ATL skills can be learned and taught, improved with practice and developed incrementally. The table below 
illustrates,  through  a number  of examples,  how  the chemistry  course  can support  ATL skill development. 
The examples  shown  in the table  are not exhaustive.  Teachers  are encouraged  to adapt  them  for use in 
their school context and collaboratively identify further examples of ATL skill development.
Further  information  on the ATL framework  and  strategies  for the development  of the ATL skills  can be 
found  in the Chemistry  teacher  support  material  and  the Diploma  Programme  Approaches  to teaching  and 
learning website .

Experimental programme
Integral  to the student  experience  of a chemistry  course  is the learning  that  takes  place  through  scientific 
inquiry  within  the classroom  or laboratory.  Experimentation  through  a variety  of forms  can be used  to 
introduce  a topic,  address  a phenomenon  or allow  students  to consider  and  examine  authentic  questions 
and curiosities.
A school’s  experimental  programme  should  allow  students  to experience  the full breadth  and  depth  of the 
course,  develop  scientific  skills  and  demonstrate  safe,  competent  and  methodical  use of a range  of tools, 
techniques and equipment. Students should therefore be encouraged to develop investigations to support 
their  learning  through  open-ended  inquiry  with  a focus  on laboratory  experiments,  databases,  simulations 
and modelling.Approaches to the teaching and learning of chemistry
16 Chemistry guide
Conceptual learning
Concept-based teaching and learning is encouraged across the continuum of IB programmes.
Concepts  are mental  representations  of categories.  They  are constructed,  modified  and  activated  by the 
learner  through  learning  experiences.  Concepts  do not exist  in isolation  but are interrelated.  Conceptual 
understanding is always a work in progress—it is continually being developed and refined.
Conceptual  understanding  is therefore  an outcome  of a non-linear,  ongoing  process  of evolving 
understandings,  adapting  previous  understandings,  and  identifying  and  dispelling  misconceptions.  It 
consists  of making  connections  between  prior  and  new  knowledge  to construct  and  build  an awareness  of 
this network of knowledge.
Concepts vary in their level of abstraction and universality.
• They can be organizing ideas that are applicable in many contexts and have relevance both within and 
across subject areas.
• They can provide a deep understanding of specific knowledge fields (or fields of knowledge) and help 
to organize knowledge further, as well as reveal connections between different areas of the subject.
For example,  consider  the following  sequence  of three  concepts,  which  shows  the more  specific  focus  of 
each concept.
Change > Reactivity > Collision theory
In other words, collision theory is a component in understanding chemical reactivity, which in turn helps to 
develop  an understanding  of change  in chemistry.  The sequence  could  be extended  further  to look  at 
concepts  such  as particle,  collision  and  reaction,  all of which  provide  a basis  for understanding  collision 
theory.
Outcomes of a concept-based approach
Fostering critical thinking, the outcome of a concept-based approach is that students are able to:
• identify examples of a concept
• organize, reflect on, modify and expand their network of knowledge
• apply concepts to existing and future knowledge
• apply their conceptual understanding as a scientific thinking tool for predicting outcomes, justifying 
conclusions and evaluating knowledge claims.
Structure of the syllabus and conceptual understanding
The structure of this chemistry syllabus is intended to promote concept-based teaching and learning.
There  are two  organizing  concepts  in the chemistry  roadmap:  structure  and  reactivity . Each  of these 
concepts  is subdivided  into  topics  and  subtopics,  which  are all connected  through  the idea  that  structure 
determines reactivity, which in turn transforms structure.
Each of the 22 subtopics is headed by a guiding question to give a sense of what is covered. The purpose of 
these  guiding  questions  is to promote  inquiry—they  are therefore  not straightforward  and  best  answered 
once  the associated  understandings  have  been  acquired.  Teachers  and  students  are encouraged  to create 
their own guiding questions to capture the content of units of study.
Several  linking  questions  are associated  with  understandings  throughout  this guide.  Linking  questions  are 
intended  to promote  the skills  in the study  of chemistry  and  highlight  links  between  the course 
understandings, encouraging students to look at an understanding from a different perspective, originating 
in a different part of the course. They are designed to facilitate these connections and their ideal outcome is 
to promote a highly networked understanding of chemistry.
For example,  the trend  in reactivity  down  group  1 is connected  to several  parts  of the course—it  illustrates 
the organization  of elements  in the periodic  table,  can be explained  in terms  of ionization  energies,  is 
related  to the electron  configuration  and  exemplifies  the tendency  of metals  to be oxidized.  The linking 
questions  found  in the guide  are not exhaustive.  Students  and  teachers  may  encounter  other  connections 
between understandings and concepts in the syllabus, leading them to create their own linking questions.
Teaching chemistry in context
The study  of chemistry  enables  constructive  engagement  with  topical  scientific  issues.  By contextualizing 
chemical concepts, scientific knowledge claims can be evaluated more effectively, and informed choices on 
such issues as human health and the environment can be made. Chemical research has brought innovation 
and  benefit  to many  fields  and  continues  to be at the heart  of seeking  effective  solutions  to many  global 
challenges.  It is therefore  important  to explore  applications  of chemistry  in our world  while  teaching  the 
course to elicit interest, understanding and curiosity.
Teaching  the content  of the course  in relation  to specific  contexts  supports  the pedagogical  principle  of 
teaching in local and global contexts as part of the approaches to teaching framework and offers a number 
of advantages.  First,  it helps  students  relate  their  learning  to genuine  applications  of chemistry, 
highlighting  the relevance  to global  issues  as well  as the significance  in students’  own  contexts.  Second,  it 
develops  an appreciation  for the interaction  between  scientific  solutions  and  their  implications,  be it 
ethical,  environmental  or economic.  Third,  it helps  to illustrate  some  of the NOS  aspects  underpinning  the 
course.
The Chemistry teacher support material  highlights possible areas that could be visited throughout the course 
and  that  may  provide  context  for some  topics  to stimulate  the application  of ideas  and  problem-solving 
skills.  Consideration  of these  and  related  areas  may  help  provide  ideas  for the scientific  investigation,  the 
collaborative sciences project, TOK exhibition, CAS, or an EE in chemistry or world studies.
Engaging with sensitive topics
Students  and  teachers  are encouraged  to engage  with  exciting,  stimulating  and  personally  relevant  topics 
and  issues  that  may  be, at times,  sensitive  or personally  challenging.  Teachers  should  be aware  of this and 
provide  guidance  on how  to engage  with  such  topics  in a responsible  manner.  Consideration  should  be 
given to the personal, political and spiritual values of others.
Prior learning
Past  experience  shows  that  students  will be able  to study  chemistry  at SL successfully  with  no background 
in, or previous  knowledge  of, science.  Their  approach  to learning,  characterized  by the IB learner  profile 
attributes, will be significant here.
However,  for most  students  considering  the study  of chemistry  at HL, while  there  is no intention  to restrict 
access,  some  previous  exposure  to formal  science  education  would  be necessary.  Specific  topic  details  are 
not specified,  but students  who  have  undertaken  the IB Middle  Years  Programme  (MYP)  or studied  an 
equivalent national science qualification or a school-based science course would be well prepared for an HL 
subject.
Links to the Middle Years Programme
The MYP  sciences  courses  seek  to promote  skills  and  attitudes  needed  to apply  scientific  knowledge  in 
theoretical,  experimental  and  authentic  contexts.  A strong  foundation  is established  for DP sciences  in 
which  learners  will capitalize  on—and  continue  advancing—their  skills  and  attitudes  to develop 
knowledge and understanding commensurate with pre-university level science.
The MYP offers a framework for learning and teaching while maintaining flexibility with curriculum content. 
The content  in MYP  sciences  courses  can therefore  vary  greatly  from  one  school  to another.  Content  in DP 
sciences  courses  is more  prescribed,  and  this is one  of the main  differences  teachers  will notice  when 
comparing the two programmes.Approaches to the teaching and learning of chemistry
18 Chemistry guide
A connected, conceptual curriculum where learning is inquiry-based and contextualized is the pedagogical 
principle  that  underpins  both  programmes  and  indeed  the entire  IB continuum  (International 
Baccalaureate, 2019).
Conceptual  learning  focuses  on organizing  ideas  and  their  interconnections.  A conceptual  approach  is 
encouraged in IB programmes because it promotes deep learning and facilitates the construction of further 
knowledge. Conceptual understanding aids the application of knowledge in unfamiliar and novel contexts. 
This skill is reflected in the aims and assessment objectives of both programmes.
Broad  concepts  frame  MYP  learning  and  teaching  with  the purpose  of unifying  ideas  across  subject  areas. 
Discipline-specific related concepts are intended to provide disciplinary depth (International Baccalaureate, 
2014). Key and related concepts are not required in the DP, although some teachers may find that they wish 
to continue  developing  a curriculum  around  them.  In DP sciences,  overarching  concepts  are manifested  in 
the course  roadmaps  and  the NOS.  DP sciences  seek  to highlight  the interconnectedness  of the course 
understandings.  The intention  is to promote  conceptual  understanding  and  further  the construction  of 
learners’ knowledge networks.
Both  MYP  and  DP teaching  involve  inquiry-based  approaches,  which  foster  a high  degree  of student 
engagement,  collaboration  and  interaction.  The inquiry,  design,  experimental,  analysis,  evaluation  and 
communication  skills  encouraged  by criteria  B and  C will serve  students  well  as they  prepare  to undertake 
the scientific  investigation  for the internal  assessment  (IA).  In addition,  MYP  students  will gain  familiarity 
with  criterion-related  assessment  and  the use of assessment  criteria,  which  will further  support  their 
understanding of the DP sciences IA criteria.
IB programmes encourage the exploration of scientific principles in connection to local and global contexts. 
Doing  so helps  students  ground  abstract  concepts  in more  concrete  local  and  global  real-world  situations 
as well  as cultivating  international-mindedness  (see  the “Approaches  to teaching”  section  in Diploma 
Programme Approaches to teaching and learning website ). Teachers should therefore weave opportunities for 
contextualization  into  the curriculum.  MYP  sciences  criterion  D analyses  the real-world  application  of 
science.  In the DP, sciences  teachers  are encouraged  to frequently  anchor  their  teaching  in real-world 
applications that are invoked throughout the course of the programme.
In addition  to equipping  students  with  scientific  knowledge  and  skills,  the MYP  and  DP sciences  courses 
share similar guiding principles that seek to develop in students the learner profile attributes.
Links to the Career-related Programme
In the Career-related  Programme  (CP),  students  study  at least  two  DP subjects,  a core  consisting  of four 
components and a career-related study, which is determined by the local context and aligned with student 
needs.  The CP has been  designed  to add  value  to the students’  career-related  studies.  This provides  the 
context  for the choice  of DP courses.  The chemistry  course  can assist  CP students  planning  careers  in a 
variety  of professional  fields  where,  for example,  a sound  understanding  of science  and  mathematical  skills 
are important.  This  includes  healthcare,  technological  and  manufacturing  industries,  and  engineering. 
While  chemistry  helps  students  understand  the underlying  science  in the contemporary  world,  it also 
encourages  the development  of strong  problem-solving,  critical  thinking  and  ethical  approaches  that  will 
assist students in the global workplace.Approaches to the teaching and learning of chemistry
19 Chemistry guide
The collaborative sciences project is an interdisciplinary sciences project, providing a worthwhile challenge 
to DP and  CP students,  addressing  real-world  problems  that  can be explored  through  the sciences.  The 
nature  of the challenge  should  allow  students  to integrate  factual,  procedural  and  conceptual  knowledge 
developed through the study of their disciplines.
Through  the identification  and  research  of complex  issues,  students  can develop  an understanding  of how 
interrelated systems, mechanisms and processes impact a problem. Students will then apply their collective 
understanding  to develop  solution-focused  strategies  that  address  the issue.  With  a critical  lens  they  will 
evaluate and reflect on the inherent complexity of solving real-world problems.
Students  will develop  an understanding  of the extent  of global  interconnectedness  between  regional, 
national,  and  local  communities,  which  will empower  them  to become  active  and  engaged  citizens  of the 
world. While addressing local and global issues, students will appreciate that the issues of today exist across 
national boundaries and can only be solved through collective action and international cooperation.
The collaborative  sciences  project  supports  the development  of students’  ATL skills,  including 
teambuilding,  negotiation  and  leadership.  It facilitates  an appreciation  of the environment,  and  the social 
and ethical implications of science and technology.
Full details of the requirements are in the Collaborative sciences project guide .

Purpose of internal assessment
Internal  assessment  is an integral  part  of the course  and  is compulsory  for both  SL and  HL students.  It 
enables students to demonstrate the application of their skills and knowledge, and to pursue their personal 
interests,  without  the time  limitations  and  other  constraints  that  are associated  with  written  examinations. 
The internal  assessment  should,  as far as possible,  be woven  into  normal  classroom  teaching  and  not be a 
separate activity conducted after a course has been taught.
The internal assessment requirements at SL and at HL are the same.
Guidance and authenticity
The scientific  investigation  (SL and  HL) submitted  for internal  assessment  must  be the student’s  own  work. 
However, it is not the intention that students should decide upon a title or topic and be left to work on the 
internal  assessment  component  without  any further  support  from  the teacher.  The teacher  should  play  an 
important  role  during  both  the planning  stage  and  the period  when  the student  is working  on the 
internally assessed work. It is the responsibility of the teacher to ensure that students are familiar with:
• the requirements of the type of work to be internally assessed
• the Sciences experimentation guidelines  publication
• the assessment criteria. Students must understand that the work submitted for assessment must 
address these criteria effectively.
Teachers and students must discuss the internally assessed work. Students should be encouraged to initiate 
discussions  with  the teacher  to obtain  advice  and  information,  and  students  must  not be penalized  for 
seeking guidance. As part of the learning process, teachers should read and give advice to students on one 
draft  of the work.  The teacher  should  provide  oral  or written  advice  on how  the work  could  be improved, 
but not edit the draft. The next version handed to the teacher must be the final version for submission.
It is the responsibility of teachers to ensure that all students understand the basic meaning and significance 
of concepts  that  relate  to academic  integrity,  especially  authenticity  and  intellectual  property.  Teachers 
must  ensure  that  all student  work  for assessment  is prepared  according  to the requirements  and  must 
explain  clearly  to students  that  the internally  assessed  work  must  be entirely  their  own.  Where 
collaboration between students is permitted, it must be clear to all students what the difference is between 
collaboration and collusion.
All work  submitted  to the IB for moderation  or assessment  must  be authenticated  by a teacher,  and  must 
not include  any known  instances  of suspected  or confirmed  malpractice.  Each  student  must  confirm  that 
the work  is their  authentic  work  and  constitutes  the final  version  of that  work.  Once  a student  has officially 
submitted the final version of the work, it cannot be retracted. The requirement to confirm the authenticity 
of work applies to the work of all students, not just the sample work that will be submitted to the IB for the 
purpose  of moderation.  For further  details,  refer  to the IB publications  Academic  integrity  policy , Diploma 
Programme:  From  principles  into  practice  and  the relevant  general  regulations  (in Diploma  Programme 
Assessment procedures ).
Authenticity may be checked by discussion with the student on the content of the work, and by scrutiny of 
one or more of the following.
• The student’s initial proposal
• The first draft of the written work
• The references cited
Assessment
Internal assessment
71 Chemistry guide
• The style of writing compared with work known to be that of the student
• The analysis of the work by a web-based plagiarism detection service such as www.turnitin.com
The same piece of work cannot be submitted to meet the requirements of both the IA and the EE.
Time allocation
Internal  assessment  is an integral  part  of the chemistry  course,  contributing  20%  to the final  assessment  in 
the SL and  the HL courses.  This  weighting  should  be reflected  in the time  that  is allocated  to teaching  the 
knowledge,  skills  and  understanding  required  to undertake  the work,  as well  as the total  time  allocated  to 
carry out the work.
It is recommended  that  a total  of approximately  10 hours  (SL and  HL) of teaching  time  should  be allocated 
to the work. This should include:
• time for the teacher to explain to students the requirements of the internal assessment
• class time for students to work on the internal assessment component and ask questions
• time for consultation between the teacher and each student
• time to review and monitor progress, and to check authenticity.
Safety requirements and recommendations
It is the responsibility  of everyone  involved  in science  education  to make  an ongoing  commitment  to safe 
and healthy practical work.
The working  practices  and  protocols  should  be effective  in safeguarding  students  and  protecting  the 
environment. Schools are responsible for following national or local guidelines, which differ from country to 
country. The Chemistry teacher support material  provides some further guidance.
Using assessment criteria for internal assessment
For internal  assessment,  a number  of assessment  criteria  have  been  identified.  Each  assessment  criterion 
has level  descriptors  describing  specific  achievement  levels,  together  with  an appropriate  range  of marks. 
The level  descriptors  concentrate  on positive  achievement,  although  for the lower levels  failure  to achieve 
may be included in the description.
Teachers  must  judge  the internally  assessed  work  at SL and  at HL against  the criteria  using  the level 
descriptors.
• The same assessment criteria are provided for SL and HL.
• The aim is to find, for each criterion, the descriptor that conveys most accurately the level attained by 
the student, using the best-fit model. A best-fit approach means that compensation should be made 
when a piece of work matches different aspects of a criterion at different levels. The mark awarded 
should be one that most fairly reflects the balance of achievement against the criterion. It is not 
necessary for every single aspect of a level descriptor to be met for that mark to be awarded.
• When assessing a student’s work, teachers should read the level descriptors for each criterion until 
they reach a descriptor that most appropriately describes the level of the work being assessed. If a 
piece of work seems to fall between two descriptors, both descriptors should be read again and the 
one that more appropriately describes the student’s work should be chosen.
• Where there are two marks available within a level, teachers should award the upper marks if the 
student’s work demonstrates the qualities described to a great extent; the work may be close to 
achieving marks in the level above. Teachers should award the lower marks if the student’s work 
demonstrates the qualities described to a lesser extent; the work may be close to achieving marks in 
the level below.
• Only whole numbers should be recorded; partial marks (fractions and decimals) are not acceptable.
• Teachers should not think in terms of a pass or fail boundary but should concentrate on identifying the 
appropriate descriptor for each assessment criterion.
• The highest level descriptors do not imply faultless performance but should be achievable by a 
student. Teachers should not hesitate to use the extremes if they are appropriate descriptions of the 
work being assessed.
• A student who attains a high achievement level in relation to one criterion will not necessarily attain 
high achievement levels in relation to the other criteria. Similarly, a student who attains a low 
achievement level for one criterion will not necessarily attain low achievement levels in the other 
criteria. Teachers should not assume that the overall assessment of the students will produce any 
particular distribution of marks.
• It is recommended that the assessment criteria be made available to students.
Internal assessment details—SL and HL
The scientific investigation
Duration: 10 hours
Weighting: 20%
The IA requirement  is the same  for biology,  chemistry  and  physics.  The IA, worth  20%  of the final 
assessment, consists of one task—the scientific investigation.
The scientific  investigation  is an open-ended  task  in which  the student  gathers  and  analyses  data  in order 
to answer their own formulated research question.
The outcome  of the scientific  investigation  will  be assessed  through  the form  of a written  report.  The 
maximum overall word count for the report is 3,000 words.
The following are not included in the word count.
• Charts and diagrams
• Data tables
• Equations, formulas and calculations
• Citations/references (whether parenthetical, numbered, footnotes or endnotes)
• Bibliography
• Headers
The following details should be stated at the start of the report.
• Title of the investigation
• IB candidate code (alphanumeric, for example, xyz123)
• IB candidate code for all group members (if applicable)
• Number of words
There is no requirement to include a cover page or a contents page.
Facilitating the scientific investigation
The research  question  should  be of interest  to the student,  but it is not necessary  that  it encompasses 
concepts beyond those described by the understandings within the guide.
The scientific investigation undertaken must have sufficient extent and depth to allow for all the descriptors 
of the assessment criteria to be meaningfully addressed.
The investigation of the research question must involve the collection and analysis of quantitative data that 
should be supported by qualitative observations where appropriate.
The scientific  investigation  allows  a wide  range  of techniques  for data  gathering  and  analysis  to be 
employed. The approaches that could be used in isolation or in conjunction with each other are as follows.
• Hands-on practical laboratory workInternal assessment
73 Chemistry guide
• Fieldwork
• Use of a spreadsheet for analysis and modelling
• Extraction and analysis of data from a database
• Use of a simulation
The Chemistry teacher support material  contains further guidance on these possible approaches.
Teachers must:
• ensure that students are familiar with the assessment criteria
• ensure that students are able to investigate their individual research question
• counsel the students on whether their proposed methodology is feasible in consideration of available 
time and resources
• ensure that students have given appropriate consideration to safety, ethical and environmental factors 
before undertaking the action phase
• remind students of the requirements for academic integrity and the consequences of academic 
malpractice. The difference between collaboration and collusion must be made clear.
Developing the research question
Each  student  is expected  to formulate,  investigate  and  answer  a unique  research  question,  seeking  advice 
from their teacher.
A student must not present the same set of raw data as another student.
Methodology for individual work
Each  student  develops  their  own  methodology  to answer  their  individual  research  question.  The student 
investigates by:
• manipulating an independent variable
or
• selecting variables during fieldwork
or
• selecting different data from external databases.
The student might seek support from peers when collecting data.
Methodology for collaborative work
Collaborative  work  is optional  and  where  it is facilitated  the groups  formed  must  be no larger  than three 
students.  Students  may  organize  their  own  groups.  The teacher  must  provide  guidance  to ensure  that  all 
students  are fully  engaged  in the collaborative  activity.  Students  must  clearly  understand  the requirement 
to conduct an individual investigation.
The methodology  developed  to answer  their  individual  research  question  may  be in part  the outcome  of 
collaborative  activity.  A student  within  the group  investigates  their  individual  research  question  by 
manipulating:
• a different independent variable from those selected by other group members
or
• the same independent variable with a different dependent variable from those selected by other 
group members
or
• different data from those selected by other group members from within a larger communally acquired 
data set.
In this context,  collaborative  work  is permitted  under  the understanding  that  the final  report  presented  for 
assessment is that of the individual student. A report by the group is not permitted. All authoring, including 
the description  of the methodology,  must  be done  individually.  This  diagram  illustrates  a possible  route 
through the IA process where students collaborate.

A possible route through collaborative work
Class collaboration to set up a database
A school  may  take  part  in a large-scale  activity  collecting  data  to generate  a database  using  standardized 
protocols.  If a student  decides  to utilize  this database  in order  to answer  their  research  question,  then  the 
investigation  must  be treated  as a database  investigation.  In such  a case  the methodology  should  be 
focused on the way the data is filtered and sampled from the whole database in the same way as if the data 
was wholly acquired from an external source.
Assessing the scientific investigation
The performance  in IA at both  SL and  HL is marked  against  common  assessment  criteria,  with  a total  mark 
out of 24. Student work is internally assessed by the teacher and externally moderated by the IB.
The four assessment criteria are as follows.Internal assessment
75 Chemistry guide
• Research design
• Data analysis
• Conclusion
• Evaluation
Each  assessment  criterion  has level  descriptors  describing  specific  achievement  levels,  together  with  an 
appropriate  range  of marks.  The level  descriptors  concentrate  on positive  achievement,  although  for the 
lower levels failure to achieve may be included in the description.
Teachers  must  judge  the internally  assessed  work  at SL and  at HL against  the criteria  using  the level 
descriptors  and  aided  by the clarifications.  The criteria  must  be applied  systematically  using  a best-fit 
approach—when  a piece  of work  matches  different  aspects  of a criterion  at different  levels  the mark 
awarded  should  be one  that  most  fairly  reflects  the balance  of achievement  against  the criterion.  It is not 
necessary  for every  single  aspect of a level descriptor  to be met  for that  mark  to be awarded.  The highest 
level descriptors do not imply faultless performance.
Where  there  are two  or more  marks  available  within a level,  teachers  should  award  the upper  mark  if the 
student’s  work  largely  satisfies  the qualities  described;  the work  may be close  to achieving  marks  in the 
level  above.  Teachers should award the lower marks if the student’s work demonstrates the qualities 
described to a lesser extent; the work may be close to achieving marks in the level below.
Only whole numbers must be recorded; partial marks (fractions and decimals) are not acceptable.
The criteria  should  be considered  independently.  A student  who  attains  a high  achievement  level  in 
relation  to one  criterion  will not necessarily  attain  high  achievement levels  in relation  to the other  criteria. 
Similarly,  a student  who  attains  a low achievement  level for one  criterion  will not necessarily  attain  low 
achievement  levels  for the other  criteria.  Teachers  should not assume that the overall  assessment  of the 
students will produce any particular distribution of marks.
Where  command  terms  are used  in the level  descriptors,  they  are to be interpreted  as indicated  in the 
“Glossary of command terms ” section of this guide. These command terms indicate the depth of treatment 
required. Command terms used within the descriptors are provided in the following table.

Research design
This  criterion  assesses  the extent  to which  the student  effectively  communicates  the methodology 
(purpose and practice) used to address the research question.
Marks Level descriptor
0 The report does not reach the standard described by the descriptors below.
1–2 • The research question is stated without context.
• Methodological considerations associated with collecting data relevant to the 
research question are stated.
• The description of the methodology for collecting or selecting data lacks the detail 
to allow for the investigation to be reproduced.
3–4 • The research question is outlined within a broad context.
• Methodological considerations associated with collecting relevant and sufficient 
data to answer the research question are described.
• The description of the methodology for collecting or selecting data allows for the 
investigation to be reproduced with few ambiguities or omissions.
5–6 • The research question is described within a specific and appropriate context.
• Methodological considerations associated with collecting relevant and sufficient 
data to answer the research question are explained.
• The description of the methodology for collecting or selecting data allows for the 
investigation to be reproduced.
Clarifications for research design
A research question with context should contain reference to the dependent and independent variables 
or two correlated variables, include a concise description of the system in which the research question is 
embedded, and include background theory of direct relevance.
Methodological considerations include:
• the selection of the methods for measuring the dependent and independent variables
• the selection of the databases or model and the sampling of data
• the decisions regarding the scope, quantity and quality of measurements (e.g. the range, interval or 
frequency of the independent variable, repetition and precision of measurements)
• the identification of control variables and the choice of method of their control
• the recognition of any safety, ethical or environmental issues that needed to be taken into account.
The description of the methodology refers to presenting sufficiently detailed information (such as specific 
materials used and precise procedural steps) while avoiding unnecessary or repetitive information, so that 
the reader may readily understand how the methodology was implemented and could in principle repeat 
the investigation.
Data analysis
This  criterion  assesses  the extent  to which  the student’s  report  provides  evidence  that  the student  has 
recorded, processed and presented the data in ways that are relevant to the research question.
Marks Level descriptor
0 The report does not reach a standard described by the descriptors below.
1–2 • The recording and processing of the data is communicated but is neither clear nor 
precise.
• The recording and processing of data shows limited evidence of the consideration 
of uncertainties.
• Some processing of data relevant to addressing the research question is carried out 
but with major omissions, inaccuracies or inconsistencies.
3–4 • The communication of the recording and processing of the data is either clear or 
precise.
• The recording and processing of data shows evidence of a consideration of 
uncertainties but with some significant omissions or inaccuracies.
• The processing of data relevant to addressing the research question is carried out 
but with some significant omissions, inaccuracies or inconsistencies.
5–6 • The communication of the recording and processing of the data is both clear and 
precise.
• The recording and processing of data shows evidence of an appropriate 
consideration of uncertainties.
• The processing of data relevant to addressing the research question is carried out 
appropriately and accurately.
Clarifications for data analysis
Data refers to quantitative data or a combination of both quantitative and qualitative data.
Communication
• Clear communication means that the method of processing can be understood easily.
• Precise communication refers to following conventions correctly, such as those relating to the 
annotation of graphs and tables or the use of units, decimal places and significant figures.
Consideration of uncertainties is subject specific and further guidance is given in the Chemistry teacher 
support material .
Major omissions, inaccuracies or inconsistencies impede the possibility of drawing a valid conclusion that 
addresses the research question.
Significant omissions, inaccuracies or inconsistencies allow the possibility of drawing a conclusion that 
addresses the research question but with some limit to its validity or detail.
Conclusion
This  criterion  assesses  the extent  to which  the student  successfully  answers  their  research  question  with 
regard to their analysis and the accepted scientific context.
Marks Level descriptor
0 The report does not reach a standard described by the descriptors below.
1–2 • A conclusion is stated that is relevant to the research question but is not supported 
by the analysis presented.
• The conclusion makes superficial comparison to the accepted scientific context.
3–4 • A conclusion is described that is relevant to the research question but is not fully 
consistent with the analysis presented.
• A conclusion is described that makes some relevant comparison to the accepted 
scientific context.
5–6 • A conclusion is justified that is relevant to the research question and fully consistent 
with the analysis presented.
• A conclusion is justified through relevant comparison to the accepted scientific 
context.
Clarifications for conclusion
A conclusion that is fully consistent requires the interpretation of processed data including associated 
uncertainties.
Scientific context refers to information that could come from published material (paper or online), 
published values, course notes, textbooks or other outside sources. The citation of published materials 
must be sufficiently detailed to allow these sources to be traceable.
Evaluation
This  criterion  assesses  the extent  to which  the student’s  report  provides  evidence  of evaluation  of the 
investigation methodology and has suggested improvements.
Marks Level descriptor
0 The report does not reach a standard described by the descriptors below.
1–2 • The report states generic methodological weaknesses or limitations.
• Realistic improvements to the investigation are stated.
3–4 • The report describes specific methodological weaknesses or limitations.
• Realistic improvements to the investigation that are relevant to the identified 
weaknesses or limitations, are described.
5–6 • The report explains the relative impact of specific methodological weaknesses or 
limitations.
• Realistic improvements to the investigation, that are relevant to the identified 
weaknesses or limitations, are explained.
Clarifications for evaluation
Generic is general to many methodologies and not specifically relevant to the methodology of the 
investigation being evaluated.
Methodological refers to the overall approach to the investigation of the research question as well as 
procedural steps.
