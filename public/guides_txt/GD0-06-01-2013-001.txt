Introduction

The Diploma Programme

The Diploma Programme is a rigorous pre-university course of study designed for students in the 16 to
19 age range. It is a broad-based two-year course that aims to encourage students to be knowledgeable
and inquiring, but also caring and compassionate. There is a strong emphasis on encouraging students to
develop intercultural understanding, open-mindedness, and the attitudes necessary for them to respect
and evaluate a range of points of view.

The Diploma Programme hexagon
The course is presented as six academic areas enclosing a central core (see figure 1). It encourages the
concurrent study of a broad range of academic areas. Students study: two modern languages (or a modern
language and a classical language); a humanities or social science subject; an experimental science;
mathematics; one of the creative arts. It is this comprehensive range of subjects that makes the Diploma
Programme a demanding course of study designed to prepare students effectively for university entrance.
In each of the academic areas students have flexibility in making their choices, which means they can
choose subjects that particularly interest them and that they may wish to study further at university.

The Diploma Programme

Choosing the right combination
Students are required to choose one subject from each of the six academic areas, although they can choose
a second subject from groups 1 to 5 instead of a group 6 subject. Normally, three subjects (and not more
than four) are taken at higher level (HL), and the others are taken at standard level (SL). The IB recommends
240 teaching hours for HL subjects and 150 hours for SL. Subjects at HL are studied in greater depth and
breadth than at SL.
At both levels, many skills are developed, especially those of critical thinking and analysis. At the end of
the course, students’ abilities are measured by means of external assessment. Many subjects contain some
element of coursework assessed by teachers. The course is available for examinations in English, French and
Spanish.

The core of the hexagon
All Diploma Programme students participate in the three course requirements that make up the core of
the hexagon. Reflection on all these activities is a principle that lies at the heart of the thinking behind the
Diploma Programme.
The theory of knowledge course encourages students to think about the nature of knowledge, to reflect
on the process of learning in all the subjects they study as part of their Diploma Programme course, and
to make connections across the academic areas. The extended essay, a substantial piece of writing of up to
4,000 words, enables students to investigate a topic of special interest that they have chosen themselves.
It also encourages them to develop the skills of independent research that will be expected at university.
Creativity, action, service involves students in experiential learning through a range of artistic, sporting,
physical and service activities.

The IB mission statement and the IB learner profile
The Diploma Programme aims to develop in students the knowledge, skills and attitudes they will need
to fulfill the aims of the IB, as expressed in the organization’s mission statement and the learner profile.
Teaching and learning in the Diploma Programme represent the reality in daily practice of the organization’s
educational philosophy.

Introduction

Nature of the subject

All dance is expressive movement with intent, purpose and structure, which communicates through the
body and gestures of the dancer. Dance is a vital and integral part of human life. It exists over time in many
forms and styles and is practised in all traditions and cultures, taking place in a range of contexts for various
purposes. Dance functions as ritual, as artistic endeavour, as social discourse, as recreation and as education.
Dance is always evolving, as innovations develop alongside or from traditional forms and practices. Dance
works may be seen as social and historical texts reflecting the cultures from which they emerge. Often these
works may be considered as emerging texts that shape and determine the direction in which culture is
moving.
Dance is a unique medium for learning about self and the world. It is one essential component of artistic,
aesthetic and cultural education, and develops creative potential through physical expression. In dance, the
integration of body, mind and spirit helps participants learn skills that are transferable to other disciplines
and to their daily lives.
Consistent with the educational philosophy of the IB, the Diploma Programme dance curriculum aims for a
holistic approach to dance, and embraces a variety of dance traditions and dance cultures—past, present
and looking towards the future. Performance, creative and analytical skills are mutually developed and
valued whether the students are writing papers or creating/performing dances. The curriculum provides
students with a liberal arts orientation to dance. This orientation facilitates the development of students
who may become choreographers, dance scholars, performers or those, more broadly, who seek life
enrichment through dance.

Distinction between SL and HL
The recommended teaching times—150 hours (SL) and 240 hours (HL)—indicate a clear distinction between
the time allowed for the completion of course assignments at SL and at HL. This differentiation between the
two levels is reflected in both the breadth and depth of study.
The aims and assessment objectives are the same at both SL and HL, with additional assessment objectives
at HL. The assessment criteria for SL and HL are related, with additional requirements at HL.
In the teaching of the dance course it should be possible to have groups of students that include both
SL and HL students. Through a variety of teaching approaches, all students—whether SL or HL—will be
encouraged to develop their creative and critical abilities and to enhance their appreciation and enjoyment
of dance.
Both SL and HL students are required to compose dances, and to analyse the process.
•

SL students compose two dance works, 6–10 minutes in total.

•

HL students compose three dance works (two of which must be contrasting), 8–15 minutes in total.

All students must also document the evolution of one of these dances.
•

At SL, students must use no more than 800 words.

•

At HL, students must use no more than 1,000 words.

Dance guide

Nature of the subject

In addition, HL students are required to discuss how connections made across the three components of
study may have influenced their choreography in the making of one dance work.
Both SL and HL students explore, compare and contrast dances from different cultures and/or traditions
through practical and theoretical investigation. Students are required to write a dance investigation.
•

At SL, students must use no more than 1,500 words.

•

At HL, students must use no more than 2,500 words.

Furthermore, HL students are required as part of their dance investigation to present an in-depth
comparative discussion of two short excerpts from dances chosen from different cultures and/or traditions.
SL and HL students may specialize in any style of dance performance but must experience more than one
style from more than one culture and/or tradition.
•

SL students are required to perform one or two dances of their choice, 3–6 minutes in total.

•

HL students are required to perform two or three dances of their choice, 6–9 minutes in total.

All students must also write short programme notes.
Throughout their studies, all students are advised to keep in mind the ”Nature of the subject”, which
describes dance as “expressive movement” that exists “in many forms and styles and is practised in all
traditions and cultures, taking place in a range of contexts for various purposes”.

Prior learning
While prior dance experience is not mandatory at SL, it is recommended. At HL it is very strongly
recommended.
The Diploma Programme dance course is designed to offer students the opportunity to build on prior
experience in dance while encouraging a broad approach to the subject. Supporting the principles of the
IB mission statement, which aims to foster student appreciation of diverse world cultures and traditions, the
course allows the possibility to choose a specific dance style to study in depth.
IB Diploma Programme dance provides an appropriate foundation for further study in dance history, theory
and practice at university level, or in dance career pathways. It also provides an enriching and valuable
course of study for students who may pursue other careers. This course also provides all students with the
opportunity to engage in the world of dance as lifelong participants.

Links to the Middle Years Programme
Those students who have completed the IB Middle Years Programme (MYP) will already have engaged
in a structured learning process in the performing and visual arts. MYP students will have developed an
inquiring, reflective approach to their work, as well as an understanding of the role of the arts in society, in
the world and in their own lives. This will allow them to develop further their experiences, skills, knowledge
and conceptual understanding in dance at Diploma Programme level. Reflection pursued in a sense of
inquiry, evaluation, artistic self-expression, collaboration and communication are all intrinsic to the beliefs
and values that inspire IB arts courses.

Nature of the subject

Dance and theory of knowledge
Students of group 6 subjects study the various artistic ways through which knowledge, skills and attitudes
from different cultural traditions are developed and transmitted. These subjects, known collectively as “the
arts”, allow students to investigate and reflect on the complexities of the human condition. By exploring a
range of materials and technologies, students should aim to develop an understanding of the technical,
creative, expressive and communicative aspects of the arts.
Students of group 6 subjects analyse knowledge from various perspectives, and they acquire this knowledge
through experiential means as well as more traditional academic methods. The nature of the arts is such that
an exploration of the areas of knowledge in general, and knowledge of the different art forms specifically,
can combine to help us understand ourselves, our patterns of behaviour and our relationship to each other
and our wider environment.
Group 6 subjects complement the theory of knowledge (TOK) ethos by revealing interdisciplinary
connections and allowing students to explore the strengths and limitations of individual and cultural
perspectives. Studying the arts requires students to reflect on and question their own bases of knowledge.
In addition, by exploring other Diploma Programme subjects in an artistic fashion, students can gain
an understanding of the interdependent nature of knowledge and are encouraged to become “active,
compassionate and lifelong learners who understand that other people, with their differences, can also be
right” (IB mission statement).
Whether dance be a recreation, a ritual or an artistic expression, it shares the educational concerns and
interests of TOK. During the IB Diploma Programme dance course, questions such as the following should
enable students to critically reflect on the various ways of knowing and on the teaching and learning
methods used in group 6.
•

Why are the arts important?

•

What do the subjects that make up the arts have in common?

•

What are the roles of emotion and reason in the arts?

•

To what extent do the other Diploma Programme subjects have “artistic” qualities?

•

What are the standards by which we judge art? Can we justify these standards, and, if so, how?

•

What moral responsibilities does the artist have? Are they different to those of any other “knower”?

•

What are the similarities between dance and other art forms such as sculpture, music, painting? What
are the unique characteristics of each form in the transmission of ”knowledge”?

•

What are the similarities and differences between knowledge found in dance and knowledge found in
other areas of endeavour such as human sciences, natural sciences or mathematics?

•

As movement is usually the primary language of dance, how does that language communicate? Can it
take the place of words? Is it possible for dance to make a narrative statement through movement?

•

How are ethics involved in dance? Does the creator or the dancer have a responsibility to improve the
human condition?

•

To what extent is knowledge gained by studying, creating, performing or viewing dance? How does
this knowledge differ from other ways of knowing?

•

How important is it for an audience to understand a choreographer’s intention?

•

Does dance bear a responsibility to reflect the economic, social and psychological conditions of the
time and place in which it occurs or was created?

•

Consider the relationship between dance and technology. In what ways are dance and technology
interactive from the point of view of dance makers and dance viewers?

6

Dance guide

Nature of the subject

•

The nature of dance is ephemeral. What are the implications of this for any knowledge contained in or
transmitted by dance?

•

Should a dance work be allowed to adjust over time? Is it still the same dance?

•

How does dance evoke an emotional response from the viewer? Is this a way of knowing?

•

What does it mean to say “I know” a dance work?

Some of these questions are reiterated within the syllabus at the end of each of the component sections.
Teachers and their students are encouraged to use these examples as part of their exploration of the
interrelationship between TOK and dance, and to explore further questions of their own.

Dance and the international dimension
The IB Diploma Programme dance course embraces the understanding that dance is a global discourse.
The course is constructed so that all students are given opportunities to study a variety of world dance
traditions through exposure to physical practice and observation as well as written investigation. Examining
dance from both familiar and unfamiliar cultures and/or traditions develops comparative-thinking skills and
deepens students’ understanding of their own culture(s) as well as those of others.
The curriculum is designed to challenge students. It draws on a wide range of dance cultures that reflect
varied histories, practices and aesthetics. Nonetheless, doing so establishes the important idea or belief
that there are common parameters in dance across different cultural contexts. Whether performed for their
communities, with their communities or for their personal pleasure, dances have—and serve—a conscious
intention, and involve space, time and energy.
The IB Diploma Programme dance course recognizes that standards of excellence can be applied crossculturally.

and at HL it is 240 hours.
The requirements of the Diploma Programme (DP) dance course are such that students at both SL and HL
will need to work with other dance students. Although it is not mandatory that these students are following
the DP dance course, these students must be from the DP dance students’ school.

Syllabus

Approaches to the teaching and learning of dance

In the teaching of the dance course it should be possible to have groups of students that include both
SL and HL students. Through a variety of teaching approaches, all students—whether SL or HL—will be
encouraged to develop their creative and critical abilities and to enhance their appreciation and enjoyment
of dance.
The dance course has three components of study.
•

Composition and analysis

•

World dance studies

•

Performance

The course has an in-built flexibility, allowing the study of diverse world dance cultures and/or traditions
and styles. Students are required and encouraged to explore dance from cultures and/or traditions distant
from their areas of familiarity.
Teachers need to encourage their students through instruction and activities that challenge and develop
their understanding in all three components while simultaneously encouraging them to make creative
connections in their work. Students are encouraged to avail themselves of opportunities for collaborative
work, including work with students from other arts disciplines, in order to further their own learning.
The dance teacher should be able to engage students in discussions that analyse, examine, interpret and
evaluate dances in a variety of performance contexts.
Ideally, the dance teacher must be able to base his or her teaching on existing expertise in:
•

the technical aspects of at least one dance culture and/or tradition

•

the making of dances

•

knowledge of the history and aesthetics regarding his or her own dance culture and/or tradition.
This will enable the teacher to guide students in their investigation of other dance cultures and/or
traditions.

Primary and secondary sources
In order to provide their students with knowledge that extends beyond their own area of expertise
teachers must be alert to literary, audio, oral and visual resources available within their own communities
and beyond. Reference to primary sources such as live performances, as well as interviews with local
practitioners of diverse dance cultures, is strongly recommended. Consulting secondary sources is also
strongly recommended. It is the school’s and the dance teacher’s responsibility to provide appropriate
resources and/or consultants.

Dance guide

13

Approaches to the teaching and learning of dance

Resources
Students and teachers will require access to:
•

media players (DVDs/videos)

•

library resources (books, periodicals, DVDs/videos and the internet)

•

audio equipment and/or live accompanists

•

designated dance space appropriate to the style(s) being studied.

It is important that teachers familiarize their students with the principles of learning as articulated in this
guide. They should refer to this guide regularly, and use it as an ongoing reference point.

Activities
Throughout their studies, all students are advised to keep in mind the “Nature of the subject”, which
describes dance as “expressive movement” that exists “in many forms and styles and is practised in all
traditions and cultures, taking place in a range of contexts for various purposes”.
A varied range of activities is encouraged wherever possible, including the following.
•

Masterclasses and workshops (as well as interviews) with visiting and local artists, and with
practitioners of diverse dance cultures and/or traditions

•

Field trips to concerts, workshops and dance festivals outside school

•

Ongoing acquisitions of literary, audio and visual materials for the school library

Teachers are expected to facilitate an ongoing dialogue in relation to student work, including the following.
•

Presentations of work in progress to the school community

•

Practice in writing critiques of masterpieces as seen on DVDs/videos or in live performance

•

Encouraging and fostering discussions in critiquing students’ creative work during class time

It is important that students adopt a proactive approach, take responsibility for their own learning, and seek
the necessary advice from their teacher.
Students will need substantially more guidance on the content of the course during the early stages.
However, throughout the teaching of the course they should be encouraged to develop critical-thinking
skills and participate in inquiry-based learning. Students should work both individually and collaboratively,
working towards informed engagement. It is important that both teachers and students refer to the IB
learner profile.

Ethical guidelines
As part of the collective consideration of the school, dance students must be supported in maintaining
an ethical perspective during their course. (Student submissions must contain no gratuitously violent
movement material, for example.)

As a performer what do you bring personally to the work (for example, consider your technical
training, your familiarity with the culture in which the dance developed)?

•

Is this work comfortable for you or is it new territory for you?

•

Choose one dance—is there something you would change about your performance of it? Why, or why
not?

All teachers of the dance course are strongly encouraged to access the online curriculum centre (OCC)
at regular intervals. The OCC is a website on which all teachers can post inquiries, present examples of
good practice, ask for advice and access exemplar materials. The content of the dance forum on the OCC
is provided by dance teachers for dance teachers. The website also includes updates on resources and
frequently asked questions.

Health and safety guidelines
All schools are required to follow health and safety guidelines during their dance activities, as appropriate.
Each school should recognize and accept its responsibilities and obligations as an institution offering dance
to provide a safe and healthy working environment, and is ultimately responsible for the health and safety
of students and staff in all dance work.
Dance studios should be well ventilated and regularly cleaned and well maintained.
The following should be provided.
•

Smooth floor surface adequate in size and construction to the needs of the styles and traditions being
taught

•

Adequate, clean changing facilities

•

First-aid kits

Ongoing reflection
Reflective journal and glossary of dance terms
Students at SL and HL are encouraged to keep a journal or notes of ongoing reflections on significant
experiences throughout the course, including:
•

performances seen

•

participatory experiences in their selected dance styles

•

responses to cross-cultural exposures.

These reflections should include a discussion of skills and techniques relevant to the styles the students are
learning. This will encourage students’ awareness of the particular challenges inherent in dance.
Keeping a journal of reflection pursued in a sense of inquiry provides an opportunity for connections to be
made across the course components, including the developing understanding and use of dance terms. The
journal will serve as a dialogue between student and teacher. It will also be valuable in the writing of the
analytical statement for composition and analysis, the investigation and the performance programme notes.
Students are encouraged to use dance vocabulary specific to their dance culture and/or tradition. A glossary
of dance terms is included in the appendices to this guide.

Composition and analysis
In this part of the course, the focus is on the making of dances, and on identifying and analysing the
processes through which student dances are composed or arranged.
Composition and analysis is designed to encourage students to think creatively, and to explore movement
possibilities and ways of manipulating dance vocabularies to articulate an intention. In building dances,
students explore different ways of structuring dances. Through class discussions and teacher commentaries
during the two-year course of study, students develop an understanding of movement principles and how
to apply them in an effective manner in each dance. Students learn both how dance structures support
diverse viewpoints, ideas and purposes, and how form, content and function interrelate.
For the purposes of this course, it is important to refer to the “Glossary of dance terms” for the difference
between terms, including “composition”, “arrangement” and “structured improvisation”.
Students will need sufficient opportunities to practise the skills required by this part of the course in order to
allow them to meet the assessment requirements. Students are required to create original dances. However,
students may create one arrangement of a long-standing established dance.
As part of their studies in composition and analysis, HL students are required to create some dances that are
of contrasting compositional nature.
Students will analyse and examine their work, including through writing an analytical statement. Students
are required to demonstrate their understanding of how the compositional structure of their work supports
Dance guide

Syllabus content

particular viewpoints, ideas and purposes. They are also required to demonstrate how form, content and
function interrelate. Students should also be able to discuss all of these elements in relation to works
choreographed by others. In addition, HL students must make connections across all aspects of their dance
learning, noting how doing so may influence their compositional work.

Theory of knowledge: potential connections
•
As movement is usually the primary language of dance, how does that language communicate?
Can it take the place of words? Is it possible for dance to make a narrative statement through
movement?
•

How are ethics involved in dance? Does the creator or the dancer have a responsibility to
improve the human condition?

•

To what extent is knowledge gained by studying, creating, performing or viewing dance? How
does this knowledge differ from other ways of knowing?

•

How important is it for an audience to understand a choreographer’s intention?

•

Consider the relationship between dance and technology. In what ways are dance and
technology interactive from the point of view of dance makers and dance viewers?

World dance studies
The study of this part of the course requires that students, through dancing, classroom activity and
individual investigation, develop:
•

an appreciation of the diversity of dance practices throughout the world

•

the ability to investigate dance cultures and/or traditions, both familiar and unfamiliar to the students

•

a theoretical knowledge and practical experience of selected dances from two cultures and/or
traditions

•

the ability to describe the similarities and differences between the historical contexts of selected
dance cultures and/or traditions

•

the ability to analyse the similarities and differences between the historical and current social and
cultural context within each selected dance culture and/or tradition

•

the ability to identify and analyse dance elements in selected dance cultures and/or traditions in order
to understand their similarities and differences

•

the ability to use and cite appropriate sources (both primary and secondary)

•

the ability to organize and present the written investigation coherently.

The study of this part of the course requires that HL students also:
•

compare and contrast two short excerpts from two dances selected from two dance cultures and/or
traditions.

As part of their world dance studies, HL students are required to focus in depth on one aspect (or a limited
number of aspects) of a short excerpt from each of the dance works investigated in their report. The student
focus is to be that of observer, not as maker of the dances being compared. Two dances must be chosen: one
from a dance culture and/or tradition that is familiar and one that is unfamiliar to the students.
Please note that HL students may not choose to submit the dances studied in this component of the course
as part of their dance performance for internal assessment.
18

Dance guide

Syllabus content

Students at SL and HL are strongly encouraged to explore several dances from more than one distinctly
different dance culture and/or tradition, both familiar and unfamiliar to the students. (Teachers should
refer to the section “Nature of the subject” in order to contextualize this.) The investigation will include
an exploration of structure/form in dances as well as compositional elements. Teachers and students are
encouraged to make use of local resources and to avail themselves of the traditions of oral history.
It is important to refer to the definition of “investigate” as used in this guide. (Please see the ”Glossary of
command terms”.)
The outcome of the world dance studies component of the course will be a written investigation that draws
upon both practical and theoretical knowledge.

Examples of approaches to the dance investigation
The following examples illustrate ways in which the investigation might be approached.

Student A
This student is from Ghana and grew up participating in the traditional dances of his ethnic group as part
of family and village social gatherings. He has also recently become a member of a school dance club that
focuses on fusing indigenous dances and hip-hop music, as gleaned from MTV (Music Television) and
popular movies. His dance investigation explores the history and evolution of Gahu (one of the dances of
his tradition) in relation to that of African-American Ring Shout in the African-American tradition in North
America, of which he has no prior knowledge. Part of his study may address an instance in which each of
these dances has served as a vehicle for political commentary and social change. He may touch on ways
that each dance has influenced contemporary social dance vocabularies. His sources are his own practice
(of Gahu and one Ring Shout), interviews (including their transcriptions) with teachers and village elders,
videotapes, an international encyclopedia of dance and various websites.
If student A is an HL student, he will then need to develop some practical knowledge of the unfamiliar dance
culture and/or tradition (North American African-American Ring Shout) and a more developed practical
knowledge of an excerpt from a dance in his familiar dance culture and/or tradition (Gahu). The former need
not necessarily be knowledge of an excerpt from a dance.
Student A could investigate a 32-count excerpt from Gahu Dance and Drum as performed, for example, by
the Nukporfe Dance/Drumming Ensemble of Binghampton University, United States (http://www.youtube.
com/watch?v=G1L_dZuLj1I, from 1:20 minutes onwards) 2 June 2010.
Similarly, student A could investigate a 32-count excerpt from Ring Shout as performed, for example, by
The Georgia Geechee Gullah Shouters (http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k9lNZabFiLg&feature=related)
2 June 2010.
Student A will then, as part of his HL dance investigation, focus on a written comparative response to the
composition of these two short excerpts, one from Gahu and one from Ring Shout.

Student B
This student is from California, USA and has extensive training in ballet and Irish step dance. Her dance
investigation focuses on ballet and hula. After providing a brief historical background to each style in
relation to its cultural and traditional context, she includes a synopsis of particular dances in both ballet
and hula. Her dance investigation compares either one of the village dances from the ballet Les Noces or
the Dance of the Cygnets (pas de quatre) from Act 2 of Swan Lake with a segment from the hula epic Holo
Mai Pele [Pele’s Travels] to support her discussion concerning the relationship in each case between dance
elements and the representation of women. Her sources range from her own ballet training to interviews
with a local hula teacher and practitioner with whom she has been taking several workshops. She has also
watched videos of Swan Lake or Les Noces, and Kuma Hula and excerpts from the Merrie Monarch Hula
Festival, which is televised each year in Hawaii. The student has read articles on each of the dances she
describes and other literature on the roles of and for women in dance.

Syllabus content

If student B is an HL student, she will then need to develop some practical knowledge of the unfamiliar
dance culture and/or tradition (an excerpt from the hula Holo Mai Pele) and a more developed practical
knowledge of an excerpt from a dance in her familiar dance culture and/or tradition (an excerpt from one of
the village dances from the ballet Les Noces or the Dance of the Cygnets (pas de quatre) from Swan Lake). The
former need not necessarily be knowledge of an excerpt from a dance.
Student B could investigate a 32-count excerpt from Consecration of the Bride as performed, for example,
by The Royal Ballet (http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yi-5mugSiX4) 2 June 2010. Alternatively, she could
investigate a 32-count excerpt from Dance of the Cygnets as performed, for example, by the American Ballet
Theater (http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9rosHlrnzFw) 2 June 2010.
Similarly, student B could investigate a 32-count excerpt from Holo Mai Pele as performed, for example, by
the Kumu Hula and Halau o Kekuhi (http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GkZ13bcHKgA, from 2:11 to 4:34
minutes) 2 June 2010.
Student B will then, as part of her HL dance investigation, focus on a written comparative response to the
composition of these two short excerpts, one from Les Noces or Swan Lake and one from Holo Mai Pele.

Theory of knowledge: potential connections
•
Does dance bear a responsibility to reflect the economic, social and psychological conditions
of the time and place in which it occurs or was created?
•

As movement is usually the primary language of dance, how does that language communicate?
Can it take the place of words? Is it possible for dance to make a narrative statement through
movement?

•

How are ethics involved in dance? Does the creator or the dancer have a responsibility to
improve the human condition?

•

Consider the relationship between dance and technology. In what ways are dance and
technology interactive from the point of view of dance makers and dance viewers?

•

Should a dance work be allowed to adjust over time? Is it still the same dance?

Performance
This component is based on the practice and presentation of dance. The primary intention is to engage
students in elements of dance artistry from classroom practice through to the performance of dance for
viewing by others.
Students may specialize in any style of performance, but must experience more than one style drawn from
more than one dance culture and/or tradition. Their study must prepare them to present one or more styles
for assessment at the end of the course.
This study requires that students develop and demonstrate technical and performance skills, performing in
solo/duet work. Students may also present group work.
Technical skills include:
•

body strength

•

control

•

coordination

•

spatial awareness

•

•

projection

•

phrasing

•

stylistic integrity

•

relationship to other performers

•

relationship to the audience

•

•

interpretative sensitivity appropriate to the work.

Programme notes
Students must prepare programme notes. Through the articulation required in developing programme
notes, students are better placed to think about the intention of the piece and, in turn, give personal
shaping to their interpretation. Teachers are encouraged from the beginning of the course to support their
students in reflecting on the communicative intentions of the dances.
For each dance that students present, the programme notes will include basic factual information. In
addition, students will also write an additional short statement focusing on the motivation of the dance and
their particular interpretation of the piece.

Assessment

Assessment in the Diploma Programme

General
Assessment is an integral part of teaching and learning. The most important aims of assessment in the
Diploma Programme are that it should support curricular goals and encourage appropriate student
learning. Both external and internal assessment are used in the Diploma Programme. IB examiners mark
work produced for external assessment, while work produced for internal assessment is marked by teachers
and externally moderated by the IB.
There are two types of assessment identified by the IB.
•

Formative assessment informs both teaching and learning. It is concerned with providing accurate
and helpful feedback to students and teachers on the kind of learning taking place and the nature of
students’ strengths and weaknesses in order to help develop students’ understanding and capabilities.
Formative assessment can also help to improve teaching quality, as it can provide information to
monitor progress towards meeting the course aims and objectives.

•

Summative assessment gives an overview of previous learning and is concerned with measuring
student achievement.

The Diploma Programme primarily focuses on summative assessment designed to record student
achievement at, or towards the end of, the course of study. However, many of the assessment instruments
can also be used formatively during the course of teaching and learning, and teachers are encouraged to
do this. A comprehensive assessment plan is viewed as being integral with teaching, learning and course
organization. For further information, see the IB Programme standards and practices document.
The approach to assessment used by the IB is criterion-related, not norm-referenced. This approach to
assessment judges students’ work by their performance in relation to identified levels of attainment, and
not in relation to the work of other students. For further information on assessment within the Diploma
Programme please refer to the publication Diploma Programme assessment: Principles and practice.
To support teachers in the planning, delivery and assessment of the Diploma Programme courses, a variety
of resources can be found on the OCC or purchased from the IB store (http://store.ibo.org). Teacher support
materials, subject reports, internal assessment guidance, grade descriptors, as well as resources from other
teachers, can be found on the OCC. Specimen and past examination papers, as well as markschemes, can be
purchased from the IB store.

Methods of assessment
The IB uses several methods to assess work produced by students.

Assessment criteria
Assessment criteria are used when the assessment task is open-ended. Each criterion concentrates on
a particular skill that students are expected to demonstrate. An assessment objective describes what
students should be able to do, and assessment criteria describe how well they should be able to do it. Using
assessment criteria allows discrimination between different answers and encourages a variety of responses.
Each criterion comprises a set of hierarchically ordered level descriptors. Each level descriptor is worth one
22

Dance guide

Assessment in the Diploma Programme

or more marks. Each criterion is applied independently using a best-fit model. The maximum marks for each
criterion may differ according to the criterion’s importance. The marks awarded for each criterion are added
together to give the total mark for the piece of work.

Markbands
Markbands are a comprehensive statement of expected performance against which responses are judged.
They represent a single holistic criterion divided into level descriptors. Each level descriptor corresponds
to a range of marks to differentiate student performance. A best-fit approach is used to ascertain which
particular mark to use from the possible range for each level descriptor.

Markschemes
This generic term is used to describe analytic markschemes that are prepared for specific examination
papers. Analytic markschemes are prepared for those examination questions that expect a particular kind
of response and/or a given final answer from the students. They give detailed instructions to examiners
on how to break down the total mark for each question for different parts of the response. A markscheme
may include the content expected in the responses to questions or may be a series of marking notes giving
guidance on how to apply criteria.

External assessment

Assessment criteria are used to assess students for all assessment tasks. The assessment criteria are
published in this guide.
For composition and analysis there are three criteria at SL and five criteria at HL.
For dance investigation there are five criteria at SL and six criteria at HL.
The descriptors are related to the assessment objectives established for the dance course. Different
assessment criteria are provided at SL and at HL.
Students should have access to the assessment criteria descriptors throughout the course of study.

External assessment details—SL and HL
Composition and analysis
Recommended teaching hours—60 hours at SL; 90 hours at HL
Weighting: 40% (SL), 35% (HL)
The purpose of the composition and analysis component is to assess the student’s ability to demonstrate
the following assessment objectives.
•

Identify the appropriate compositional processes and structures to support dances with different
subject matter or content (AO1)

•

Demonstrate the use of compositional craft to support the intention, form and content of the dances
(AO2)

•

Apply in the analytical statement the key terms and concepts used in developing dance composition(s)
(AO2)

•

Critically reflect upon the creative process of compositional problems encountered, including possible
appropriate solutions for future development (AO3)

•

Demonstrate control of compositional craft appropriate to each dance composition (AO4)

In addition at HL only, the purpose is to assess the student’s ability to demonstrate the following assessment
objectives.
•

Demonstrate compositional contrast across two of the three dance works (AO3)

•

Analyse and evaluate the influence and significance of connections from all three components of the
Diploma Programme dance course in the making of dance composition (AO3)

The task
Students must meet the following requirements.
•

Students at SL must compose two dances (a total length of 6–10 minutes) and write an analytical
statement (no more than 800 words).

•

Students at HL must compose three dances (a total length of 8–15 minutes) and write an analytical
statement (no more than 1,000 words).

The first dance composed by the student must be a solo, which is to be performed by the student himself
or herself.
The second dance composed by the student must be a solo or a duet, which is to be performed by another
student (or students) from the school.
One of the two dances may be an arrangement by the student of a traditional dance or standard repertoire.
Both composition submissions must be independent dance pieces performed and filmed in a studio setting
(not a theatrical stage setting). In order to ensure maximum recording visibility the works must be filmed
under working lights (not theatrical lighting) and students must wear regular practice clothes, not costumes.
While both composition submissions may be filmed at any time during the course, and students are
encouraged to complete one of the two dances during the first year of study, the final submission must
reflect the best that the student has achieved throughout the course.
Time limit
If students exceed the time limit, the examiner’s assessment must be based on the first 10 minutes of the
total time. In case of doubt, examiners are instructed to determine when the time limit has been exceeded.
Work that falls significantly short of the stated time requirement is unlikely to fully meet the stated
requirements of the task and is likely to receive low marks.

Dance guide

27

External assessment

Analytical statement
In addition, the student is required to write an analytical statement focusing on one submission. The length
of the analytical statement must be no more than 800 words.
Work that falls significantly short of the stated word count is unlikely to fully meet the stated requirements of
the task and is likely to receive low marks. The student must consult with his or her teacher before preparing
the analytical statement. Teachers must provide guidance about the writing skills needed and, to this end,
teachers are encouraged to challenge and support the student to write brief focused responses to dance(s)
that the student has engaged with during the course.
Although the analytical statement could refer briefly (in no more than 100 words) to the two dances, it must
specifically reflect upon the process of developing one of these dances.
In the analytical statement, the student must:
•

after a short summary, (briefly) present the intention of the dance.

The student must then critically discuss:
•

the basic ideas and images that motivated the dance

•

the compositional craft used, referring to basic dance elements (space, time and dynamics)

•

any compositional issues or compositional problems that arose in the process, and how these were, or
were not, resolved

•

the most successful aspects and, if the dance work were to be presented again, the possible changes
to be made, and why.

The student must use appropriate dance vocabulary, and dance vocabulary specific to the chosen dance
culture and/or tradition is encouraged.
If it is appropriate or useful, a discussion of the impact of outside sources (visual arts, literature, music,
natural phenomena, political and social events, commentary on such events) may be included in the
analytical statement. The analytical statement may contain photographs or other visual material in support
of the dance work.
Word limit
If students exceed the word limit, the examiner’s assessment must be based on the first 800 words. In case
of doubt, examiners are instructed to determine when the word limit has been exceeded.
Work that falls significantly short of the stated word count is unlikely to fully meet the stated requirements
of the task and is likely to receive low marks.

Composition and analysis criteria
The composition and analysis will be assessed using the three external assessment criteria.
The student composition and analysis will be measured by the:
•

overall impression of the dance works

•

craft demonstrated

•

analytical statement.

(See “External assessment criteria—SL”.)
The student should have access to the assessment criteria descriptors throughout the course of study.

The third dance, a group dance, may be an individual or collaborative composition. If the latter, this must be
a collaboration with a student within the school from another arts discipline. In either case, this third dance
must be a group dance performed by other dance students from the school.
One of the three dances may be an arrangement by the student of a traditional dance or standard repertoire.
In addition, HL students are required to display evidence of contrasting compositional nature in two of the
three works. The focus must be on:
•

how the form is supported by the selection of appropriate movements, movement development and/
or arrangement

•

use of space, time and dynamics.

(The required focus is not on the choice of subject matter, or music or accompanying sound.)
Two of the three composition submissions must be independent dance pieces performed and filmed in a
studio setting (not a theatrical stage setting). In order to ensure maximum recording visibility the works
must be filmed under working lights (not theatrical lighting) and students must wear regular practice
clothes, not costumes.
One of the three compositions may be filmed in a studio setting or a theatrical setting under working
lights (theatrical lighting may not be used). If costume is part of the essence of the performance of this
composition, costume may be worn—otherwise, students must wear regular practice clothes. If this
composition is a collaborative venture encompassing other media, and if the composition necessitates it,
the work may be filmed in another location. However, two of the three dances must be performed and
filmed in a studio setting.
While the three composition submissions may be filmed at any time during the course, and students are
encouraged to complete one of the three dances during the first year of study, the final submission must
reflect the best that the student has achieved throughout the course.
Time limit
If students exceed the time limit, the examiner’s assessment must be based on the first 15 minutes of the
total time. In case of doubt, examiners are instructed to determine when the time limit has been exceeded.
Work that falls significantly short of the stated time requirement is unlikely to fully meet the stated
requirements of the task and is likely to receive low marks.
Analytical statement
In addition, the student is required to write an analytical statement focusing on one submission.
The length of the analytical statement must be no more than 1,000 words.
Work that falls significantly short of the stated word count is unlikely to fully meet the stated requirements of
the task and is likely to receive low marks. The student must consult with his or her teacher before preparing
the analytical statement. Teachers must provide guidance about the writing skills needed and, to this end,
teachers are encouraged to challenge and support the student to write brief focused responses to dance(s)

were not, resolved

•

the most successful aspects and, if the dance work were to be presented again, the possible changes
to be made, and why.

•

The student must also include an analysis and evaluation of the influence and significance of
connections from all three components of study (composition and analysis, dance investigation,
performance) in the making of the one dance composition. (Please see “Syllabus content” for the
recommendation that all students keep a journal, and also “Approaches to the teaching and learning
of dance”.)

The student must use appropriate dance vocabulary, and dance vocabulary specific to the chosen dance
culture and/or tradition is encouraged.
If it is appropriate or useful, a discussion of the impact of outside sources (visual arts, literature, music,
natural phenomena, political and social events, commentary on such events) may be included in the
analytical statement. The analytical statement may contain photographs or other visual material in support
of the dance work.
Word limit
If students exceed the word limit, the examiner’s assessment must be based on the first 1,000 words. In case
of doubt, examiners are instructed to determine when the word limit has been exceeded.
Work that falls significantly short of the stated word count is unlikely to fully meet the stated requirements
of the task and is likely to receive low marks.

Composition and analysis criteria
The composition and analysis will be assessed using five external assessment criteria.
The student composition and analysis will be measured by the:
•

overall impression of the dance works

•

craft demonstrated

•

compositional contrast demonstrated across two of the three dances

•

analytical statement

•

analysis and evaluation of the connections from all three components of the dance course in the
making of the dance works.

(See “External assessment criteria—HL”.)
The student should have access to the assessment criteria descriptors throughout the course of study.

The compositions
In certain dance traditions in which composition is not appropriate for students, students may compose
instead in another style.
•

Students may choose to create as one of the two dances at SL, or three at HL, an arrangement of
existing standard repertoire or of a traditional dance.

•

If a student chooses to submit an arrangement, then a recording of the version from which the
arrangement was made must be included with the student’s submission. (Please refer to “Filming and
assessment procedures”.)

Structured improvisation alone will not be accepted as an independent work.

Advice, discussion and support, academic honesty
For further information regarding level of advice, discussion and support, and academic honesty, please see
“The role of the teacher in the external assessment components”.

Filming and assessment procedures
It is essential to refer to the Handbook of procedures for the Diploma Programme for information regarding
examination procedures. This document includes detailed instructions for filming student work (all
recordings must be submitted on DVD or other digital format specified by the IB and notified to schools).

Dance investigation—SL and HL
Recommended teaching hours—30 hours at SL; 60 hours at HL
Weighting: 20% (SL), 25% (HL)
The purpose of the written dance investigation is to assess the student’s ability to demonstrate the following
assessment objectives.
•

Describe the similarities and differences between the historical contexts of two dance cultures and/or
traditions (AO1)

•

Analyse the similarities and differences between the historical and the current context within each
selected dance culture and/or tradition (AO2)

•

Analyse the similarities and differences in the dance elements of two dance cultures and/or traditions
(AO2)

•

At HL only: Demonstrate an in-depth comparative discussion of two short dance excerpts from two
dance cultures and/or traditions (AO3)

•

Demonstrate organization of written material, including use and attribution of appropriate sources
(AO4)

The task
Each student is required to investigate two dance cultures and/or traditions and present their findings in a
formal written report. The student should consult with the teacher in choosing their dance cultures and/or
traditions.
The study must be an independent study and not a collaborative one. While discouraged from doing so,
students are not prohibited from choosing the same or similar dance cultures and/or traditions. Students
and their teachers are strongly encouraged to view this report as a sustained investigation that is selfdirected.
The report must not be more than 1,500 words in length at SL, and 2,500 words in length at HL.
The written investigation must include the following:
•

one dance culture and/or tradition that is familiar to the student, and

•

one dance culture and/or tradition that is unfamiliar to the student.

Both dance cultures and/or traditions must be distinct and different from each other. It is important that
students in their choice of familiar and unfamiliar cultures and/or traditions do not choose ones that are
too close for effective investigation. Hip-hop and break dance, for example, are both from the same dance
tradition and/or culture.
The focus of this written investigation into the two dance cultures and/or traditions must include:
•

the historical context

•

the current context—knowledge and understanding of the present-day social and cultural context
(including social, religious, political, spiritual and/or intellectual significance)—in relation to the
historical context

•

the elements in the dance—the particular use of the body (involving space, time and dynamics).

32

Dance guide

External assessment

The written investigation must address:
•

for the historical context and the elements in the dance, the similarities and differences between the
two dance cultures and/or traditions

•

for the current context (in relation to the historical context), the similarities and differences within
each selected dance culture and/or tradition.

The student must include, where appropriate, particular dances as examples. It is important that the student
develops both a theoretical and practical knowledge of the selected dance cultures and/or traditions. The
written report should make it clear why the student chose to investigate the particular dance cultures and/
or traditions.
The written report must be clearly organized and must include primary and secondary sources. Attributions
must be correct and acknowledged using a consistent system to guarantee the authenticity of the work.
(For further information, see ”Source material” in this section.) Care should be taken to maintain a sense
of proportion between the student’s own writing and the use of quotations to strengthen a particular
statement.
The written report must also refer to:
•

the intention

•

the dance structure/form

•

the choice of subject matter (whether narrative or abstract)

•

the choice of music or accompanying sound, or significant visual elements such as costumes and
props (if used).

The treatment of the two dance cultures and/or traditions in the written report must be balanced.
Dance terms must be used (see “Glossary of dance terms”) and dance vocabulary specific to the dance
cultures and/or traditions should be included where possible.
If it is appropriate or useful to illustrate points made, students may include visual material (for example,
drawings, photographs, diagrams) and/or audio material (for example, music scores or a CD recording of
musical excerpts—five minutes maximum). Visual recordings must not be included. If audio recordings are
made, it is essential to refer to the Handbook of procedures for the Diploma Programme.
Additional requirements at HL
In addition, HL students are required as part of their written investigation to write an in-depth comparative
discussion of two short excerpts from two dances from the two chosen dance cultures and/or traditions
(one from a familiar dance culture and/or tradition, one unfamiliar).
Students may not choose to perform these dances as part of their dance performance for internal
assessment.
This comparative discussion must be presented as a separate section towards the end of the written
report. (Nevertheless this section must be included in the main body of the investigation and before the
conclusion.)
When writing the in-depth comparative discussion HL students must:
•

focus on aspects of one or more dance elements (the particular use of the body, involving space, time
and dynamics) and/or movement development and/or arrangement (see “Glossary of dance terms”)

•

demonstrate, through their writing, some practical knowledge of one dance culture and/or tradition
(unfamiliar) and a more developed practical knowledge of the other (familiar), including movement
knowledge of the excerpt

Dance guide

33

External assessment

•

choose excerpts that are short enough to be considered in sufficient detail

•

discuss from the point of view of the observer, not the maker of the dance works.

Word limit
If students exceed the word limit, the examiner’s assessment must be based on the first 1,500 words at SL,
and the first 2,500 words at HL. In case of doubt, examiners are instructed to determine when the word limit
has been exceeded.
Diagrams and bibliography must not be included in the word count. Because of these parameters, care
must be taken both in using a computer word-count tool and then in stating the number of words.
Work that falls significantly short of the stated word count is unlikely to fully meet the stated requirements
of the task and is likely to receive low marks.

Assessment
Standard level
The student dance investigation will be assessed using five external assessment criteria:
•

knowledge and understanding of historical context (between each dance culture and/or tradition)

•

analysis of current context (within each selected dance culture and/or tradition in relation to historical
context)

•

analysis of dance elements

•

use and attribution of appropriate sources

•

organization of written material.

(See “External assessment criteria—SL”.)
The student should have access to the assessment criteria descriptors throughout the course of study.
Higher level
The student dance investigation will be assessed using six external assessment criteria:
•

knowledge and understanding of historical context (between each dance culture and/or tradition)

•

analysis of current context (within each selected dance culture and/or tradition in relation to historical
context)

•

analysis of dance elements

•

use and attribution of appropriate sources

•

organization of written material

•

comparative discussion.

(See “External assessment criteria—HL”.)
The student should have access to the assessment criteria descriptors throughout the course of study.
Source material
In carrying out the investigation, the student must consult various sources and should be urged to be
imaginative, bold and original in deciding which sources are appropriate and would prove useful. Students
must be encouraged to look at the validity of each source and to compare a variety of sources before
deciding which to use in their academic argument.
The student must include both primary and secondary sources.

34

Dance guide

External assessment

Primary sources include:
•

live performance

•

film/DVD/video of a complete live performance (not an excerpt)

•

workshop participation

•

dance notation

•

interviews and discussion (oral history) with practitioners and other figures of authority in the field

•

traditional practitioners, who can be highly significant in the historical analysis of dance—it should be
noted that in some cultures oral history provides the main source for such analysis.

Secondary sources include:
•

written texts, including material from the internet

•

photography

•

costumes, sets, props

•

musical scores

•

programmes

•

reviews

•

letters and journals.

Use of the internet in research
The internet is one of a range of investigation tools that students can use. However, caution must be taken
to ensure that internet sources are relevant to the subject. Students should avoid over reliance on internet
investigation in proportion to primary sources.
Citation of sources
Sources of information must be acknowledged both within the report and in a detailed bibliography. A consistent
format must be used (for example, the Modern Language Association (MLA)/the Harvard author-date system).
All internet sources must be accurately and completely cited in accordance with a consistent format. It is not
enough to simply cite the web page address. Students must state the author’s name if possible, title of the
article or entry and date on which the site was accessed. (For example: Antonio Gades. esflamenco.com. 18
February 2007. http://www.esflamenco.com/bio/en10498.html.)

The role of the teacher in the external assessment components
Prior to student completion of the first draft, the teacher is expected to:
•

inform the student of the requirements of the analytical statement (composition and analysis) and the
written investigation (dance investigation), including the differences between SL and HL

•

make the assessment criteria available to the student at all times

•

require the student in the early stages of the analytical statement and written dance investigation to
provide information of the intention and outline

•

encourage and support the student in the preparation of the work and facilitate access to resources

•

provide guidance on the investigative and written skills needed

•

ensure that the student understands what constitutes academic honesty and an authentic piece of
work, including how to cite sources.

Dance guide

35

External assessment

While the teacher is encouraged to discuss work with the student, the student must be allowed to make the
final choice of dance works and dance cultures and/or traditions and to develop his or her own ideas.
Through regular monitoring, the teacher must ensure that the work is the student’s own. Before the
submission of each final piece of work, the teacher must:
•

ensure that the student fills in each coversheet, signs it, gives the word count and, in the case of the
dance investigation, notes the familiar and unfamiliar dance cultures and/or traditions investigated,
including how these have been experienced (for example, through workshops)

•

complete and sign the coversheet.

Extended essays
If the same broad topic is chosen for different assessment components, that topic must be treated
completely differently—otherwise it may be considered a breach of regulations. A student who chooses to
write an extended essay in dance should focus on a research question that has no common ground with the
material of their individual investigation. (Please refer to the General regulations: Diploma Programme.)

Advice
During the process of completing the analytical statement (composition and analysis) and the written
investigation (dance investigation), the student should submit a comprehensive draft of the final version
of each to enable the teacher to give appropriate feedback. As part of this process, the teacher can give
advice to the student on this draft only. This advice can be either verbal or written, and can indicate the way
in which the work could be improved. If the advice is written, the teacher must not extensively annotate
or edit the student draft. The next version handed to the teacher after the first version must be the final
version.

Discussion and support
Students must not be penalized for seeking guidance. However, if a student could not have completed
the dance investigation without substantial support from the teacher, this should be recorded on the
appropriate form that accompanies the work from the Handbook of procedures for the Diploma Programme.

Academic honesty
Teachers must ensure that material submitted is the student’s own work. Students are ultimately responsible
for ensuring that all work submitted for assessment is authentic, with the work or ideas of others fully and
correctly acknowledged. Every student must also sign a declaration on the coversheet that is attached to
their work. In addition, teachers are also required to sign each coversheet (composition and analysis and
dance investigation) to confirm that, to the best of their knowledge, the work of each student is his or her
own work and constitutes the final version of that work. For further information about academic honesty,
teachers should refer to the latest edition of the IB publication Academic honesty.

Assessment

Internal assessment

Purpose of internal assessment
Internal assessment is an integral part of the course and is compulsory for both SL and HL students. It
enables students to demonstrate the application of their skills and knowledge, and to pursue their personal
interests, without the time limitations and other constraints that are associated with written examinations.
The internal assessment should, as far as possible, be woven into normal classroom teaching and not be a
separate activity conducted after a course has been taught.
The internal assessment requirements at SL and at HL for dance are the same in that all students are required
to submit the performance component. However, HL students are required to submit more work.

Guidance and authenticity
The SL and HL components submitted for internal assessment must be the student’s own work. However,
it is not the intention that students should decide upon a title, topic, idea or particular piece and be left to
work on the internal assessment component without any further support from the teacher. The teacher
should play an important role during both the planning stage and the period when the student is working
on the internally assessed work. It is the responsibility of the teacher to ensure that students are familiar
with:
•

the requirements of the type of work to be internally assessed

•

the assessment criteria; students must understand that the work submitted for assessment must
address these criteria effectively.

Teachers and students must discuss the internally assessed work. Students should be encouraged to initiate
discussions with the teacher to obtain advice and information, and students must not be penalized for
seeking guidance. However, if a student could not have completed the work without substantial support
from the teacher, this should be recorded on the appropriate form from the Handbook of procedures for the
Diploma Programme.
It is the responsibility of teachers to ensure that all students understand the basic meaning and significance
of concepts that relate to academic honesty, especially authenticity and intellectual property. Teachers
must ensure that all student work for assessment is prepared according to the requirements and must
explain clearly to students that the internally assessed work must be entirely their own.
As part of the learning process, teachers can give advice to students on a first draft/performance of the
internally assessed work. This advice should be in terms of the way the work could be improved. If responding
to written work, this first draft must not be heavily annotated or edited by the teacher; if responding to work
of a performing nature, this must not be an extensive response. The next version handed to the teacher
after the first draft/performance must be the final one.
All work submitted to the IB for moderation or assessment must be authenticated by a teacher, and must
not include any known instances of suspected or confirmed malpractice. Each student must sign the
coversheet for internal assessment to confirm that the work is his or her authentic work and constitutes the
final version of that work. Once a student has officially submitted the final version of the work to a teacher
(or the coordinator) for internal assessment, together with the signed coversheet, it cannot be retracted.
Dance guide

51

Internal assessment

Authenticity may be checked by discussion with the student on the content of the work, and scrutiny of one
or more of the following:
•

the student’s initial proposal

•

the first draft/performance

•

the style of writing/performing compared with work known to be that of the student.

The requirement for teachers and students to sign the coversheet for internal assessment applies to the
work of all students, not just the sample work that will be submitted to an examiner for the purpose of
moderation. If the teacher and student sign a coversheet, but there is a comment to the effect that the
work may not be authentic, the student will not be eligible for a mark in that component and no grade will
be awarded. For further details refer to the IB publication Academic honesty and the relevant articles in the
General regulations: Diploma Programme.
For further details, refer to the Handbook of procedures for the Diploma Programme.

Group work
Please refer to the requirements for the performance component in “Internal assessment details—SL and
HL”.

Time allocation
Internal assessment is an integral part of the dance course, contributing 40% to the final assessment in
the SL and the HL courses. This weighting should be reflected in the time that is allocated to teaching the
knowledge, skills and understanding required to undertake the work, as well as the total time allocated to
carry out the work.
It is recommended that a total of approximately 60 hours (SL) and 90 hours (HL) should be allocated to the
work. This should include:
•

time for the teacher to explain to students the requirements of the internal assessment

•

class time for students to work on the internal assessment component

•

time for consultation between the teacher and each student

•

time to review and monitor progress, and to check authenticity.

Requirements and recommendations
It is important for the integrity of the moderation process that the internal assessment by the teacher
is based on the same evidence as that available to the moderator (for example, recordings and written
documentation).
All recordings must be submitted on DVD or other digital format specified by the IB and notified to schools.
Teachers must ensure that the submitted material has been replayed successfully on a machine other than
that on which it was recorded. The case and accompanying legend must identify both the school and
student, and teachers must ensure that only good-quality recordings are submitted.

52

Dance guide

Internal assessment

Using assessment criteria for internal assessment
For internal assessment, a number of assessment criteria have been identified. Each assessment criterion
has level descriptors describing specific levels of achievement, together with an appropriate range of marks.
The level descriptors concentrate on positive achievement, although for the lower levels failure to achieve
may be included in the description.
Teachers must judge the internally assessed work at SL and at HL against the criteria using the level
descriptors.
•

The same assessment criteria are provided for SL and HL.

•

The aim is to find, for each criterion, the descriptor that conveys most accurately the level attained
by the student, using the best-fit model. A best-fit approach means that compensation should be
made when a piece of work matches different aspects of a criterion at different levels. The mark
awarded should be one that most fairly reflects the balance of achievement against the criterion. It is
not necessary for every single aspect of a level descriptor to be met for that mark to be awarded.

•

When assessing a student’s work, teachers should read the level descriptors for each criterion until
they reach a descriptor that most appropriately describes the level of the work being assessed. If a
piece of work seems to fall between two descriptors, both descriptors should be read again and the
one that more appropriately describes the student’s work should be chosen.

•

Where there are two or more marks available within a level, teachers should award the upper marks if
the student’s work demonstrates the qualities described to a great extent. Teachers should award the
lower marks if the student’s work demonstrates the qualities described to a lesser extent.

•

Only whole numbers should be recorded; partial marks, that is fractions and decimals, are not
acceptable.

•

Teachers should not think in terms of a pass or fail boundary, but should concentrate on identifying
the appropriate descriptor for each assessment criterion.

•

The highest level descriptors do not imply faultless performance but should be achievable by a
student. Teachers should not hesitate to use the extremes if they are appropriate descriptions of the
work being assessed.

•

A student who attains a high level of achievement in relation to one criterion will not necessarily
attain high levels of achievement in relation to the other criteria. Similarly, a student who attains a low
level of achievement for one criterion will not necessarily attain low achievement levels for the other
criteria. Teachers should not assume that the overall assessment of the students will produce any
particular distribution of marks.

•

It is recommended that the assessment criteria be made available to students.

Internal assessment

The purpose of the performance component is to assess the student’s ability to demonstrate the following
assessment objectives.
•

Demonstrate knowledge and understanding of the selected dance(s) performed (AO1)

•

Demonstrate the ability to present an effective performance (AO2)

•

Demonstrate ability to interpret sensitively the intention of the dance(s) (AO3)

•

Demonstrate control of technical skills appropriate to the dance (AO4)

The task
The student, in consultation with the teacher, must choose the dance(s) to be performed. The dance(s)
chosen should demonstrate the student’s range of abilities as a performer and be appropriate to their skill
level and to the dance.
Students must meet the following requirements.
•

Students at SL will perform one or two dances (solo/duet/group, but at least one must be a solo or a
duet) in any style or styles—total length of 3–6 minutes.

•

Students at HL will perform two or three dances (solo/duet/group, but at least one must be a solo or a
duet) in any style or styles—total length of 6–9 minutes. At least half of the HL presentation time must
be devoted to solo and/or duet work.

•

The performances must show proficiency and expressive ability appropriate to the dance and to the
dancer’s technical ability.

•

If more than one dance is being presented, students, in consultation with the teacher, are encouraged
to choose dances that allow them to demonstrate expressive and stylistic range.

•

Care must be taken in the choice of group pieces: the student must feature prominently enough to
allow for his or her accomplishment to be assessed.

•

If several students are presenting the same group work in performance, one filming is acceptable.
However, the final submission for each student must reflect the best that the student has achieved.
Each student must be clearly identifiable.

•

Duets and groups must be performed with a student (or students) from the Diploma Programme
dance student’s school.

•

Each dance must be composed or arranged by someone other than the student(s) (for example, the
teacher or a guest choreographer) or taught from standard repertoire. No student choreography is
allowed in the dance performance component.

•

Each of the dances must be presented at an open showing, in a studio setting. In order to ensure
maximum recording visibility the showing must be filmed under working lights (not theatrical
lighting) and students must wear regular practice clothes, not costumes. The student presenting work
for examination must wear a contrasting top to the other dancers. If HL students are performing a
third dance, one of the three dances may be filmed in a theatrical setting, under working lights, at an
open showing. (Theatrical lighting may not be used.) If costume is part of the essence of this dance,
costume may be worn—otherwise, students must wear regular practice clothes.

Each dance may be filmed at any time during the course but the final submission must reflect the best that
the student has achieved throughout the course.
It is essential to refer to the Handbook of procedures for the Diploma Programme for information regarding
examination procedures. This document includes detailed instructions for filming student work.

54

Dance guide

Internal assessment

Time limit
If the time limit is exceeded, the assessment must be based on the first 6 minutes of the total time for SL
students, and the first 9 minutes of the total time for HL students. In case of doubt, teachers and examiners
are instructed to determine when a time limit has been exceeded.
Work that falls significantly short of the stated time requirement is unlikely to fully meet the stated
requirements of the task and is likely to receive low marks.

Programme notes
The student must also submit short programme notes. These programme notes will provide information on
each dance to be presented and must include:
•

the title of the dance

•

the choreographer (for example, teacher, guest artist, reconstructed from standard repertoire)

•

collaborators (for example, composer, designers)

•

a brief statement about the motivation for the dance and its interpretation (one or two paragraphs at
the most)

•

any additional relevant information (for example, reasons for performing this particular material).

Each student’s programme notes must clearly be independent work and not a collaboration (in the event
that several students choose the same piece[s]).

Performance criteria
Each student’s performance will be assessed by the teacher using the four internal assessment criteria.
The student’s performance will be measured by the:
•

impact it conveys

•

technical skills

•

interpretative ability displayed

•

programme notes.

(See “Internal assessment criteria—SL and HL”.)
The student should have access to the assessment criteria descriptors throughout the course of study.

Glossary of dance terms

As part of making this glossary of dance terms their own, students are encouraged to use dance vocabulary
specific to their dance cultures and/or traditions.
Arrangement

The application of changes to existing dances through varying such elements as
the number of dancers, space, time and sequencing of movement.

Composition

The invention and ordering of movement in space, time and dynamics, and the
creation of a dance form in support of an intention. This overall structure may
include other elements such as music, costumes, sets, props, visual and aural
effects, text and lighting.

A dance

An ordering of human movement in time and space that embodies a coherent
concept. It may stand alone or be a part of a larger work, but it must be a
complete structure.

Dance culture

In general, dances that evolve from the aesthetic values and practices of particular
ethnic groups or regions.

Dance elements

The particular use of the body, involving space, time and dynamics.

Dance excerpt

A part of a dance/series of dances that may be seen as complete in itself.

Dance function

The purpose(s) of a dance, both to its maker and to others.

Dance structure/
form

In general, the systematic ordering of individual phrases into larger parts called
“sections”, composed into a whole work; the shape of the whole work is its form.

Dance style

A distinctive manner of moving; the characteristic way in which a dance is
created, or performed, that identifies the dance as belonging to a particular
choreographer, school or period.

Dance tradition

In general, a particular codification of dance movement that has established its
place in history. This codification may include hybrid dance elements.

acknowledged reputation and continue to be performed.

Dance guide

59

Glossary of dance terms

Structured
improvisation

The spontaneous ordering of movement possibilities in response to a particular
framework. (Improvisation is often used to encourage the discovery of a
personal movement style or as a preparation for choreography. In established
styles, improvisation is often a feature of performance, whereby dancers may
spontaneously manipulate given elements and so demonstrate their mastery of
the elements of the style to fulfill choreographic structure.)

Temporal clarity

The extent to which there is appropriate use of time in relation to choreography;
complementary with, but not necessarily parallel to, the rhythmical structure
of the music. This aspect is particularly important when there is no musical
accompaniment.
