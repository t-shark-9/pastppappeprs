Introduction

The Diploma Programme

The Diploma Programme is a rigorous pre-university course of study designed for students in the 16 to 19
age range. It is a broad-based two-year course that aims to encourage students to be knowledgeable and
inquiring, but also caring and compassionate. There is a strong emphasis on encouraging students to
develop intercultural understanding, open-mindedness, and the attitudes necessary for them to respect
and evaluate a range of points of view.

The Diploma Programme hexagon
The course is presented as six academic areas enclosing a central core. It encourages the concurrent
study of a broad range of academic areas. Students study: two modern languages (or a modern language
and a classical language); a humanities or social science subject; an experimental science; mathematics;
one of the creative arts. It is this comprehensive range of subjects that makes the Diploma Programme a
demanding course of study designed to prepare students effectively for university entrance. In each of the
academic areas students have flexibility in making their choices, which means they can choose subjects that
particularly interest them and that they may wish to study further at university.

The Diploma Programme

Choosing the right combination
Students are required to choose one subject from each of the six academic areas, although they can choose
a second subject from groups 1 to 5 instead of a group 6 subject. Normally, three subjects (and not more
than four) are taken at higher level (HL), and the others are taken at standard level (SL). The IB recommends
240 teaching hours for HL subjects and 150 hours for SL. Subjects at HL are studied in greater depth and
breadth than at SL.
At both levels, many skills are developed, especially those of critical thinking and analysis. At the end of
the course, students’ abilities are measured by means of external assessment. Many subjects contain some
element of coursework assessed by teachers. The course is available for examinations in English, French and
Spanish.

The core of the hexagon
All Diploma Programme students participate in the three course requirements that make up the core of
the hexagon. Reflection on all these activities is a principle that lies at the heart of the thinking behind the
Diploma Programme.
The theory of knowledge course encourages students to think about the nature of knowledge, to reflect
on the process of learning in all the subjects they study as part of their Diploma Programme course, and
to make connections across the academic areas. The extended essay, a substantial piece of writing of up to
4,000 words, enables students to investigate a topic of special interest that they have chosen themselves.
It also encourages them to develop the skills of independent research that will be expected at university.
Creativity, action, service involves students in experiential learning through a range of artistic, sporting,
physical and service activities.

The IB mission statement and the IB learner profile
The Diploma Programme aims to develop in students the knowledge, skills and attitudes they will need
to fulfill the aims of the IB, as expressed in the organization’s mission statement and the learner profile.
Teaching and learning in the Diploma Programme represent the reality in daily practice of the organization’s
educational philosophy.

Introduction

Nature of the subject

Computer science requires an understanding of the fundamental concepts of computational thinking as
well as knowledge of how computers and other digital devices operate.
The Diploma Programme computer science course is engaging, accessible, inspiring and rigorous. It has the
following characteristics.
•

draws on a wide spectrum of knowledge

•

enables and empowers innovation, exploration and the acquisition of further knowledge

•

interacts with and influences cultures, society and how individuals and societies behave

•

raises ethical issues

•

is underpinned by computational thinking.

Computational thinking involves the ability to:
•

think procedurally, logically, concurrently, abstractly, recursively and think ahead

•

utilize an experimental and inquiry-based approach to problem-solving

•

develop algorithms and express them clearly

•

appreciate how theoretical and practical limitations affect the extent to which problems can be solved
computationally.

During the course the student will develop computational solutions. This will involve the ability to:
•

identify a problem or unanswered question

•

design, prototype and test a proposed solution

•

liaise with clients to evaluate the success of the proposed solution and make recommendations for
future developments.

Computer science has links with subjects outside of group 4, notably information technology in a global
society (ITGS), but it should be noted that there are clear differences between the subjects.

Computer science and the international dimension
Computer science itself is an international endeavour—the exchange of information and ideas across national
boundaries has been essential to the progress of the subject. This exchange is not a new phenomenon but
it has accelerated in recent times with the development of information and communication technologies.
The development of solutions may be at a local, national or global scale and lies at the heart of the subject.
Therefore teachers of computer science should study a range of examples from different geographical
locations as well as at different scales.
Developments such as open source software and the emergence of social networking epitomize the
global nature of the subject. Internet forums exist that welcome ideas and solutions developed from
computer scientists from all continents in driving forward developments to different software types. These
developments have revolutionized the way that people, and in particular the young, interact.

Computer science guide

Nature of the subject

On a practical level, the group 4 project (which all science students must undertake) mirrors the work of
computer scientists by encouraging collaboration between schools across the regions.

Distinction between SL and HL
While the skills and activities of computer science are common to students at both SL and HL, students at
HL are required to study additional topics in the core, a case study and also extension material of a more
demanding nature in the option chosen. The distinction between SL and HL is therefore one of both breadth
and depth.
Additionally, the HL course has 240 hours devoted to teaching, compared with 150 hours for the SL course.
Students at SL and HL in computer science study a common core consisting of:
•

four topics (system fundamentals; computer organization; networks; and computational thinking,
problem-solving and programming)

•

one option (chosen from databases; modelling and simulation; web science; or object-oriented
programming)

•

one piece of internally assessed work, which includes a computational solution.

The HL course has three additional elements:
•

three further topics (abstract data structures; resource management; control)

•

additional and more demanding content for the option selected

•

an additional externally assessed component based on a pre-seen case study of an organization or
scenario; this requires students to research various aspects of the subject—which may include new
technical concepts and additional subject content—in greater depth.

Prior learning
Past experience shows that students will be able to study computer science at SL successfully with no
background in, or previous knowledge of, computer science. Their approach to study, characterized by
specific IB learner profile attributes—inquirers, thinkers and communicators—will be significant here.
Students who have undertaken the IB Middle Years Programme (MYP) or studied a similar course prior to
commencing the IB Diploma Programme would also be well prepared.
The study of computer science at HL demands a higher level of problem-solving skills and the ability to
understand and manipulate abstract concepts. Although no previous knowledge of computer science is
required, some exposure to programming is desirable.

Links to the Middle Years Programme
Students who have undertaken the MYP sciences, technology and mathematics courses will be well
prepared for group 4 subjects. The MYP science objectives and assessment criteria A–F are aligned with
the group 4 objectives and internal assessment criteria, and allow for a smooth transition from the MYP
to the Diploma Programme. In particular, the “One world” objective in MYP sciences is further developed
in group 4 computer science with the increased emphasis on aim 8—that is, to “raise awareness of the
moral, ethical, social, economic and environmental implications of using science and technology”. There are
specific references to aim 8 implications in assessment statements and teacher’s notes in the syllabus details
sections in all group 4 guides.

Nature of the subject

The IB technology continuum
The MYP technology course builds on experiences of inquiry that students have gained in their time in the
IB Primary Years Programme (PYP). PYP teaching and learning experiences challenge students to be curious,
ask questions, explore and interact with the environment physically, socially and intellectually to construct
meaning and refine their understanding. Even when there is no technology component in the PYP, the use
of structured inquiry is a precursor to the problem-solving and inquiry-based approach of MYP technology.
The MYP technology course develops skills linked to the design cycle, which provides the model of thinking
and the strategy used to help students investigate problems and design, plan, create and evaluate the
product. Students continuing on to the IB Diploma Programme will have experienced the use of the design
cycle and will have developed critical-thinking and design skills, which they will be able to apply and extend
in computer science.
As in the MYP technology course, a product can be defined as the solution that students have generated
independently. This means that the Diploma Programme computer science course requires students to
become actively involved in, and to focus on, the whole design process as well as the final product, building
on the skills acquired during the MYP technology course.
In order to complete the IB Diploma Programme computer science internal assessment successfully,
students are expected to create a solution to a specific problem using the design cycle, which extends the
range of skills developed in MYP technology.

Computer science and theory of knowledge
There is no one scientific method of gaining knowledge or of finding explanations for the behaviour of the
natural world. Computer science works through a variety of approaches to produce these explanations, but
they all rely on data from observations and have a common underpinning rigour, whether using inductive
or deductive reasoning. The explanation may be in the form of a theory, sometimes requiring a model that
contains elements not directly observable. Producing these theories often requires an imaginative, creative
leap. Where such a predictive theoretical model is not possible, the explanation may consist of identifying
a correlation between a factor and an outcome. This correlation may then give rise to a causal mechanism
that can be experimentally tested, leading to an improved explanation. All these explanations require
an understanding of the limitations of data, and the extent and limitations of our knowledge. Computer
science requires freedom of thought and open-mindedness, and an essential part of the process of science is
the way the international computer science community shares ideas through academic papers, conferences
and open forums. The syllabus details sections in the group 4 guides give references in teacher’s notes to
appropriate topics where theory of knowledge can be addressed.
During the course in computer science a number of issues will arise that highlight the relationships between
theory of knowledge and computer science. Some of the questions that could be considered during the
course are identified in the following list.
•

What is the difference between data, information, knowledge and wisdom? To what extent can
computers store and impart data, information, knowledge and wisdom?

•

Computational thinking includes: procedure, logic, pre-planning (thinking ahead), concurrency,
abstraction and recursion. To what extent are these ways of thinking distinct? To what extent can
knowledge in different areas (mathematics, ethics, and so on) be analysed in these ways?

•

It has been said that human memory is more like an improvised performance than a movie on a DVD.
What does this mean? How does human memory differ from computer memory?

•

How does a computer language differ from a natural language?

6

Computer science guide

Nature of the subject

•

What are the differences between representing numbers in denary and in binary? In binary, 1 + 1 = 10.
Does this tell us anything about the nature of mathematical truth?

•

What are the challenges of creating a computer model of some aspect of the world?

•

A chess machine can beat the top human chess players. Does a machine therefore “know” how to play
chess?

•

To what extent does computational thinking challenge conventional concepts of reasoning?

•

How do we know if other humans feel emotions? Can a machine ever feel an emotion? How would we
know?

•

Was Akio Morita correct when he claimed that “You can be totally rational with a machine. But if you
work with people, sometimes logic has to take a back seat to understanding”?

•

Does information and communication technology, like deduction, simply allow the knower to
arrange existing knowledge in a different way, without adding anything, or is this arrangement itself
knowledge in some sense?

•

What did Sydney Harris mean when he said that “The real danger is not that computers will begin to
think like men, but that men will begin to think like computers”? Was he right, or was this statement
based on a misunderstanding of either men or computers?

•

What do we mean by “holistic” and “reductionist” approaches to knowledge? What are the strengths
and weaknesses of each approach?

•

To what extent is it possible to capture the richness of concepts such as “intelligence” or “judgment”
via a reductionist approach?

•

If we attach a camera or microphone to a computer, it can receive data from the world. Does this
mean that a computer can “perceive the world”? To what extent might human perception be a similar
process?

Introduction

Aims

Subject aims
Diploma Programme computer science students should become aware of how computer scientists
work and communicate with each other and with other stakeholders in the successful development and
implementation of IT solutions. While the methodology used to solve problems in computer science
may take a wide variety of forms, the group 4 computer science course emphasizes the need for both a
theoretical and practical approach.
It is in this context that the Diploma Programme computer science course should aim to:
1.

provide opportunities for study and creativity within a global context that will stimulate and challenge
students developing the skills necessary for independent and lifelong learning

2.

provide a body of knowledge, methods and techniques that characterize computer science

3.

enable students to apply and use a body of knowledge, methods and techniques that characterize
computer science

4.

demonstrate initiative in applying thinking skills critically to identify and resolve complex problems

5.

engender an awareness of the need for, and the value of, effective collaboration and communication
in resolving complex problems

6.

develop logical and critical thinking as well as experimental, investigative and problem-solving skills

7.

develop and apply the students’ information and communication technology skills in the study of
computer science to communicate information confidently and effectively

8.

raise awareness of the moral, ethical, social, economic and environmental implications of using science
and technology

9.

develop an appreciation of the possibilities and limitations associated with continued developments
in IT systems and computer science

10.

encourage an understanding of the relationships between scientific disciplines and the overarching
nature of the scientific method.

Syllabus

Approaches to the teaching and learning of computer
science

The Diploma Programme computer science course adopts a significantly different approach to many other
computer science courses. Teachers who have taught other courses, including previous IB computer science
courses, must familiarize themselves with this approach before they commence teaching.
Computer science is seen as an experimental science. Therefore it is expected that teachers use a wide
range of practical activities to support the theoretical content.

Computational thinking
Computational thinking is a problem-solving methodology that is applicable across a range of subject
disciplines and underpins this course.
The six principles of computational thinking, identified by Jeanette Wing in her article “Computational
thinking” are:
•

thinking procedurally

•

thinking logically

•

thinking ahead

•

thinking concurrently

•

thinking abstractly

•

thinking recursively (HL only).

The 10 hours explicitly stated in the SL/HL core indicate the time required to teach these principles within
other topics throughout the duration of the course. In the HL extension the time required to teach these
principles is not explicitly stated but is included in the overall time allocated. It is expected that teachers will
use an iterative method in integrating these principles into the other subject content.
There are a number of possible approaches to the teaching of these principles such as:
•

teaching each principle linked to one scenario only

•

teaching the principle(s) as threads that are linked to a number of scenarios

•

teaching some of the principles as linked to one scenario only and others linked to a number of
scenarios.

Delivering the course
There are a number of approaches that may be taken to deliver the computer science course. The syllabus
is written in a non-prescriptive manner that allows appropriate scenarios to be selected by the teacher.
The scenarios should include real-world problems that will be relevant, contemporary in nature and
provide ways for the students to integrate their own experiences within an inquiry-based approach. These
scenarios should provide students with an opportunity to decompose a system, gaining an understanding
of algorithms that influence the way it functions.

12

Computer science guide

Approaches to the teaching and learning of computer science

Topics should not be taught in a linear fashion as it is possible for more than one of the sub-topics
to be taught together. This is demonstrated in the example class activity below, which focuses on the
development of a login interface.
Class activity

Topic in syllabus

Creating a login
interface

•

Identify the context for which a system is planned (1.1.1)

•

Suggest various types of testing (1.1.7)

•

Construct suitable representations to illustrate system requirements
(1.2.7)

•

Describe the purpose of prototypes to demonstrate the proposed
solution to the client (1.2.8)

•

Thinking procedurally, thinking logically, thinking abstractly (4.1)

•

Connecting computational thinking and program design (4.2)

•

Use of programming languages (4.3.6–4.3.9)

•

Some of the 30 hours allocated to the preparation and/or completion of
the internal assessment where techniques can be applied appropriately

The use of code is seen as an essential part of testing the algorithms developed. The teacher support
material includes suggested practical activities linked to these types of activity that may be used by teachers
as a part of their teaching. This list of practical activities is not exhaustive.
The internal assessment should provide an opportunity for the students to showcase their innovative skills
while developing a practical solution to either a specified problem or unanswered question. These skills will
be evident in the use of complex design and algorithmic principles as well as rigorous testing leading to the
development of a functional product.

Algorithmic development
Teachers must be aware of the different levels of abstraction used in developing a solution to a specified
problem. This may be illustrated using the following examples.

Example 1
Given the following array
NAMES
[0]

[1]

[2]

[3]

[4]

Robert

Boris

Brad

George

David

and the following algorithm, which is constructed to reverse the contents of array NAMES
N = 5 // the number of elements in the array
K = 0 // this is the first index in the array
loop while K < N – 1
TEMP = NAMES[K]
NAMES [K] = NAMES [N – K –1]
NAMES [N – K –1] = TEMP
K = K + 1
end loop

Computer science guide

Approaches to the teaching and learning of computer science

a.

trace the algorithm, showing contents of the array after each execution of the loop

[2 marks]

b.

state the number of times the loop is executed

[1 mark]

c.

outline why the algorithm does not reverse the contents of the array NAMES, and how this could be
corrected.										
[2 marks]

Example 2
A geography teacher is searching an array, CITYNAMES, containing 100 names of cities and wants to print
out the names of the cities beginning with D.
Construct pseudocode to indicate how this may be done:
// FirstLetter(“CITY”) will return the first letter of the word “CITY”
// Elements are stored in an array called CITYNAMES
loop for C from 0 to 99
if FirstLetter(CITYNAMES[C]) = “D” then
		output CITYNAMES[C]
endif
end loop

Example 3

A geography teacher is searching CITIES, a collection of city names, and wants to print out the names of the
cities beginning with D.
Construct pseudocode to indicate how this may be done:
// FirstLetter(“CITY”) will return the first letter of the word “CITY”
loop while CITIES.HasNextItem()
NAME = CITIES.getNext()
if FirstLetter(NAME) = “D”
		output NAME
end if
end loop
Students are not expected to construct code for SL paper 1, HL paper 1 and HL paper 3 beyond the level of
pseudocode. For SL paper 2 and HL paper 2, the use of code will depend on the option.

Options
The introduction of options allows computer science teachers to focus on an area of interest or specialism.
Below is some information that may assist teachers in selecting the most appropriate option.

Additional information linked to the options
Databases
Students are expected to use database software to support the theoretical concepts within the syllabus.
There is no prescribed database development environment. Appropriate database development
environments may include Access, Open Office Base, MySQL and FileMaker.

Assessment in the Diploma Programme

General
Assessment is an integral part of teaching and learning. The most important aims of assessment in the
Diploma Programme are that it should support curricular goals and encourage appropriate student
learning. Both external and internal assessment are used in the Diploma Programme. IB examiners mark
work produced for external assessment, while work produced for internal assessment is marked by teachers
and externally moderated by the IB.
There are two types of assessment identified by the IB.
•

Formative assessment informs both teaching and learning. It is concerned with providing accurate
and helpful feedback to students and teachers on the kind of learning taking place and the nature of
students’ strengths and weaknesses in order to help develop students’ understanding and capabilities.
Formative assessment can also help to improve teaching quality, as it can provide information to
monitor progress towards meeting the course aims and objectives.

•

Summative assessment gives an overview of previous learning and is concerned with measuring
student achievement.

The Diploma Programme primarily focuses on summative assessment designed to record student
achievement at, or towards the end of, the course of study. However, many of the assessment instruments
can also be used formatively during the course of teaching and learning, and teachers are encouraged to
do this. A comprehensive assessment plan is viewed as being integral with teaching, learning and course
organization. For further information, see the IB Programme standards and practices document.
The approach to assessment used by the IB is criterion-related, not norm-referenced. This approach to
assessment judges students’ work by their performance in relation to identified levels of attainment, and
not in relation to the work of other students. For further information on assessment within the Diploma
Programme please refer to the publication Diploma Programme assessment: Principles and practice.
To support teachers in the planning, delivery and assessment of the Diploma Programme courses a variety
of resources can be found on the OCC or purchased from the IB store (http://store.ibo.org). Teacher support
materials, subject reports, internal assessment guidance, grade descriptors, as well as resources from other
teachers, can be found on the OCC. Specimen and past examination papers as well as markschemes can be
purchased from the IB store.

Methods of assessment
The IB uses several methods to assess work produced by students.

Assessment criteria
Assessment criteria are used when the assessment task is open-ended. Each criterion concentrates on
a particular skill that students are expected to demonstrate. An assessment objective describes what
students should be able to do and assessment criteria describe how well they should be able to do it. Using
assessment criteria allows discrimination between different answers and encourages a variety of responses.

Computer science guide

65

Assessment in the Diploma Programme

Each criterion comprises a set of hierarchically ordered level descriptors. Each level descriptor is worth one
or more marks. Each criterion is applied independently using a best-fit model. The maximum marks for each
criterion may differ according to the criterion’s importance. The marks awarded for each criterion are added
together to give the total mark for the piece of work.

Markbands
Markbands are a comprehensive statement of expected performance against which responses are judged.
They represent a single holistic criterion divided into level descriptors. Each level descriptor corresponds
to a range of marks to differentiate student performance. A best-fit approach is used to ascertain which
particular mark to use from the possible range for each level descriptor.

Markschemes
This generic term is used to describe analytic markschemes that are prepared for specific examination
papers. Analytic markschemes are prepared for those examination questions that expect a particular kind
of response and/or a given final answer from the students. They give detailed instructions to examiners
on how to break down the total mark for each question for different parts of the response. A markscheme
may include the content expected in the responses to questions or may be a series of marking notes giving
guidance on how to apply criteria.

The paper
This paper is based on a case study produced annually by the IB and available on the OCC.
A clean copy of the case study must be downloaded by the IB coordinator and issued to the students with
their examination paper.
The purpose of the paper is to assess the student’s ability to demonstrate the following objectives in relation
to the syllabus:
•

Assessment objective 1—know and understand

•

Assessment objective 2—apply and use

•

Assessment objective 3—construct, analyse, evaluate and formulate

This paper consists of four structured questions, which assess the whole syllabus in an integrated way.
Students are required to answer all of the questions.
The questions are related to the scenario in the case study. In addition to the case study further stimulus
material may be provided in the examination paper.
Questions 1, 2 and 3 may be subdivided. Question 4 will require the synthesis of information from a range of
sources, including independent research and investigations beyond the case study, to develop an extended
response to a specified issue.
The number of marks for each part will be given on the paper, and is linked to the command term used. This
will indicate to students the depth of the response required.

Computer science guide

71

External assessment

The case study
The case study is a valuable teaching tool that can be used to integrate all aspects of the syllabus.
This case study will be provided 12 months before the May examination session (18 months before the
November session) so that students can carry out detailed research prior to the HL paper 3 examination,
which contributes 20% of the final mark.
The computer science case study provides the stimulus material for the investigation of a scenario involving
current developments and/or issues in computer science. The information obtained will prepare students
and form the basis of the requirements for answering the questions in HL paper 3.
The case study is an opportunity to keep the course abreast of current technology by introducing new
technical concepts or issues requiring a more in-depth investigation than that required in the rest of the
course.
Through their investigation of the case study, students should be able to:
•

demonstrate an understanding of the computer science concepts fundamental to the system(s) in the
case study (objective 1)

•

demonstrate an understanding of how the system(s) in the case study work (objective 1)

•

apply material from the course syllabus in the context of the case study (objective 2)

•

explain how scenarios specified in the case study may be related to other similar local and global
scenarios (objective 3)

•

discuss the social impacts and ethical issues relevant to the case study (objective 3)

•

explain technical issues relating to the case study (objective 3)

•

evaluate information that may be gathered from local and global sources including field trips,
interviews, primary and secondary research, invited guest speakers and online interviews (objective 3)

•

evaluate, formulate or justify strategic solutions based on the synthesis of information from the
case study itself, additional research and new stimulus material provided in the examination paper
(objective 3).

External assessment markbands—HL
All questions except for question 4 on HL paper 3 use indicative content with adaptable markschemes and

Internal assessment

Purpose of internal assessment
Internal assessment is an integral part of the course and is compulsory for both SL and HL students. It
enables students to demonstrate the application of their skills and knowledge, and to pursue their personal
interests, without the time limitations and other constraints that are associated with written examinations.
The internal assessment should, as far as possible, be woven into normal classroom teaching and not be a
separate activity conducted after a course has been taught.
The internal assessment requirements at SL and at HL are the same. However, these requirements contribute
to a different percentage of the overall mark. Students are required to produce a solution that consists of a
cover page, the product and the documentation. The focus of the solution is on providing either an original
product or additional functionality to an existing product for a client.
The internal assessment component (solution), as well as being practical and productive, forms an important
part of the assessment of the computer science course. It is imperative, therefore, that the teacher provides
appropriate guidance to students.

Guidance and authenticity
The solution submitted for internal assessment must be the student’s own work. However, it is not the
intention that students should decide upon a title or topic and be left to work on the internal assessment
component without any further support from the teacher. The teacher should play an important role during
both the planning stage and the period when the student is working on the internally assessed work. It is
the responsibility of the teacher to ensure that students are familiar with:
•

the requirements of the type of work to be internally assessed

•

the ethical guidelines mentioned in the “Requirements and recommendations” section of this
document

•

the assessment criteria; students must understand that the work submitted for assessment must
address these criteria effectively.

Teachers and students must discuss the internally assessed work. Students should be encouraged to initiate
discussions with the teacher to obtain advice and information, and students must not be penalized for
seeking guidance. However, if a student could not have completed the work without substantial support
from the teacher, this should be recorded on the appropriate form from the Handbook of procedures for the
Diploma Programme.
It is the responsibility of teachers to ensure that all students understand the basic meaning and significance
of concepts that relate to academic honesty, especially authenticity and intellectual property. Teachers
must ensure that all student work for assessment is prepared according to the requirements and must
explain clearly to students that the internally assessed work must be entirely their own.
As part of the learning process, teachers can give advice to students on a first draft of the internally assessed
work. This advice should be in terms of the way the work could be improved, but this first draft must not be
heavily annotated or edited by the teacher. The next version handed to the teacher after the first draft must
be the final one.
74

Computer science guide

Internal assessment

All work submitted to the IB for moderation or assessment must be authenticated by a teacher, and must
not include any known instances of suspected or confirmed malpractice. Each student must sign the
coversheet for internal assessment to confirm that the work is his or her authentic work and constitutes the
final version of that work. Once a student has officially submitted the final version of the work to a teacher
(or the coordinator) for internal assessment, together with the signed coversheet, it cannot be retracted.
Authenticity may be checked by discussion with the student on the content of the work, and scrutiny of one
or more of the following:
•

the student’s initial proposal

•

the first draft of the written work

•

the references cited

•

the style of writing compared with work known to be that of the student.

The requirement for teachers and students to sign the coversheet for internal assessment applies to the
work of all students, not just the sample work that will be submitted to an examiner for the purpose of
moderation. If the teacher and student sign a coversheet, but there is a comment to the effect that the
work may not be authentic, the student will not be eligible for a mark in that component and no grade will
be awarded. For further details refer to the IB publication Academic honesty and the relevant articles in the
General regulations: Diploma Programme.
The same piece of work cannot be submitted to meet the requirements of both the internal assessment and
the extended essay.

Group work
The development of the solution must be undertaken by the student on an individual basis. Collaborative or
group work may not be undertaken by students.

Time allocation
It is recommended that a total of approximately 30 teaching hours for both SL and HL should be allocated
to the work.
This should include:
•

time for the teacher to explain to students the requirements of the internal assessment, including
codes of ethical behaviour and confidentiality

•

class time for students to work on the internal assessment

•

time spent by the student making arrangements to collect data as appropriate

•

time for consultation between the teacher and each student

•

time to review and monitor progress, and to check authenticity.

Additional time may be needed outside normal class time for students to work independently, such as
acquiring additional skills required for the project and consulting with other people.

Computer science guide

75

Internal assessment

Requirements and recommendations
Teachers and students will need to discuss issues relating to the design of the product, the collection of data
and consultations with others. Students should be encouraged to initiate discussions with the teacher to
obtain advice and information, and will not be penalized for seeking advice.

Ethical guidelines for internal assessment
Given the nature of the project, students must take into account ethical problems and implications for
undertaking research and developing the solution, for example, ensuring the confidentiality and security of
data. Wherever possible, original data should be used or be collected by the student.
The following guidelines must be applied.
•

Consent must be obtained from people who will be involved in the development of the solution
before any investigation is begun.

•

All data collected must be stored securely in order to maintain confidentiality.

•

Only the data collected for the solution can be used. It must not be used for any other purpose without
explicit permission.

Teachers should refer to the Ethical practice in the Diploma Programme poster for further guidance.

Health and safety guidelines
Schools are advised to follow local best practice in health and safety for research linked to the development
of the solution. Each school is ultimately responsible for the health and safety of students.

Word count
Students must produce a solution that includes supporting documentation up to a maximum of 2,000
words. If the word limit is exceeded, the teacher’s assessment of the documentation must be based on the
first 2,000 words.
Work that falls significantly beneath the stated word count is unlikely to fully meet the stated requirements
of the task and is likely to receive low marks.

Using assessment criteria for internal assessment
For internal assessment, a number of assessment criteria have been identified. Each assessment criterion has
level descriptors describing specific levels of achievement together with an appropriate range of marks. The
level descriptors concentrate on positive achievement, although for the lower levels failure to achieve may
be included in the description.
Teachers must judge the internally assessed work at SL and at HL against the criteria using the level
descriptors.
•

The same assessment criteria are provided for SL and HL.

•

The aim is to find, for each criterion, the descriptor that conveys most accurately the level attained
by the student, using the best-fit model. A best-fit approach means that compensation should be
made when a piece of work matches different aspects of a criterion at different levels. The mark
awarded should be one that most fairly reflects the balance of achievement against the criterion. It is
not necessary for every single aspect of a level descriptor to be met for that mark to be awarded.

76

Computer science guide

Internal assessment

•

When assessing a student’s work, teachers should read the level descriptors for each criterion until
they reach a descriptor that most appropriately describes the level of the work being assessed. If a
piece of work seems to fall between two descriptors, both descriptors should be read again and the
one that more appropriately describes the student’s work should be chosen.

•

Where there are two or more marks available within a level, teachers should award the upper marks if
the student’s work demonstrates the qualities described to a great extent. Teachers should award the
lower marks if the student’s work demonstrates the qualities described to a lesser extent.

•

Only whole numbers should be recorded; partial marks, that is fractions and decimals, are not
acceptable.

•

Teachers should not think in terms of a pass or fail boundary, but should concentrate on identifying
the appropriate descriptor for each assessment criterion.

•

The highest level descriptors do not imply faultless performance but should be achievable by a
student. Teachers should not hesitate to use the extremes if they are appropriate descriptions of the
work being assessed.

•

A student who attains a high achievement level in relation to one criterion will not necessarily attain
high achievement levels in relation to the other criteria. Similarly, a student who attains a low level of
achievement for one criterion will not necessarily attain low achievement levels for the other criteria.
Teachers should not assume that the overall assessment of the students will produce any particular
distribution of marks.

•

It is recommended that the assessment criteria be made available to students.

Introduction
The requirement of the internal assessment is to develop a solution for a specified client to a specified
problem or an unanswered question.
The solution is assessed using five criteria.
•

Planning

•

Solution overview

•

Development

•

Functionality and extensibility of product

•

Evaluation

Key terms
The term “solution” refers to all the work submitted by the student for the internal assessment; the term
“product” refers to the completed software only. The product is a subset of the solution.
The terms “developer” and “student” are synonymous.

Computer science guide

77

Internal assessment

The term “client” refers to the person for whom the product is being developed. The student may also be
the client.
The term “adviser” refers to a third party the student must identify to assist him or her in the development
of the product.
There are three scenarios for the development of the product.
1.

The student is developing the product for a third party who is the client and also acts as the adviser.

2.

The student is developing the product for a third party who is the client. Another person acts as the
adviser.

3.

The student is the client (developing the product for himself or herself). An appropriate adult must act
as the adviser.

Choice of topic
In identifying a problem, students can select any topic that interests them. It does not have to be directly
related to the specified themes in the syllabus or to the option studied.
Students should undertake a challenging task using appropriate techniques to showcase their algorithmic
thinking and organizational skills.
The solution may take one of these forms:
•

Creating a new system, such as an OOP program, a relational database, a simulation or a stand-alone/
web-based application

•

Adding functionality to an existing system, such as connecting a webpage(s) to a database, writing a
function for Moodle, writing a plug-in, or developing a stand-alone application

It is essential that whatever form the solution takes it ensures the student can explicitly demonstrate and
document his or her algorithmic thinking skills.
Examples are illustrated in the teacher support material.
It should be noted that products created using templates that show no evidence of modification in their
structure, design or functionality are not permitted. Examples of inappropriate products include:
•

the development of a programming product only using copied code

•

the development of a website (product) using a web-based template that determines its structure and
layout

•

the use of unmodified exemplar products or templates provided with software such as the Northwind
database in MS Access

•

a product that does not meet the ethical requirements outlined in the “Requirements and
recommendations” section of this document.

Choice of adviser
Students will need to work closely with the adviser throughout the development of the solution. Therefore
it is recommended that wherever possible, students select an adviser who is known to them or their family.
This could include members of the school community, local clubs or businesses.

Development of the solution
Students are advised to use the following guidelines to develop the solution. This will ensure it fulfills the
requirements of the assessment criteria.
Prior to developing the product the teacher must have:
•

approved the choice of client/adviser and scenario

•

reviewed preliminary designs and checked that the:
––

templates provided in the zip file are being used

––

proposed timeline for completing the product is realistic

––

scope and nature of the product are appropriate.

Criterion A: Planning
The scenario
The following key questions should be considered.
•

Who is the client/adviser?

•

Is the choice of client/adviser appropriate?

•

Why is the product being developed?

Rationale for proposed solution
The rationale behind the choice of the proposed product must be in extended writing, with reference
to the student’s consultations with the client and/or adviser, justifying how the choice of this particular
product is an effective solution.
Before reaching a decision for the proposed product the student and/or computer science teacher must
determine:
•

Criterion B: Solution overview
A Record of tasks form in the zip file must be used for the product proposed in criterion A.
The record of tasks form addresses:
•

a chronology of the key events in planning, designing, developing, testing and implementing the
solution

•

any other issues that may arise that may affect the development of the solution.

The design overview should include:
•

design methodologies appropriate to the type of product being designed

•

different levels of draft design, such as the overall structure and the internal layout of the product
itself; this can also include investigation into specific elements used within the product (such as
classes, sub-classes, tables, queries, style sheets, graphic elements, effects)

•

evidence of a testing plan that addresses the main areas of functionality of the product.

The student must submit final versions of the Record of tasks form and the design overview. However, the
teacher will need to see earlier versions to determine whether the product proposed is appropriate and
feasible.

Criterion C: Development
The product must be compatible with the information in criterion A and criterion B.
The student must present a list of the techniques used in developing the product.
The techniques may include algorithmic thinking, data structures, software tools and user interface. This list
need not be exhaustive but should illustrate how the major components of the product were developed.
The student must provide evidence of algorithmic thinking.
The information in the development documentation must provide a detailed account, using extended
writing and other appropriate information, to explain the following.
•

The structure of the product and why it is appropriate

•

The algorithmic thinking used in the development of the product

•

The techniques used in the development of the product and reasons why they are appropriate to it
(may include screenshots, exemplar data, reference to information in the appendix)

•

Any existing tools that are used in the development of the product, such as code libraries, software
packages, web hosting, security information or infrastructure issues

Any reference material such as templates, program code, applets or other materials that have been used
or modified must be acknowledged in this criterion. The code used in the product can be included in the
appendix.

Criterion D: Functionality and extensibility of product
This criterion should be completed as two parts and does not require any additional written documentation.
Functionality of the product
The student must use the video to demonstrate the product functioning. This evidence will be supported,
where possible, by the product on the CD-ROM/DVD or USB.

82

Computer science guide

Internal assessment

Extensibility of product
The student should design the product so that it can be maintained by another party and/or be further
developed. Therefore the design of the product should include appropriate folder and data structures,
intuitive file and/or class naming conventions and, where appropriate, comments in the code.

Criterion E: Evaluation
This criterion should be completed as two parts.
Evaluation of the product
The evaluation of the product should refer directly to the success criteria in criterion A, feedback from the
client/adviser, as well as any other appropriate feedback obtained.
Recommendations for the future development of the product
The student will use the feedback and the evaluation of the specific performance criteria to recommend
possible future developments to the product. These recommendations should explain the benefits of these
developments.

Internal assessment criteria—SL and HL
Rationale
General overview
The computer science internal assessment focuses on the balance between the level of algorithmic thinking
and problem-solving required to develop a product within the framework of the design cycle.

The assessment criteria
Criteria A, B and E are process-oriented and examine how the internal assessment task was carried out and
allow common assessment criteria to be applied to different types of product from the different options.
Criterion C is a holistic assessment of the final product and assesses the student’s understanding of the
concepts involved in its development. Criterion D is a holistic assessment of the functionality and future
extensibility of the product.

Criterion A: Planning (6 marks)
The success criteria identified in criterion A will be used in criterion D to evaluate the effectiveness of the

Assessment

The group 4 project

The group 4 project is an interdisciplinary activity in which all Diploma Programme science students must
participate. The intention is that students from the different group 4 subjects analyse a common topic
or problem. The exercise should be a collaborative experience where the emphasis is on the processes
involved in, rather than the products of, such an activity.
In most cases students in a school would be involved in the investigation of the same topic. Where
there are large numbers of students, it is possible to divide them into several smaller groups containing
representatives from each of the science subjects. Each group may investigate the same topic or different
topics—that is, there may be several group 4 projects in the same school.
Students studying environmental systems and societies are not required to undertake the group 4 project.

Summary of the group 4 project
The group 4 project is a collaborative activity where students from different group 4 subjects work together
on a scientific or technological topic, allowing for concepts and perceptions from across the disciplines to
be shared in line with aim 10—that is, to “develop an understanding of the relationships between scientific
disciplines and their influence on other areas of knowledge”. The project can be practically or theoretically
based. Collaboration between schools in different regions is encouraged.
The group 4 project allows students to appreciate the environmental, social and ethical implications
of science and technology. It may also allow them to understand the limitations of scientific study, for
example, the shortage of appropriate data and/or the lack of resources. The emphasis is on interdisciplinary
cooperation and the processes involved in scientific investigation, rather than the products of such
investigation.
The choice of scientific or technological topic is open but the project should clearly address group 4 aims 7,
8 and 10 of the biology, chemistry and physics subject guides.
Ideally, the project should involve students collaborating with those from other group 4 subjects at all
stages. To this end, it is not necessary for the topic chosen to have clearly identifiable separate subject
components. However, for logistical reasons, some schools may prefer a separate subject “action” phase
(see the following “Project stages” section).

Project stages
The 10 hours allocated to the group 4 project, which are part of the teaching time set aside for developing
the practical scheme of work, can be divided into three stages: planning, action and evaluation.

Planning
This stage is crucial to the whole exercise and should last about two hours.
•

86

The planning stage could consist of a single session, or two or three shorter ones.

Computer science guide

The group 4 project

•

This stage must involve all group 4 students meeting to “brainstorm” and discuss the central topic,
sharing ideas and information.

•

The topic can be chosen by the students themselves or selected by the teachers.

•

Where large numbers of students are involved, it may be advisable to have more than one mixed
subject group.

After selecting a topic or issue, the activities to be carried out must be clearly defined before moving
from the planning stage to the action and evaluation stages.
A possible strategy is that students define specific tasks for themselves, either individually or as members of
groups, and investigate various aspects of the chosen topic. At this stage, if the project is to be experimentally
based, apparatus should be specified so that there is no delay in carrying out the action stage. Contact with
other schools, if a joint venture has been agreed, is an important consideration at this time.

Action
This stage should last around six hours and may be carried out over one or two weeks in normal scheduled
class time. Alternatively, a whole day could be set aside if, for example, the project involves fieldwork.
•

Students should investigate the topic in mixed-subject groups or single-subject groups.

•

There should be collaboration during the action stage; findings of investigations should be shared
with other students within the mixed/single-subject group. During this stage, in any practically based
activity, it is important to pay attention to safety, ethical and environmental considerations.

Note: Students studying two group 4 subjects are not required to do two separate action phases.

Evaluation
The emphasis during this stage, for which two hours are probably necessary, is on students sharing their
findings, both successes and failures, with other students. How this is achieved can be decided by the
teachers, the students or jointly.
•

One solution is to devote a morning, afternoon or evening to a symposium where all the students, as
individuals or as groups, give brief presentations.

•

Alternatively, the presentation could be more informal and take the form of a science fair where
students circulate around displays summarizing the activities of each group.

The symposium or science fair could also be attended by parents, members of the school board and the
press. This would be especially pertinent if some issue of local importance has been researched. Some of the
findings might influence the way the school interacts with its environment or local community.

Addressing aims 7 and 8
Aim 7: “develop and apply 21st century communication skills in the study of science.”
Aim 7 may be partly addressed at the planning stage by using electronic communication within and
between schools. It may be that technology (for example, data logging, spreadsheets, databases and so
on) will be used in the action phase and certainly in the presentation/evaluation stage (for example, use of
digital images, presentation software, websites, digital video and so on).

Computer science guide

87

The group 4 project

Aim 8: “become critically aware, as global citizens, of the ethical implications of using science and
technology.”

Addressing the international dimension
There are also possibilities in the choice of topic to illustrate the international nature of the scientific
endeavour and the increasing cooperation required to tackle global issues involving science and technology.
An alternative way to bring an international dimension to the project is to collaborate with a school in
another region.

Types of project
While addressing aims 7, 8 and 10 the project must be based on science or its applications. The project may
have a hands-on practical action phase or one involving purely theoretical aspects. It could be undertaken
in a wide range of ways:
•

designing and carrying out a laboratory investigation or fieldwork

•

carrying out a comparative study (experimental or otherwise) in collaboration with another school

•

collating, manipulating and analysing data from other sources, such as scientific journals,
environmental organizations, science and technology industries and government reports

•

designing and using a model or simulation

•

contributing to a long-term project organized by the school.

Logistical strategies
The logistical organization of the group 4 project is often a challenge to schools. The following models
illustrate possible ways in which the project may be implemented.
Models A, B and C apply within a single school, and model D relates to a project involving collaboration
between schools.
Model A: mixed-subject groups and one topic
Schools may adopt mixed-subject groups and choose one common topic. The number of groups will
depend on the number of students.
Model B: mixed-subject groups adopting more than one topic
Schools with large numbers of students may choose to do more than one topic.
Model C: single-subject groups
For logistical reasons some schools may opt for single-subject groups, with one or more topics in the action
phase. This model is less desirable as it does not show the mixed subject collaboration in which many
scientists are involved.
Model D: collaboration with another school
The collaborative model is open to any school. To this end, the IB provides an electronic collaboration board
on the OCC where schools can post their project ideas and invite collaboration from other schools. This
88

Computer science guide

The group 4 project

could range from merely sharing evaluations for a common topic to a full-scale collaborative venture at all
stages.
For schools with few Diploma Programme (course) students or schools with Diploma Programme course
students, it is possible to work with non-Diploma Programme or non-group 4 students, or undertake the
project once every two years. However, these schools are encouraged to collaborate with another school.
This strategy is also recommended for individual students who may not have participated in the project, for
example, through illness or because they have transferred to a new school where the project has already
taken place.

Timing
The 10 hours that the IB recommends be allocated to the project may be spread over a number of weeks.
The distribution of these hours needs to be taken into account when selecting the optimum time to carry
out the project. However, it is possible for a group to dedicate a period of time exclusively to project work if
all/most other schoolwork is suspended.

Year 1
In the first year, students’ experience and skills may be limited and it would be inadvisable to start the
project too soon in the course. However, doing the project in the final part of the first year may have the
advantage of reducing pressure on students later on. This strategy provides time for solving unexpected
problems.

Year 1–Year 2
The planning stage could start, the topic could be decided upon, and provisional discussion in individual
subjects could take place at the end of the first year. Students could then use the vacation time to think
about how they are going to tackle the project and would be ready to start work early in the second year.

Year 2
Delaying the start of the project until some point in the second year, particularly if left too late, increases
pressure on students in many ways: the schedule for finishing the work is much tighter than for the other
options; the illness of any student or unexpected problems will present extra difficulties. Nevertheless,
this choice does mean students know one another and their teachers by this time, have probably become
accustomed to working in a team and will be more experienced in the relevant fields than in the first year.

Combined SL and HL
Where circumstances dictate that the project is only carried out every two years, HL beginners and more
experienced SL students can be combined.

Selecting a topic
Students may choose the topic or propose possible topics and the teacher then decides which one is the
most viable based on resources, staff availability and so on. Alternatively, the teacher selects the topic or
proposes several topics from which students make a choice.

Computer science guide

89

The group 4 project

Student selection
Students are likely to display more enthusiasm and feel a greater sense of ownership for a topic that they
have chosen themselves. A possible strategy for student selection of a topic, which also includes part of
the planning stage, is outlined here. At this point, subject teachers may provide advice on the viability of
proposed topics.
•

Identify possible topics by using a questionnaire or a survey of students.

•

Conduct an initial “brainstorming” session of potential topics or issues.

•

Discuss, briefly, two or three topics that seem interesting.

•

Select one topic by consensus.

•

Students make a list of potential investigations that could be carried out. All students then discuss
issues such as possible overlap and collaborative investigations.

A reflective statement written by each student on their involvement in the group 4 project must be included
on the coversheet for each internal assessment investigation. See the Handbook of procedures for more
details.
