Introduction

The Diploma Programme

The Diploma Programme is a rigorous pre-university course of study designed for students in the 16 to 19
age range. It is a broad-based two-year course that aims to encourage students to be knowledgeable and
inquiring, but also caring and compassionate. There is a strong emphasis on encouraging students to
develop intercultural understanding, open-mindedness, and the attitudes necessary for them to respect
and evaluate a range of points of view.

The Diploma Programme model
The course is presented as six academic areas enclosing a central core (see figure 1). It encourages the
concurrent study of a broad range of academic areas. Students study two modern languages (or a modern
language and a classical language); a humanities or social science subject; a science; mathematics; and
one of the creative arts. It is this comprehensive range of subjects that makes the Diploma Programme a
demanding course of study designed to prepare students effectively for university entrance. In each of the
academic areas students have flexibility in making their choices, which means they can choose subjects that
particularly interest them and that they may wish to study further at university.

The Diploma Programme

Choosing the right combination
Students are required to choose one subject from each of the six academic areas, although they can, instead
of an arts subject, choose two subjects from another area. Normally, three subjects (and not more than
four) are taken at higher level (HL), and the others are taken at standard level (SL). The IB recommends 240
teaching hours for HL subjects and 150 hours for SL. Subjects at HL are studied in greater depth and breadth
than at SL.
At both levels, many skills are developed, especially those of critical thinking and analysis. At the end of
the course, students’ abilities are measured by means of external assessment. Many subjects contain some
element of coursework assessed by teachers.

The core of the Diploma Programme model
All Diploma Programme students participate in the three course elements that make up the core of the
model.
Theory of knowledge (TOK) is a course that is fundamentally about critical thinking and inquiry into the
process of knowing rather than about learning a specific body of knowledge. The TOK course examines the
nature of knowledge and how we know what we claim to know. It does this by encouraging students to
analyse knowledge claims and explore questions about the construction of knowledge. The task of TOK is to
emphasize connections between areas of shared knowledge and link them to personal knowledge in such a
way that an individual becomes more aware of his or her own perspectives and how they might differ from
others.
Creativity, activity, service (CAS) is at the heart of the Diploma Programme. The emphasis in CAS is on
helping students to develop their own identities, in accordance with the ethical principles embodied in
the IB mission statement and the IB learner profile. It involves students in a range of activities alongside
their academic studies throughout the Diploma Programme. The three strands of CAS are creativity (arts
and other experiences that involve creative thinking), activity (physical exertion contributing to a healthy
lifestyle) and service (an unpaid and voluntary exchange that has a learning benefit for the student).
Possibly, more than any other component in the Diploma Programme, CAS contributes to the IB’s mission to
create a better and more peaceful world through intercultural understanding and respect.
The extended essay, including the world studies extended essay, offers the opportunity for IB students to
investigate a topic of special interest, in the form of a 4,000-word piece of independent research. The area of
research undertaken is chosen from one of the students’ Diploma Programme subjects, or in the case of the
interdisciplinary world studies essay, two subjects, and acquaints them with the independent research and
writing skills expected at university. This leads to a major piece of formally presented, structured writing, in
which ideas and findings are communicated in a reasoned and coherent manner, appropriate to the subject
or subjects chosen. It is intended to promote high-level research and writing skills, intellectual discovery
and creativity. As an authentic learning experience it provides students with an opportunity to engage in
personal research on a topic of choice, under the guidance of a supervisor.

The Diploma Programme

Approaches to teaching and approaches to learning
Approaches to teaching and learning across the Diploma Programme refer to deliberate strategies, skills and
attitudes which permeate the teaching and learning environment. These approaches and tools, intrinsically
linked with the learner profile attributes, enhance student learning and assist student preparation for the
Diploma Programme assessment and beyond. The aims of approaches to teaching and learning in the
Diploma Programme are to:
•

empower teachers as teachers of learners as well as teachers of content

•

empower teachers to create clearer strategies for facilitating learning experiences in which students
are more meaningfully engaged in structured inquiry and greater critical and creative thinking

•

promote both the aims of individual subjects (making them more than course aspirations) and linking
previously isolated knowledge (concurrency of learning)

•

encourage students to develop an explicit variety of skills that will equip them to continue to be
actively engaged in learning after they leave school, and to help them not only obtain university
admission through better grades but also prepare for success during tertiary education and beyond

•

enhance further the coherence and relevance of the students’ Diploma Programme experience

•

allow schools to identify the distinctive nature of an IB Diploma Programme education, with its blend
of idealism and practicality.

The five approaches to learning (developing thinking skills, social skills, communication skills, selfmanagement skills and research skills) along with the six approaches to teaching (teaching that is inquirybased, conceptually focused, contextualized, collaborative, differentiated and informed by assessment)
encompass the key values and principles that underpin IB pedagogy.

The IB mission statement and the IB learner profile
The Diploma Programme aims to develop in students the knowledge, skills and attitudes they will need
to fulfill the aims of the IB, as expressed in the organization’s mission statement and the learner profile.
Teaching and learning in the Diploma Programme represent the reality in daily practice of the organization’s
educational philosophy.

Academic honesty
Academic honesty in the Diploma Programme is a set of values and behaviours informed by the attributes
of the learner profile. In teaching, learning and assessment, academic honesty serves to promote personal
integrity, engender respect for the integrity of others and their work, and ensure that all students have an
equal opportunity to demonstrate the knowledge and skills they acquire during their studies.
All coursework—including work submitted for assessment—is to be authentic, based on the student’s
individual and original ideas with the ideas and work of others fully acknowledged. Assessment tasks that
require teachers to provide guidance to students or that require students to work collaboratively must be
completed in full compliance with the detailed guidelines provided by the IB for the relevant subjects.
For further information on academic honesty in the IB and the Diploma Programme, please consult the
IB publications Academic honesty (2011), The Diploma Programme: From principles into practice (2009) and
General regulations: Diploma Programme (2011). Specific information regarding academic honesty as it
pertains to external and internal assessment components of this Diploma Programme subject can be found
in this guide.

The Diploma Programme

Acknowledging the ideas or work of another person
Coordinators and teachers are reminded that candidates must acknowledge all sources used in work
submitted for assessment. The following is intended as a clarification of this requirement.
Diploma Programme candidates submit work for assessment in a variety of media that may include audiovisual material, text, graphs, images and/or data published in print or electronic sources. If a candidate uses
the work or ideas of another person, the candidate must acknowledge the source using a standard style of
referencing in a consistent manner. A candidate’s failure to acknowledge a source will be investigated by the
IB as a potential breach of regulations that may result in a penalty imposed by the IB final award committee.
The IB does not prescribe which style(s) of referencing or in-text citation should be used by candidates; this
is left to the discretion of appropriate faculty/staff in the candidate’s school. The wide range of subjects,
three response languages and the diversity of referencing styles make it impractical and restrictive to insist
on particular styles. In practice, certain styles may prove most commonly used, but schools are free to
choose a style that is appropriate for the subject concerned and the language in which candidates’ work is
written. Regardless of the reference style adopted by the school for a given subject, it is expected that the
minimum information given includes: name of author, date of publication, title of source, and page numbers
as applicable.
Candidates are expected to use a standard style and use it consistently so that credit is given to all sources
used, including sources that have been paraphrased or summarized. When writing text, candidates must
clearly distinguish between their words and those of others by the use of quotation marks (or other method,
such as indentation) followed by an appropriate citation that denotes an entry in the bibliography. If an
electronic source is cited, the date of access must be indicated. Candidates are not expected to show faultless
expertise in referencing, but are expected to demonstrate that all sources have been acknowledged.
Candidates must be advised that audio-visual material, text, graphs, images and/or data published in print
or in electronic sources that is not their own must also attribute the source. Again, an appropriate style of
referencing/citation must be used.

Learning diversity and learning support
requirements
Schools must ensure that equal access arrangements and reasonable adjustments are provided to
candidates with learning support requirements that are in line with the IB documents Candidates with
assessment access requirements and Learning diversity in the International Baccalaureate programmes: Special
educational needs within the International Baccalaureate programmes.

Introduction

Nature of design

1. What is design?
1.1

Design is a process that links innovation and creativity.

1.2

Design provides a structured process based on well-established design principles to resolve authentic
problems.

1.3

Design involves generating ideas, exploring the possibilities and constraints to find solutions.

1.4

Design is a cyclical and iterative process.

1.5

Design is human-centred and focuses on the needs, wants and limitations of the end user.

1.6

Competent design can be achieved by all and is not restricted to uniquely skilled individuals. The use
of well-established design principles and processes increases the probability that a design will be
successful.

1.7

Designers use a wide variety of concepts, principles and strategies, which, taken together, make up
what is known as design methodology. Designers adapt their approach to different design contexts,
but they have a common understanding of the process necessary to form valid and suitable solutions.

1.8

Competent design requires imagination and creativity together with substantial factual, procedural
and conceptual knowledge.

1.9

In-depth investigation of the nature of a problem is required to establish clear parameters for a design
specification. This determines the scope of a solution and is necessary for good decision-making.

1.10 Designers must adopt an approach that allows them to think creatively within the constraints of a
design specification. The ability to create unique and original solutions to a proposed problem is
advantageous.
1.11 Designers need to critically explore the latest advances in technology to determine whether they can
be used to develop the best solution to a problem. Traditional methods can be more appropriate and
user-friendly.
1.12 Design is a collaborative endeavour requiring diverse teams of experts to realize a tangible solution.
1.13 Modelling is central to design. This involves cognitive, graphical, physical, aesthetic, mechanical, and
digital modelling.
1.14 The growth in computing power has made modelling much more powerful. The generation of digital
prototypes allows dynamic modelling of complex situations. Simulations involving large amounts of
data, large numbers of variables and complex calculations speed up the design process and extend
possible solutions.
1.15 A designer should maintain an unbiased view of a situation and evaluate a context objectively,
highlighting the strengths, weaknesses and opportunities of a product, service or system.
1.16 Designers have a responsibility to the community and the environment. Their decisions often have
major impact on both and they must always be aware of the ethical and moral dimensions of their
work.

6

Design technology guide

Nature of design

1.17 Design is carried out by a community of people from a wide variety of backgrounds and traditions, and
this has clearly influenced the way design has progressed at different times. However, it is important
to understand that design is universal and has common understandings, methodologies, and goals.
1.18 Designers must consider how users will interact with, use and misuse the products they design.
1.19 Designers should be aware that with the advancement of technology, there are now issues surrounding
security and safety of personal data that need to be addressed in the majority of contexts.
1.20 Design permeates every aspect of human experience. Individuals make design decisions in all areas of
their work, home and leisure.

2. The role of science and technology in design
2.1

Both science and technology have a fundamental relationship with design. Technology preceded
science, but now most technological developments are based on scientific understanding.

2.2

Traditional technology comprised useful artifacts often with little understanding of the science
underpinning their production and use. In contrast, modern technology involves the application of
scientific discoveries to produce useful artifacts.

2.3

The application of scientific discovery to solve a problem enables designers to create new technologies.

2.4

These new technologies can be utilized by scientists to make new scientific discoveries.

2.5

Designers use new and existing technologies to create new products, services and systems.

2.6

The rapid pace of scientific discovery has impacted the rate that designers can develop new
technologies. New technologies allow new products to be developed, which solve long-standing
problems, improve on existing solutions and fill gaps in markets.

2.7

Often, by solving one problem and designing new technologies, there are unforeseen consequences,
which bring new problems.

2.8

Technology is designed in response to changes in human needs. Many societies have benefited from
the design of technologies to provide resources, such as electricity and fresh water supplies, clothing,
food and transport.

2.9

The technologies that sustain the digital revolution are only one facet of technology. Design remains
involved in developing technology to satisfy basic human needs and make people’s lives easier.

2.10 The concept of sustainability is becoming a greater priority for designers. The development of
sustainable technologies is a response to environmental and social pressures relating to climate
change, energy and resource depletion.

3. Characteristics of a good designer
The following characteristics frame a profile of both professional and aspiring designers. They reflect the
desirable abilities, skill sets and mindset of all designers.
Designers can/are able to:
3.1

problem solve/troubleshoot in any context or situation, across a variety of design disciplines

3.2

realize innovative products, services, systems and technologies by learning through failure, extensive
trialling, constant evaluation and redevelopment, perseverance and determination

3.3

seek, establish and verify broad concepts and general principles that underlie design methodology

Design technology guide

Nature of design

3.4

conduct thorough research, synthesize evidence and apply the findings to the development of
innovative products, services, systems and technologies

3.5

carefully observe human interactions and situations, identify and monitor short- and long-term trends
and ask pertinent questions to explore design opportunities

3.6

assess the risks associated with the design and use of technology as well as any associated moral,
social, ethical or environmental issues

3.7

think creatively and develop ideas beyond the confines of existing concepts, principles and modes of
thinking

3.8

empathize with individuals or groups to ascertain and identify needs or design opportunities

3.9

Introduction

Nature of design technology

Design, and the resultant development of new technologies, has given rise to profound changes in
society: transforming how we access and process information; how we adapt our environment; how we
communicate with others; how we are able to solve problems; how we work and live.
Technology emerged before science, and materials were used to produce useful and decorative artifacts
long before there was an understanding of why materials had different properties that could be used
for different purposes. In the modern world the reverse is the case, and designers need to have an
understanding of the possibilities offered by science to realize the full potential of what they can design in
terms of new technologies, products and systems.
Design is the link between innovation and creativity, taking thoughts and exploring the possibilities and
constraints associated with products or systems, allowing them to redefine and manage the generation of
further thought through prototyping, experimentation and adaptation. It is human-centred and focuses on
the needs, wants and limitations of the end user.
Competent design is within the reach of all. Through the practice and application of well-established design
principles and methodologies, individuals can increase the likelihood that a design will be successful. These
principles taken together make up what is known as the design cycle.
Designing requires an individual to be imaginative and creative, while having a substantial knowledge
base of important factors that will aid or constrain the process. Decision-making needs to be supported
by adequate and appropriate research and investigation. Designers must think “out of the box” to develop
innovative solutions, while thinking “in the box” to conform to requirements set by clients or research.
Both the ideas of design and the process of design can only occur in a human context. Design involves
multidisciplinary teams and stakeholders with different backgrounds and traditions. It is important to
understand, however, that to design is to be involved in a community of inquiry with certain common
beliefs, methodologies, understandings and processes. Design is multidisciplinary and draws from many
areas including the natural and social sciences, mathematics and arts.
Diploma Programme design technology aims to develop internationally minded people whose enhanced
understanding of design and the technological world can facilitate our shared guardianship of the planet
and create a better world.
It focuses on analysis, design development, synthesis and evaluation. The creative tension between theory
and practice is what characterizes design technology within the Diploma Programme sciences group.
Inquiry and problem-solving are at the heart of the subject. Diploma Programme design technology
requires the use of the design cycle as a tool, which provides the methodology used to structure the inquiry
and analysis of problems, the development of feasible solutions, and the testing and evaluation of the
solution. In Diploma Programme design technology, a solution can be defined as a model, prototype,
product or system that students have developed independently.
Diploma Programme design technology achieves a high level of design literacy by enabling students to
develop critical-thinking and design skills, which they can apply in a practical context. While designing may
take various forms, it will involve the selective application of knowledge within an ethical framework.
A well-planned design programme enables students to develop not only practical skills but also strategies
for creative and critical thinking.

Nature of design technology

The design cycle
Each and every designer approaches a problem in a different way. Depending on the designers’ specialism,
they tend to have their own methodology, but there are some general activities common to all designers.
The design cycle model is a fundamental concept underpinning the design process and central to a
student’s understanding of design activities.

Figure 2
The Diploma Programme Higher level design cycle
The design cycle diagram (figure 2) represents the Diploma Programme design technology methodology of
how designers develop products. The process is divided into the following four stages.
•

Analysis of a design opportunity

•

Conceptual design

•

Development of a detailed design

•

Testing and evaluation

This incremental process allows the designer to go from identifying a design opportunity to the testing and
evaluation of a solution. This process leads to invention.
At higher level (HL), the following two additional stages are added.
•

Detailed development of a commercial product

•

Making choices for commercial production

10

Design technology guide

Nature of design technology

The student must take his or her invention and plan to develop it into an innovation, that is get the product
to diffuse into the marketplace. The two new stages are designed to extend the students’ skills and ability to
create innovations.

Design technology and the international dimension
Technology itself is an international endeavour; the exchange of information and ideas around the world has
been both a cause and an effect of the development of technology. This exchange is not a new phenomenon
but it has accelerated in recent times with the development of information and communication
technologies. Indeed, the idea that technology is a modern invention is a myth—people began developing
technologies when they first started fashioning tools from stones, making fire to process their food, and
shaping material to keep themselves warm. Teachers are encouraged to emphasize this contribution in
their teaching of various topics, perhaps through an analysis of the principles of early technologies and the
use of timeline websites. The design technology method in its widest sense, with its emphasis on creativity,
innovation, open-mindedness and freedom of thought, transcends politics, religion and nationality. Where
appropriate within certain topics, the syllabus details sections in the group 4 guides contain links illustrating
the international aspects of technology.
On an organizational level, many international bodies now exist to analyse and promote technology.
International bodies such as the International Labour Organization, the United Nations Industrial
Development Organization, the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, the United
Nations Conference on Trade and Development and many others monitor, plan and provide information
about global technology issues. The rapid profusion of these international organizations attests to the
global nature of technology: both the internationalization of the design and development of technology,
and the global effects of technologies, for example, climate change. Students are encouraged to access the
extensive websites of these international organizations to enhance their appreciation of the international
dimensions of technology.
Some topics in the guide are specifically written to bring out this global dimension. On a practical level, the
group 4 project mirrors real design methodology by encouraging collaboration between schools across the
regions.
The power of technology to transform societies is unparalleled. It has the potential to produce great
universal benefits or to reinforce inequalities and cause harm to people and the environment. In line with
the IB mission statement, students need to be aware of the moral responsibility of designers to ensure that
appropriate technologies are available to all communities on an equitable basis and that they have the
technological capacity to use this for developing sustainable societies.
Students’ attention should be drawn to sections of the syllabus with links to international-mindedness.
Examples of issues relating to international-mindedness are given within sub-topics in the syllabus content.

Nature of design technology

Distinction between SL and HL
Design technology students at standard level (SL) and higher level (HL) undertake a common core and have
four common assessment criteria used for their internal assessment (IA). They are presented with a syllabus
that encourages the development of certain skills, attributes and attitudes, as described in the “Assessment
objectives” section of this guide.
While the skills and activities of design technology are common to students at both SL and HL, students at
HL are required to study additional topics and are required to meet two additional assessment criteria for
internal assessment. The distinction between SL and HL is one of breadth and depth.

Prior learning
Past experience shows that students will be able to study design technology at SL successfully with no
background in, or previous knowledge of, the subject. Their approach to study, characterized by the specific
IB learner profile attributes—inquirers, thinkers and communicators—will be significant here.
However, for most students considering the study of design technology at HL some previous exposure to
design would be beneficial. Specific topic details are not specified but students who have undertaken the
IB Middle Years Programme (MYP) would be well prepared. Other national design technology education
qualifications or a school-based design technology course would also be suitable preparation for study of
design technology at HL.

Links to the Middle Years Programme
Diploma Programme design technology builds on experiences of inquiry that students have gained in their
time in the IB Primary Years Programme (PYP) and MYP. PYP teaching and learning experiences challenge
students to be curious, ask questions, explore and interact with the environment physically, socially
and intellectually to construct meaning and refine their understanding. Even when there is no design
component in the PYP, the use of structured inquiry is a precursor to the problem-solving and inquiry-based
approach of MYP design.
The inquiry-based approach of MYP design courses thoroughly prepare students for Diploma Programme
design technology. The MYP design objectives and assessment criteria provide a clear and smooth transition
from the MYP to Diploma Programme. The alignment between the design methodology expressed through
the MYP design cycle is further developed in Diploma Programme design technology with problem-solving
through invention at the heart of SL; and this is further extended towards innovation at HL. As such, students
continuing on to Diploma Programme design technology from MYP have gained a wealth of experience
using the MYP design cycle and will have developed critical-thinking and design skills, which they will be
able to apply to solve more complex problems.

Design technology and theory of knowledge
The theory of knowledge (TOK) course (first assessment 2015) engages students in reflection on the
nature of knowledge and on how we know what we claim to know. The course identifies eight ways of
knowing: reason, emotion, language, sense perception, intuition, imagination, faith and memory. Students
explore these means of producing knowledge within the context of various areas of knowledge: the
natural sciences, the social sciences, the arts, ethics, history, mathematics, religious knowledge systems
and indigenous knowledge systems. The course also requires students to make comparisons between the
different areas of knowledge; reflecting on how knowledge is arrived at in the various disciplines, what the
disciplines have in common, and the differences between them.
TOK lessons can support students in their study of design technology, just as the study of design technology
can support students in their TOK course. TOK provides a space for students to engage in stimulating
wider discussions about questions such as the extent to which technology is both an enabler and limiter
of knowledge. It also provides an opportunity for students to reflect on the methodologies of design
technology, and how these compare to the methodologies of other areas of knowledge.
Design technology guide

13

Nature of design technology

In this way there are rich opportunities for students to make links between their design technology and
TOK courses. One way in which design technology teachers can help students to make these links to TOK is
by drawing students’ attention to knowledge questions which arise from their subject content. Knowledge
questions are open-ended questions about knowledge, and include questions such as:
•

How does knowledge in design technology progress? How does that compare to how knowledge
progresses in other areas of knowledge?

•

Are intuitively appealing explanations more likely to be true than explanations supported by other
means?

•

What is the role of imagination in design technology?

•

Are the methods used in design technology closer to the methods used in the arts or the methods
used in the natural sciences?

•

What is the relationship between facts/data and theories, and how does this differ in different areas of
knowledge?

•

What is the impact of culture in the production and distribution of knowledge in various areas of
knowledge?

•

To what extent does the methodology of an investigation limit or determine the possible outcomes?

Suggestions for TOK discussions and examples of relevant knowledge questions are provided throughout
this guide, within the sub-topics in the syllabus content. Teachers can also find suggestions of interesting
knowledge questions for discussion in the “Areas of knowledge” and “Knowledge frameworks” sections
of the Theory of knowledge guide. Students should be encouraged to raise and discuss such knowledge
questions in both their design technology and TOK classes.

Aims

Design technology aims
Through studying design technology, students should become aware of how designers work and
communicate with each other. While the design methodology may take on a wide variety of forms, it is the
emphasis on a practical approach through design work that characterizes this subject.
The aims of the subject state in a general way what the teacher may expect to teach or do, and what a
student may expect to experience or learn.

Syllabus

Approaches to the teaching of design technology

Format of the syllabus
The format of the syllabus section of the group 4 guides gives prominence and focus to the teaching and
learning aspects.

Topics
Topics are numbered for ease of reference (for example, “Topic 2: Resource management and sustainable
production”).

Sub-topics
Sub-topics are numbered as follows, “2.1 Resources and reserves”. Further information and guidance about
possible teaching times are contained in the teacher support material.
Each sub-topic begins with an essential idea. The essential idea is an enduring interpretation that is
considered part of the general understanding of design.
Below the essential idea the sub-topic is presented in three columns.
The first column is the “Nature of design”. This gives specific examples in context illustrating some aspects
of the nature of design. These are linked directly to specific references in the “Nature of design” section of
the guide to support teachers in their understanding of the general theme to be addressed.
The second column lists concepts and principles, which are the main general ideas to be taught, and
“Guidance” gives information about the limits and constraints and the depth of treatment required.
The third column gives suggestions to teachers about relevant references to international-mindedness. It
also gives examples of TOK knowledge questions (see Theory of knowledge guide published 2013) that can be
used to focus students’ thoughts on the preparation of the TOK prescribed essay. The “Utilization” section
may link the sub-topic to other parts of the subject syllabus and other Diploma Programme subject guides.
Finally, the “Aims” section refers to how design technology aims are being addressed in the sub-topic.

Design technology practical skills
I hear and I forget. I see and I remember. I do and I understand.
Confucius
Integral to the experience of students in any of the group 4 courses is their experience in the classroom,
workshop, laboratory or in the field. Practical activities allow students to interact directly with natural
materials, and primary and secondary data sources. These experiences provide the students with the
opportunity to design investigations, collect data, develop manipulative skills, analyse results, collaborate
with peers and evaluate and communicate their findings. Practical activities can be used to introduce a
topic, investigate a phenomenon or allow students to consider and examine questions and curiosities.
By providing students with the opportunity for hands-on experimentation, they are carrying out some of
the same processes that designers undertake.
It is important that students are involved in an inquiry-based practical programme that allows for the
development of design thinking. It is not enough for students just to be able follow directions and to simply
replicate a given procedure, they must be provided with the opportunities for genuine inquiry. Developing
inquiry skills will give students the ability to construct an explanation based on reliable evidence and logical
reasoning. Once developed, these higher-order thinking skills will enable students to be lifelong learners
and design literate.

Approaches to the teaching of design technology

A school’s practical scheme of work should allow students to experience the full breadth and depth of the
course. This practical scheme of work must also prepare students to undertake the design project that is
required for the internal assessment. The development of students’ manipulative skills should involve them
being able to follow instructions accurately and demonstrate the safe, competent and methodical use of a
range of techniques and equipment, which can then be applied to a range of design contexts.

Mathematical requirements
All Diploma Programme design technology students should be able to:
•

perform the basic arithmetic functions: addition, subtraction, multiplication and division

•

carry out calculations involving means, decimals, fractions, percentages, ratios, approximations and
reciprocals

•

use scientific notation (for example, 3.6 × 106)

•

use direct and inverse proportion

•

solve simple algebraic equations

•

plot and interpret graphs (with suitable scales and axes) including two variables that show linear and
non-linear relationships

•

interpret graphs, including the significance of gradients, changes in gradients, intercepts and areas

•

interpret data presented in various forms (for example, bar charts, histograms and pie charts).

Use of information and communication technology
Information and communication technology (ICT) involves the use of computers, its applications and
communication facilities in teaching and learning activities. Therefore, the use of ICT goes beyond Diploma
Programme design technology and extends to all the teaching and learning in all subjects across the
curriculum. The effective use of ICT is included in approaches to learning (ATL) and, as such, schools must
ensure that a whole-school approach is in place to allow students to develop information and technological
literacy and become competent users of information and communication technologies such as computers
and computer numerical control (CNC) machinery.
Depending upon the school resources, ICT should be used whenever appropriate:
•

as a means of expanding students’ knowledge of the world in which they live

•

as a channel for developing concepts and skills

•

as a powerful communication tool.

Planning your course
The syllabus as provided in the subject guide is not intended to be a teaching order. Instead it provides
detail of what must be covered by the end of the course. A school should develop a scheme of work that
best works for their students. For example, the scheme of work could be developed to match available
resources, to take into account student prior learning and experience, or in conjunction with other local
requirements.

Approaches to the teaching of design technology

HL teachers may choose to teach the core and AHL topics at the same time or teach them in a spiral fashion,
by teaching the core topics in year one of the course and revisiting the core topics through the delivery of
the AHL topics in year two of the course.
However the course is planned, adequate time must be provided for examination revision. Time must also
be given for students to reflect on their learning experience and their growth as learners.

The IB learner profile
The design technology course is closely linked to the IB learner profile. By following the course, students
will have engaged with the attributes of the IB learner profile. For example, the requirements of the internal
assessment provide opportunities for students to develop every aspect of the profile. For each attribute of
the learner profile, a number of references are given below.

Design is human centred and, therefore, designers
need to ensure that the products they design are
the right size for the user and therefore comfortable
to use. Designers have access to data and drawings,
which state measurements of human beings of all
ages and sizes. Designers need to consider how users
will interact with the product or service. Use and
misuse is an important consideration. (1.5, 1.18, 1.20)

Human beings vary psychologically in complex
ways. Any attempt by designers to classify people
into groups merely results in a statement of broad
principles that may or may not be relevant to the
individual. Design permeates every aspect of human
experience and data pertaining to what cannot
be seen such as touch, taste, and smell are often
expressions of opinion rather than checkable fact. (1.5,

The abundance of resources and raw materials in the
industrial age led to the development of a throwaway
society, and as resources run out, the many facets of
sustainability become a more important focus for
designers. The result of the throwaway society is large
amounts of materials found in landfill, which can be
considered as a new source to mine resources from.

Efficient energy use is an important consideration
for designers in today’s society. Energy conservation
and efficient energy use are pivotal in our impact
on the environment. A designer’s goal is to reduce
the amount of energy required to provide products
or services using newer technologies or creative
implementation of systems to reduce usage. For
example, driving less is an example of energy
conservation, while driving the same amount but with
a higher mileage car is energy efficient. (1.11, 1.16, 2.10)

A design team should be “user” driven and
frequent contact with potential users is essential. To
understand how a product, service or system may be
used, the designer must consider the prior knowledge
and experience of the users, as well as their typical
psychological responses. Evaluation methods that
utilize appropriate testing and trialling strategies must
be used to determine these aspects. (1.5, 1.16, 1.18)
Usability objectives include usefulness,
effectiveness, learnability, attitude (likeability)
Benefits of enhanced usability include product
acceptance, user experience, productivity, user
error, training and support

Designers must consider the market when targeting
their product, service or system. The smaller the
sector, the more the target audience will have in
common. Companies may decide to compete in the
whole market or only in segments that are attractive
and/or familiar. A designer’s understanding of the
identified market is essential. (2.6)

Two broad categories of market sectors are
geographical- and client-based, with specific
segments varying greatly.

employs many of the methods of gaining
knowledge most closely associated with the
human sciences. What are these methods of
gaining knowledge, and how do they compare
to the methods used in the natural sciences?

development and market segmentation
Market research strategies

•
•

•

Market research often identifies how to improve the
product, service or system and increase its chance
of success within a particular sector or segment. The
price a user is prepared to pay is usually determined
through market research. This in turn sets an upper
limit of cost to the design and production of a
potential product, service or system. Market research
has a crucial role in determining the constraints a
designer has to work within. (1.5)
The purpose of market research includes idea
generation and development; evaluating market
potential and economic trends; collecting
data relating to demographics, family roles,
consumers; identifying suitable promotional
strategies; considering technological trends and
scientific advances
Market research strategies include literature
search, expert appraisal, user trial, user research,
perceptual mapping and environmental
scanning

Assessment in the Diploma Programme

General
Assessment is an integral part of teaching and learning. The most important aims of assessment in the
Diploma Programme are that it should support curricular goals and encourage appropriate student
learning. Both external and internal assessments are used in the Diploma Programme. IB examiners mark
work produced for external assessment, while work produced for internal assessment is marked by teachers
and externally moderated by the IB.
There are two types of assessment identified by the IB.
•

Formative assessment informs both teaching and learning. It is concerned with providing accurate
and helpful feedback to students and teachers on the kind of learning taking place and the nature of
students’ strengths and weaknesses in order to help develop students’ understanding and capabilities.
Formative assessment can also help to improve teaching quality, as it can provide information to
monitor progress towards meeting the course aims and objectives.

•

Summative assessment gives an overview of previous learning and is concerned with measuring
student achievement.

The Diploma Programme primarily focuses on summative assessment designed to record student
achievement at, or towards the end of, the course of study. However, many of the assessment instruments
can also be used formatively during the course of teaching and learning, and teachers are encouraged to
do this. A comprehensive assessment plan is viewed as being integral with teaching, learning and course
organization. For further information, see the IB Programme standards and practices (2010) document.
The approach to assessment used by the IB is criterion-related, not norm-referenced. This approach to
assessment judges students’ work by their performance in relation to identified levels of attainment, and
not in relation to the work of other students. For further information on assessment within the Diploma
Programme please refer to the publication Diploma Programme assessment: Principles and practice (2009).
To support teachers in the planning, delivery and assessment of the Diploma Programme courses, a variety
of resources can be found on the OCC or purchased from the IB store (http://store.ibo.org). Additional
publications such as specimen papers and markschemes, teacher support materials, subject reports and
grade descriptors can also be found on the OCC. Past examination papers as well as markschemes can be
purchased from the IB store.

Methods of assessment
The IB uses several methods to assess work produced by students.

Assessment criteria
Assessment criteria are used when the assessment task is open-ended. Each criterion concentrates on
a particular skill that students are expected to demonstrate. An assessment objective describes what
students should be able to do, and assessment criteria describe how well they should be able to do it. Using
assessment criteria allows discrimination between different answers and encourages a variety of responses.

86

Design technology guide

Assessment in the Diploma Programme

Each criterion comprises a set of hierarchically ordered level descriptors. Each level descriptor is worth one
or more marks. Each criterion is applied independently using a best-fit model. The maximum marks for each
criterion may differ according to the criterion’s importance. The marks awarded for each criterion are added
together to give the total mark for the piece of work.

Markbands
Markbands are a comprehensive statement of expected performance against which responses are judged.
They represent a single holistic criterion divided into level descriptors. Each level descriptor corresponds
to a range of marks to differentiate student performance. A best-fit approach is used to ascertain which
particular mark to use from the possible range for each level descriptor.

Analytic markschemes
Analytic markschemes are prepared for those examination questions that expect a particular kind of
response and/or a given final answer from students. They give detailed instructions to examiners on how to
break down the total mark for each question for different parts of the response.

Marking notes
For some assessment components marked using assessment criteria, marking notes are provided. Marking
notes give guidance on how to apply assessment criteria to the particular requirements of a question.

Inclusive assessment arrangements
Inclusive assessment arrangements are available for candidates with assessment access requirements.
These arrangements enable candidates with diverse needs to access the examinations and demonstrate
their knowledge and understanding of the constructs being assessed.
The IB document Candidates with assessment access requirements provides details on all the inclusive
assessment arrangements available to candidates with learning support requirements. The IB document
Learning diversity in the International Baccalaureate programmes: Special educational needs within the
International Baccalaureate programmes outlines the position of the IB with regard to candidates with diverse
learning needs in the IB programmes. For candidates affected by adverse circumstances, the IB documents
General regulations: Diploma Programme (2011) and the Handbook of procedures for the Diploma Programme
provide details on access consideration.

Responsibilities of the school
The school is required to ensure that equal access arrangements and reasonable adjustments are provided
to candidates with learning support requirements that are in line with the IB documents Candidates with
assessment access requirements and Learning diversity in the International Baccalaureate programmes: Special
educational needs within the International Baccalaureate programmes.

Internal assessment

Purpose of internal assessment
Internal assessment is an integral part of the course and is compulsory for both SL and HL students. It
enables students to demonstrate the application of their skills and knowledge, and to pursue their personal
interests, without the time limitations and other constraints that are associated with written examinations.
The internal assessment should, as far as possible, be woven into normal classroom teaching and not be a
separate activity conducted after a course has been taught.
The internal assessment requirements at SL and at HL are different. The first four assessment criteria (A–D)
are common between SL and HL; however, HL design projects have additional requirements, which are
assessed using two additional criteria (E and F). This internal assessment section of the guide should be read
in conjunction with the internal assessment section of the teacher support material.

Guidance and authenticity
The work submitted for internal assessment must be the student’s own work. However, it is not the intention
that students should decide upon a title or topic and be left to work on the internal assessment component
without any further support from the teacher. The teacher should play an important role during both
the planning stage and the period when the student is working on the internally assessed work. It is the
responsibility of the teacher to ensure that students are familiar with:
•

the requirements of the type of work to be internally assessed

•

the IB animal experimentation policy

•

the assessment criteria; students must understand that the work submitted for assessment must
address these criteria effectively.

Teachers and students must discuss the internally assessed work. Students should be encouraged to initiate
discussions with the teacher to obtain advice and information, and students must not be penalized for
seeking guidance. As part of the learning process, teachers should read and give advice to students on one
draft of the work. The teacher should provide oral or written advice on how the work could be improved,
but not edit the draft. The next version handed to the teacher must be the final version for submission.
It is the responsibility of teachers to ensure that all students understand the basic meaning and significance
of concepts that relate to academic honesty, especially authenticity and intellectual property. Teachers
must ensure that all student work for assessment is prepared according to the requirements and must
explain clearly to students that the internally assessed work must be entirely their own. Where collaboration
between students is permitted, it must be clear to all students what the difference is between collaboration
and collusion.
All work submitted to the IB for moderation or assessment must be authenticated by a teacher, and must not
include any known instances of suspected or confirmed academic misconduct. Each student must confirm
that the work is his or her authentic work and constitutes the final version of that work. Once a student has
officially submitted the final version of the work it cannot be retracted. The requirement to confirm the
authenticity of work applies to the work of all students, not just the sample work that will be submitted to

92

Design technology guide

Internal assessment

the IB for the purpose of moderation. For further details refer to the IB publication Academic honesty (2011),
The Diploma Programme: From principles into practice (2009) and the relevant articles in General regulations:
Diploma Programme (2011).
Authenticity may be checked by discussion with the student on the content of the work, and scrutiny of one
or more of the following:
•

the student’s initial proposal

•

the first draft of the written work

•

the references cited

•

the style of writing compared with work known to be that of the student

•

the analysis of the work by a web-based plagiarism detection service such as http://www.turnitin.com.

The same piece of work cannot be submitted to meet the requirements of both the internal assessment and
the extended essay.

Group work
Each design project is an individual piece of work based on different research collected.
It should be made clear to students that all work connected with the writing of the design project, should
be their own. It is therefore helpful if teachers try to encourage in students a sense of responsibility for their
own learning so that they accept a degree of ownership and take pride in their own work.

Time allocation
Internal assessment is an integral part of the design technology course, contributing 40% to the final
assessment in the SL and the HL courses. This weighting should be reflected in the time that is allocated to
teaching the knowledge, skills and understanding required to undertake the work, as well as the total time
allocated to carry out the work.
It is recommended that a total of approximately 40 hours (SL) and 60 hours (HL) should be allocated to the
work. This should include:
•

time for the teacher to explain to students the requirements of the internal assessment

•

class time for students to work on the internal assessment component and ask questions

•

time for consultation between the teacher and each student

•

time to review and monitor progress, and to check authenticity.

Safety requirements and recommendations
While teachers are responsible for following national or local guidelines, which may differ from country to
country, attention should be given to the guidelines below, which were developed for the International
Council of Associations for Science Education (ICASE) Safety Committee by The Laboratory Safety Institute
(LSI).

Using assessment criteria for internal assessment
For internal assessment, a number of assessment criteria have been identified. Each assessment criterion has
level descriptors describing specific achievement levels, together with an appropriate range of marks. The
level descriptors concentrate on positive achievement, although for the lower levels failure to achieve may
be included in the description.
Teachers must judge the internally assessed work at SL and at HL against the criteria using the level
descriptors.
•

There are four common criteria used to assess both SL and HL; however, HL is assessed using two
additional criteria.

•

The aim is to find, for each criterion, the descriptor that conveys most accurately the level attained
by the student, using the best-fit model. A best-fit approach means that compensation should be
made when a piece of work matches different aspects of a criterion at different levels. The mark
awarded should be one that most fairly reflects the balance of achievement against the criterion. It is
not necessary for every single aspect of a level descriptor to be met for that mark to be awarded.

•

When assessing a student’s work, teachers should read the level descriptors for each criterion until
they reach a descriptor that most appropriately describes the level of the work being assessed. If a
piece of work seems to fall between two descriptors, both descriptors should be read again and the
one that more appropriately describes the student’s work should be chosen.

•

Where there are two or more marks available within a level, teachers should award the upper marks
if the student’s work demonstrates the qualities described to a great extent; the work may be close
to achieving marks in the level above. Teachers should award the lower marks if the student’s work
demonstrates the qualities described to a lesser extent; the work may be close to achieving marks in
the level below.

•

Only whole numbers should be recorded; partial marks (fractions and decimals) are not acceptable.

•

Teachers should not think in terms of a pass or fail boundary, but should concentrate on identifying
the appropriate descriptor for each assessment criterion.

96

Design technology guide

Internal assessment

•

The highest level descriptors do not imply faultless performance but should be achievable by a
student. Teachers should not hesitate to use the extremes if they are appropriate descriptions of the
work being assessed.

•

A student who attains a high achievement level in relation to one criterion will not necessarily
attain high achievement levels in relation to the other criteria. Similarly, a student who attains a low
achievement level for one criterion will not necessarily attain low achievement levels for the other
criteria. Teachers should not assume that the overall assessment of the students will produce any
particular distribution of marks.

•

It is recommended that the assessment criteria be made available to students.

Practical work and internal assessment
General introduction
The internal assessment (IA) requirement is worth 40% of the final assessment and consists of one design
project.
Student work is internally assessed by the teacher and externally moderated by the IB. The performance
in IA at both SL and HL is marked against 4 common assessment criteria, with an additional 2 assessment
criteria for HL.
The expectations at SL and HL for the 4 common assessment criteria are the same.
The IA task consists of one design project. At SL, this project will be completed in about 40 hours. At HL, this
project will be completed in about 60 hours. Each criterion should be addressed in about 10 hours.
Clarifications follow each assessment criterion with further detail of what is expected for each strand of the
criterion. Indications of the scope and size of the sections of each project can be found in the clarifications.
These amount to:
•

at SL, approximately 34 A4 pages (or equivalent), maximum 38 pages, and no more than 3000 words.

•

at HL, approximately 52 A4 pages (or equivalent), maximum 56 pages, and no more than 4000 words

•

appendices are not required and examiners will not read them or any information contained within
them.

These limits should be made clear to the students. The teacher should not award any marks for work over
the word or page limit. If selected in the sample for moderation, the examiner will stop reading the project
once these limits have been reached.
The design project allows a wide range of contexts to be explored through the varying material disciplines
of design technology, including product design, food product design, fashion design/textiles, electronic
product design, robotics, and so on. The design project addresses many of the learner profile attributes as
well.
The task produced should be complex and commensurate with the level of the course. It should require
a purposeful research question and the rationale for it. The marked exemplar material produced in the
teacher support material demonstrates that the assessment will be rigorous and of the same standard as the
assessment in the previous courses.
Exemplars of a range of design contexts appear in the teacher support material.
The assessment criteria are detailed in the following section and are all assessed using a 9 point scale.

Internal assessment criteria—Common to SL and HL
Criterion A: Analysis of a design opportunity
Clients and designers establish a design opportunity before engaging with the design process. Establishing
the design opportunity often stems from a real-life problem that needs to be solved. By investigating this
problem and design opportunity thoroughly, designers can gain clear direction in the requirements for a
prototype. To meet the requirements of this criterion, students must:
•

describe a problem that leads to a design opportunity

•

investigate the problem to develop a design brief

•

develop a design specification

Criterion B: Conceptual design
Once the design brief and specifications have been established, designers explore a range of possible
concepts through modelling. As the concepts are developed and refined, their feasibility is determined
against the specifications, which helps determine the most appropriate ideas to take forward into
detailed design development. Students will use concept modelling to develop ideas to meet appropriate
specifications that explore solutions to the problem and justify the most appropriate idea for detailed
development.

the prototype as a solution to the initial problem. The testing will also highlight areas of weakness where the
prototype has not met the required expectations. This leads to further iterative development. Students will

* A note on annotations
Annotations must not be more than 10 words each. Any annotation more than 10 words will be considered
as counting towards the word count.
Annotations must be legible, preferably typed. Students and teachers should ensure annotations can be
read clearly. Handwritten annotations must be clear and equivalent to Arial font size 11pt. To ensure clarity
when scanned, black ink is strongly recommended.

Appendices
Material placed in appendices form evidence for the teacher proving students have conducted background
research, collected and analysed raw data, and conducted tests for evaluation. The appendices are not
considered when marking or moderating. The appendices are not included as part of the ePortfolio for
eMarking. The appendices are not uploaded as part of the ePortfolio or as supporting material.

Instructions for teacher marking concerning appendices
It is important for teachers to mark the same work the moderator will see. Therefore, teachers must not refer
to or mark appendices when marking the design project. Teachers must only mark the required evidence for
the design project as detailed in the assessment criteria clarifications.

Rationale for practical work
Although the requirements for IA are centred on the design cycle and do not require students to create their
proposed solution themselves, the different types of practical and modelling work (10 hours at SL and 26
hours at HL) that a student may engage in serve other purposes, including:
•

illustrating, teaching and reinforcing theoretical concepts

•

developing an appreciation of the essential hands-on nature of much design work

•

developing an appreciation of designers’ use of secondary data from databases

•

developing an appreciation of designers’ use of modelling

•

developing an appreciation of the benefits and limitations of design methodology.

Therefore, there is good justification for teachers to conduct further practical activities/investigations
beyond that required for the IA scheme.

110

Design technology guide

Internal assessment

Practical scheme of work
The practical scheme of work (4/PSOWDT) is the practical course planned by the teacher and acts as a
summary of all the investigative activities carried out by a student. Students at SL and HL in the same subject
may carry out some of the same practical activities/investigations.

Syllabus coverage
The range of practical work carried out should reflect the breadth and depth of the subject syllabus at each
level, but it is not necessary to carry out a practical activity/investigation for every syllabus topic. However,
all students must participate in the group 4 project and meet the requirements of the IA.

Planning your practical scheme of work
Teachers are free to formulate their own practical schemes of work by choosing practical activities/
investigations according to the requirements outlined. Their choices should be based on:
•

subjects and levels taught

•

the needs of their students

•

available resources

•

teaching styles

Each scheme must include some complex practical activities/investigations that make greater conceptual
demands on students. A scheme made up entirely of simple practical activities/investigations, such as
ticking boxes or exercises involving filling in tables, will not provide an adequate range of experience for
students.
Teachers are encouraged to use the OCC to share ideas about possible practical activities by joining in the
discussion forums and adding resources in the subject home pages.

Creating a prototype
Students are not required to manufacture their own prototype; however, they do require a prototype of
their design in order to evaluate and test it when addressing criterion D.
Students are encouraged to manufacture their own prototype; however, this can be outsourced. The
prototype must be of sufficient quality so that it can be tested against the design and marketing
specifications. Students may require more than one prototype to test fully.

Teacher-directed activities (formative tasks)
Time has been allocated in the course for teacher-directed tasks: 10 hours at SL and 26 hours at HL. This time
can be used by teachers to direct students:
•

to practise and develop appropriate design and practical skills

•

to complete a mini-project that can be formatively assessed against the assessment criteria

•

to ensure that a prototype is manufactured (by themselves or outsourced) for evaluation as part of the
IA.

Design technology guide

111

Internal assessment

Flexibility
The practical programme is flexible enough to allow a wide variety of practical activities/investigations to
be carried out. These could include:
•

data-gathering exercises such as questionnaires, user trials and surveys

•

using databases for secondary data

•

data-analysis exercises

•

developing and using different types of modelling techniques and models

•

computer simulations and CAD

•

focused workshop/laboratory-based practical activities or projects extending over several weeks.

Practical work documentation
The 4/PSOW form is a record of all practical activities carried out by a class. The form is not required to
moderate the individual investigations, so it is not necessary to submit this form. However, the 4/PSOW
is an essential planning and recording document for teachers to ensure that a suitable range of practical
activities is carried out and that the appropriate hours are allocated to practical work. Teachers should
continue to maintain this form (or their own version of it including all the same information) to record the
practical activities carried out by the class. The form should be retained in the school and made available to
the IB, for example, during the five-year school evaluation process.

Time allocation for practical work
The recommended teaching times for all Diploma Programme courses are 150 hours at SL and 240 hours

(excluding time spent writing up work). These times include 10 hours for the group 4 project and 40 hours
(SL) and 60 hours (HL) for the IA. The remaining time is allocated to teacher-directed activities.

The group 4 project

The group 4 project is an interdisciplinary activity in which all Diploma Programme science students must
participate. The intention is that students from the different group 4 subjects analyse a common topic
or problem. The exercise should be a collaborative experience where the emphasis is on the processes
involved in, rather than the products of, such an activity.
In most cases students in a school would be involved in the investigation of the same topic. Where
there are large numbers of students, it is possible to divide them into several smaller groups containing
representatives from each of the science subjects. Each group may investigate the same topic or different
topics—that is, there may be several group 4 projects in the same school.
Students studying environmental systems and societies are not required to undertake the group 4 project.

Summary of the group 4 project
The group 4 project is a collaborative activity where students from different group 4 subjects work together
on a scientific or technological topic, allowing for concepts and perceptions from across the disciplines to
be shared in line with aim 10—that is, to “develop an understanding of the relationships between scientific
disciplines and their influence on other areas of knowledge”. The project can be practically or theoretically
based. Collaboration between schools in different regions is encouraged.
The group 4 project allows students to appreciate the environmental, social and ethical implications of science
and technology. It may also allow them to understand the limitations of scientific study, for example, the
shortage of appropriate data and/or the lack of resources. The emphasis is on interdisciplinary cooperation
and the processes involved in scientific investigation, rather than the products of such investigation.
The choice of scientific or technological topic is open but the project should clearly address group 4 aims 7,
8 and 10 of the biology, chemistry and physics subject guides.
Ideally, the project should involve students collaborating with those from other group 4 subjects at all
stages. To this end, it is not necessary for the topic chosen to have clearly identifiable separate subject
components. However, for logistical reasons, some schools may prefer a separate subject “action” phase
(see the following “Project stages” section).

Project stages
The 10 hours allocated to the group 4 project, which are part of the teaching time set aside for developing
the practical scheme of work, can be divided into three stages: planning, action and evaluation.

Planning
This stage is crucial to the whole exercise and should last about two hours.
•

The planning stage could consist of a single session, or two or three shorter ones.

•

This stage must involve all group 4 students meeting to “brainstorm” and discuss the central topic,
sharing ideas and information.

113

The group 4 project

•

The topic can be chosen by the students themselves or selected by the teachers.

•

Where large numbers of students are involved, it may be advisable to have more than one mixed
subject group.

After selecting a topic or issue, the activities to be carried out must be clearly defined before moving
from the planning stage to the action and evaluation stages.
A possible strategy is that students define specific tasks for themselves, either individually or as members of
groups, and investigate various aspects of the chosen topic. At this stage, if the project is to be experimentally
based, apparatus should be specified so that there is no delay in carrying out the action stage. Contact with
other schools, if a joint venture has been agreed, is an important consideration at this time.

Action
This stage should last around six hours and may be carried out over one or two weeks in normal scheduled
class time. Alternatively, a whole day could be set aside if, for example, the project involves fieldwork.
•

Students should investigate the topic in mixed-subject groups or single-subject groups.

•

There should be collaboration during the action stage; findings of investigations should be shared
with other students within the mixed/single-subject group. During this stage, in any practically based
activity, it is important to pay attention to safety, ethical and environmental considerations.

Note: Students studying two group 4 subjects are not required to do two separate action phases.

Evaluation
The emphasis during this stage, for which two hours are probably necessary, is on students sharing their
findings, both successes and failures, with other students. How this is achieved can be decided by the
teachers, the students or jointly.
•

One solution is to devote a morning, afternoon or evening to a symposium where all the students, as
individuals or as groups, give brief presentations.

•

Alternatively, the presentation could be more informal and take the form of a science fair where
students circulate around displays summarizing the activities of each group.

The symposium or science fair could also be attended by parents, members of the school board and the
press. This would be especially pertinent if some issue of local importance has been researched. Some of the
findings might influence the way the school interacts with its environment or local community.

Addressing aims 7 and 8
Aim 7: “develop and apply 21st century communication skills in the study of science.”
Aim 7 may be partly addressed at the planning stage by using electronic communication within and
between schools. It may be that technology (for example, data logging, spreadsheets, databases and so
on) will be used in the action phase and certainly in the presentation/evaluation stage (for example, use of
digital images, presentation software, websites, digital video and so on).
Aim 8: “become critically aware, as global citizens, of the ethical implications of using science and
technology.”

114

The group 4 project

Addressing the international dimension
There are also possibilities in the choice of topic to illustrate the international nature of the scientific
endeavour and the increasing cooperation required to tackle global issues involving science and technology.
An alternative way to bring an international dimension to the project is to collaborate with a school in
another region.

Types of project
While addressing aims 7, 8 and 10 the project must be based on science or its applications. The project may
have a hands-on practical action phase or one involving purely theoretical aspects. It could be undertaken
in a wide range of ways:
•

designing and carrying out a laboratory investigation or fieldwork

•

carrying out a comparative study (experimental or otherwise) in collaboration with another school

•

collating, manipulating and analysing data from other sources, such as scientific journals,
environmental organizations, science and technology industries and government reports

•

designing and using a model or simulation

•

contributing to a long-term project organized by the school.

Logistical strategies
The logistical organization of the group 4 project is often a challenge to schools. The following models
illustrate possible ways in which the project may be implemented.
Models A, B and C apply within a single school, and model D relates to a project involving collaboration
between schools.
Model A: mixed-subject groups and one topic
Schools may adopt mixed-subject groups and choose one common topic. The number of groups will
depend on the number of students.
Model B: mixed-subject groups adopting more than one topic
Schools with large numbers of students may choose to do more than one topic.
Model C: single-subject groups
For logistical reasons some schools may opt for single-subject groups, with one or more topics in the action
phase. This model is less desirable as it does not show the mixed subject collaboration in which many
scientists are involved.
Model D: collaboration with another school
The collaborative model is open to any school. To this end, the IB provides an electronic collaboration board
on the OCC where schools can post their project ideas and invite collaboration from other schools. This
could range from merely sharing evaluations for a common topic to a full-scale collaborative venture at all
stages.

The group 4 project

For schools with few Diploma Programme (course) students it is possible to work with non-Diploma
Programme or non-group 4 students, or undertake the project once every two years. However, these
schools are encouraged to collaborate with another school. This strategy is also recommended for individual
students who may not have participated in the project, for example, through illness or because they have
transferred to a new school where the project has already taken place.

Timing
The 10 hours that the IB recommends be allocated to the project may be spread over a number of weeks.
The distribution of these hours needs to be taken into account when selecting the optimum time to carry
out the project. However, it is possible for a group to dedicate a period of time exclusively to project work if
all/most other schoolwork is suspended.

Year 1
In the first year, students’ experience and skills may be limited and it would be inadvisable to start the
project too soon in the course. However, doing the project in the final part of the first year may have the
advantage of reducing pressure on students later on. This strategy provides time for solving unexpected
problems.

Year 1–Year 2
The planning stage could start, the topic could be decided upon, and provisional discussion in individual
subjects could take place at the end of the first year. Students could then use the vacation time to think
about how they are going to tackle the project and would be ready to start work early in the second year.

Year 2
Delaying the start of the project until some point in the second year, particularly if left too late, increases
pressure on students in many ways: the schedule for finishing the work is much tighter than for the other
options; the illness of any student or unexpected problems will present extra difficulties. Nevertheless,
this choice does mean students know one another and their teachers by this time, have probably become
accustomed to working in a team and will be more experienced in the relevant fields than in the first year.

Combined SL and HL
Where circumstances dictate that the project is only carried out every two years, HL beginners and more
experienced SL students can be combined.

Selecting a topic
Students may choose the topic or propose possible topics and the teacher then decides which one is the
most viable based on resources, staff availability and so on. Alternatively, the teacher selects the topic or
proposes several topics from which students make a choice.

116

Design technology guide

The group 4 project

Student selection
Students are likely to display more enthusiasm and feel a greater sense of ownership for a topic that they
have chosen themselves. A possible strategy for student selection of a topic, which also includes part of
the planning stage, is outlined here. At this point, subject teachers may provide advice on the viability of
proposed topics.
•

Identify possible topics by using a questionnaire or a survey of students.

•

Conduct an initial “brainstorming” session of potential topics or issues.

•

Discuss, briefly, two or three topics that seem interesting.

•

Select one topic by consensus.

•

Students make a list of potential investigations that could be carried out. All students then discuss
issues such as possible overlap and collaborative investigations.

A reflective statement written by each student on their involvement in the group 4 project must be
included on the coversheet for each internal assessment investigation. See the Handbook of procedures for
the Diploma Programme for more details.
