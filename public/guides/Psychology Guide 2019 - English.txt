The Diploma Programme
The Diploma Programme is a rigorous pre-university course of study designed for students in the 16 to 19
age range. It is a broad-based two-year course that aims to encourage students to be knowledgeable and
inquiring, but also caring and compassionate. There is a strong emphasis on encouraging students to
develop intercultural understanding, open-mindedness, and the attitudes necessary for them to respect
and evaluate a range of points of view.

The Diploma Programme model
The course is presented as six academic areas enclosing a central core (see figure 1). It encourages the
concurrent study of a broad range of academic areas. Students study two modern languages (or a modern
language and a classical language), a humanities or social science subject, an experimental science,
mathematics and one of the creative arts. It is this comprehensive range of subjects that makes the
Diploma Programme a demanding course of study designed to prepare students effectively for university
entrance. In each of the academic areas students have flexibility in making their choices, which means
they can choose subjects that particularly interest them and that they may wish to study further at
university.

Figure 1
Diploma Programme model

Choosing the right combination
Students are required to choose one subject from each of the six academic areas, although they can,
instead of an arts subject, choose two subjects from another area. Normally, three subjects (and not
more than four) are taken at higher level (HL), and the others are taken at standard level (SL). The IB
recommends 240 teaching hours for HL subjects and 150 hours for SL. Subjects at HL are studied in
greater depth and breadth than at SL.

8

At both levels, many skills are developed, especially those of critical thinking and analysis. At the end of
the course, students’ abilities are measured by means of external assessment. Many subjects contain some
element of coursework assessed by teachers.

The core of the Diploma Programme model
All Diploma Programme students participate in the three course elements that make up the core of the
model.
Theory of knowledge (TOK) is a course that is fundamentally about critical thinking and inquiry into the
process of knowing rather than about learning a specific body of knowledge. The TOK course examines
the nature of knowledge and how we know what we claim to know. It does this by encouraging students
to analyse knowledge claims and explore questions about the construction of knowledge. The task of TOK
is to emphasize connections between areas of shared knowledge and link them to personal knowledge
in such a way that an individual becomes more aware of his or her own perspectives and how they might
differ from others.
Creativity, activity, service (CAS) is at the heart of the Diploma Programme. The emphasis in CAS is on
helping students to develop their own identities, in accordance with the ethical principles embodied in
the IB mission statement and the IB learner profile. It involves students in a range of activities alongside
their academic studies throughout the Diploma Programme. The three strands of CAS are creativity (arts,
and other experiences that involve creative thinking), activity (physical exertion contributing to a healthy
lifestyle) and service (an unpaid and voluntary exchange that has a learning benefit for the student).
Possibly, more than any other component in the Diploma Programme, CAS contributes to the IB’s mission
to create a better and more peaceful world through intercultural understanding and respect.
The extended essay, including the world studies extended essay, offers the opportunity for IB students to
investigate a topic of special interest, in the form of a 4,000-word piece of independent research. The area
of research undertaken is chosen from one of the students’ six Diploma Programme subjects, or in the
case of the interdisciplinary world studies essay, two subjects, and acquaints them with the independent
research and writing skills expected at university. This leads to a major piece of formally presented,
structured writing, in which ideas and findings are communicated in a reasoned and coherent manner,
appropriate to the subject or subjects chosen. It is intended to promote high-level research and writing
skills, intellectual discovery and creativity. An authentic learning experience, it provides students with an
opportunity to engage in personal research on a topic of choice, under the guidance of a supervisor.

Approaches to teaching and approaches to learning
Approaches to teaching and learning across the Diploma Programme refers to deliberate strategies,
skills and attitudes which permeate the teaching and learning environment. These approaches and
tools, intrinsically linked with the learner profile attributes, enhance student learning and assist student
preparation for the Diploma Programme assessment and beyond. The aims of approaches to teaching and
learning in the Diploma Programme are to:

9

• empower teachers as teachers of learners as well as teachers of content
• empower teachers to create clearer strategies for facilitating learning experiences in which students are
more meaningfully engaged in structured inquiry and greater critical and creative thinking
• promote both the aims of individual subjects (making them more than course aspirations) and linking
previously isolated knowledge (concurrency of learning)
• encourage students to develop an explicit variety of skills that will equip them to continue to be
actively engaged in learning after they leave school, and to help them not only obtain university
admission through better grades but also prepare for success during tertiary education and beyond
• enhance further the coherence and relevance of the students’ Diploma Programme experience
• allow schools to identify the distinctive nature of an IB Diploma Programme education, with its blend of
idealism and practicality.
The five approaches to learning (developing thinking skills, social skills, communication skills, selfmanagement skills and research skills) along with the six approaches to teaching (teaching that is inquirybased, conceptually focused, contextualized, collaborative, differentiated and informed by assessment)
encompass the key values and principles that underpin IB pedagogy.

The IB mission statement and the IB learner profile
The Diploma Programme aims to develop in students the knowledge, skills and attitudes they will
need to fulfill the aims of the IB, as expressed in the organization’s mission statement and the learner
profile. Teaching and learning in the Diploma Programme represent the reality in daily practice of the
organization’s educational philosophy.

Academic honesty
Academic honesty in the Diploma Programme is a set of values and behaviours informed by the attributes
of the learner profile. In teaching, learning and assessment, academic honesty serves to promote personal
integrity, engender respect for the integrity of others and their work, and ensure that all students have an
equal opportunity to demonstrate the knowledge and skills they acquire during their studies.
All coursework—including work submitted for assessment—is to be authentic, based on the student’s
individual and original ideas with the ideas and work of others fully acknowledged. Assessment tasks that
require teachers to provide guidance to students or that require students to work collaboratively must be
completed in full compliance with the detailed guidelines provided by the IB for the relevant subjects.
For further information on academic honesty in the IB and the Diploma Programme, please consult the
IB publications Academic honesty in the IB educational context, Diploma Programme: From principles into
practice and General regulations: Diploma Programme. Specific information regarding academic honesty
as it pertains to external and internal assessment components of this Diploma Programme subject can be
found in this guide.

10

Acknowledging the ideas or work of another person
Coordinators and teachers are reminded that candidates must acknowledge all sources used in work
submitted for assessment. The following is intended as a clarification of this requirement.
Diploma Programme candidates submit work for assessment in a variety of media that may include
audio-visual material, text, graphs, images and/or data published in print or electronic sources. If a
candidate uses the work or ideas of another person, the candidate must acknowledge the source using a
standard style of referencing in a consistent manner. A candidate’s failure to acknowledge a source will be
investigated by the IB as a potential breach of regulations that may result in a penalty imposed by the IB
final award committee.
The IB does not prescribe which style(s) of referencing or in-text citation should be used by candidates;
this is left to the discretion of appropriate faculty/staff in the candidate’s school. The wide range of
subjects, three response languages and the diversity of referencing styles make it impractical and
restrictive to insist on particular styles. In practice, certain styles may prove most commonly used, but
schools are free to choose a style that is appropriate for the subject concerned and the language in which
candidates’ work is written. Regardless of the reference style adopted by the school for a given subject,
it is expected that the minimum information given includes: name of author, date of publication, title of
source, and page numbers as applicable.
Candidates are expected to use a standard style and use it consistently so that credit is given to all sources
used, including sources that have been paraphrased or summarized. When writing text candidates
must clearly distinguish between their words and those of others by the use of quotation marks (or
other method, such as indentation) followed by an appropriate citation that denotes an entry in the
bibliography. If an electronic source is cited, the date of access must be indicated. Candidates are not
expected to show faultless expertise in referencing, but are expected to demonstrate that all sources have
been acknowledged. Candidates must be advised that audio-visual material, text, graphs, images and/or
data published in print or in electronic sources that is not their own must also attribute the source. Again,
an appropriate style of referencing/citation must be used.

Learning diversity and learning support requirements
Schools must ensure that equal access arrangements and reasonable adjustments are provided to
candidates with learning support requirements that are in line with the IB documents Candidates with
assessment access requirements and Learning diversity and inclusion in IB programmes.

Nature of the subject
Psychology
Psychology is the rigorous and systematic study of mental processes and behaviour. It is a complex
subject which draws on concepts, methods and understandings from a number of different disciplines.
There is no single approach that would describe or explain mental processes and behaviour on its own
as human beings are complex animals, with highly developed frontal lobes, cognitive abilities, involved
social structures and cultures. The study of behaviour and mental processes requires a multidisciplinary
approach and the use of a variety of research techniques whilst recognising that behaviour is not a static
phenomenon, it is adaptive, and as the world, societies and challenges facing societies change, so does
behaviour.

Figure 2
Approaches to understanding behaviour
At the core of the DP psychology course is an introduction to three different approaches to understanding
behaviour:
• biological approach to understanding behaviour
• cognitive approach to understanding behaviour
• sociocultural approach to understanding behaviour.
The knowledge, concepts, theories and research that have developed the understanding in these fields
will be studied and critically evaluated to answer some of the questions being asked by psychologists
today. Furthermore, the interaction of these approaches to studying psychology will form the basis of

12

a holistic and integrated approach to understanding mental processes and behaviour as a complex,
dynamic phenomenon, allowing students to appreciate the diversity as well as the commonality between
their own behaviour and that of others.
The contribution and the interaction of the three approaches can be best understood through the
options. There are four options in the course. They focus on areas of applied psychology:
• abnormal psychology
• developmental psychology
• health psychology
• psychology of human relationships.
The options provide an opportunity to take what is learned from the study of the approaches to
psychology and put it into the context of specific lines of inquiry, broaden students’ experience of the
discipline and develop the students’ critical inquiry skills.
Surrounding the approaches and the options are the overarching themes of research and ethics. A
consideration of both is paramount to the nature of the subject.
Psychologists employ a range of research methods, both qualitative and quantitative, in order to test their
observations and hypotheses. As a part of the core syllabus, DP psychology promotes an understanding
of the various approaches to research and how they have been used in order to critically reflect on the
evidence as well as assist in the design, implementation, analysis and evaluation of the students’ own
investigations.
Psychology studies human beings and as such it is paramount that the ethical implications in any line
of investigation, and at all points in the course, are fully explored and understood to ensure that ethical
guidelines are followed at all times.

Distinction between SL and HL
There are three main distinctions between this course at SL and at HL.
1. The following extensions to the core approaches are studied at HL only.
• The role of animal research in understanding human behaviour
• Cognitive processing in a technological (digital/modern) world
• The influence of globalization on individual behaviour
This differentiation is reflected in paper 1 section B of the external assessment.
2. SL students are required to study one option while HL students study two options. This
differentiation is reflected in paper 2 of the external assessment.
3. Both SL and HL students will be expected to show their understanding of approaches to research
in the internal assessment and for criterion D (critical thinking) in paper 1 section B and paper 2
responses. Additionally, HL students will be directly assessed on their understanding of approaches
to research in paper 3 of the external assessment. This will cover both qualitative and quantitative
research methods.

13

Psychology and the core
Psychology and TOK
TOK is invaluable for exploring some of the bigger questions relevant to the teaching, learning and
practice of psychology. Questions that can be explored include the following.
• Can models and theories be used to understand and predict human behaviour?
• Does a researcher’s choice of methodology affect the reliability or credibility of research?
• Is what we know about human behaviour limited by our ethical considerations?
• Are emotions universal?
• Are the methods of the natural sciences applicable in the social sciences?
• Are there human qualities or behaviours that will remain beyond the scope of science?
As with other areas of knowledge, there are a variety of ways of gaining knowledge in the social sciences,
including observation and experimentation, inductive and deductive reasoning, and the collection of
evidence.
Having followed a course of study in an individuals and societies subject, students should be able to
reflect critically on the various ways of knowing and on the methods used in the social sciences, and in so
doing become inquiring, knowledgeable and caring young people, as described in the IB learner profile.
More information on TOK can be found in the Theory of knowledge guide.

Psychology and CAS
CAS plays a crucial role in the DP in the development of personal and interpersonal skills. It also provides
an important counterbalance to the academic pressures of the DP, allowing and valuing exploration and
engagement beyond the academic.
Examples of CAS experiences with links to psychology include the following:
• acting as a mentor to children in lower years
• designing a welcome pack for students new to the school
• promoting a healthy lifestyle.
More information on CAS can be found in the Creativity, activity, service guide.

Psychology and the extended essay
Psychology is a popular subject choice for extended essays. The research skills developed by students
undertaking an extended essay in psychology not only benefit them in their study of DP psychology,
but also prepare them for study in psychology and other subjects beyond the DP. Examples of topics for
extended essays in psychology include:
• To what extent does emotional intelligence improve job performance in the workplace?
• To what extent is nudging useful in promoting healthy eating in adolescent boys?
• To what extent can acculturative stress be a risk factor for depression?

14

More information for teachers who are acting as supervisors for students completing extended essays in
psychology can be found on the Extended essay website.

Psychology and international-mindedness
International-mindedness is an umbrella term through which the IB defines the goal of international
education, and which is exemplified by the emphasis in all IB programmes on promoting global
engagement, multilingualism and intercultural understanding.
The DP psychology course develops an understanding of how our behaviour is shaped by the societies
and cultures we experience and how we in turn shape our environment. The course also aids in the
understanding of individual mental processes and behaviour with all its nuances and flaws and supports
the understanding that others can also be right.

15

Approaches to the teaching and learning of psychology
The layout of the psychology course as it appears in this guide is for information and does not represent
a scheme of work. A holistic approach to the content of the course is encouraged and much of the
content in one approach can be linked to the study of another. For example, cognitive processes and the
methods used to understand the brain are closely related. This is also true of the options which build on
the understandings from the approaches. In addition, the options have been framed to encourage the use
of examples relevant to local as well as global contexts.
The internal assessment requires the development of social, communication and self-management skills
through collaboration and teamwork, but a problem-based approach to the content would foster and
develop these skills further. Underpinning all the approaches to teaching and learning in this course is a
focus on the development of critical thinking. The three approaches to studying human mental processes
and behaviour, as well as the recognition that psychology is evidence based, provide ample opportunity
for the development of critical thinking skills.
For a more general overview of approaches to teaching and learning in the Diploma Programme, please
see the Approaches to teaching and learning website.
A useful framework for developing and practising a critical approach to research in psychology is the
summary below from Wade and Tavris. (Wade, C and Tavris, C. 1990. Psychology. 2nd edition. New York.
Harper and Row.)
Ask questions, challenge assertions.
• Why are some studies still so influential in spite of their methodological or theoretical flaws?
• What was the historical context of the research?
Define the problem.
• This helps the student to focus his or her argument and keep it on track.
Examine the evidence for and against.
• Evaluate the research that gives support, fails to give support, or contradicts a theory.
• Avoid emotional reasoning and be aware of one’s own biases.
• Reflexivity can be used to reduce a student’s own bias.
Do not oversimplify.
• Recognize reductionist arguments.
• Consider alternative explanations.
• Be aware of the findings of other studies or alternative theories.
Tolerate uncertainty.
• It is acceptable to say that research is inconclusive or contradictory.

16

Employ cultural evaluation.
• Make comparisons with studies done in other cultures.
• Is there a cultural bias in the theory/study?
Employ gender evaluation.
• Has gender been considered as a variable in the theory/study?
• Is there a gender bias in the theory/study?
Employ methodological evaluation.
• What strengths and limitations are inherent in the methodology/method/technique used?
• Are there aspects of the method used that compromise its validity (for example, representativeness of
the sample)?
• What would happen if the study were repeated today with different subjects?
• Consider the use of triangulation to evaluate findings.
Employ ethical evaluation.
• Would the study be acceptable to modern ethical committees?
• Is there any justification for the infringement of ethical standards?
Evaluate by comparison.
• How effective is the theory in explaining the behaviour compared with another theory?
• How do the findings of study X compare with those of study Y, and what could account for any
differences?

Engaging with sensitive topics
The study of psychology provides students with an opportunity to engage with exciting, stimulating
and personally relevant topics and issues, however, it should be noted that often such topics and issues
can also be sensitive and personally challenging. Teachers should be aware of this and provide guidance
to students on how to approach and engage with such topics and issues in a responsible and inclusive
manner. Providing a safe environment in which discussion may be facilitated is an important role of the
teacher.

Prior learning and links to the Middle Years Programme
No prior study of psychology is expected. No particular background in terms of specific subjects studied
for national or international qualifications is expected or required of students. The skills needed for the
psychology course are developed during the course itself.
Psychology can be offered as one of the subjects within the individuals and societies subject group of the
IB Middle Years Programme (MYP). MYP individuals and societies is a concept-driven curriculum aimed at
helping the learner construct meaning through improved critical thinking and the transfer of knowledge.

17

The MYP course uses a framework of key concepts. These are broad, organizing, powerful ideas that have
relevance within the subject but also transcend it, having relevance in other subject groups. Regardless
of whether it is psychology or another subject from the subject group, the fundamental concepts of
MYP individuals and societies provide a very useful foundation for students who go on to study the DP
psychology course.

Aims
Individuals and societies aims
The aims of all subjects in group 3, individuals and societies, are to:
1. encourage the systematic and critical study of: human experience and behaviour; physical, economic
and social environments; the history and development of social and cultural institutions
2. develop in the student the capacity to identify, to analyse critically and to evaluate theories, concepts
and arguments about the nature and activities of the individual and society
3. enable the student to collect, describe and analyse data used in studies of society, to test hypotheses
and interpret complex data and source material
4. promote the appreciation of the way in which learning is relevant to both the culture in which the
student lives and the culture of other societies
5. develop an awareness in the student that human attitudes and opinions are widely diverse and that a
study of society requires an appreciation of such diversity
6. enable the student to recognize that the content and methodologies of the subjects in group 3 are
contestable and that their study requires the toleration of uncertainty.

Psychology aims
The aims of the psychology course at SL and at HL are to:
1. develop an understanding of the biological, cognitive and sociocultural factors affecting mental
processes and behaviour
2. apply an understanding of the biological, cognitive and sociocultural factors affecting mental
processes and behaviour to at least one applied area of study
3. understand diverse methods of inquiry
4. understand the importance of ethical practice in psychological research in general and observe
ethical practice in their own inquiries
5. ensure that ethical practices are upheld in all psychological inquiry and discussion
6. develop an awareness of how psychological research can be applied to address real-world problems
and promote positive change.

18

Syllabus content
The syllabus as provided in this subject guide is not intended to be in teaching order. Instead it provides
detail of what must be covered by the end of the course. A school should develop a scheme of work that
best works for its students. For example, the scheme of work could be developed to match available
resources, to take into account student prior learning and experience, or in conjunction with other local
requirements. However the course is planned, adequate time must be provided for examination revision.
Time must also be given for students to reflect on their learning experience and their growth as learners.
Key terms found in the syllabus are included in the “Appendices” of this guide.

20

Syllabus content: Core
The approaches to understanding behaviour are laid out in topics (shown in bold). Each topic has a
content heading (shown in bold) and specific concepts/terms (shown in italics) to study (please see tables
1, 2, and 3 for examples). Italicized material under the content headings indicates the minimum content
expected to meet the syllabus requirements, and teachers are free to supplement additional material
explicitly connected to that content heading (table 2). Content shown under the content headings that
is not in italics is suggested content and will not be used in the formulation of assessment questions;
however, students may include this content in their responses. When students are instructed to study

The approaches to understanding behaviour are compulsory for SL and HL students (except for the HL
extension, which is for HL students only). The core is assessed in paper 1 of the external assessment, but it
also forms the foundation for teaching and learning in the options.
The approaches to researching behaviour are for both SL and HL students, with a focus on research
methods used to study behaviour. They are organized to reflect the considerations made when reading
or preparing a piece of research. Only HL students are formally assessed on the approaches to researching
behaviour in paper 3.

Biological approach to understanding behaviour
The biological approach to understanding behaviour is largely an investigation into correlations. Do areas
of the brain correlate with behaviour? When changes take place in the brain do changes take place in
behaviour or is the reverse the case? Could an individual’s behaviour be predicted from their genes? Is
human behaviour subject to natural selection?
The relationship between biology and behaviour is a complex one of mutual causality. The technology
available to investigate this relationship is becoming ever more sophisticated, while the ethics of this line
of inquiry are increasingly an area for public debate.
The biological approach to behaviour looks at:
• the relationship between the brain and behaviour (SL and HL)
• hormones and pheromones and their effects on behaviour (SL and HL)
• the relationship between genetics and behaviour (SL and HL)
• the role of animal research in understanding human behavior (HL only).
Relevant to all the topics are:
• the contribution of research methods used in the biological approach to understanding human
behaviour
• ethical considerations in the investigation of the biological approach to understanding human
behaviour.

Techniques used to study the brain in relation
to behaviour: Study one technique used to
understand the brain and behaviour.
The choice of techniques used to correlate
the brain with behaviour is based on a variety
of factors including opportunity, available
technology and cost. There are strengths and
limitations to the different techniques used
to study the effects of the brain on behaviour;
however, the contribution of different techniques
has helped to understand behaviour. Examples of
techniques include fMRI, MRI, EEG, CAT, and PET.
Localization of function: Study one example of
localization of function.

Localization of function is the theory that certain
parts of the brain correspond to certain functions
and reflects the idea that behaviour, emotion, and/
or thoughts originate in specific regions of the
brain.
Neuroplasticity: Study one example of
neuroplasticity.
The development of neural networks through
repetition and neural pruning is both genetic
and subject to environmental influences. Neural
networks can change developmentally, over time
or after injury.
Study all of the following.
• Neural network
• Neural pruning
Neurotransmitters and their effects on
behaviour: Study one neurotransmitter and its
effect on behaviour.
Neurotransmitters mediate the events at the
synapse and are affected by agonists that amplify
their effects and antagonists that reduce their
effects. Neurons working together can produce
a large variety of effects, resulting in a complex
repertoire of behaviours. As a result, any claim of
cause and effect should be treated with caution.
Study all of the following.
• Neuron
• Synapse (how these relate to excitatory and
inhibitory neurotransmitters)
• Agonist

Genes are made of DNA providing the blueprint
for the structure and function of the human body,
including behaviour.
Genetic similarity: Study genetic similarity
(twins, siblings, parents, adopted children) for
one behaviour.
Genetic similarity is referred to as relatedness.
The greater the genetic similarities between two
individuals or a group of individuals the higher the
degree of relatedness.
Study the following.
• Twin and kinship studies
Evolutionary explanation for behaviour: Study
one example of an evolutionary explanation for
behaviour.
Examples include survival of the fittest and natural
selection.
Genes are constantly being switched on and off by
signals from inside and outside the body. Internal
signals include the presence of hormones or other
chemicals, or indeed other genes. Hormones are
frequently produced as a result of environmental
events and work by altering gene expression.
There are countless environmental events that
also affect gene expression. The signal activates
special proteins that can promote or block the
expression of a gene.
Sometimes genes are permanently switched off
through methylation of the DNA molecule as part
of the developmental process. This effect on genes
is sometimes referred to as epigenetics as there
is no alteration in the actual structure of the DNA.
Mutations occur when there is an actual alteration
of the DNA.

HL extension: The role of animal research in
understanding human behaviour
Questions are formulated (at AO3 level) from the
topic and/or content headings.

For all three topics in the biological approach, and
with reference to research studies, HL students
should study the following.
• The value of animal models in research to
provide insight into human behaviour
• Ethical considerations in animal research

Cognitive approach to understanding behaviour
The cognitive approach to understanding behaviour looks at:
• cognitive processing (SL and HL)
• reliability of cognitive processes (SL and HL)
• emotion and cognition (SL and HL)
• cognitive processing in a technological (digital/modern) world (HL only).
Relevant to all the topics are:

25

• the contribution of research methods used in the cognitive approach to understanding human
behaviour
• ethical considerations in the investigation of the cognitive approach to understanding human
behaviour.
The cognitive approach to behaviour views human beings as processors of information much in the
same way as a computer processes information. The cognitive approach to behaviour focuses on areas of
research such as schema processing, memory processing, and thinking, and how cognition may influence
behaviour. Researchers are also interested in the extent to which cognitive processes are reliable, for
example, in relation to thinking and memory. How cognitive processes may be affected in the modern
digitalized world is an emerging field within the cognitive approach to behaviour.
Cognitive processes are often influenced in complex ways by emotions. The influence of emotions on
cognitive processes is studied not only by cognitive psychologists, but is developing as an area of interest
for cognitive neuroscientists as well as social psychologists.
Research methods in the cognitive approach to understanding of behaviour rely on experiments and
brain imaging technologies as well as qualitative approaches to understanding everyday memory and
thinking, making the cognitive approach an example of the holistic approach to understanding human
behaviour.

Models of memory: Study two memory models.
Memory models provide a framework for an
understanding of conceptualization of human
memory processes over time. Examples relevant
to the study of memory models include explicit/
implicit memory, sensory memory, shortterm memory, long-term memory, central
executive, phonological loop, episodic buffer, and
visuospatial sketchpad.

limited to: top-down/bottom-up processing;
pattern recognition—the matching of a current
input to information in memory; effort after
meaning—the attempt to match unfamiliar ideas
into a familiar framework; stereotyping—a fixed
mental representation of a group of individuals.

Human memory is not an exact copy of events, but
rather a reconstruction that may be altered over
time, through discussions with others or input
from the media. Research shows that memory
may be changed during storage, processing and
retrieval, due to schema processing. Relevant
examples related to studying the nature of
reconstructive memory could be but are not
limited to:
• confabulation—a memory based on a
fabricated, distorted or misinterpreted
memory often believed to be true in spite of
contradictory evidence
• schema processing—memory processing based
on prior knowledge in the form of schemas that
could result in distortion
• false memories—recalling an event that never
happened and believing it to be true.

Humans rely on intuitive thinking and take
cognitive shortcuts resulting in a number of wellresearched biases.
Relevant examples related to studying factors
involved in biased thinking and decisionmaking include but are not limited to rational
versus intuitive thinking, heuristics, algorithms,
anchoring, framing and representativeness, as well
as the cognitive biases:
• confirmation bias—the tendency to seek out
information to confirm what you already believe
• cognitive dissonance—a so-called motivational
bias that focuses on personal motivation for
selection and interpretation of information so
that your cognitions are consistent with your
decisions and/or behaviour
• optimism bias—the tendency to think that
nothing bad will ever happen to you
• selective attention—the tendency to focus on
a limited number of stimuli when several are
occurring at the same time
• illusory correlations—the tendency to
incorrectly identify correlations where there
are none, as for example in “implicit personality
theories”.
Examples of biases include, but are not limited to:
• heuristics
• anchoring
• representativeness
• availability
• cognitive biases
• confirmation bias

Questions are formulated (at AO3 level) from the
topic and/or content headings.

For all three topics in the cognitive approach, and
with reference to research studies, HL students
should study the following.
• The influence (positive and negative) of
technologies (digital/modern) on cognitive
processes.
• Methods used to study the interaction between
technologies and cognitive processes.

Sociocultural approach to understanding behaviour
The sociocultural approach to behaviour looks at:
• the individual and the group (SL and HL)
• cultural origins of behaviour and cognition (SL and HL)
• cultural influences on individual behaviour (SL and HL)
• the influence of globalization on individual behaviour (HL only).
Relevant to all the topics are:
• the contribution of research methods used in the sociocultural approach to understanding human
behaviour
• ethical considerations in the investigation of the sociocultural approach to understanding human
behaviour.
The sociocultural approach to behaviour investigates the role of social and cultural influences in shaping
thinking and human behaviour. An increasing body of culturally informed research has made crosscultural psychology as well as cultural psychology a contemporary topic of debate among psychologists
working in the field. Theories, concepts and research studies provide the background for a more nuanced
understanding of the variety and complexity of human behaviour. This is important in the modern
globalized world where issues related to migration and integration are on the rise.

29

Key figures in the field of modern social psychology have often favoured experimental methods to
understand how social context influences behaviours, identities, attitudes and cognitions, however,
by studying acculturation in terms of intergroup relations, we can start to understand that the same
processes may be seen in the interaction between cultural groups. Social and cultural psychologists
are now also using qualitative research methods in order to get a better understanding of intergroup
relations as well as the process of acculturation.

social cognitive theory include:
• self-efficacy
• reciprocal determinism
• socialization
• social/cultural learning.

For all three topics in the sociocultural approach,
and with reference to research studies, HL
students should study the following.
• The effect of the interaction of local and global
influences on behaviour.
• Research methods used to study the influence
of globalization on behaviour.

Approaches to researching behaviour
The study of psychology is evidence based and has evolved through a variety of different research
approaches, both qualitative and quantitative. As students are exposed to research it is important that
they understand the advantages and limitations of different approaches in order to critically evaluate the

31

contribution of research studies to the understanding of human behaviour. Asking questions, challenging
assumptions and critically assessing the methods used by researchers are integral skills in the study of
psychology. These skills are assessed by criterion D (critical thinking) for essay responses in paper 1 section
B and paper 2, and they apply to both SL and HL students.
An understanding of approaches to research is also important for the internal assessment task in order to
design, conduct, analyse, draw conclusions and evaluate an experiment. This applies to both SL and HL
students.
Only HL students will be directly assessed on their understanding of approaches to research in paper 3.

Research methods
Essentially there are two broad categories of research—experimental and non-experimental—that use
qualitative and quantitative approaches. There is no hierarchy to the approaches. The method chosen will
depend on the aims and objectives of an investigation. No method is perfect in itself and all methods have
their individual strengths and limitations. A researcher will choose the method or methods that are most
suitable for a specific research study.
Approaches to research in psychology may be reductionist or holistic. As behaviour is often the result
of complex social, cultural, cognitive as well as biological interactions, a combination of approaches to
researching behaviour is not only inevitable, but desirable.

• unstructured
• semi-structured
• focus-groups

The following are elements of researching behaviour and will be dependent on the research method
chosen.

Research designs
Matched pair
design

Randomly assign one of a pair to either the control or the experimental group.
Researchers may match individuals on specific characteristics, such as ethnicity or
age. Twin studies are an example of a matched pair design.

Independent
samples/
independent
measures design

Uses two separate groups of participants. For example, one group of participants
is assigned to the control group while the other group is assigned to the
experimental or treatment condition.

Repeated
measures design

Exposes participants to each condition making up the Independent Variable.

32

Hypothesis
A hypothesis is a statement that is testable and falsifiable based on the results of an experiment
or observation. The null hypothesis (Ho) is a statement that the treatment has no effect while
the alternative hypothesis (H1) is a statement that the treatment has an effect on the Dependent
Variable. One of the hypotheses is rejected and the other accepted depending on the outcome of the
investigation.

Variables
Dependent Variable—the measurement generated by the manipulation of the Independent Variable.
Independent Variable—the factor that the experimenter manipulates.

Sampling technique
This involves selecting participants for a study. Examples of sampling techniques include:
• random sampling
• convenience/opportunity sampling
• volunteer sampling
• purposive sampling
• snowball sampling.

Standardization/control
This refers to eliminating or controlling any factor that could affect the results of the study, apart from
the Independent Variable. When and how this is carried out will depend on the method chosen to
generate the information needed.

Ethical considerations
These are paramount in any investigation of any kind in psychology. Please see the "Ethical guidelines"
chapter of this guide and the teacher support material for more information on ethical considerations in
psychology.

Analysing data
The ways researchers analyse data through data presentation, inductive content analysis or statistics.

Evaluating research
Evaluation of research data for:
• reliability
• validity (internal/external)
• credibility
• bias.

Bias
Bias refers to factors that may affect the results of the study. These include:
• researcher bias

33

Bias
• participant bias
• sampling bias.

Drawing conclusions
There are several ways to draw conclusions about the research. These include:
• correlation and causation
• replication
• generalization for quantitative research
• transferability for qualitative research
• triangulation.

34

Syllabus content: Options
There are four options covering areas of applied psychology:
• abnormal psychology
• developmental psychology
• health psychology
• psychology of human relationships.
SL students study one option, while HL students study two.
Whereas the core provides a general overview, the options allow students to study a specialized area of
psychology to apply their learning. What is learned in the core forms the foundation for the learning in the
options. The options provide the opportunity to integrate learning in an applied context. In addition, the
options provide the opportunity to explore the different approaches taken in research and highlight the
ethical considerations and sensitivities pertinent to a specific line of inquiry.
The options are assessed in paper 2, which contains three essay questions per option. SL students choose
one essay from one option, while HL students choose two essays from two different options. Examination
questions for paper 2 use AO3-level command terms and are formulated using the topic heading and/
or content headings (shown in bold). Questions linked to research, ethical considerations, or the
approaches to understanding behaviour will be linked to the topic heading. Any material connected by
the word “and” may be connected on examination questions by “and/or".
The essay titles for paper 2 only use command terms that correspond to AO3. These are as laid out in the
following table.

Contrast

Give an account of the differences between two (or more) items or situations,
referring to both (all) of them throughout.

Discuss

Offer a considered and balanced review that includes a range of arguments,
factors or hypotheses. Opinions or conclusions should be presented clearly and
supported by appropriate evidence.

Evaluate

Make an appraisal by weighing up the strengths and limitations.

To what extent

Consider the merits or otherwise of an argument or concept. Opinions and
conclusions should be presented clearly and supported with appropriate evidence
and sound argument.

Each option is divided into three topics. For each option, there will be three essay titles to choose from,
one for each topic in the option.

Abnormal psychology
Abnormal psychology focuses on the diagnosis, explanation, and treatment of abnormal behaviour. The
three topics for this option are:
• factors influencing diagnosis
• etiology of abnormal psychology

35

• treatment of disorders.
Each of these topics should draw on what has been learned in the biological, cognitive and sociocultural
approaches to behaviour where appropriate. In addition, students should have the opportunity to explore
the different approaches taken in research and should be made aware of the ethical considerations and
the sensitivity required in a discussion of this subject. There is no clear definition of what constitutes
normal behaviour and, by the same token, what constitutes abnormal behaviour. Concepts of normal and
abnormal change over time and are influenced by such factors as clinical biases, social norms, gender,
culture and socio-economic status. An appreciation of this is fundamental to this option. It is an important
consideration in diagnosis and in decisions on the treatment of disorders as well as when considering the
factors that cause abnormal behaviour.
In discussing the topics students may look at several disorders or focus on a single disorder. Both are
acceptable approaches to the content and have the same potential to score well in assessment. The
disorders chosen to explain and develop the topics should come from the following categories:
• anxiety disorders
• depressive disorders
• obsessive compulsive disorder
• trauma and stress related disorders

Developmental psychology
Developmental psychology is the study of how and why people’s behaviour and thinking changes over
time. The three topics in this option are:
• influences on cognitive and social development
• developing an identity
• developing as a learner.
Knowledge about the influence of biological, social and cultural factors in the development of an
individual is helpful not only for families, but also in childcare and education to create opportunities for
children and young people all over the world, so each of these topics should draw on what has been
learned in the biological, cognitive and sociocultural approaches to behaviour where appropriate. In
addition, students should have the opportunity to explore the different approaches taken in research and
should be made aware of the ethical considerations and the sensitivity required in a discussion of this
subject.
Developmental psychology focuses on how development can be supported or undermined. It is
important to gain an understanding of the extent to which early experience may influence later
development and if there are critical periods in development. Ideas centred around resilience are of
relevance in this option and may help explain why some people are more affected by their experiences
than others.

Health psychology
Many health issues are the result of lifestyle, either imposed on individuals or chosen by individuals,
and often despite well-publicised risks. An understanding of health psychology is important in the
development of prevention strategies and fosters a more positive perception of healthy choices. The three
topics in this option are:
• determinants of health
• health problems
• promoting health.
Each of these topics should use the learning from the biological, cognitive and sociocultural approaches
to behaviour where appropriate. In addition, students should have the opportunity to explore the
different approaches taken in the research and should be made aware of the ethical considerations and
the sensitivity required in a discussion of this subject.
It is important for health psychologists to take into account differences in attitudes towards health-related
behaviour as well as variations in the incidence of health problems when trying to help individuals or
consider ways to promote health. In addition, factors such as lifestyle and social context may influence
health and illness, making one of the goals of health psychology to promote an understanding of
behaviour that leads to a healthier lifestyle.
In discussing the issues students may look at several health-related phenomena or focus on a single
health issue. Both are acceptable approaches to the content and have the same potential to score well in
assessment. The topics being studied in this option should come from one or more of the following.
• stress
• addiction
• obesity
• chronic pain
• sexual health

Psychology of human relationships
Humans are social animals dependent on others for their well-being. This social psychology option
focuses on human relationships between individuals in personal relationships or in groups. The three
topics in this option are:
• personal relationships
• group dynamics
• social responsibility.
Each of these topics should use the learning from the biological, cognitive and sociocultural approaches
to behaviour where appropriate. In addition, students should have the opportunity to explore the
different approaches taken in the research and should be made aware of the ethical considerations and
the sensitivity required in a discussion of this subject.
Studying human relationships has its challenges and it is tempting to oversimplify complex social and
psychological issues. One approach to the study of human relationships concentrates on the role of
hormones and genetics. However, this gives a limited understanding of how relationships develop.
Cognitive theorists have also contributed to the understanding of relationships by applying schema
theory, while social psychologists have focused on beliefs, social identity theory and the role of culture.
However, key goals of social psychologists are to understand the complexities of relationships, improve
interpersonal relationships, promote social responsibility and reduce violence. As such, in the research
on human relationships, credibility and trustworthiness of a study as well as ethical considerations are
important throughout.

Assessment in the Diploma Programme
General
Assessment is an integral part of teaching and learning. The most important aims of assessment in the
Diploma Programme are that it should support curricular goals and encourage appropriate student
learning. Both external and internal assessments are used in the Diploma Programme. IB examiners
mark work produced for external assessment, while work produced for internal assessment is marked by
teachers and externally moderated by the IB.
There are two types of assessment identified by the IB.
• Formative assessment informs both teaching and learning. It is concerned with providing accurate
and helpful feedback to students and teachers on the kind of learning taking place and the nature of
students’ strengths and weaknesses in order to help develop students’ understanding and capabilities.
Formative assessment can also help to improve teaching quality, as it can provide information to
monitor progress towards meeting the course aims and objectives.
• Summative assessment gives an overview of previous learning and is concerned with measuring
student achievement.
The Diploma Programme primarily focuses on summative assessment designed to record student
achievement at, or towards the end of, the course of study. However, many of the assessment instruments
can also be used formatively during the course of teaching and learning, and teachers are encouraged to
do this. A comprehensive assessment plan is viewed as being integral with teaching, learning and course
organization. For further information, see the IB Programme standards and practices document.
The approach to assessment used by the IB is criterion-related, not norm-referenced. This approach to
assessment judges students’ work by their performance in relation to identified levels of attainment, and
not in relation to the work of other students. For further information on assessment within the Diploma
Programme please refer to the publication Diploma Programme assessment: Principles and practice.
To support teachers in the planning, delivery and assessment of the Diploma Programme courses, a
variety of resources can be found on the programme resource centre or purchased from the IB store
(store.ibo.org). Additional publications such as specimen papers and markschemes, teacher support
materials, subject reports and grade descriptors can also be found on the programme resource centre.
Past examination papers as well as markschemes can be purchased from the IB store.

41

Methods of assessment
The IB uses several methods to assess work produced by students.

Assessment criteria
Assessment criteria are used when the assessment task is open-ended. Each criterion concentrates on
a particular skill that students are expected to demonstrate. An assessment objective describes what
students should be able to do, and assessment criteria describe how well they should be able to do it.
Using assessment criteria allows discrimination between different answers and encourages a variety of
responses. Each criterion comprises a set of hierarchically ordered level descriptors. Each level descriptor
is worth one or more marks. Each criterion is applied independently using a best-fit model. The maximum
marks for each criterion may differ according to the criterion’s importance. The marks awarded for each
criterion are added together to give the total mark for the piece of work.

Markbands
Markbands are a comprehensive statement of expected performance against which responses are judged.
They represent a single holistic criterion divided into level descriptors. Each level descriptor corresponds
to a range of marks to differentiate student performance. A best-fit approach is used to ascertain which
particular mark to use from the possible range for each level descriptor.

Analytic markschemes
Analytic markschemes are prepared for those examination questions that expect a particular kind of
response and/or a given final answer from students. They give detailed instructions to examiners on how
to break down the total mark for each question for different parts of the response.

Marking notes
For some assessment components marked using assessment criteria, marking notes are provided. Marking
notes give guidance on how to apply assessment criteria to the particular requirements of a question.

Inclusive assessment arrangements
Inclusive assessment arrangements are available for candidates with assessment access requirements.
These arrangements enable candidates with diverse needs to access the examinations and demonstrate
their knowledge and understanding of the constructs being assessed.
The IB document Candidates with assessment access requirements provides details on all the inclusive
assessment arrangements available to candidates with learning support requirements. The IB document
Learning diversity and inclusion in IB programmes outlines the position of the IB with regard to candidates
with diverse learning needs in the IB programmes. For candidates affected by adverse circumstances, the
IB documents General regulations: Diploma Programme and the annual Diploma Programme Assessment
procedures provide details on access consideration.

42

Responsibilities of the school
The school is required to ensure that equal access arrangements and reasonable adjustments are
provided to candidates with learning support requirements that are in line with the IB documents
Candidates with assessment access requirements and Learning diversity and inclusion in IB programmes.

Criterion C: Use of research to support answer (6 marks)
Psychology is evidence based so it is expected that students will use their knowledge of research
to support their argument. There is no prescription as to which or how many pieces of research are
appropriate for their response. As such it becomes important that the research selected is relevant and
useful in supporting the response. One piece of research that makes the points relevant to the answer is
better than several pieces that repeat the same point over and over.

Criterion D: Critical thinking (6 marks)
This criterion credits students who demonstrate an inquiring and reflective attitude to their
understanding of psychology. There are a number of areas where students may demonstrate critical
thinking on the knowledge and understanding used in their responses and the research used to support
that knowledge and understanding. The areas of critical thinking are:
• research design and methodologies
• triangulation
• assumptions and biases
• contradictory evidence or alternative theories or explanations
• areas of uncertainty.
These areas are not hierarchical and not all areas will be relevant in a response. In addition, students could
demonstrate a very limited critique of methodologies, for example, and a well-developed evaluation of
areas of uncertainty in the same response. As a result a holistic judgment of their achievement in this
criterion should be made when awarding marks.

Criterion D: Critical thinking (6 marks)
This criterion credits students who demonstrate an inquiring and reflective attitude to their
understanding of psychology. There are a number of areas where students may demonstrate critical
thinking on the knowledge and understanding used in their responses and the research used to support
that knowledge and understanding. The areas of critical thinking are:
• research design and methodologies
• triangulation
• assumptions and biases
• contradictory evidence or alternative theories or explanations
• areas of uncertainty.
These areas are not hierarchical and not all areas will be relevant in a response. In addition, students could
demonstrate a very limited critique of methodologies, for example, and a well-developed evaluation of
areas of uncertainty in the same response. As a result a holistic judgment of their achievement in this
criterion should be made when awarding marks.

Internal assessment
Purpose of internal assessment
Internal assessment is an integral part of the course and is compulsory for both SL and HL students.
It enables students to demonstrate the application of their skills and knowledge, and to pursue their
personal interests without the time limitations and other constraints that are associated with written
examinations. The internal assessment should, as far as possible, be woven into normal classroom
teaching and not be a separate activity conducted after the course has been taught.
The internal assessment requirements at SL and at HL are the same. Students will investigate a published
study, theory or model relevant to their learning in psychology by conducting an experimental
investigation and reporting the findings. The requirements will be explained in more detail in the internal
assessment details.

Group work
Students are required to work as part of a group to plan and conduct the investigation. The research
method, subjects and materials, as well as the operationalization of the Independent and Dependent
Variables, will be the result of the group working together. Once the data has been generated the
collaboration is complete. Each student will write up the report independently of other group members.
The data will be analysed and conclusions drawn independently. Students should not discuss the results
with other members of the group. Likewise, the evaluation should be carried out independently. While
there will be some similarities (as the students are drawing on the same data), it is important that they are
reminded of the requirements for academic honesty and the consequences of academic malpractice. The
report must adhere to the ethical guidelines in all aspects.
The group must consist of a minimum of two students and a maximum of four students. SL and HL
students may work together. Students may also choose to collaborate virtually with another student or
students in other IB World Schools. Alternatively, students may work with another student who is not
studying DP psychology. This may be a student studying a psychology course with another provider, or a
student studying a related course such as an experimental science or social science course. Students may
choose group members who share a common interest or they may join a group and then decide on an
area for study within that group.

Assessing group work
Collaboration represents an authentic way of working in the field of research, but as it is difficult to assess
a team member’s contribution completely objectively, the reporting of the method will be awarded fewer
marks than the other sections. A student’s evaluation of the method (including protocols, participants
and materials) is where a clear understanding of the exploration will be rewarded, as this is carried out
independently of the group. It is expected that a student will point out the strengths as well as the

59

limitations of the method as part of their evaluation—a good design will generate as much opportunity
for comment as a less effective design, but it is anticipated that a student will only gain the higher marks
for their evaluation if they are fully engaged in the thinking behind the design of the investigation.
The difference between collaboration and collusion must be made clear to all students.

Time allocation
Internal assessment is an integral part of the psychology course, contributing 25% to the final assessment
at SL and 20% at HL. This weighting should be reflected in the time that is allocated to teaching the
knowledge, skills and understanding required to undertake the work, as well as the total time allocated to
carry out the work.
It is recommended that a total of approximately 20 hours of teaching time should be allocated to the work
for both SL and HL students.
This should include time to:
• explain to students the requirements of the internal assessment task
• review the ethical guidelines for the course
• work on the internal assessment component and ask questions
• collaborate in groups
• consult with the groups (and individual students as necessary)
• review and monitor progress, checking authenticity.

Guidance and authenticity
The report submitted for internal assessment must be the student’s own work. However, the teacher
should play an important role during both the planning stage and the period when the student is working
on the internally assessed work. It is the responsibility of the teacher to ensure that students are familiar
with:
• the requirements of the type of work to be internally assessed
• the psychology course ethical guidelines and the IB guidelines on academic honesty
• the assessment criteria—students must understand that the work is being submitted for assessment
and must address the criteria effectively.
Teachers and students must discuss the internally assessed work. Students should be encouraged to
initiate discussions with the teacher to obtain advice and information, and students must not be penalized
for seeking guidance. As part of the learning process, teachers should read and give advice to students
on one draft of the work. The teacher should provide oral or written advice on how the work could be
improved, but not edit the draft. The next version handed to the teacher must be the final version for
submission.

60

Once a student has officially submitted the final version of the work it cannot be retracted. It is the
teacher’s responsibility to ensure that all students understand the basic meaning and significance
of concepts that relate to academic honesty, especially authenticity and intellectual property. The
requirement to confirm the authenticity of work applies to the work of all students, not just the sample
work that will be submitted to the IB for the purpose of moderation. For further details refer to the IB
publications Academic honesty in the IB educational context, Diploma Programme: From principles into
practice and General regulations: Diploma Programme.
Authenticity may be checked by discussion with the student on the content of the work, and scrutiny of
one or more of the following:
• the student’s initial proposal
• the first draft of the written work
• the references cited
• the style of writing compared with other work known to be that of the student
• the analysis of the work by a web-based plagiarism detection service such as www.turnitin.com.
The same piece of work cannot be submitted to meet the requirements of both the internal assessment
and the extended essay.

Requirements and recommendations
Approaches to research in the core covers some of the main methods students are likely to encounter
during their studies in psychology, however, for the purposes of the internal assessment, students are
required to work exclusively using the experimental method.

Choice of topic
The experiment is an opportunity for students to investigate an area of interest to them, to enrich their
studies and stimulate their curiosity. The following points will serve as a guide to the choice of topic.
• The topic can be from any area of psychology.
• The theory or model on which the investigation is based must appear in a peer-reviewed publication.
• The link between the study or model used and the students’ aims and objectives for their experiment
must be made clear.
• The relevance of the experiment, that is the reason for carrying out the experiment, must be made clear.

Approaches to experimentation
The experimental method looks for a relationship between two variables to support a hypothesis of cause
and effect. The two variables are:
• the Independent Variable which is the variable manipulated by the experimenters
• the Dependent Variable which is the variable measured.

61

All other factors which could affect the Dependent Variable should be controlled as far as possible. The
study used may guide the students towards appropriate controls, but it may be adapted to suit the
context in which the students are working.
Approaches to the Independent Variable (IV)

62

It is important that there is only one Independent Variable in the experiment.
The Independent Variable is the variable that is manipulated by the experimenters. Students should base
their choice of the number of conditions and the nature of the conditions on the study used to inform
their experiment.
Students may wish to conduct a simple experiment, in which case the Independent Variable would have
two conditions.
The study on which the experiment is based may have several conditions for the Independent Variable.
Students may choose to replicate all the conditions or choose to simplify the experiment and choose two
conditions for their own experiment.
Details of how the Independent Variable is operationalized may also differ from the study. As an example,
students may choose different words for a word list, or a different type of music to the study to suit their
own circumstances, provided the link between the study and their own experiment remains clear.
Variables that are based upon pre-existing characteristics of the participants are not suitable for the
internal assessment. Variables that are not acceptable Independent Variables include, but are not limited
to:
• gender (for example, comparing the results of female and male participants)
• age (for example, comparing the performance of 10-year-old participants and 18-year-old participants)
• native language (for example, comparing native French speakers and native Mandarin speakers)
• culture (for example, comparing the results of Afro-Caribbean participants and Swedish participants)
• education level (for example, comparing the performance of students in grade 5 and grade 11)
• socio-economic status (for example, poor participants and rich participants)
• handedness (for example, left-handed and right-handed participants).
While these variables might be of interest to students, they cannot be manipulated within the framework
of the internal assessment. If such a variable is defined as the Independent Variable, the experiment will
not meet the requirements and will not earn marks.
In addition, experiments involving the following elements are not acceptable and will not earn marks.
• placebos
• ingestion or inhalation (for example, food, drink, smoking, drugs)
• deprivation (for example, sleep, food).

Approaches to the Dependent Variable (DV)

63

The Dependent Variable is the variable measured. There are a number of approaches here too.
• Students may replicate the operationalization of the Dependent Variable used in the study on which
they base their experiment.
• Students may adapt the operationalization of the Dependent Variable to suit their own circumstances
or resources. They may, for example, alter the number of measurements taken, the type of
measurements taken or use a different Dependent Variable altogether, provided that the link between
the study and their own experiment remains clear and can be justified.
In addition, students may choose to alter the method of the study in a variety of different ways to better
suit the context in which they are working. Students may for example alter:
• the nature of the participants as the most feasible participants for a school experiment would be other
students
• the number of participants involved. The study may have had access to participant numbers that are
impossible to replicate in a school. Alternatively, the study may have used a matched pairs design
which cannot be replicated in school as there are too few participants to choose from, making matching
problematic.
The marking criteria are designed to allow for a degree of flexibility and full marks can be achieved if the
variations outlined above are applied. Exemplars of student work and further assistance in conducting the
experiment for internal assessment is available in the teacher support material.

Analysis
The data collected should be appropriately displayed. Raw data should be available in an appendix. The
data should be analysed in terms of:
• descriptive statistics to highlight the variability and spread of the data
• inferential statistics to draw conclusions about the significance of the data generated in terms of
supporting a hypothesis. Cause and effect should be treated with caution and conclusions should be
tentative.

The evaluation
The evaluation of the experiment should focus on:
• the limitations of the method—those factors which are likely to have had an influence on the outcome
of the experiment but could not have been avoided (human error or accidents and omissions that could
easily have been avoided with a little foresight and planning are not acceptable as limitations)
• suggestions for improving the method to generate more data or more effective data in order to arrive
at a firmer conclusion. These may be based on the limitations identified or proposed on the basis of a
fresh consideration of the experimental design.

64

Presentation
The following details should be stated in the title page of the report.
• Title of the investigation
• IB candidate code (alphanumeric, for example XYZ123)
• IB candidate code for all group members
• Date, month and year of submission
• Number of words
The report should be between 1,800 and 2,200 words in length and consist of the following components:
• Introduction
• Exploration
• Analysis
• Evaluation
• References (not included in word count)
• The references are not assessed but must be included to meet the requirements of honest
academic practice. Not attributing ideas of others included in your work amounts to academic
misconduct. If academic misconduct is discovered in any work you submit for IB assessment, you
will not be awarded a grade for the subject.
The appendices do not count towards the word count but should be kept to a minimum. Appendices
should include:
• raw data tables
• print-outs of calculations and/or results from statistics software or calculations made for analytical
purposes
• consent form pro forma (unfilled)
• copy of standardized instructions and debriefing notes
• supplementary materials.
Ethical guidelines should be adhered to throughout the planning, conducting and reporting of the
experimental work for internal assessment.

Using assessment criteria for internal assessment
For internal assessment, a number of assessment criteria have been identified. Each assessment criterion
has level descriptors describing specific achievement levels, together with an appropriate range of marks.
The level descriptors concentrate on positive achievement, although for the lower levels failure to achieve
may be included in the description.
Teachers must judge the internally assessed work at SL and at HL against the criteria using the level
descriptors.
• The same assessment criteria are provided for SL and HL.

65

• The aim is to find, for each criterion, the descriptor that conveys most accurately the level attained by
the student, using the best-fit model. A best-fit approach means that compensation should be made
when a piece of work matches different aspects of a criterion at different levels. The mark awarded
should be one that most fairly reflects the balance of achievement against the criterion. It is not
necessary for every single aspect of a level descriptor to be met for that mark to be awarded.
• When assessing a student’s work, teachers should read the level descriptors for each criterion until they
reach a descriptor that most appropriately describes the level of the work being assessed. If a piece of
work seems to fall between two descriptors, both descriptors should be read again and the one that
more appropriately describes the student’s work should be chosen.
• Where there are two or more marks available within a level, teachers should award the upper marks
if the student’s work demonstrates the qualities described to a great extent; the work may be close
to achieving marks in the level above. Teachers should award the lower marks if the student’s work
demonstrates the qualities described to a lesser extent; the work may be close to achieving marks in the
level below.
• Only whole numbers should be recorded; partial marks (fractions and decimals) are not acceptable.
• Teachers should not think in terms of a pass or fail boundary, but should concentrate on identifying the
appropriate descriptor for each assessment criterion.
• The highest level descriptors do not imply faultless performance but should be achievable by a student.
Teachers should not hesitate to use the extremes if they are appropriate descriptions of the work being
assessed.
• A student who attains a high achievement level in relation to one criterion will not necessarily
attain high achievement levels in relation to the other criteria. Similarly, a student who attains a low
achievement level for one criterion will not necessarily attain low achievement levels for the other
criteria. Teachers should not assume that the overall assessment of the students will produce any
particular distribution of marks.
• It is recommended that the assessment criteria be made available to students.

Using markbands for internal assessment
For internal assessment, markbands have been identified. Each markband has level descriptors describing
specific achievement levels for a piece of work in a holistic fashion, together with an appropriate range of
marks. The level descriptors concentrate on positive achievement, although for the lower levels failure to
achieve may be included in the description.
Teachers must judge the internally assessed work at SL and at HL using the markband level descriptors.
• The same markbands are provided for SL and HL.
• The aim is to find the descriptor that conveys most accurately the level attained by the student's work,
using the best-fit model. A best-fit approach means that compensation should be made when a piece
of work matches different aspects of a markband at different levels. The mark awarded should be one
that most fairly reflects the balance of achievement against the markband. It is not necessary for every
single aspect of a level descriptor to be met for that mark to be awarded.

66

• When assessing a student’s work, teachers should read the level descriptors until they reach a
descriptor that most appropriately describes the level of the work being assessed. If a piece of work
seems to fall between two descriptors, both descriptors should be read again and the one that more
appropriately describes the student’s work should be chosen.
• There are a number of marks available within a level; teachers should award the upper marks if the
student’s work demonstrates the qualities described to a great extent; the work may be close to
achieving marks in the level above. Teachers should award the lower marks if the student’s work
demonstrates the qualities described to a lesser extent; the work may be close to achieving marks in the
level below.
• Only whole numbers should be recorded; partial marks (fractions and decimals) are not acceptable.
• Teachers should not think in terms of a pass or fail boundary, but should concentrate on identifying the
appropriate level descriptor for each markband.
• The highest level descriptors do not imply faultless performance but should be achievable by a student.
Teachers should not hesitate to use the extremes if they are appropriate descriptions of the work being
assessed.
• It is recommended that the markbands be made available to students.

Ethical guidelines
The experiment for the internal assessment must adhere to the ethical guidelines outlined below.
• Any experimental study that creates anxiety, stress, pain or discomfort for participants is not permitted.
Experiments involving deception, conformity, obedience, or any other form of harm are not permitted.
The experiment must be appropriate to the sensitivities of the particular school, community and
country.
• Any experimental study that involves unjustified deception, involuntary participation or invasion of
privacy, including the inappropriate use of information and communication technology (ICT), email
and the internet, must be avoided. There may be rare occasions when such infringements cannot
be avoided, in which case the approval of other experienced psychologists should be sought before
proceeding.
• Partial deception may be allowed for some experiments where full knowledge of the experiment
would fundamentally affect the outcome—such experiments are permissible provided they do
no harm and participants are fully debriefed at the end. Participants retain their right to withdraw
their data at this point. The only exception is a conformity or obedience study; these are not
permitted under any circumstances. The teacher should be ready and willing to explain why
conformity and obedience experiments are not appropriate for students at this level of study.
• Consent must be explicitly gained from participants through the use of a consent form. Implied consent
is not acceptable.
• All participants must be informed of the aims and objectives of the experiment.
• All participants must be informed before commencing the experimental study that they have the right
to withdraw at any time. Pressure must not be placed on any individual participant to continue with the
investigation.
• Young children (under 12 years) must not be used as participants as they cannot give informed consent.
Experimental studies involving older children (from 12 years up to 16 years) need the written consent
of parent(s) or guardian(s). Students must ensure that parents are fully informed about the implications
for children who take part in such research. Where an experimental study is conducted with children in
a school, the written consent of the teachers concerned must also be obtained.
• Participants must be debriefed and given the right to withdraw their own personal data and responses.
Anonymity for each participant must be guaranteed even after the experiment has finished.
• Participants must be shown the results of the research and if reasonable deception was involved, the
participants must have the deception explained and justified to them.
• Teachers and students must exercise the greatest sensitivity to local and international cultures.
• Students must not conduct research with any participant who is not in a fit state of mind and cannot
respond freely and independently.
• If any participant shows stress or pain at any stage of an experimental study, the investigation must
finish immediately, and the participant must be allowed to withdraw.
• Non-human animals must not be used for the experimental study.

70

• All data collected must be kept in a confidential and responsible manner and not disclosed to any other
person.
• Data must not be used for purposes other than that agreed to by the participants.
• Students must regard it as their duty to monitor the ways in which their peers conduct research, and to
encourage public re-evaluation of any research practices that breach these guidelines.
• Experimental studies that are conducted online are subject to the same guidelines. Any data collected
online must be deleted once the research is complete. Such data must not be used for any purpose
other than the conduct of the experimental study.
• Teachers who feel the need for more guidance on whether an experiment is ethical should consult
other teachers—via the programme communities—who may offer additional expertise and critical
distance.
For the experiment to be considered ethical, it must do no harm to anyone (also see section “Approaches
to the Independent Variable” above). This includes participants, researchers, bystanders, teachers/
supervisors, moderators, and eventual readers. Teachers should be prepared to discuss and explain what
“harm” means. It can mean a number of things: hurt, injure, torment, tease, torture, traumatize, impair,
wound, mistreat, punish, maltreat, misuse, abuse, molest, damage, or adversely affect. Harm manifests in
many ways, not only in a physical sense. High standards of ethical practice are central to the IB philosophy
and should therefore be promoted and supported by the entire IB community.

Appendices

Glossary of command terms
Command terms for psychology
Students should be familiar with the following key terms and phrases used in examination questions,
which are to be understood as described below. Although these terms will be used frequently in
examination questions, other terms may be used to direct students to present an argument in a specific
way.
The command terms used in psychology are arranged into four groups labelled assessment objectives
(AO). The first three, AO1, AO2 and AO3, are hierarchical with more challenging verbs for assessment as
you progress from AO1 to AO3. AO4 is not hierarchical, but represents actions related to subject-specific
tasks.

Assessment objective 1 (AO1)
Knowledge and comprehension of specified content
These terms require students to demonstrate knowledge and understanding and learn and
comprehend the meaning of information.
Describe

Give a detailed account.

Identify

Provide an answer from a number of possibilities.

Outline

Give a brief account or summary.

Assessment objective 2 (AO2)
Application and analysis of knowledge and understanding
These terms require students to use and analyse knowledge and understanding, explain actual
situations, break down ideas into simpler parts and to see how the parts relate.
Explain

Give a detailed account including reasons or causes.

Suggest

Propose a solution, hypothesis or other possible answer.

Assessment objective 3 (AO3)
Synthesis and evaluation
These terms require students to make a judgment based on evidence and, when relevant, construct an
argument or rearrange component ideas into a new whole and make judgments based on evidence or a
set of criteria.
Contrast

Give an account of the differences between two (or more) items or situations,
referring to both (all) of them throughout.

Discuss

Offer a considered and balanced review that includes a range of arguments,
factors or hypotheses. Opinions or conclusions should be presented clearly and
supported by appropriate evidence.

Evaluate

Make an appraisal by weighing up the strengths and limitations.

72

To what extent

Consider the merits or otherwise of an argument or concept. Opinions and
conclusions should be presented clearly and supported with appropriate evidence
and sound argument.

Assessment objective 4 (AO4)
Selection and use of skills appropriate to psychology. The terms require students to take action.
Design

Produce a plan, simulation or model.

Investigate

Observe, study, or make a detailed and systematic examination, in order to
establish facts and reach new conclusions.

Predict

Give an expected result.

Factors that may affect the results of the study.
These include researcher bias, participant bias, and
sampling bias.

Case study

A detailed analysis over time of an area of
interest (a case) to produce context-dependent
knowledge. A case study could also be an in-depth
study of an individual. For the purpose of DP
psychology, case studies are considered a research
method and use other research methods, such as
interviews, to collect data.

Cognitive processes

Any mental function involved in the acquisition,
storage, interpretation, manipulation,
transformation, and use of knowledge. Examples
of these processes include attention; learning;
memory; perception; thinking and decisionmaking. (Retrieved October 2019 from https://
dictionary.apa.org/cognitive-process.)

Cognitive schemas

Mental representations.

Convenience sampling

The process of selecting people who are able to
participate in the study at a given time.

Correlational research

A type of study investigating relationships
between variables without any control over
the setting; a focus on two variables (Retrieved
October 2019 from https://dictionary.apa.org/
correlational-research.)

Credibility

The degree to which the research gives a true
picture of what is being investigated and the
results represent the perceptions and opinions
of the research participants. Credibility is a factor
in establishing trustworthiness in qualitative
research.

Data presentation

The collection of raw data, which is then processed
in a variety of ways and displayed in a table, graph,
or chart, so that possible trends in the results can
be seen.

Dependent Variable

The measurement generated by the manipulation
of the Independent Variable.

Descriptive statistics

The spread of the data and measures of central
tendency.

74

Digital technology

Electronic technology that generates, stores, and
processes data (for example, smart phones and
computers).

Ethical considerations

Considerations that are paramount in any
psychology investigation; they concern the ethics
of treating participants fairly and without harm.
Please see the "Ethical guidelines" chapter of
this guide and the teacher support material for
more information on ethical considerations in
psychology.

Experiments

A series of observations conducted under
controlled conditions to study a relationship with
the purpose of drawing causal inferences about
that relationship. An experiment involves the
manipulation of an Independent Variable, the
measurement of a Dependent Variable, and the
exposure of participants to one or more of the
conditions being studied. (Retrieved October 2019
from https://dictionary.apa.org/experiment.)

External validity

The extent to which the results of a study can be
generalized or transferred to another sample or
context.

Field experiment

The researcher may/may not manipulate
the Independent Variable, but conducts the
experiment in a real-life environment. As a result,
extraneous variables cannot be controlled.

Genes

Genes are made up of DNA that provides the
blueprint for the structure and function of the
human body. This could include behaviour. An
individual’s genome refers to all the genes that
individual possesses. The link between genes
and behaviour can be studied using one or more
examples.

Gene regulation and gene expression

Not all genes an individual possesses are
expressed at all times. Genes can be switched
on and off. This is gene regulation resulting in
differential gene expression. Therefore, having
a gene for a particular behaviour does not
necessarily mean that an individual will exhibit
that behaviour.

Generalization

Term used in quantitative approaches based
on probability sampling where the results are
applicable to the whole target population.

Hormones

Chemicals released by specific glands in the body
to regulate medium- and long-term changes in the
body. Some hormones, for example, adrenaline,
also act as neurotransmitters and can produce
instantaneous effects on mood and attention. One
or more examples can be used to study hormonal
effects on behaviour.

Hypothesis

A statement that is testable and falsifiable based
on the results of an experiment or observation.
The null hypothesis (Ho) is a statement that the
treatment has no effect while the alternative
hypothesis (H1) is a statement that the treatment
has an effect on the Dependent Variable. One of

75

the hypotheses is rejected and the other accepted
depending on the outcome of the investigation.
Independent samples/independent measures
design

Uses two separate groups of participants. For
example, one group of participants is assigned
to the control group while the other group
is assigned to the experimental or treatment
condition.

Independent Variable

The factor that the experimenter manipulates.

Inductive content analysis

Used in qualitative research to determine the
meaning or purpose of data as it appears in
the transcript or field notes. The analysis of the
transcript or field notes involves coding and
categorizing data and organizing them into a
hierarchy of themes.

Inferential statistics

Statistical information that attempts to highlight
relationships and trends in the data.

In-group/out-group

Groups with which an individual identifies (ingroup) or does not identify (out-group).

Internal validity

The rigor of the study and the extent to which
the researcher took alternative explanations into
account.

Interviews

Qualitative interviews include unstructured, semistructured and focus-group interviews. These are
used to gain an insight into people’s thoughts,
opinions and feelings from their own point of
view.

Localization of function

The concept that specific parts of the cerebral
cortex are relatively specialized for particular types
of cognitive and behavioural processes. (Retrieved
October 2019 from https://dictionary.apa.org/
localization-of-function.)

Matched pair designs

Randomly assign one of a pair to either the control
or the experimental group. Researchers may
match individuals on specific characteristics, such
as ethnicity or age. Twin studies are an example of
a matched pair design.

Methodological triangulation

Tests a theory or a psychological phenomenon
using different methods of inquiry. Data from a
variety of methods (survey, interview, case study,
experiments) is used to help validate the results of
a study.

Natural experiments

Researchers find naturally occurring variables and
study them.

Naturalistic observations

Observations of naturally occurring behaviour
in a natural setting. Several different recording
techniques can be used, but field notes are an
important part of the data. Observations may be
participant or non-participant observations. The
ethical implications of covert observations need to
be justified.

Neural networks

Develop in the brain by the making and breaking
of synaptic connections between neurons.

76

Neuroplasticity

The development of neural networks through
repetition and neural pruning that is both genetic
and subject to environmental influences. Neural
networks can change developmentally, over time
or after injury.

Neurotransmission

It is enough for students to know that nerve
impulses travel along neurons until they reach a
synapse. The details of how this is achieved are not
required.

Neurotransmitters

Mediate the events at the synapse. There are many
neurotransmitters in the human brain. Serotonin
and dopamine are two of the better known. Many
hormones can also act as neurotransmitters, for
example, adrenaline and oxytocin. One or more
examples can be used to illustrate the effect of
neurotransmitters.

Participant bias

When participants act according to how the
researcher may want them to act, for example, due
to the social desirability effect.

Purposive sampling

Participants are chosen because they possess
characteristics salient to the research study.

Qualitative research

Exploratory and used to gain an insight into
psychological phenomena of interest. Further
research into the topic may well include
quantitative studies with more data.

Quantitative research

Exposes participants to each condition making up
the Independent Variable.

Quasi-experiments

Participants are grouped based on a characteristic
of interest, such as gender, ethnicity, or scores on a
depression scale.

Random sampling

The process where every member in the target
population has an equal chance of being selected.

Raw data

The original measurements on a variable as
collected by the researcher prior to cleaning.
For example, each participant’s response on a
psychology task is considered raw data.

Reliability

The consistency of a study in terms of the extent
to which a test or measure produces the same
results in repeated trials.

Repeated measures design

Exposes participants to each condition making up
the Independent Variable.

Replication

The degree to which the study can be repeated
by the same or different researchers and achieve
comparable results.

Research design

Overall structure of a study that might include one
or more methods.

Research method

The technique used to sample, collect, and analyse
data; considered as one possible component of
the research design.

Sampling bias

Occurs when the sample is not representative
of the target population, whether the sample is

77

based on selection criteria (qualitative research) or
probability sampling (quantitative research).
Sampling technique

Selecting participants for a study. Random
sampling, convenience/opportunity sampling,
and self-selected/volunteer sampling are common
techniques.

Schema theory

A branch of cognitive science focused on how the
brain structures knowledge.

Self-selected/volunteer sampling

Individuals choose to participate in the study.

Snowball sampling

Participants who are already in a study help the
researcher to recruit more participants through
their social network.

Standardization/control

Eliminating or controlling any factor that could
affect the results of the study, apart from the
Independent Variable. When and how this is
carried out will depend on the method chosen to
generate the information needed.

Stereotypes

A generalized and rather fixed way of thinking
about a group of people.

Survey

There are two types of surveys, interviews and
questionnaires. For the purpose of DP psychology,
surveys within the qualitative approach will refer
to interviews, while surveys within the quantitative
approach will refer to questionnaires.

Technologies

Refers to digital/modern technology.

Transferability

A qualitative term for when findings from a study
can be transferred to settings and/or populations
outside the study only if the findings of a particular
study are corroborated by findings of similar
studies (for example, in multiple case studies).

Triangulation

An approach used to ensure enough evidence is
available to make a valid claim about the results of
a study.

Twin and kinship studies

Also referred to as twin and family studies.

Validity

The degree to which the results accurately reflect
what the research is measuring. There are two
forms, external validity and internal validity.
