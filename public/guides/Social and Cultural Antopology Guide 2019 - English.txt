The Diploma Programme
The Diploma Programme is a rigorous pre-university course of study designed for students in the 16 to 19
age range. It is a broad-based two-year course that aims to encourage students to be knowledgeable and
inquiring, but also caring and compassionate. There is a strong emphasis on encouraging students to develop
intercultural understanding, open-mindedness, and the attitudes necessary for them to respect and evaluate
a range of points of view.

The Diploma Programme model
The course is presented as six academic areas enclosing a central core (see figure 1). It encourages the
concurrent study of a broad range of academic areas. Students study two modern languages (or a modern
language and a classical language), a humanities or social science subject, an experimental science,
mathematics and one of the creative arts. It is this comprehensive range of subjects that makes the Diploma
Programme a demanding course of study designed to prepare students effectively for university entrance. In
each of the academic areas students have flexibility in making their choices, which means they can choose
subjects that particularly interest them and that they may wish to study further at university.

Figure 1
Diploma Programme model

Choosing the right combination
Students are required to choose one subject from each of the six academic areas, although they can,
instead of an arts subject, choose two subjects from another area. Normally, three subjects (and not
more than four) are taken at higher level (HL), and the others are taken at standard level (SL). The IB
recommends 240 teaching hours for HL subjects and 150 hours for SL. Subjects at HL are studied in greater
depth and breadth than at SL.

At both levels, many skills are developed, especially those of critical thinking and analysis. At the end of the
course, students’ abilities are measured by means of external assessment. Many subjects contain some
element of coursework assessed by teachers.

The core of the Diploma Programme model
All Diploma Programme students participate in the three course elements that make up the core of the model.
Theory of knowledge (TOK) is a course that is fundamentally about critical thinking and inquiry into the
process of knowing rather than about learning a specific body of knowledge. The TOK course examines the
nature of knowledge and how we know what we claim to know. It does this by encouraging students to
analyse knowledge claims and explore questions about the construction of knowledge. The task of TOK is
to emphasize connections between areas of shared knowledge and link them to personal knowledge in such
a way that an individual becomes more aware of his or her own perspectives and how they might differ from
others.
Creativity, activity, service (CAS) is at the heart of the Diploma Programme. CAS enables students to live out
the IB learner profile in real and practical ways, to grow as unique individuals and to recognize their role in
relation to others. Students develop skills, attitudes and dispositions through a variety of individual and group
experiences that provide students with opportunities to explore their interests and express their passions,
personalities and perspectives. CAS complements a challenging academic programme in a holistic way,
providing opportunities for self-determination, collaboration, accomplishment and enjoyment.
The three strands of CAS are:


creativity—exploring and extending ideas leading to an original or interpretive product or
performance



activity—physical exertion contributing to a healthy lifestyle



service—collaborative and reciprocal engagement with the community in response to an authentic
need

The extended essay, including the world studies extended essay, offers the opportunity for IB students to
investigate a topic of special interest, in the form of a 4,000-word piece of independent research. The
area of research undertaken is chosen from one of the students’ six Diploma Programme subjects, or
in the case of the interdisciplinary world studies essay, two subjects, and acquaints them with the
independent research and writing skills expected at university. This leads to a major piece of formally
presented, structured writing, in which ideas and findings are communicated in a reasoned and coherent
manner, appropriate to the subject or subjects chosen. It is intended to promote high-level research
and writing skills, intellectual discovery and creativity. An authentic learning experience, it provides
students with an opportunity to engage in personal research on a topic of choice, under the guidance
of a supervisor.

Approaches to teaching and approaches to
learning
Approaches to teaching and learning across the Diploma Programme refers to deliberate strategies, skills
and attitudes which permeate the teaching and learning environment. These approaches and tools,
intrinsically linked with the learner profile attributes, enhance student learning and assist student preparation
for the Diploma Programme assessment and beyond. The aims of approaches to teaching and learning in
the Diploma Programme are to:


empower teachers as teachers of learners as well as teachers of content



empower teachers to create clearer strategies for facilitating learning experiences in which students
are more meaningfully engaged in structured inquiry and greater critical and creative thinking

Social and cultural anthropology guide`



promote both the aims of individual subjects (making them more than course aspirations) and linking
previously isolated knowledge (concurrency of learning)



encourage students to develop an explicit variety of skills that will equip them to continue to be
actively engaged in learning after they leave school, and to help them not only obtain university
admission through better grades but also prepare for success during tertiary education and beyond



enhance further the coherence and relevance of the students’ Diploma Programme experience



allow schools to identify the distinctive nature of an IB Diploma Programme education, with its blend
of idealism and practicality.

The five approaches to learning (developing thinking skills, social skills, communication skills, selfmanagement skills and research skills) along with the six approaches to teaching (teaching that is inquirybased, conceptually focused, contextualized, collaborative, differentiated and informed by assessment)
encompass the key values and principles that underpin IB pedagogy.
For further guidance on approaches to teaching and approaches to learning in social and cultural
anthropology, please see the Social and cultural anthropology teacher support material that complements
this guide.

The IB mission statement and the IB learner
profile
The Diploma Programme aims to develop in students the knowledge, skills and attitudes they will need to
fulfill the aims of the IB, as expressed in the organization’s mission statement and the learner profile.
Teaching and learning in the Diploma Programme represent the reality in daily practice of the organization’s
educational philosophy.
The social and cultural anthropology syllabus is closely linked to this, striving to develop internationally
minded people who recognize their common humanity and shared guardianship of the planet, and who help
create a better and more peaceful world. DP social and cultural anthropology facilitates the development of
the attributes of the learner profile.
Learner profile

Connection to social and cultural anthropology

Inquirers

Through the reading of ethnographic material and undertaking their own
fieldwork, students demonstrate both the skills needed for inquiry and their
interest in learning about others.

Knowledgeable

Students acquire in-depth knowledge and understanding of other peoples’ worlds
through the study of a wide range of ethnographic material. They explore
anthropological concepts, ideas and issues that have local and global
significance.

Thinkers

Applying an anthropological lens, students consider the world around them,
analysing, interpreting and evaluating ethnographic material critically. They
develop their ability to think with and through anthropological concepts, ideas,
theories and material, and apply this to real-world situations. In undertaking
anthropological fieldwork, students also develop their ability to consider the
ethical questions related to the collection of data.

Communicators

Students express and share their ideas in a wide range of ways, including
presentations, critical reflections and essays.

Principled

In applying anthropological skills to research and the reading of ethnographic
material, students learn to act with integrity and honesty and a strong sense of
fairness, justice and respect for the dignity of the individual, groups and
communities. In undertaking their own fieldwork, students take responsibility for
their methodological choices, their interactions with members of their community
and the representation of their research participants.

Connection to social and cultural anthropology

Open-minded

Using cross-cultural ethnographic material, students gain an insight into
humankind in all its diversity. They explore different perspectives and
experiences of everyday practices, how societies work, and why people believe
what they believe. They learn to value and respect the traditions of others and
use an anthropological lens to better understand contemporary real-world issues.

Caring

Contributing to an understanding of contemporary real-world issues, students of
anthropology come to empathize with, show compassion towards and respect for
others. Through this engagement, students develop critical, reflexive knowledge
in relation to their own positions as global actors.

Balanced

Students’ understanding of the importance of intellectual development is
reinforced by the internal assessment component of the course, which balances
the acquisition of knowledge and critical-thinking skills with their application in a
real-world setting.

Risk-takers

Anthropology engages students in an intellectual endeavour that challenges
them to question their own values and attitudes. It seeks to engage them in an
exploration of how the strange can become familiar and the familiar can become
strange.

Reflective

Reflexivity—the ability to reflect on how one’s own knowledge, beliefs and
perspectives may influence the researching and writing process—is an important
concept and skill that anthropology students explore.
Throughout the course, and especially in the internal assessment task, students
are asked to critically reflect on their engagement with the discipline.

Academic honesty
The Diploma Programme prides itself on promoting high standards of academic honesty.
Academic honesty in the Diploma Programme is a set of values and behaviours informed by the attributes of
the learner profile. In teaching, learning and assessment, academic honesty serves to promote personal
integrity, engender respect for the integrity of others and their work, and ensure that all students have an
equal opportunity to demonstrate the knowledge and skills they acquire during their studies.
All coursework—including work submitted for assessment—is to be authentic, based on the student’s
individual and original ideas with the ideas and work of others fully acknowledged. Assessment tasks that
require teachers to provide guidance to students or that require students to work collaboratively must be
completed in full compliance with the detailed guidelines provided by the IB for the relevant subjects.
For further information on academic honesty in the IB and the Diploma Programme, please consult the IB

Acknowledging the ideas or work of another
person
Coordinators and teachers are reminded that candidates must acknowledge all sources used in work
submitted for assessment. The following is intended as a clarification of this requirement.
Diploma Programme candidates submit work for assessment in a variety of media that may include audiovisual material, text, graphs, images and/or data published in print or electronic sources. If a candidate uses
the work or ideas of another person, the candidate must acknowledge the source using a standard style of
referencing in a consistent manner. A candidate’s failure to acknowledge a source will be investigated by the
IB as a potential breach of regulations that may result in a penalty imposed by the IB final award committee.
The IB does not prescribe which style(s) of referencing or in-text citation should be used by candidates; this
is left to the discretion of appropriate faculty/staff in the candidate’s school. The wide range of subjects, three
response languages and the diversity of referencing styles make it impractical and restrictive to insist on
particular styles. In practice, certain styles may prove most commonly used, but schools are free to choose
a style that is appropriate for the subject concerned and the language in which candidates’ work is written.
Regardless of the reference style adopted by the school for a given subject, it is expected that the minimum
information given includes: name of author, date of publication, title of source, and page numbers as
applicable.
The following criteria must be applied.
•

Students are expected to use a standard style and use it consistently so that credit is given to all sources
used, including sources that have been paraphrased or summarized.

•

When writing, students must clearly distinguish (in the body of the text) between their words and those
of others by the use of quotation marks (or other method like indentation) followed by an appropriate
citation that denotes an entry in the bibliography.

•

Students are not expected to show faultless expertise in referencing, but are expected to demonstrate
that all sources have been acknowledged.

•

Students must be advised that any audio-visual material, text, graphs, images and/or data that is crucial
to their work and that is not their own must also attribute the source. Again, an appropriate style of
referencing/citation must be used.

•

Regardless of the reference style adopted by the school for a given subject, it is expected that the
minimum information given includes:
–

name of author

–

date of publication

–

title of source

–

page numbers as applicable

–

date of access (electronic sources)

–

URL.

Nature of the subject

Social and cultural anthropology
Imagine you could have lived a thousand different kinds of lives, but you end up having lived only one (Geertz
paraphrased in Eriksen, 2009: 11). Anthropology is about finding out about the thousand other lives you could
have lived if you had been born in a different time or place. It is about “making sense of other people’s worlds,
translating their experiences and explaining what they are up to, how their societies work and why they
believe in whatever it is that they believe in” (Eriksen, 2006: ix). More than this, in an increasingly
interconnected world, anthropology seeks to unravel the complexities of what makes us human by exploring
what makes people as social beings in different cultures different from each other.
Social and cultural anthropology is the comparative study of culture and human societies. Anthropologists
seek an understanding of humankind in all its diversity. This understanding is reached through the study of
societies and cultures and the exploration of the general principles of social and cultural life. Social and
cultural anthropology places special emphasis on comparative perspectives that make explicit our own
cultural assumptions and those of others. Anthropologists explore problems and issues associated with the
complexity of societies in local, regional and global contexts, and as such, it is a dynamic, exciting and highly
relevant subject.
The social and cultural anthropology course for both SL and HL students is designed to engage students
with the concepts, methods, language and theories of the discipline. At the heart of the course is the practice
of anthropologists, and the insights they produce as a result of this in the form of ethnographic material.
Students are given the opportunity through their own experiential internal assessment activity to engage in
authentic anthropological practice. This provides an opportunity for students to explore how the strange can
become familiar and the familiar strange.
Although social and cultural anthropology shares much of its theory with other social sciences, it is distinct in
a number of ways. These distinctions include a research tradition of participant observation and an in-depth,
empirical study of social groups. Areas of anthropological inquiry in this course are: belonging; classifying
the world; communication, expression and technology; conflict; development; health, illness and healing;
movement, time and space; production, exchange and consumption; and the body. These areas are explored
through the key anthropological concepts of belief and knowledge, change, culture, identity, materiality,
power, social relations, society, and symbolism.
Moreover, anthropology contributes to an understanding of contemporary real-world issues such as war and
conflict, the environment, poverty, injustice, inequality, and human and cultural rights, providing a uniquely
rich context in which to explore them. The study of anthropology offers critical insights into the continuities
and dynamics of social change, the development of societies and what it means to live with differences.
Social and cultural anthropology contributes a distinctive approach to intercultural awareness and
understanding, which embodies the essence of an IB education. As a course, it offers an opportunity for
students to become engaged with anthropological approaches and to develop critical, reflexive knowledge in
relation to their own positions as global actors. Additionally, it fosters the development of citizens who are
globally aware, internationally minded, and ethically sensitive. In other words, it is transformative:
transforming the way students see others, the way they view themselves, and ultimately how they act in the
world.

Distinction between SL and HL
The following represents how the SL and HL course will differ in terms of breadth and depth.
•

Different internal assessment activities

•

Part 1: Engaging with anthropology
There are HL extension topics for students. In terms of assessment, there is an extension question on
anthropological ethics.

Social and cultural anthropology guide`

•

Anthropological thinking: theories
SL students will be expected to demonstrate an understanding of anthropological theories as they relate
to the ethnographic material they study to AO2 level. At HL, more range and depth is expected, including
specific theories in greater detail than at SL; HL students will be assessed to AO3 level. Theories will
not be prescribed for either SL or HL but will depend on the ethnographic material studied. Theory is
assessed on paper 2 for SL students and on papers 1 and 2 for HL students.

•

Engaging with ethnography
SL students study three areas of inquiry, reading one complete monograph for each area, plus a range
of supplementary material. HL students study four areas of inquiry, reading one complete monograph
for each area, plus a range of supplementary material. In terms of assessment, HL students will
complete an additional essay question.

Social and cultural anthropology and the core
As with all Diploma Programme courses, social and cultural anthropology should both support and be
supported by the three elements of the Diploma Programme core.

Theory of knowledge
Students in this subject group explore the interactions between humans and their environment in time and
place. As a result, these subjects are often known collectively as the humanities or social sciences.
As with other subject areas, knowledge in individuals and societies subjects can be gained in a variety of
ways. For example, archival evidence, data collection, experimentation, observation, and inductive and
deductive reasoning can all be used to help explain patterns of behaviour that lead to knowledge claims.
Students in individuals and societies subjects are required to evaluate these knowledge claims by exploring
concepts such as validity, reliability, credibility, certainty and individual as well as cultural perspectives
through knowledge questions.
In TOK, there are two types of knowledge claims.
•

Claims that are made within particular areas of knowledge or by individual knowers about the world (it
is the job of TOK to examine the basis for these first-order claims)

•

Claims that are made about knowledge

Knowledge questions are questions about knowledge, and contain the following features.
•

Knowledge questions are questions about knowledge. Instead of focusing on specific content, they
focus on how knowledge is constructed and evaluated.

•

Knowledge questions are open in the sense that there are a number of plausible answers to them. The
questions are contestable.

•

Knowledge questions should be expressed in general terms, rather than using subject-specific terms.

The relationship between individuals and societies subjects and TOK is of crucial importance and
fundamental to the Diploma Programme. Having followed a course of study in individuals and societies,
students should be able to reflect critically on the various ways of knowing and methods used in human
sciences, and in doing so, become “inquiring, knowledgeable and caring young people” (IB mission
statement).
A knowledge question in social and cultural anthropology challenges a statement, assertion or assumption
about the subject that students believe to be true or take for granted. From a TOK perspective, students need
to question these claims and how they are justified. Knowledge questions are not about social and cultural
anthropology per se but about how knowledge in social and cultural anthropology—and more widely, in social
sciences—is constructed.

Social and cultural anthropology guide`

Some knowledge questions that could be considered during the course are identified below. These are
presented in relation to the concepts of belief and knowledge, change, culture, identity, materiality, power,
social relations, society and symbolism that underpin the course and so reflect more overarching questions.
Suggested links to TOK are also identified for each area of inquiry in part 2 of the course, engaging with
ethnography.

CAS: Creativity, activity and service
CAS experiences can be associated with each of the subject groups of the Diploma Programme.
CAS and social and cultural anthropology can complement each other in a number of ways. Learning about
the connections between human experience of social and cultural life, and how this may connect to global
issues that manifest themselves at a local level, may give students ideas for CAS experiences.
An important characteristic of the social and cultural anthropology course is that students examine
contemporary human experience in different societies and cultures in a contextual way. Due to the
interconnectedness of the 21st-century world, many global challenges manifest themselves in students’ local
or otherwise significant communities as powerfully as at national and international levels. The ethos of the
CAS programme is to engage students in experiential learning in a similarly contextual way.
As a result of the knowledge and understanding students develop about an issue as seen through an
anthropological lens, they might be able to investigate, plan, act, reflect on and demonstrate CAS
experiences in a more informed and meaningful way. Similarly, CAS experiences can ignite students’ passion
for addressing a particular issue in social and cultural anthropology.
The challenge and enjoyment of CAS experiences can often have a profound effect on social and cultural
anthropology students, who might choose to engage with CAS in a number of different ways. The CAS
experience can be a single event or may be an extended series of events. However, CAS experiences must
be distinct from, and may not be included or used in, the student’s Diploma Programme course requirements.
Additional suggestions on the links between Diploma Programme subjects and CAS can be found in the
Creativity, activity and service teacher support material.

The extended essay
An extended essay in social and cultural anthropology provides students with an opportunity to learn what
constitutes a distinctively anthropological approach to the organization of human life and society. Students
explore anthropological perspectives and ways of thinking, and develop critical, reflexive knowledge in an indepth manner through their chosen topic of inquiry.
Students are able to demonstrate their knowledge, research and critical-thinking skills in a substantial piece
of writing that utilizes anthropological concepts and theories, and ethnographic material. The outcome of the
research should be a coherent and structured essay, effectively answering a specific research question that
is anthropological in nature.
There are clear differences between the internal assessment tasks for social and cultural anthropology and
an extended essay in the subject. These are outlined in the table below:
Internal assessment

Extended essay

The aim of the internal assessment is for
students of anthropology to understand and
explore the practice of anthropology, in terms of
the specific research methodologies that
anthropologists engage with when doing
anthropology.

The aim of the extended essay is to allow students
to explore an area of interest and to produce an
academic piece of writing modelled on those
produced for journals. It is not an extension of the
internal assessment.

Social and cultural anthropology and indigenous knowledge systems
For social and cultural anthropology knowledge is socially and culturally produced and grounded in particular
historical contexts. Thus, from an anthropological perspective all knowledge is local; in other words,
indigenous. For students following the social and cultural anthropology course, the area of knowledge in
TOK, indigenous knowledge systems, should be approached critically. Applying an anthropological lens,
students must understand the power relations that exist in the hierarchical classification of knowledge. From
an anthropological perspective, the notion of indigenous knowledge systems is itself problematic and should
be contested. It assumes that certain understandings of knowledge are outside an unexamined “us”, and
therefore a process of othering or exoticizing occurs when considering various understandings of the world.
In this process of othering or exoticizing, indigenous knowledge is reified and analysed as being static, oneway and ahistorical. This does not acknowledge the mutual interaction, dynamism and historicism within all
knowledge systems—which are ultimately all indigenous.
Students of anthropology can explore these issues by considering some of the following questions.
•

Within TOK why are indigenous knowledge systems posited as an “other” way of knowing?

•

Why are indigenous knowledge systems considered so closely in connection with cosmology?

•

To what extent is the system of classification within TOK, such as ways of knowing and areas of
knowledge, based on what anthropologists consider to be an example of “the great divide”?

Great divide: The term refers to the theoretical proposition of a qualitative division in human history between
the modern and the traditional (or civilized and primitive, or “us”/”them”), a division usually associated with
different modes of thought (Barnard, A and Spencer, J. 1996. Encyclopedia of social and cultural
anthropology. London and New York. Taylor & Francis).

To what extent does the analytical category of indigenous knowledge systems reduce cultural diversity?

•

How are value judgments expressed in terms of indigenous knowledge systems?

•

How can a student of anthropology challenge this system of classification? Why would it be important
to do so from an anthropological perspective?

•

Is this system of classification a reflection of western hegemonic thought?

Social and cultural anthropology and internationalmindedness
International mindedness is a specific way of thinking central to teaching and learning in the IB Diploma
Programme and is very much at the heart of social and cultural anthropology. Students’ emotional intelligence
is enhanced as they build cultural understanding, consider cultural relativism, and gain skills in cross-cultural
communication.
Understanding of “self” and “other” is central to anthropology, a discipline that explores the diversity and
dynamism of culture, exploring different ways of thinking and a rich variety of social constructs. Everintensifying physical and virtual global interconnectedness creates a myriad of opportunities for interaction
of cultures and pertinently emphasizes the crucial need to nurture international-mindedness in students.
Never before has it been more vital that we understand the “Other”; the study of social and cultural
anthropology is a most suitable way to achieve this end.
Embracing cultural understanding gives meaning to the variety of ways that people interpret what it means
to be human, raising awareness of commonalities and differences, homogeneity and pluralism. Anthropology
encourages an understanding of cultures “in context”, eschewing stereotypes; a truly international perception
that fosters willing, effective communication.
The internationally minded anthropology student feels a responsibility to be actively engaged with his or her
wider, global world and operates from a platform of understanding of, and engagement with his or her own
society and culture.

Engaging with sensitive topics
Studying social and cultural anthropology allows the opportunity for students to engage with exciting,
stimulating and personally relevant topics and issues. However, it should be noted that often such topics and
issues can also be sensitive and personally or culturally challenging (for example, when exploring notions of
belonging and the formation of identity, especially in relation to sexuality and gender; or exploring topics that
examine violence and conflict; or topics on health and illness that may examine death and dying). Teachers
should be aware of this and provide guidance to students on how to approach and engage with such topics
in a responsible manner, providing due consideration to questions and issues that may arise. Teachers
should also read carefully the ethical guidelines for the internal assessment tasks for further information.

Prior learning
The social and cultural anthropology course requires no specific prior learning. No particular background in
terms of specific subjects studied for national or international qualifications is expected or required. The skills
needed for the social and cultural anthropology course are developed within the context of the course itself.

Links to the Middle Years Programme
The IB Middle Years Programme (MYP) individuals and societies subject group involves inquiry into
historical, contemporary, geographical, political, social, economic, religious, technological and cultural
contexts that influence and impact on the lives and environments of people and communities. The MYP
individuals and societies subject group therefore provides a very useful foundation for students who go on to
study the Diploma Programme social and cultural anthropology course.
The concept-based approach to teaching adopted in the MYP is also a prominent part of the Diploma
Programme social and cultural anthropology course, with many of the same concepts explored in more
sophisticated and in-depth ways than in the MYP. These include, for example:
•

agency

•

community

•

culture

•

identity

•

meaning

•

structure

•

subjectivity.

Inquiry-based learning is also central to the way in which students in the MYP study individuals and societies
and the approach taken in the Diploma Programme social and cultural anthropology course, where students
develop their critical-thinking skills in the exploration of a wide range of contextualized ethnographic material.
The course also provides opportunities for students to apply an anthropological lens to real-world
contemporary issues.
MYP students in individuals and societies are required to practise and develop their investigation skills, one
of the MYP’s four assessment objectives. This lays an important foundation for the internal assessment
component of Diploma Programme social and cultural anthropology, where students are expected to
undertake independent research that allows them to engage in the practice of anthropologists.
Thus, studying social and cultural anthropology naturally extends the skills developed in MYP individuals and
societies subjects. Equally, students’ organization, collaboration, research and presentation strategies that
began in MYP individuals and societies will become more sophisticated while undertaking the Diploma
Programme social and cultural anthropology course.

Social and cultural anthropology as part of the
Career-related Programme
In the IB Career-related Programme (CP), students study at least two Diploma Programme subjects, a core
consisting of four components and a career-related study, which is determined by the local context and
aligned with student needs. The CP has been designed to add value to the student’s career-related studies.
This provides the context for the choice of Diploma Programme courses. Courses can be chosen from any
group of the Diploma Programme. It is also possible to study more than one course from the same group (for
example, visual arts and film).
Social and cultural anthropology may be a beneficial choice for CP students considering careers in, for
example, the hospitality industry, the technology industry, or international business. Social and cultural
anthropology helps students to understand the interconnections of cultures and societies in the 21st century
world and to engage with similarity and difference in human experience. Students explore different social
and cultural structures and practices leading to a greater understanding of the world around them.

Social and cultural anthropology guide`

Social and cultural anthropology encourages the development of strong communication skills, critical
thinking, and ethical approaches that will assist students in preparing for the future global workplace. This inturn fosters the IB learner profile attributes that are transferable to the entire CP, providing relevance and
support for the student’s learning.
For the CP students, Diploma Programme courses can be studied at SL or HL. Schools can explore
opportunities to integrate CP student with Diploma Programme students.

Syllabus content—Part 1: Engaging with anthropology

Introduction
This unit of study introduces some of the key areas of anthropology and forms the basis on which the areas
of inquiry should be explored. It introduces students to the discipline of anthropology as well as its practice.
Engaging with anthropology provides a framework for how students will engage with the course; they are
introduced to some of the questions and issues that will be explored within the areas of inquiry.
The three areas of engaging with anthropology are as follows.
•

The language of anthropology: key concepts and inquiry-specific concepts

•

The practice of anthropology: doing anthropology—the ethnographic method and ethical
considerations

•

Anthropological thinking: anthropological theories

The language

Anthropological
thinking

The practice of
anthropology

All students of social and cultural anthropology should be familiar with the set of key concepts, the methods
used by anthropologists, and the issues associated with the construction of ethnographic accounts. While
engaging with anthropology should be introduced as a discrete unit of study, the questions and issues raised
should also be integrated into the study of the areas of inquiry. In other words, the questions and issues from
this unit of study should be returned to throughout the teaching of the course as students become more
familiar with anthropology and the work of anthropologists. The material in this unit here will help to inform
student understanding of the ethnographic material studied in later units.

The language of anthropology
Becoming familiar and confident with the language of anthropology is an important part of the course.
Students’ ability to read and engage with ethnographic materials and to communicate and express their own
ideas in relation to these will require them to understand and use anthropological terms and concepts
appropriately. Developing these skills necessitates examining the language of anthropology, its terms and
concepts, in the context of anthropology as a discipline.

Social and cultural anthropology guide`

23

Concepts provide a framework by which aspects of social and cultural life can be explored, and make it
possible to understand social and cultural life in a reasoned, analytical anthropological fashion. However, it
is important to remember that how concepts within anthropology have been understood and applied has
changed over time and place, and can be expected to change in the future. Context is thus extremely
important when applying a conceptual framework of understanding to any ethnographic material used.
The social and cultural anthropology course must be approached through an understanding of the following
nine key concepts.
•

Belief and knowledge

•

Change

•

Culture

•

Identity

•

Materiality

•

Power

•

Social relations

•

Society

•

Symbolism

The definitions and relationship of each of the key concepts to the discipline of social and cultural
anthropology are the subject of debate and should be treated as contestable. However, in the context of this
course the following guidance is given as to how they might initially be understood.
Key concept

Definition

Belief and knowledge

Belief and knowledge is a set of convictions,
values and viewpoints regarded as “the truth” and
shared by members of a social group. These are
underpinned and supported by known cultural
experience.

Change

Change refers to the alteration or modification of
cultural or social elements in a society. Change
may be due to internal dynamics within a society,
or the result of contact with another culture, or a
consequence of globalization.

Culture

Culture refers to organized systems of symbols,
ideas, explanations, beliefs and material
production that humans create and manipulate in
the course of their daily lives. Culture includes the
customs by which humans organize their physical
world and maintain their social structure. More
recent approaches to culture recognize that
cultures are not static, homogenous or bounded
but dynamic and fluid. Culture refers to the shared
social construction of meanings, but
simultaneously culture is often also a site of
contested meanings. These recent formulations of
the concept recognize that culture may be the
subject of disagreement and conflict within and
among societies and this disagreement may
include the definition of culture itself.

Social and cultural anthropology guide`

24

Key concept

Definition

Identity

Identity can refer either to the individual’s private
and personal view of the self or to how an
individual is viewed from the perspective of a
social group. In addition, identity may also refer to
group identity, which may take the form of religious
identity, ethnic identity or national identity, for
example.

Materiality

Objects, resources and belongings have cultural
meaning, described by Arjun Appadurai as “the
social life of things” (Appadurai 1986). They are
embedded in all kinds of social relations and
practices. Some anthropologists seek to
understand human experience through the study
of material objects. This occurs, for example, in
contemporary approaches that focus on the
materiality of the body.

Power

Power is an essential feature of social relations
and can be considered as a person's or group's
capacity to influence, manipulate or control others
and resources. In its broadest sense, power can
be understood as involving distinctions and
inequalities between members of a social group.
Some approaches to power focus on structural
power and understand power to be everywhere
and to contribute in the production of reality.

Social relations

Social relations refer to any relationship between
two or more individuals in a network of
relationships. Social relations involve an element
of individual agency as well as group expectations,
and form the basis of social organization and
social structure. They pervade every aspect of
human life and are extensive, complex, and
diverse.

Society

Society refers to the way in which humans
organize themselves in groups and networks.
Society is created and sustained by social
relationships and institutions. The term “society”
can also be used to refer to a human group that
exhibits some internal coherence and distinguishes
itself from other such groups.

Symbolism

Symbolism is the study of the significance that
people attach to objects, actions, and processes,
creating networks of symbols through which they
construct a culture’s web of meaning.

These introductory definitions should be used as a starting place for exploring the key concepts through the
ethnographic material studied. It is expected and encouraged that students will engage with the key concepts
and demonstrate an understanding of how they are used to describe and analyse individuals and groups in
their cultural and social contexts.
Students should understand that these concepts are dynamic and change over time, and that they are
influenced by theoretical and historical contexts. While the nine key concepts provide a framework for the
teaching of the areas of inquiry, each area of inquiry will also provide opportunities for students to become
familiar with concepts related to those specific areas of study. These are not exhaustive and by no means
discrete to those areas in which they are identified as throughout the course students will become aware of
how the same key or inquiry-specific concept may be used and understood in different areas of anthropology.
These concepts—both key and inquiry-specific—will be used to form the basis of the assessment of students’
understanding of the course.

Social and cultural anthropology guide`

25

The nine key concepts weave a conceptual thread throughout the course, both within and between the areas
of inquiry. They will equip students with a conceptual framework with which to access and understand areas
of anthropological study and ethnographic material. They can, and should, be considered at a number of
different levels—global, regional, national, local, community and individual.
Example 1
Identity: The individual’s perception of himself or herself can be modified by the view held by the local
community depending on class, ethnicity, gender, and nationality. These in turn can be modified by both
regional and global influences. For example, gender may be understood and experienced differently at a
national, international or individual cultural level.
Example 2
Symbolism: People ascribe different meanings to the same thing depending on their cultural context. For
example, tattoos are a widespread phenomenon, but have different symbolic significance for individuals
according to their gender, sexual orientation, social group, ethnicity and nationality.
Please note that although the course is designed to study anthropology with the help of the nine key concepts
outlined here, there are many other related terms and concepts to encounter within the discipline that will
help students to understand the key concepts. These are indicated in part 1 of the syllabus, engaging with
anthropology, where there are a wide range of anthropological related terms and concepts that students must
become familiar with and confident in using. Those identified in engaging with anthropology are not an
exhaustive list, but rather provide a basis for the development and understanding of anthropological language
that will emerge from the ethnographic material studied in later units. Additionally, in each area of inquiry
studied students are introduced to inquiry-specific concepts.

The practice of anthropology
Research methods and data collection
The ethnographic method is one of the distinguishing features of social and cultural anthropology. The
methods selected by an anthropologist for collecting data in the field relate to the theoretical perspective of
the anthropologist and the production of the final ethnographic text.
There are a number of methods and issues of data collection that anthropologists commonly need to consider
in their preparation for fieldwork and during the data-gathering phase of their work. These include the
following.


Participant observation (which may include a range of data-gathering methods and techniques)



Collection of data techniques(for example, visual methods)



Use of qualitative and quantitative data



Analysis and interpretation



Ethical issues

Fieldwork
Anthropological accounts are based on detailed and wide-ranging data collected over a substantial period of
time. The time that an ethnographer spends studying a group is a process called “fieldwork”. Fieldwork with
a particular group often takes place more than once and involves a long-term personal engagement between
the ethnographer and the group. However, in many contemporary fieldwork settings ethnographers may not
have direct face-to-face contact over a prolonged period with a single and delimited group of people. For
example, work in densely populated urban settings, in multi-sited settings, or in a virtual environment requires
a rethinking and reconceptualizing of the relations between ethnographer and the group being studied.

Social and cultural anthropology guide`

26

Participant observation
In the course of fieldwork, many ethnographers become involved as fully as possible in the activities that they
study, rather than act as detached bystanders. At the same time, they must seek to preserve some analytical
distance. The extent of their participation and its effect on the activity depends on a variety of factors including
the nature of the activity, the rapport between observers and the particular members of the group being
studied or “actors”, and the goals of the research. Participant observation has traditionally been the main
method in anthropological fieldwork.
Ethnographers and the actors develop social ties in the course of fieldwork. All parties involved must
constantly negotiate the nature of these ties. Social relations in fieldwork are as complex as other social
relations that human beings form in the course of their lives.

Collection of data techniques
Ethnographers use a broad variety of techniques in collecting data, including interviewing, observation, notetaking, audio and visual recording, discussing recordings with members of the group being studied, keeping
journals, collecting censuses, life histories, questionnaires, using archival materials, material culture and
producing genealogies. Data may also be collected in a variety of forms that illustrate different aspects of a
given society and culture at a given time and place. These may include expressive forms and internal
accounts such as music, lyrics, literature, letters, stories and films. The nature of the data and the techniques
used to collect it depend on the goals of the research. Each technique provides a partial view and therefore
cannot stand alone, nor can it be used uncritically. It is essential that any such material should be examined
from an anthropological perspective. The body of data collected during fieldwork is often substantial, and is
used selectively in analysis and in writing up the results of the fieldwork. Fieldwork data is often supplemented
with the materials gathered in libraries and museums.

Use of qualitative and quantitative data
Qualitative data consists of texts, lists and recordings, which do not lend themselves to numerical
representation, while quantitative data can be expressed in numbers. For most anthropologists, qualitative
data is more crucial than quantitative data, although the quantitative often provides useful support for the
qualitative.

Analysis and interpretation
The analysis of anthropological data consists of discovering consistencies and other recurrent patterns in the
data. This discovery process often relies heavily on the anthropologist’s theoretical framework and on the
relevant works of other anthropologists. Anthropologists recognize that description and analysis are never
free of theoretical and personal biases, but always involve selection and interpretation.

Ethical issues
Ethnographers are bound by ethical principles governing their conduct as fieldworkers and as professional
practitioners. Among other things, these principles dictate that the ethnographer respects the dignity of the
members of the group being studied, gives attention to the possibility that any disseminated information may
be used against the best interests of those being studied, and recognizes any power differentials between
the parties involved in fieldwork.
Ethics is also concerned with the relationship between ethnographers and their colleagues, students and
audiences. What constitutes ethical conduct is often the subject of debate and is best understood in context.

Anthropology in practice for Diploma Programme students
Engaging with anthropological practice is best demonstrated and appreciated through the internal
assessment components, which are designed to encourage students actively to engage with the practice of
anthropology—fieldwork.
The nature of these components at SL and HL is to engage in what is at the heart of what anthropologists
do. The internal assessment tasks allow students to understand how anthropologists do anthropology by
envisioning how they themselves would ethnographically investigate an aspect of their own culture, or, in
many cases, that of another.

Social and cultural anthropology guide`

27

Whether at SL or HL, all students of the Diploma Programme social and cultural anthropology course must
appreciate and understand the key elements of undertaking fieldwork, particularly in relation to
methodological issues, ethical considerations and the presentation and representation of data.
Students may choose to use a variety of technologies to assist their data collection, but they must consider
the implications of this, particularly with regard to ethical considerations. Students are not permitted to submit
any digital materials with their internal assessment, except for photographs that are embedded in the body
of their reports. The relevance of these photographs must be explained.
Additionally, in the teaching of both part 1 of the syllabus (engaging with anthropology), and part 2 (engaging
with ethnography), students must explore questions and issues related to the practice of anthropology. In
teaching engaging with anthropology as an introductory unit, teachers should explore the basic tenets of
anthropological practice, and then revisit these through the ethnographic materials studied in engaging with
ethnography.
The following graphic illustrates the basic tenets of anthropological practice. These should be considered
both in relation to the reading of ethnography and students’ own engagement in the practice of fieldwork.

Anthropological thinking theories
Anthropology can be viewed as a discipline that offers two primary kinds of insights:


an insight into the cultural variation that exists in the world



an insight into the methods and theories that enable exploration, comparison and understanding of
these cultural variations.

In other words, it is a subject that offers both things to think about (areas of inquiry) and things to think
with (theories and concepts).
In developing anthropological thinking, students are expected to reflect on how a particular set of ideas might
be used to think about the world around them in specific ways. Ethnography may be considered as the
practice of writing about other groups of people as a way of making sense of their “worlds” by presenting
their world as they view it. Theory then is how anthropologists shape and order the ethnographic data they
collect (the view of the world from the perspective of the subjects studied) to frame the way in which the
readers of ethnographies are helped to see other people’s worlds as valid and viable ways of living. These
understandings are inevitably formed at the nexus of ethnography and theory.
For the purposes of this course both SL and HL students need to become familiar with the anthropological
theories that relate to the ethnographic material they are studying. Reading ethnographic material naturally
exposes students to different anthropological theories as no ethnography exists in a theoretical vacuum. The
difference between what is expected in terms of theory is the level of depth of knowledge and understanding
that SL and HL students must demonstrate, and the level to which they will be assessed.
The teaching and learning of theories should be based on the ethnographic material studied and their
manifestation in particular historical contexts. Students, through the ethnographic materials studied, should
develop an understanding of both classic and contemporary anthropological theories.
In anthropology, a theory is an abstract framework that systematically organizes facts in order to make sense
of the world. Theories need to be linked to, and grounded in, the study of ethnographic accounts.
This will help students to:
•

recognize how theory frames analysis

•

appreciate ways in which theory influences the selection, presentation and interpretation of
ethnographic materials

•

appreciate how ethnography influences theory and its development

•

identify and compare alternative theoretical interpretations of the same ethnographic materials

•

recognize that anthropologists may incorporate multiple perspectives on ethnographic material in their
analyses and explanations.

SL students need to be familiar with the theories that relate to the ethnographies they read, and be able to
identify and explain them in this context.
HL students need to be familiar with, and confident in, the use of theories in anthropology in their reading
and evaluation of ethnographic material, as well as their comparison of ethnographic studies. This may be in
terms of how different theories are applied to the same culture, yielding different interpretations of that culture,
or in terms of how the same theory is applied to different cultures allowing for points of comparison.

Guidance for teaching
While there is no stipulated requirement for the number of anthropological theories studied, students are
expected to be able to demonstrate knowledge and understanding of the theories that pertain to the
ethnographic material they have studied. It is important to note that students are not expected to cultivate an
Social and cultural anthropology guide`

30

in-depth knowledge of all the theories presented, but should have (at least) secure knowledge of some of
them and an awareness of others. In choosing ethnographic material, teachers should be mindful of providing
access to sources that allow for the exploration of a number of anthropological theories. The aim is to help
students develop anthropological insight and give them the appropriate tools for critical analysis. It is possible
to study anthropological theories in a number of ways, although all should be related to the historical context
in which the theories were formulated.
Example 1
A study of the way in which a particular concept has been addressed in different historical periods and by
different writers
For example, female gender roles have been analysed differently across time according to the theoretical
approach of the anthropologist. A structuralist viewpoint may focus on the actions of men while women are
apparently “passive” and “lacking voice”, while a feminist anthropologist will concentrate on social life
incorporating the actions and ideas of women as agents.
Example 2
The study of a specific school of theory and the particular anthropologists within it
For example, in cultural materialism the works of Marvin Harris, Maxine Margolis, Jerald Milanich and Conrad
Kottak may be explored in relation to the application of a cultural materialist approach to different societies.
Example 3
A comparison of different theories applied to ethnographic studies of the same culture
For example, social life in the Highlands of New Guinea may be viewed from a transactional perspective
using the work of Andrew Strathern, a feminist perspective using the work of Marilyn Strathern, and a practice
theory perspective referring to the work of Holly Wardlow.
It is recommended that theories be introduced early on in the course, ideally as soon as students begin
engaging with ethnographic material.
The following are some of the theories that students may become acquainted with depending on their
interests and the ethnographic material studied. This list is not exhaustive but rather illustrative of the different
theories that can be utilized and applied to ethnographic material. Part 1 of the course, engaging with
anthropology, gives further guidance on how to approach the teaching of theory. Additionally, the Social and
cultural anthropology teacher support material includes specific information on some of the theories listed
here.
Potential theories:
•

Cultural materialism

•

Anthropological questions to think with and through
Big anthropological questions
The following “big” anthropological questions underpin an understanding of the course. The students’
exploration of particular cultures and societies should allow them to consider these universal questions. An
understanding of these big anthropological questions should inform and be informed by the ethnographic
material studied, and students should have the opportunity to reflect on these throughout the course. Their
understanding of these big anthropological questions will be assessed in paper 1, at both SL and HL.

•

What is culture?

•

What does it mean to be a person?

•

What does it mean to live in society?

•

How are we the same and different from each other?

•

Why does anthropology matter?

•

To what extent is knowing others possible?

Ethnography is not anthropology
Although no anthropologist should underestimate the value of ethnographic study, ethnography is not
anthropology. There should not be a conflation of anthropology and ethnography, as if they are one and the
same. Students will spend a lot of time getting into ethnography, but they also need to consider how the data
and insights provided by these ethnographies allow them to reflect on what is of central concern to the
discipline of anthropology—that is, what makes us human?
Ethnography is not an end in itself, but should rather be seen as a means to understanding what it means to
be human. Tim Ingold argues that students need to “proceed beyond the awareness of cultural diversity to a
more fundamental grasp of our common humanity” (Ingold 1985). He further argues that in order to make
this jump, from the particular (what makes humans of different kinds) to the universal (what makes us
human) we need anthropological thinking, which is to say, anthropological theories. In the design and
organization of the course, due consideration is given to this.
The course (re)defines the boundary between anthropology and ethnography in two parts:
1.

engaging with anthropology

2.

engaging with ethnography.

The central issues of the language of anthropology, the practice of anthropology, and anthropological thinking
addressed in part 1, engaging with anthropology, are designed to provide a common thread throughout part
2 of the syllabus, engaging with ethnography (in the study of the areas of inquiry). The aim of this approach
is to allow students to move “from questions of what makes humans of different kinds to the question of what
makes us human” (Ingold 1985).
Additionally, the course is strengthened in terms of developing anthropological thinking as a result of
explaining the ways in which ethnographies embody the aims and assumptions of the discipline in a clearer
way, through these big anthropological questions. This is because students will be able to contextualize the
ethnographic material they engage with by considering these broader anthropological questions.
The big anthropological questions that connect how society, for example, relates to human difference, and
how this difference in turn relates to our common humanity allow for the explorations of ethnographic material
and the concepts related to them to be examined in a more anthropological way. In other words, the same
question can be asked (and answered) in terms of kinship, politics, economics and so on. More than this,
whatever the context (kinship, politics, economics, belief systems), the possible answers can be developed
Social and cultural anthropology guide`

33

in ways that place the emphasis on a central concept, such as identity or materiality. The use of concepts
such as these give students a sense of how the discipline has developed and the recursive nature of
anthropological preoccupations—that is, the significance of the discipline’s continuous engagement with the
question of humankind(s).
In these ways a more interesting and meaningful engagement with anthropological thinking can occur and
theoretical understanding can develop, since they will emerge in relation to the ethnographic material that
students study.
For example: Interpreting the Kula ring
The Kula ring is an interesting case that can illuminate the ways in which social and cultural anthropologists
make sense of other people’s worlds by applying different theoretical lenses to the same practice. Thinking
of theories as lenses used to frame data, we can see how the Kula ring—a well-known ethnographic case—
can, for example, provide us with different understandings of the Trobriand people and insights into the
concepts of reciprocity and exchange. This helps us to realize how different theories shape the
representations of the cultures or societies anthropologists write about. Through this case we can appreciate
the rich dialogues that took place between theoretical approaches in the history of anthropology. Teachers
can undertake a similar exercise with other ethnographic examples.

Syllabus content—Part 2: Engaging with ethnography

Introduction
The IB Diploma Programme in social and cultural anthropology is underpinned by a number of pedagogical
principles. In particular, the teaching of social and cultural anthropology is conceptually focused and
ethnographically grounded.
The relationship between concepts, ethnographic material, and theories and methods can be illustrated in
the following graphic.

Concepts
(key and inquiry-specific)

Theories and
methods

Ethnographic
material

As the graphic indicates, the three components are equally relevant and teachers may choose any one as a
starting point for their teaching. Concepts are anchored in the content of anthropology—its language, practice
and theories—and come alive through the study of ethnography. Together these help students to acquire a
holistic and integrated understanding of social and cultural anthropology as a discipline.

Social and cultural anthropology guide`

35

Examples
Focus on concepts
A teacher may choose to explore a particular concept and select short ethnographic pieces that help to
illustrate this concept in different cultures and societies, and across different periods in time.
Focus on ethnographic material
When teaching ethnography, the concepts that are studied in class are those that the ethnographer focuses
on in the text. It is also the ethnography in this case that determines the content that is learned, in terms of
the specific anthropological concepts, methodological issues and relevant theories.
Focus on theories and methods
Alternatively, teachers may want to explore a particular anthropological theory, and choose ethnographic
material that utilizes this theory in its application to and interpretation of ethnographic data. This approach
demonstrates that anthropologists who use a specific theoretical framework may be concerned with exploring
a particular concept—for example, the use of feminist or Marxist theories when examining issues of power.
Or, teachers may want to explore a particular methodological or ethical issue, and choose ethnographic
material that demonstrates or illustrates this issue. The focus may be on how different anthropologists
approach the same issue in different contexts.

SL students study three areas of inquiry—one from each group.
HL students study four areas—one from each group and the fourth chosen from any of the three groups.
Social and cultural anthropology guide`

36

The areas of inquiry must be explored using a range of ethnographic materials, including reading at least
one full-length ethnography per area, supplemented by shorter ethnographic pieces from anthropological
journals, edited books or chapters from additional monographs.
The nine key concepts—belief and knowledge, change, culture, identity, materiality, power, social relations,
society, and symbolism—must be explored across the areas of inquiry studied. In addition, each area of
inquiry has inquiry-specific concepts. Students will be assessed through these key and inquiry-specific
concepts.
In choosing the areas of inquiry and the accompanying ethnographic material, teachers need to ensure that
across the areas of inquiry chosen, all key concepts and inquiry-specific concepts are explored.

Making meaningful connections
Applying an anthropological lens to contemporary issues
As stated in the “Nature of the subject” section, social and cultural anthropology is about “making sense of
other people’s worlds” (Eriksen 2006: ix) and exploring problems and issues associated with the complexity
of societies in a number of different contexts (for example, local, national, regional and global). To this end,
being able to apply an anthropological lens to contemporary issues as they happen makes this a highly
relevant and engaging course. Throughout the course, in the study of part 1, engaging with anthropology,
and more explicitly in part 2, engaging with ethnography, teachers should encourage students to make
connections between what they are hearing and reading about in the news and the concepts, issues, and
topics they are exploring in class. While all ethnographies deal with real-world issues related to, for example,
equality, the environment, identity, development, and conflict, being able to take a topical issue in the news
and apply an anthropological lens to it gives students the opportunity to think anthropologically about a
current matter of general interest. The following models demonstrate how a real-world issue, which is
grounded in a contemporary example, connects to anthropological concepts and areas of inquiry.

Teachers should provide opportunities for students to be able to make these connections using contemporary
examples. Important questions to ask include the following.
•

How does anthropology help us to understand real-world issues?

•

What kinds of questions would anthropologists be interested in asking when examining real-world
issues?

•

To what extent does applying an anthropological lens to real-world issues provide a different insight or
perspective on these issues?

The ability to make these connections links explicitly to one of the big anthropological questions in part 1,
engaging with anthropology: why does anthropology matter?
Students are assessed on this skill in paper 2, section A.
Further examples can be found in the “Making meaningful connections” section in the Social and cultural
anthropology teacher support material.

Ethnography
Ethnography is the basic raw material for a course in social and cultural anthropology, and literally means
“writing about peoples”. In anthropology, it is often used in two ways: first, to refer to the practice and process
of doing fieldwork and taking notes, and secondly, to the practice and product of writing. Students learn to
understand and evaluate ethnographic materials so they can use them to answer anthropological questions.
This requires the development of skills for the thoughtful and critical understanding of how ethnography is
constructed: formulating the research question, the theoretical orientation, the research methods chosen,
ethical decisions made and the processes used to decide what data to include.

Selection of ethnographies
When selecting ethnographies, both contemporary and classic, teachers must take into account the
requirements of the course and more specifically the areas of inquiry. It is advisable to select a full-length
ethnography and also a range of shorter ethnographic pieces that allow for the chosen areas of inquiry to be
fully explored. This choice must be informed by the key concepts relevant to the area of inquiry being studied,
Social and cultural anthropology guide`

38

as well as the inquiry-specific concepts. It is possible for one ethnographic source to cover a range of different
concepts, areas of inquiry and theories.
Ethnographic films and other visual or virtual media may be used as supplementary teaching materials to
explore the areas of inquiry, but these must not replace written ethnographic material. However, if used, they
must be treated in the same critical and reflective manner as written ethnographies.
When using ethnographic material, students should consider:
•

the ethnographic present

•

methodological issues

•

ethics

•

anthropological theories and concepts.

They must be able to identify ethnographic material in terms of:
•

fieldwork location(s)

•

historical context(s)

•

group(s) studied

•

ethnographer(s).

Students are required to study three full-length ethnographies at SL and four at HL—one for each area of
inquiry. In addition, teachers should also use supplementary ethnographic material in the form of articles from
anthropological journals, edited books or chapters from additional ethnographies in teaching.
Annotated bibliographies for some ethnographies can be found in the Social and cultural anthropology
teacher support material. These are for illustrative purposes and their inclusion does not imply that the IB
prescribes the teaching of these particular ethnographies. Teachers are free to choose appropriate and
relevant material. The examples provided here simply demonstrate how links can be made between
ethnographic material, the areas of inquiry and the nine key concepts. This will help in making informed
choices.

Representation in ethnographic accounts
Understanding the relationship between fieldwork data and ethnographic accounts is central to the syllabus,
and important in the analysis and evaluation students are expected to make of the ethnographic material
they read. The transformation of fieldwork data into ethnographic accounts presents a variety of challenges
that are commonly discussed as problems of representation. The anthropologist aims to provide a descriptive
account and interpretation of the reality of the people studied. The ethnography includes the representation
of local practices, beliefs and worldviews and interprets these through the analytical framework of the
anthropologist.
Contemporary anthropologists recognize that the descriptions and interpretations of culture they produce
should be examined critically. Ethnographic materials reflect the perspective of an observer and are open to
interpretation and critique. All ethnographic materials should be examined with the following points in mind.
•

Social groups are internally diverse; for example, groups that may appear homogeneous at one level
may be heterogeneous at another, and different anthropologists may see and represent the same group
differently.

•

Fieldwork participants and ethnographers always operate within a social context and this necessarily
requires an explicit awareness of the ethical decisions required before, during and after fieldwork.

Social and cultural anthropology guide`

39

•

Anthropologists make decisions about what is studied, how it is studied and what is included in the
published ethnographic account.

•

All anthropological accounts are produced for a particular audience and in a particular historical context.

Ethnographic accounts are the product of years of work, from the initial observation to field notes, analysis
and the written report. Most contemporary ethnographic accounts focus on a specific set of questions, but
necessarily link these to broader patterns at play in the society in question and beyond. At all stages, what
is recorded and what is not recorded is the product of decisions made by the anthropologist. The ethnography
is the outcome of the anthropologist’s theoretical orientation, and the purposes and goals of the research.
For further guidance, please refer to the “Anthropology and issues of representation” section in the Social
and cultural anthropology teacher support material.

Reading ethnography critically
Ethnographies present multiple points of view, some of which may be explicit and others implicit. When
reading an ethnography, the student needs to identify the claims, examine the evidence and evaluate whether
the data supports the claims and conclusions made in the ethnography. Ethnographic findings can be
validated by comparison within a society, within a region or by cross-cultural comparison.
However, when engaging with ethnographic texts, it is not always evident what or where the questions, data
or conclusions come from. Thus, the reading of ethnographic material can present a challenge in the
classroom as students are expected to develop the skills that will allow them to discern and analyse the
author’s intentions, and in a sense “deconstruct” the text in order to use it to “(re)construct” an argument in
relation to a particular question asked (Rivière 2014). According to Gay y Blasco and Wardle, “To learn to
read ethnography is to understand the way ethnographic arguments are constructed within a context of
anthropological debate” (2007: 98).
This guidance focuses on the expectations for how students should use ethnographic materials to begin to
think anthropologically. In this regard, and drawing on ideas of ethnography from Barnard and Spencer
(1996), Gay y Blasco and Wardle (2007) and Jacobson (1991), ethnography can be seen as simultaneously
a product, a perspective and a process/method. The first refers to ethnography as a product of knowledge;
the second understands it as a practice of knowledge, a practice that aims to understand social and cultural
phenomena from the perspective of those in the society who share culture or from the theoretical perspective
of the anthropologist; the third as a process/method that recognizes the ethnographer as the main instrument
of knowledge; the medium through which knowledge is acquired and shared.
Reading ethnography involves more than being able to glean information about a
particular group, an activity, or a theory: it entails taking an anthropological
approach to ethnographic texts. […] being able to elucidate how a text embodies
the aims and cultural assumptions that support anthropology as a discipline; how
an ethnography adheres to, or attempts to challenge, the shared codes and
conventions of the ethnographic genre; and how it evidences the social and
cultural conditions under which it was produced.
Gay y Blasco and Wardle 2007: 2
Ethnographies may be written in a variety of different styles (including those that read more like novels), are
themed on life cycles, or are centred on one key aspect of social or cultural life. This “style” is something that
teachers can discuss with students to show how the ethnographic form itself is multiple and may depend not
only on when an ethnography was written, but also on the preferences and/or perspectives of the
anthropologist.
It is important to note that many contemporary ethnographies have a specific focus or theme—such as death,
migration or consumption—that is explored, and they do not aim to cover all aspects of a culture or society.

Social and cultural anthropology guide`

40

There are some questions that students should consider when reading ethnographies that will provide clues
about the type of ethnographer/anthropologist the author is. These questions may point to the particular
theoretical orientation of the ethnographer, and his or her level of reflexivity. For example:
•

Is the ethnographer mainly interested with showing how things work cohesively in society or with the
conflicts that arise?

•

Is the ethnographer interested in how individuals experience their culture, or are individuals not really
“visible” in the writing?

•

Is the anthropologist present in the ethnography or is his or her subjectivity limited?

Use of ethnographic film
There are many ethnographic films and other visual and virtual media that may be used to support the
teaching of social and cultural anthropology. However, these must be treated in the same critical and
reflective manner as the written ethnographies.
Ethnographic film can bring culture to life, and given the prevalence of visual images in the lives of students,
it can offer an alternative way to engage students in the study of the subject. Bird and Godwin (2006) argue
however that we cannot assume that films speak for themselves, and thus they need to be contextualized
and this includes considering how they relate to anthropological concepts. They further state that although
visual media are powerful, teachers need to make explicit how they are connected to the wider context of
anthropological knowledge: they must offer opportunities to compare, contrast and arrive at reasoned
interpretations.
In other words, using ethnographic films to support and complement the ethnographic material students are
reading can be a useful exercise, but it should not replace the use of written ethnography. Nor should film be
used without a consideration of questions to think with and through.
To put this another way, “how can the (visual capability of) film complement the (lexical capability of)
ethnography?” (Heider 2006: 2–3). Heider states that an ethnographic film cannot stand by itself, and it
certainly should not replace the written ethnography. While an ethnographic film “can present much at which
the words of a written ethnography can only hint”, it cannot “communicate all the information that we can
legitimately ask of ethnography” (2006: 116). The use of ethnographic films must thus be supported with
written ethnographic material or better yet, films should only be used to support written ethnographic material.

Questions to consider before using ethnographic films
•

What constitutes an “ethnographic film”?

•

If ethnographic films are to be used in the classroom, how can they be effectively used?

•

To what extent can ethnographic films achieve the same objectives and standards of written
ethnography?

•

How can films present information that written ethnographies cannot?

•

What ethical considerations arise in the production of ethnographic films?

In supporting the use of ethnographic films in the teaching of the course, the following guidance is offered.

Guidance for teachers in the use of ethnographic films
•

Teachers must choose films that are clearly ethnographic, that is, have been produced by an
anthropologist or have been filmed using clearly ethnographic methods and approaches.

•

Teachers must be mindful of why and how they are going to use an ethnographic film to ensure that the
purpose and usefulness of the film is explicit in terms of developing anthropological understandings.

Social and cultural anthropology guide`

41

•

There must be a connection between the film and the areas of inquiry and/or the ethnographic material
being studied.

•

It may be more appropriate to use carefully selected excerpts from films to highlight particular questions,
issues or points of comparison rather than using whole films, which can be lengthy.

•

Teachers must ensure that students are clear about why they are watching the film so that they can
critically engage with it. The following types of questions might be a useful starting point when using
ethnographic films.
–

What or who is missing from the film?

–

What choices have the film-makers made and how does this affect the content and imagery of the
film?

–

Does the use of music on the soundtrack, narrators versus direct address or observational realism
make a difference?

–

How reliable and valid are ethnographic films as a means of ethnographic description?

–

How does the “portrayal” of a group compare and contrast between written and visual
ethnographies?

Ethnographic films must be viewed critically. As Paul Henley argues in his paper “The promise of
ethnographic film” (1996), “in order for ethnographic film to become of central importance to anthropology,
its theoretical status has to be articulated in terms that relate to the current theoretical and methodological
concerns of anthropology more generally” (1996: 6). Furthermore, he continues, “[...W]e [must] consider ...
[ethnographic films] as a means of representation that may be used in conjunction with written texts to provide
more rounded and comprehensive ethnographic accounts, [rather than] as a direct alternative to
ethnographic texts” (1996: 20). If promoted in this way, we will ensure that anthropological knowledge is not
reduced to just more or less interesting images, since this is what poor use of ethnographic material results
in. In other words, ethnographic film should add value to the reading of monographs and other ethnographic
material and not be seen as a stand-alone resource or substitute for written ethnography.

Engaging with ethnography—Areas of inquiry
The following template outlines how each area of inquiry is organized and set out. The aim of the template
is to provide teachers with some structure while still providing enough scope for flexibility and choice of topics
within areas of inquiry. Teachers are expected to cover all inquiry-specific concepts, but are not expected to
cover all suggested topics within the area of inquiry. The template also demonstrates how links can be made
back to the ‘big’ anthropological questions, the language of anthropology (concepts), the practice of
anthropology, and anthropological thinking (theories), which were covered in part 1 of the syllabus, engaging
with anthropology.

Belonging
Overview of area of inquiry
The anthropology of belonging encompasses both the more traditional and also very contemporary fields of
research, including studies of kinship, ethnicity, personhood and how individuals come together to form
communities. Individuals, as social beings, are born into and belong to particular social groups defined in a
multitude of ways. These may include belonging to a defined social class and religion, as well official
bureaucratic forms of belonging such as citizenship. Individuals may also produce forms of relatedness where
they self-fashion and perform identities that are meaningful for them in their particular social context. They
may express aspects of selfhood that are chosen, for example, membership of political groups. Belonging
includes economic and political dimensions, and is relevant at the micro level of the individual as well as at
the meso level of subcultural groups, and the macro level of national and global organizations and institutions.

Social and cultural anthropology guide`

42

From the beginning of the discipline, anthropologists have been interested in how societies organize to
reproduce themselves, and the ideologies and institutions that make this possible. Older studies of non-state
societies emphasized the formal organizational principles of kinship as an institution for the transmission of
status, political and religious office, economic goods and access to land (for example, Evans-Pritchard 1969
[1940], Radcliffe-Brown, 1965). More recent work in the field has incorporated understandings of
globalization and new technologies. Such work engages with how contemporary individuals experience and
enact belonging to a social group, or to several overlapping and intersecting groups simultaneously. This
work has also documented how migration and forms of discrimination based on ideas of personhood,
ethnicity, race, sexuality or faith may result in social dislocation, marginalization and exclusion. In contrast,
the ethnographic study of the impact of new reproductive technologies, friendship as influenced by social
networking websites, virtual/online communities and imagined communities has also shown how individuals
make and negotiate choices to become members of social groups and thus forge links to others with whom
they share aspects of their identity.
Ethnographies now often focus on how individuals experience belonging and how their choices shape and
even create the social world in which they live, thus forming the identities they embrace, recognizing the
complex interplay between social institutions and individual agency as explained by Bourdieu’s (1977)
practice theory. This represented a significant shift in ethnographic perspective, and while social institutions
are still understood as constraining agency to some extent, there is a greater appreciation of the
resourcefulness and initiative shown by individuals in the pursuit of their social and personal goals. The
desires and goals of individuals are, however, informed by the social values and shared ideologies of the
society they belong to. More contemporary work in the field of belonging has discussed forces that distance
and separate, or alternatively encourage, individuals to produce new and creative expressions of belonging,
linking those who may be physically distant or socially and culturally very different, utilizing, for example, the
concepts of disjuncture and dislocation in Appadurai (1996).
In this area of inquiry, the centrality of belonging in anthropology can be explored in a number of contexts
and through a range of inquiry-specific concepts. Individual experiences of belonging, desire, or even
violence as constitutive of group membership are historically contingent. Our ideas of what it means to
belong, what we desire, and seek to achieve change as we go through life, and as the societies in which we
live change. Belonging is socially produced and can be approached through the everyday practices, and
reflections on these practices, of anthropological subjects. The consequences of processes associated with
globalization on belonging may be studied through work on migration, the creation of transnational
communities that have been made possible by technological developments, and the impacts such largescale processes have had at the interpersonal level and in local contexts.
In teaching this area of inquiry, the following questions may be useful for framing discussions.
•

How are new reproductive technologies changing the ways in which people understand belonging?

•

How may choosing to belong to a social group be an expression of resistance?

•

To what extent are desires and emotions culturally produced and historically contingent?

•

Why do we need to belong to social groups and communities?

•

Why do some groups remain marginal or excluded from society?

•

How do nation states deal with internal diversity?

•

How is identity shaped by the experiences of migration and mobility?

•

What kind of belonging is possible in transnational or virtual spaces?

•

Is the exclusion of some people necessary in order to create a bounded group?

•

How does the social construction and delimitation of groups change over time?

This area of inquiry requires a balance between conceptual understandings, which serve as analytical
frameworks, and topic-based exploration. One approach to the teaching of this might be to examine classic
works on kinship systems and ideas of “family”. This may then be rethought and re-conceptualized as more
recent ethnographic work is introduced, which incorporates notions of complexity in identity formation and
the work of social memory for understanding belonging.

Area of inquiry—Belonging (see “Teaching units” in the appendices)

Classifying the world
Overview of area of inquiry
Classifying or categorizing the world is a meaning-making activity. Individuals understand the world and their
place in it through compartmentalizing and ordering everything in the natural and transcendent world in
symbolic systems where some things are placed at the centre and others at the margins or boundaries.
Inevitably, some things defy straightforward classification and are then often considered either particularly
polluting or sacred. For example, in the case of blood, a culture may consider human menstrual blood to be
polluting, yet consider the blood of sacrificed animals to be sacred.
Historically, this topic has been known as the anthropology of classification. The study of how people classify
themselves, each other, and the physical and non-physical world has been central to anthropology since its
inception. Indeed, 19th century unilineal evolutionists such as Tylor (1871) and Morgan (1877) proposed
ideas of cultural hierarchies and superior and inferior civilizations, as well as notions of progress. These
legacies of the early days of the discipline continue to inform and misinform popular notions of development
and difference. The work of early and mid-20th century anthropological theorists such as Durkheim and
Mauss (1963 [1903]), Van Gennep (1960 [1909]), Evans-Pritchard (1983 [1937]), and Lévi-Strauss (1962)
sought to understand the classification systems of the “Other”. Evans-Pritchard’s work tackled notions of the
limits of rationality within cultures from a structural functionalist perspective. Developing a structuralist
perspective, Lévi-Strauss sought to explain the different classification systems as based on the same human
cognitive capacity to order the world in which we live with the key differences between societies accounted
for by different approaches to myth and history. By suggesting that “man is an animal suspended in webs of
significance he himself has spun”, Clifford Geertz (1973) invited anthropologists to consider what symbols
and categories reveal about a culture.
The anthropology of classification in the 21st century is a rich area of study that both builds upon and departs
from its forebears. Mary Douglas’ seminal work on notions of purity and pollution (1966) are today used to
analyse topics as diverse as mental health, disease, organic and fast foods, and pregnancy and child-rearing;
while Victor Turner’s work on liminality (1969), which develops the pioneering work of Van Gennep, is applied
to many topics beyond the ritual process and rites of passage, such as studies on third and fourth genders,
airport terminals, refugee camps, and the conceptualization of social death (for example, Malkki 1995;
Thomassen 2014). Some anthropologists study the senses to reveal the complex classification systems of
other cultures, which may be based on classifying time and space through smell (osmology) or sound
(acoustemology) (Classen, Howes and Synnott 1994). This area of inquiry extends to a diverse range of
possible topics.
Social death often refers to when individuals are “excluded” from social life due to, for example conditions
such as dementia, or those in a coma. They are biologically alive but have been forgotten, excluded or
ignored by society, or are not able to engage in social relations resulting in a social death.
In teaching this area of inquiry, the following questions may provide helpful frames for exploring ethnographic
data and anthropological thinking.

What do the Diploma Programme subject groups and the areas of inquiry within social and cultural
anthropology reveal about the culture of the IB education?

•

How do categories reveal ontological assumptions?

•

How are categories contested and subverted?

•

In what ways is the act of categorization an expression of power?

•

How might the categorization of groups as “other” lead to ethnocide?

•

How does categorizing foodstuffs lead to food being edible or taboo?

•

How does the categorization of people result in discrimination?

This area of inquiry requires a balance between conceptual understandings, which serve as analytical
frameworks, and topic-based exploration. One approach to the teaching of this might be to examine classic
works on classification, which may then be rethought and re-conceptualized as more recent ethnographic
work is introduced, incorporating examples of how classification systems are used to understand
contemporary issues.

Communication, expression and technology
Overview of area of inquiry
Anthropologists understand communication as a cultural practice and explore how the different means of
communication have significant roles in the social construction of reality. Anthropology has reflected on the
role of communication in the processes of social and cultural differentiation, focusing on the study of writing,
orality, ritual, performance and, more recently, mass media.
Interest in communication and expression began early in anthropological inquiry and focused on the
importance of understanding meaning as being grounded in specific contexts. This contextual setting for the
understanding of communication was necessary in order to fully understand “the native’s perspective” and
to be able to translate this meaningfully (Malinowski 1922). According to this view, language is primarily
associated with the performance of “social tasks”.
As the notion of cultural relativism emerged, anthropologists sought to explain the strong interrelationship
between language and culture—that is, how language mediates our perceptions (Sapir 1921). Some
anthropologists have studied the impact of writing on culture (Goody 1977, 1986) and others have reflected
on the method of ethnography as the study of a society as though it were a text to be read and interpreted
by the anthropologist (Geertz 1973).
Anthropologists explore communication not only focusing on the semantic content of language, but also on
the social hierarchies and power present in communicative processes. The access to and control of the tools
of communication enable groups to legitimate their practices and establish consensus in society. For
example, Bourdieu’s (1991) Rites of Institution focuses on language as symbolic power. He also reflects on
the importance of language as cultural capital to create social and cultural distinctions. Within interdisciplinary
research, Raymond Williams (1985) focused on popular culture, reflecting on mass media and the
relationship between communication, hegemony and culture to understand contemporary sociocultural
dynamics. Also James Scott’s (1990) concept of “public and hidden transcripts” focused on language and
resistance. Post-colonial studies are interested in transcultural communication, in decolonizing writing and
knowledge, and in the dynamics of self-representation in the context of colonial subordination. Today,
contemporary approaches focus on theoretical and empirical studies of global media, exploring varied local
uses of media technologies and the ways in which media messages are localized and incorporated into
diverse cultural contexts. The ethnography of audiences is also a subject of study in the field of culture and
communication. Some current research focuses on means of communication within particular scapes
(Appadurai 1996) in a globalized world. Tensions between the global and the local, local forms of
appropriation, problems of representations and conflict in intercultural communication are significant issues
to explore.
Performance studies also constitute an interesting methodological and theoretical lens to analyse practices
in their communicative dimension, ranging from Victor Turner’s (1969) interest in performance to Butler’s
(1999) emphasis on the artificiality and constructed character of gender identity as performance. Ritual,
political or artistic practices are studied in a new light as a result of this theoretical approach.
Another area of recent interest is ethnography that focuses on areas of social media and virtual worlds.
Miller’s ethnography Tales from Facebook (2011) explores both the negative and positive effects of Facebook
in Trinidad, particularly in terms of the cultivation and destruction of relationships. Tom Boellstorff’s
ethnography, Coming of Age in Second Life (2008) provides an engaging insight into how virtual worlds share
the rich complexity of the real world when it comes to culture, but also offers a new perspective on
ethnographic fieldwork.

In teaching this area of inquiry, the following questions may be helpful frames for exploring ethnographic data
and anthropological thinking.
•

How have changes in communication and expression impacted globalization?

•

How are social hierarchies expressed and communicated?

•

Does the global spread of media technologies entail cultural homogenization?

•

Is it only older generations that make a clear differentiation between virtual and real?

•

How have youth cultures appropriated media technologies for their own uses?

•

To what extent can language relate to power differentials in gender, class or ethnicity?

•

What role do modern technologies of communication play in political mobilization?

This area of inquiry requires a balance between conceptual understandings, which serve as analytical
frameworks, and topic-based exploration. One approach to the teaching of this might be to examine classic
works on expression and communication that focus on orality, writing and other types of cultural expression
and older technologies of communication. These older technologies may then be rethought and reconceptualized as more recent ethnographic work is introduced, which incorporates research on new
technologies and their effects on the complexities of global communication.

Conflict
Overview of area of inquiry
The anthropology of conflict offers a thought-provoking tool for students who aim to explore and understand
the complexity of power relations from an anthropological and ethnographic viewpoint. One very important
angle on conflict is the tension between the state and those under the power of the state. This is a subsection of political anthropology. It is a core and ongoing field of research that has taken the discipline from
the study of the origin of the state in remote and “simple” or “exotic” societies (Beattie 1960) at the turn of the
19th century to contemporary ethnographies on the current configuration of power relations in a globalized
and transnational world (Eller 1999). Another possible angle on conflict focuses on tensions emerging from
everyday social relations between individuals, groups and institutions, in public and private spaces and in
rituals of resistance or exaltation (Varzi 2006). Power is expressed practically and symbolically in ideas,
values, emotions and actions of individuals and groups. The interweaving of the cultural, both symbolic and
moral, with determinations of social position (class, age, gender) and the forms in which power relations are
expressed (institutions, ideologies, dominations, resistances) make for complex and diverse levels of
analysis.
A new and productive topic in political anthropology is the study of the modern state. Studying “us” is a
challenging anthropological endeavour; that is, to study the state is usually complicated by the tendency to
essentialize or reify culture and society. The state appears as “natural” or “given”. To combat these cultural
assumptions, contemporary anthropologists are studying modern nation-states ethnographically, in terms of
their social and historical character. They focus on the actors’ perspectives, which reveal multiple levels of
meanings. These studies frequently shed light on the micro-level, less obvious relations of power and
domination within our current political orders.
Possible topics of study in this area of inquiry include: the constitution of political communities; the
relationship between order and conflict; the association between power, authority and legitimacy; the role of
social and indigenous movements; questions of inequality; perceptions and modes of violence; and concerns
about human rights and citizenship. Anthropologists reflect on these topics drawing from classic readings
such as Marxist understandings of exploitation and domination; Weberian concepts of state and
bureaucracies; the concept of hegemony in the works of Gramsci; and the more recent work of Foucault
including his concepts of governmentality, discipline and biopolitics, as well as other contributions from
feminist and post-colonial studies.

In teaching this area of inquiry, the following questions may be helpful frames for exploring ethnographic data
and anthropological thinking.
•

What are different sources of conflict?

•

Why is the same issue a source of conflict in one setting, but not in another setting?

•

What does it mean to resolve conflict?

•

Is the state the solution to, or the cause of, conflict?

•

Is conflict a natural result of our tendency to “other”?

•

What are the different ways in which conflict is manifest in one’s life and in society?

This area of inquiry requires a balance between conceptual understandings, which serve as analytical
frameworks, and topic-based exploration. One approach to the teaching of this might be to explore, for
example, the issue of domestic violence in society, beginning with analysis of news stories, documentaries
and print/electronic media articles (particularly prevalent during the global annual White Ribbon Day
campaign). Discussion and debate can then be informed and supported by more sophisticated reading and
analysis of anthropological text and ethnography, especially feminist writings .
Area of inquiry—Conflict (see “Teaching units” in the appendices)

Development
Overview of area of inquiry
Tradition and change collide as power relations play out in the fascinating, often contentious, interface
between developed and developing societies and segments of societies. The concept of development refers
to more economically developed societies providing assistance and resources to less economically
developed societies, either directly through bilateral aid or indirectly via other agencies. Development also
refers to self-directed industrial, technological and economic improvement. Anthropologists are active in this
field as advisers to governments or agencies (such as non-government organizations (NGOs), United
Nations agencies, or the World Bank) that wish to include knowledge and understanding of local cultures in
their decision-making process. In particular, valuable understanding of indigenous knowledge systems can
be shared with providers. Anthropologists may also conduct fieldwork, analysing the social impact of
development on specific communities.
Of particular interest to anthropologists is the western assumption by providers that development means
improvement in people’s lives when in reality this may not be the case. Neo-colonialism emerges as a topic
in the discourse on development; has the hegemony previously associated with colonial rule merely taken
on a different form? Development anthropologists are not only committed to making a positive contribution
to the lives of the recipients of aid, often through involving marginalized people in the decision-making
process, but are also obliged to evaluate the effectiveness of aid projects. In some cases it may be clear that
the negative social impact of development programmes, projects and policies outweighs the perceived
benefits.
The topic of development is contentious, as it may seem that the philosophy and aims of anthropology are
somewhat at odds with the realities of providing aid to communities in developing societies. An ethnocentric
evaluation of what “progress” means may dominate. Some of the first critical reactions to the dialogue about
development came during the 1970s from dependence theorists such as Immanuel Wallerstein (1979),
whose ideas drew from neo-Marxist thinking and who argued that the world was divided into core and
peripheral regions where inequality was perpetuated through unequal exchange within the international world
order. To follow the debate on development anthropology it is worthwhile exploring the work of
anthropologists such as Katy Gardner and David Lewis (1996), whose work includes a consideration of the
role of multinationals and the competing narratives of “development” and “un-development”; Arturo Escobar
(1995), who compares development and colonialism as mechanisms of control and governmentality; David
Mosse (2005), whose emphasis on the importance of a relational approach questions the dominant and
normative role of economists in development policy and practice; and other current anthropological writings
that may be pertinent.
Social and cultural anthropology guide`

In teaching this area of inquiry, the following questions may be useful in framing discussions.
•

When does development become “non-development”?

•

To what extent is development the other side of the coin to “under-development”?

•

How might development anthropologists resolve ethical issues?

•

Who decides whose “needs” are to be provided for?

•

Is development the new colonialism?

•

To what extent is indigenous knowledge relevant to development policymaking?

This area of inquiry requires a balance between conceptual understandings, which serve as analytical
frameworks, and topic-based exploration. One approach to the teaching of this might be to explore, for
example, the relationship between a developed nation and a developing nation that were formerly connected
as the colonizer and the colonized. To begin with, the nature of the relationship can be analysed through
investigating data available on government and NGOs’ websites and also examining contrasting viewpoints
expressed in print/electronic media. An anthropological framework can then be applied to evaluate the current
relationship in terms of development and the notion of neo-colonialism, using specific ethnography and other
writings. Also of interest will be the critical evaluation of the role of an anthropologist (particularly any ethical
considerations) in advising a government or an NGO regarding a development project that affects a specific
community in the developing nation being studied.
Area of inquiry—Development (see “Teaching units” in the appendices)

Health, illness and healing
Overview of area of inquiry
The anthropology concerned with health, illness and healing is a fascinating area with enormous implications
for all of us as individuals and as members of culture groups who understand health, illness and healing in
complex and diverse ways. Although most westernized societies have adopted a biomedical model of health
that defines health, illness and healing in terms of the biochemistry of the body, the nature of viral and
bacterial infection, and the response of the body to medication and/or surgery, there are many other ways of
viewing the subject. In westernized societies there is a growing belief in what is usually called the
biopsychosocial model of health. This way of thinking acknowledges that human health is strongly influenced
by psychological factors such as the relationship between the doctor and the patient, as well as, of course,
the relationships the patient has with family, friends and work colleagues (Kleinman 1988, 1995). This leads
onto the wider area of social factors related to health and healing, which include an even wider range of
relationships and can encompass religious beliefs. Although the biopsychosocial model has been criticized,
most westernized cultures no longer practise a purely biomedical type of medicine but acknowledge that
humans are embedded in an enormous web of psychological and social complexity.
Few societies in the world today are untouched by the biomedical model but most societies have a parallel
model of some type of biopsychosocial approach. A major area in health, illness and healing where there are
enormous variations is the aetiology of diseases, the study of the causes of illness. Many cultures may accept
a biological cause but see that cause as embedded within a variety of other factors such as environmental,
social, cultural and supernatural. Some societies do not subscribe to a concept of chance and link infection
with, for example, witchcraft (Mavhungu 2012). Other societies see illness as an infection but one that clearly
indicates divine displeasure (Frankel 1986; Jennings 1995). One of the intriguing aspects of considering
these societies is to try to disentangle the extent to which such beliefs are a combination of religious faith
and social control.
In some societies there are two parallel systems of health, illness and healing running alongside each other
with a greater or lesser degree of integration. Where members of a society have migrated from a nonwesternized to a westernized society, there are intriguing examples of cases where they maintain their
traditional healing customs in parallel with the biomedical model of the host country. An excellent example of
this is found in the combination of American biomedicine and traditional Hmong shamanic practices
(Conquergood and Paja Thao 1989; Hickman 2007; Siegel and Conquergood 1984; Siegel 2001).
Social and cultural anthropology guide`

48

While discussions about the biomedical model might seem to dominate perceptions on health, illness and
healing in both anthropological and non-anthropological discourse, there are a range of very interesting
departures from this that explore different cultural and social experiences of it. These include an exploration
of the different ways in which illness, for example, is experienced through pain, suffering, and abandonment
(Biehl and Eskerod 2005) and is caused by structural violence (Farmer 2003).
In this area of inquiry, health, illness and healing can be explored in a number of contexts and through a
range of inquiry-specific concepts. An examination of health, illness and healing both historically and
culturally can, for example, give rise to questions that contest understandings of the mind and the body, or
how pain and suffering are caused and experienced, as well as the political and economic nature of health
and illness.
In teaching this area of inquiry, the following questions may be useful in framing discussions.
•

How do biomedical, social or cultural understandings of the body affect the understanding of health and
illness?

•

How does religious belief influence healing practices?

•

How do structural forces create or shape health and illness?

•

To what extent is illness a socially constructed phenomenon?

•

How do some understandings of the body facilitate the commodification of body parts?

•

To what extent has the curing of illness become largely a political and economic pursuit rather than the
relief of suffering and pain?

•

What differences in the aetiology of illnesses exist in the various systems of healing?

•

How does the use of healing substances vary across cultures?

This area of inquiry requires a balance between conceptual understandings, which serve as analytical
frameworks, and topic-based exploration. One approach to the teaching of this might be to explore the
language and main ideas in medical anthropology and then to apply these in the reading of one full-length
ethnography and several shorter case studies of health, illness and healing systems in different cultural
settings.
Area of inquiry—Health, illness and healing (see “Teaching units” in the appendices)

Movement, time and space
Overview of area of inquiry
The anthropology of movement, time and space is both a classic anthropological area of research and a
broad and lively contemporary field of study incorporating recent developments in the study of social memory,
virtual communities and the politics of identity. What is clear within this area of research is the centrality of
these concepts to understanding how people experience and make sense of their worlds.
Durkheim and Mauss (1963 [1903]) pioneered the study of time and space in the early 20th century,
demonstrating that time and space were collective representations reflecting the social structure of particular
societies. Hence, time and space were always mediated by society and the individual’s experience of time
and space had its origins in collective social life. Movement in space or through time was experienced in the
encounters with boundaries (space) or intervals (time), marking a change of time or space. Time and space
themselves are not neutral, rather they are associated with different values, meaning and emotions often
linked to rituals marking socially relevant transitions as in rites of passage.
Evans-Pritchard (1969 [1940]) went on to show how both time and space are relative concepts with the
quality of time and space varying depending on the context and social connection. For example, if there are
two equidistant villages, the village one can reach without having to cross a river is experienced as closer,
and by the same token, a village in which more closely related people live is felt as closer in time than a
Social and cultural anthropology guide`

49

village in which only distant relatives live. In the latter example, the closer two people are to sharing the same
ascendant kinsperson, the closer in time they experience their relatedness, meaning two men who share a
grandfather are closer in time to each other than two men who share a great-great-grandfather.
Anthropologists such as Bourdieu (1991) were interested in the intersections of time and space while other
anthropologists have been interested in social memory and forgetting. These studies then inform
understandings of identity, the construction of virtual communities, and the politics of difference. Not only
does it matter what is remembered and how this is remembered, but so, too, does what is forgotten. Studies
of social memory may include ethnographies on recently re-formulated social memories of colonialism, ethnic
identity in the diaspora, nostalgia for what is thought to have been lost, and concomitant heritage projects to
reinvent and preserve particular pasts for consumption in the present. The remembering, as well as the
forgetting, of the past is always inextricably linked to the perceived needs of the present and hence, the
interplay between the past and the present is complex and nuanced (Cole 2001).
The anthropological study of movement, time and space has also led to innovative work in urban
anthropology, incorporating both social class and gendered understandings of space and, in particular, public
space (Low and Lawrence-Zuniga 2003; Patel 2010). Contemporary anthropologists are producing exciting
and relevant work on the global flows of migrants, with the poor at one extreme and professional expatriates
at the other, and the forced movements of refugees fleeing environmental and political crises and the nonplaces traversed by tourists as they journey in time and space for recreation (Malkki 1995; Appadurai 1990,
2006; Gmelch 2010; Augé 1992; Fechter 2007). The study of the experience of ruptures as well as
continuities in time, space and movement, and the impacts of these on family, community and society, are
essential for an anthropology of the 21st century (Kuchler 1993; Stoller 1995).
In this area of inquiry, the centrality of movement, time and space in anthropology can be explored in a
number of contexts and through a range of inquiry-specific concepts. Movement, time and space may be
explored as culturally contingent categories, which are imbued with value and give meaning to everyday
activities and practices (Basso 1996; Basso and Feld 1996). These categories also have value and give
meaning to activities and practices that are, in some way, conceptualized and experienced as extraordinary,
and these too can be studied.
In teaching this area of inquiry, the following questions may be useful in framing discussions.
•

How do time and space shape social practice in a particular society?

•

How are time and space produced through social activity, for example, in ritual?

•

How is space constructed to include some persons and exclude others?

•

How do some individuals and groups find ways to resist exclusion from particular times and spaces?

•

How is social movement understood and incorporated into social memory?

•

In what ways can movement or time be understood as forms of resistance?

•

What happens to time and space in a virtual community?

This area of inquiry requires a balance between conceptual understandings, which serve as analytical
frameworks, and topic based exploration. In approaching the teaching of this area of inquiry, it would be
useful to begin with examining how time and space and the movement of people through time and across
space (which could also be in spaces of dreaming or other altered states of consciousness) are understood
in specific cultures at particular historical moments. Movement, time and space should be explored critically,
drawing on both classical and contemporary theoretical work in anthropology.

Production, exchange and consumption
Overview of area of inquiry
The capitalist system is global in our world today. Under its hegemony, economies are tightly interwoven in
a complex interrelated world. In this global arena, there are tensions and conflicts, inclusions and exclusions,
and economic inequalities that affect many different groups in dramatic ways. Can the complexities of these
phenomena be fully explained by economics? Or should these processes be understood using a wider
anthropological framework?
This area of inquiry aims to address these exciting issues. The field of economic anthropology involves both
the comparative study of economic systems, and the social and cultural nature of economic activity. It
explores the ways in which societies construct, interact with, and transform the social and cultural
environment in the production, distribution, and consumption of material and symbolic goods.
This field has a long tradition in anthropology and constitutes one of its core areas of research. Using the
concept of “habitus” in their study of non-capitalist societies, anthropologists began to challenge economists’
assumptions about human behaviour by disputing the universality of economic laws. That is, they discovered
that not all people behave according to the same canons of economic rationality (Sahlins 1972; Bourdieu
2005). Economic anthropologists maintain that the economy has to be understood within its social and
cultural contexts.
The problem of exchange was one of the earliest topics of anthropological reflection. At the turn of the 20th
century, Malinowski (1922) and Boas (1888) began to question and reject evolutionist abstractions. From
well-known ethnographic cases like the Kula system or the potlatch as examples of alternative forms of the
circulation and distribution of goods, anthropologists started to think about the place of social reciprocity in
the allocation of resources. Continuing in the tradition of Mauss’s seminal work The Gift (1925), reflections
on commodity and gift exchange remain an ongoing area of research engaging many anthropologists from
different theoretical perspectives and approaches.
The focus on production entered the academic debate in the 1970s. As Wolf pointed out in his classic work
Europe and the People Without History (1982), it was difficult for the social sciences, and anthropology in
particular, to understand an interconnected world. Mintz (1985) demonstrated the multiple connections that
accounted for the emergence of modern capitalism. In line with this, anthropologists have researched the
interactions between large processes of capitalist expansion and local cultural responses. Work and labour
have been studied at length, particularly focusing on proletarianization, poverty, gender roles, peasantry, and
migration.
Studies on consumption enrich the debate from multiple approaches. Douglas and Isherwood (1979) and
Sahlins (1976) represent turning points in the study of material culture, discussing how the essence of
consumption is communication and the exchange of meanings through goods. More recently, Miller (1995)
has reflected on the impact of consumer goods on cultural values, while Bourdieu (1984) has analysed how
consumption expresses power relations and introduced the concept of “habitus”—the embodiment of the
material conditions of existence.
In teaching this area of inquiry, the following questions may be useful in framing discussions.
•

How do anthropologists understand the relationship between culture and economy?

•

Is there one universal form of economic behaviour and rationality?

•

How do anthropologists explain poverty and inequality?

•

What do anthropologists say about work and labour?

•

What is reciprocity and how is it relevant in a capitalist society?

•

In what ways is capitalism considered a global phenomenon?

•

How does the capitalist system expand and relate to other economic systems?

•

Why do people want goods?

•

What is the process of commodification?

This area of inquiry can be explored in a number of contexts and through a range of inquiry-specific concepts
and varied analytical frameworks, considering a balance between classic and more contemporary readings.
For example, a full-length ethnography focusing on one topic within studies of capitalism and shorter articles
dealing with other related issues may be included in the area of inquiry. Some of these articles may lead to
more theoretical discussions that will deepen the students’ understandings of the problems posed in this
area.
Area of inquiry—Production, exchange and consumption (see “Teaching units” in the appendices)

The body
Overview of area of inquiry
The anthropology of the body is an exciting and diverse area of research, which provides a balance between
more classic areas of anthropological study (such as the ritualized body or localized bodies) and new
emerging areas (such as experiential bodies or mechanized bodies). What is clear within this area of research
is the centrality of the body to understanding how people experience and make sense of their worlds.
While it was Marcel Mauss in 1936 who argued that “body techniques” should be the focus of anthropological
study, it was not until much later that the body as an area of research began to emerge with any dominance
in social and cultural anthropology. This area of research has sought to explore the body as more than a
“natural object” but rather as a constitutive dimension of everyday cultural and social practices. In other
words, how meanings and values are produced on and about the body.
Theorizing about the body within anthropology has been prolific in recent years and, more recently, has been
closely linked to the rise in questions about the biopolitics, suffering, and commodification. Mauss (1936)
discusses the enculturation of people through their bodies; Douglas (1966 [2002]) refers to the role of the
body as a metaphor for making sense of the world; Foucault (1973 [1963], 1977) argues that we are trained
through our bodies to be modern subjects; Csordas (1990, 1994) seeks to understand human participation
in the cultural world through embodied experience; Turner (1996) points out that projects of the self are also
projects of the body; even Bourdieu (1977) offers the concept of “habitus” to explore the relationship between
social structure and embodied experience; and Comaroff (1985) has highlighted the role of corporeality in
the practices of opposition and resistance.
In this area of inquiry, the centrality of the body in anthropology can be explored in a number of contexts and
through a range of inquiry-specific concepts. An examination of the body as a historically and culturally
contingent category can be seen, for example, as the material focus of everyday practices—whether as an
object of self-identification or the subject of social control.
In teaching this area of inquiry, the following questions may be useful in framing discussions.
•

How is culture inscribed on the body?

•

How do persons inhabit bodies?

•

How are mechanized and medical technologies changing the ways in which people think about and
experience the body?

•

Can we have persons without bodies and bodies without persons? In other words, what is the
relationship between the body and the self?

•

How is the body used as a form of resistance to the mechanisms of power?

•

In what ways is the human body shaped by sociocultural, historical and political processes? How, in
turn, does it shape them?

This area of inquiry requires a balance between conceptual understandings, which serve as analytical
frameworks, and topic based exploration. In approaching the teaching of this area of inquiry, it would be
useful to begin with examining how human bodies are the product of both biology and culture, and compare
the relationship between the body, mind and society across time and place. The body should be explored
critically, questioning the notion of it as a natural, universal object. It should be explored in terms of how
bodies are perceived, understood, and experienced in a number of contexts. In other words, in choosing the
topics to study and ethnographies to read, attention should be given to the body as a lived experience
encompassing all its social and symbolic relationships.

Assessment

Assessment in the Diploma Programme

General
Assessment is an integral part of teaching and learning. The most important aims of assessment in the
Diploma Programme are that it should support curricular goals and encourage appropriate student learning.
Both external and internal assessment is used in the Diploma Programme. IB examiners mark work produced
for external assessment, while work produced for internal assessment is marked by teachers and externally
moderated by the IB.
There are two types of assessment identified by the IB:
•

Formative assessment informs both teaching and learning. It is concerned with providing accurate and
helpful feedback to students and teachers on the kind of learning taking place and the nature of
students’ strengths and weaknesses in order to help develop students’ understanding and capabilities.
Formative assessment can also help to improve teaching quality, as it can provide information to
monitor progress towards meeting the course aims and objectives.

•

Summative assessment gives an overview of previous learning and is concerned with measuring
student achievement.

The Diploma Programme primarily focuses on summative assessment designed to record student
achievement at, or towards the end of, the course of study. However, many of the assessment instruments
can also be used formatively during the course of teaching and learning, and teachers are encouraged to do
this. A comprehensive assessment plan is viewed as being integral with teaching, learning and course
organization. For further information, see the IB Programme standards and practices document.
The approach to assessment used by the IB is criterion-related, not norm-referenced. This approach to
assessment judges students’ work by their performance in relation to identified levels of attainment, and not
in relation to the work of other students. For further information on assessment within the Diploma
Programme please refer to the publication Diploma Programme assessment: Principles and practice.
To support teachers in the planning, delivery and assessment of the Diploma Programme courses, a variety
of resources can be found on the OCC or purchased from the IB store (http://store.ibo.org). Teacher support
materials, subject reports, internal assessment guidance, grade descriptors, as well as resources from other
teachers, can be found on the OCC. Specimen and past examination papers as well as markschemes can
be purchased from the IB store.

Methods of assessment
The IB uses several methods to assess work produced by students.

Assessment criteria
Assessment criteria are used when the assessment task is open-ended. Each criterion concentrates on a
particular skill that students are expected to demonstrate. An assessment objective describes what students
should be able to do, and assessment criteria describe how well they should be able to do it. Using
assessment criteria allows discrimination between different answers and encourages a variety of responses.
Each criterion comprises a set of hierarchically ordered level descriptors. Each level descriptor is worth one
or more marks. Each criterion is applied independently using a best-fit model. The maximum marks for each
criterion may differ according to the criterion’s importance. The marks awarded for each criterion are added
together to give the total mark for the piece of work.

Markbands
Markbands are a comprehensive statement of expected performance against which responses are judged.
They represent a single holistic criterion divided into level descriptors. Each level descriptor corresponds to
a range of marks to differentiate student performance. A best-fit approach is used to ascertain which
particular mark to use from the possible range for each level descriptor.

Markschemes
This generic term is used to describe analytic markschemes that are prepared for specific examination
papers. Analytic markschemes are prepared for those examination questions that expect a particular kind of
response and/or a given final answer from the students. They give detailed instructions to examiners on how
to break down the total mark for each question for different parts of the response. A markscheme may include
the content expected in the responses to questions or may be a series of marking notes giving guidance on
how to apply assessment criteria.

Marking notes
For some assessment components marked using assessment criteria, marking notes are provided. Marking
notes give guidance on how to apply assessment criteria to the particular requirements of a question.

Inclusive assessment arrangements
Inclusive assessment arrangements are available for candidates with assessment access requirements.
These arrangements enable candidates with diverse needs to access the examinations and demonstrate
their knowledge and understanding of the constructs being assessed.
The IB document Candidates with assessment access requirements provides details on all the inclusive
assessment arrangements available to candidates with learning support requirements. The IB document
Learning diversity and inclusion in IB programmes (January 2016) outlines the position of the IB with regard
to candidates with diverse learning needs in the IB programmes. For candidates affected by adverse
circumstances, the IB documents General regulations: Diploma Programme and the Handbook of procedures
for the Diploma Programme provide details on access consideration.

Responsibilities of the school
The school is required to ensure that that equal access arrangements and reasonable adjustments are
provided to candidates with learning support requirements that are in line with the IB documents Candidates
with assessment access requirements and Learning diversity and inclusion in IB programmes.

each examination.

External assessment details—SL
Paper 1
Duration: 1 hour 30 minutes
Weighting: 40%
Paper 1 is based on part 1 of the syllabus, engaging with anthropology. It consists of an unseen text (500–
700 words) and four compulsory questions set on the text.

Qualities assessed
•

The purpose of the unseen text is to assess the students’ ability to undertake critical reading of
ethnographic materials in relation to their general anthropological knowledge.

•

The critical reading requires an ability to recognize the conceptual framework and anthropological
approaches evident in the unseen text. It also requires students to analyse and interpret the text and
compare it with other ethnographic material, applying their own conceptual knowledge and
understanding of anthropology.

•

Students must use evidence from the text, phrasing this in their own words, and also be able to refer to
a range of ethnographic material in order to formulate a discussion.

Questions
The questions on the unseen text require: description and application of concepts, analysis and interpretation,
and comparison.
The wording of each question indicates the level of response required.

Question 1: Description and application of concepts
Students are expected to demonstrate their knowledge and understanding of a given concept and be able to
apply this to the provided ethnographic text. They are required to present information from the text in their
own words rather than quote directly.
Question 2: Analysis and interpretation
Students are required to demonstrate an understanding of the key concept and use it to illuminate certain
issues evident in the text. Further to this, they must construct an argument supported by analysis and
interpretation of the ethnographic text provided.
Social and cultural anthropology guide`

59

Questions 3 and 4: Comparison
Students must choose one of two possible options, 3 or 4. In both options, students are expected to show an
ability to think about the text in relation to other contexts and to draw explicit comparisons. The principles on
which such a comparison may be drawn should be made explicit and clearly linked to the anthropological
issues raised by the text.
Comparative material must allow for both comparison (similarities) and contrast (differences) from the text.
Ethnographic materials used in comparison must be identified and situated in terms of the ethnographic
present, the historical context, the fieldwork location and the ethnographer.
In the first option (3), students must choose one of three key concepts and use it as a basis of comparison
with any other group or society they have studied.
In the second option (4), students are expected to think about the approaches to research used by the
anthropologist in the text as the starting point for a comparison with the approach(es) used by one other
anthropologist.

Question 5: Understanding of a “big” anthropological question
Students must refer to the text and their own knowledge of a range of ethnographic materials to construct a
well-developed argument that explores one of the following “big” anthropological questions.
•

What is culture?

•

What does it mean to be a person?

•

What does it mean to live in society?

•

How are we the same and different from each other?

•

Why does anthropology matter?

•

To what extent is knowing others possible?

Students should think with and through ethnographic material analytically and creatively.

Mark allocation
The allocation of marks for each question is indicated on the paper. The maximum number of marks for this
paper is 30.

Paper 2
Duration: 1 hour 30 minutes
Weighting: 40%
Paper 2 is based on part 2 of the syllabus, engaging with ethnography. There are two sections to paper 2
and students are required to answer two questions: one compulsory question in section A and one question
from section B.
The same questions are set for SL and HL, but the assessment criteria are different.

Section A
Students must choose one of three key concepts and one of five real-world issues, and apply them to the
ethnographic material studied in one of the areas of inquiry.

Section B
Students must choose one area of inquiry that has not already been used to answer section A and select
one question. All questions refer to either a key concept or an inquiry-specific concept.

Social and cultural anthropology guide`

60

Students must choose a different area of inquiry for section A and section B. Students who choose the same
area of inquiry for section A and section B will have their marks capped in section B (on the section B question
where the area of inquiry is the same as section A). Please refer to the assessment criteria.

Questions
Section A
The question in section A is compulsory. To answer this question, a student is required to select one area of
inquiry, one key concept and one real-world issue. For every session, the question format will remain the
same but the key concepts and real-world issues will vary, and these will be specified in the question. The
student is free to choose from any area of inquiry studied in class (not specified in the question).
In order for students to be prepared to answer the question in section A, they must have studied all nine key
concepts and three areas of inquiry. When formulating their arguments, students will need to demonstrate
their ability to apply and connect their anthropological knowledge to a real-world issue, which is grounded in
a contemporary example. Whatever form the response takes, students must recognize that any ethnographic
description is historically and geographically specific, and constructed by a particular person under particular
circumstances; answers should reflect these considerations.

Section B
To answer section B, a student is required to choose one question from one area of inquiry. This area of
inquiry must not be the same as the one chosen to answer section A.
In order for students to be prepared to answer one question in section B, they must have studied all nine key
concepts and three areas of inquiry with their inquiry-specific concepts. When formulating their arguments,
students will need to decide on the appropriate balance between description, generalization and specific
examples. Whatever form the response takes, students must recognize that any ethnographic description is
historically and geographically specific, and constructed by a particular person under particular
circumstances; answers should reflect these considerations.

Mark allocation
The maximum number of marks available for each question is 15. The maximum number of marks available
for this paper is 30.

External assessment criteria—SL
The external assessment consists of two written examination papers at SL, which are externally set and
externally marked. These are designed to allow students to demonstrate what they know and can do. The
external components contribute 80% of the marks at SL.

External assessment details—HL
The external assessment consists of two written examination papers at HL, which are externally set and
externally marked. These are designed to allow students to demonstrate what they know and can do. The
external components contribute 75% of the marks at HL.

Paper 1
Duration: 2 hours
Weighting: 30%
Paper 1 is based on part 1 of the syllabus, engaging with anthropology. It has two sections. Section A is
based on an unseen text (500–700 words) with four compulsory questions. Section B is based on textual or
visual stimuli, and is specifically concerned with anthropological ethics.

Section A
Qualities assessed
•
The purpose of the unseen text is to assess the students’ ability to undertake critical reading of
ethnographic materials in relation to their general anthropological knowledge.
•

The critical reading requires an ability to recognize the conceptual framework and anthropological
approaches evident in the unseen text. It also requires students to analyse and interpret the text and
compare it with other ethnographic material, applying their own conceptual and theoretical knowledge
and understanding of anthropology.

•

Students must use evidence from the text, phrasing this in their own words, and also be able to refer to
a range of ethnographic material in order to formulate a discussion.

Questions
The questions on the unseen text require: description and application of concepts, analysis and interpretation,
and comparison.
The wording of each question indicates the kind of response required.

Social and cultural anthropology guide`

68

Question 1: Description and application of concepts
Students are expected to demonstrate their knowledge and understanding of a given concept and be able to
apply this to the provided ethnographic text. They are required to present information from the text in their
own words rather than quote directly.

Question 2: Analysis and interpretation
Students are required to demonstrate an understanding of the key concept and use it to illuminate certain
issues evident in the text. Further to this, they must construct an argument supported by analysis and
interpretation of the ethnographic text provided.

Questions 3 and 4: Comparison
Students must choose one of two possible options, 3 or 4. In both options, students are expected to show an
ability to think about the text in relation to other contexts and to draw explicit comparisons. The principles on
which such a comparison may be drawn should be made explicit and clearly linked to any anthropological
issues raised by the text.
Comparative material must allow for both comparison (similarities) and contrast (differences) with the text.
Ethnographic materials used in comparison must be identified and situated in terms of the ethnographic
present, the historical context, the fieldwork location and the ethnographer.
In the first option (3), students must choose one of three key concepts and use it as a basis of comparison
with any other group or society they have studied. This comparison must include reference to concepts,
ethnography and theory.
In the second option (4), students are expected to think about the approaches to research used by the
anthropologist in the text as the starting point for a main principle on which a comparison with the theoretical
and methodological approach(es) used by one other anthropologist will be established.

Question 5 Understanding of a “big” anthropological question
Students must refer to the text and their own knowledge of a range of ethnographic material to construct a
well-developed argument that explores one of the following “big” anthropological questions.
•

What is culture?

•

What does it mean to be a person?

•

What does it mean to live in society?

•

How are we the same and different from each other?

•

Why does anthropology matter?

•

To what extent is knowing others possible?

Students should think with and through ethnographic material analytically and creatively.

Section B
Section B assesses students’ knowledge and understanding of the ethical issues of doing anthropology.
Students choose between two stimuli (one written, one visual) to answer a static question – a question that
remains the same for each examination session; the stimuli will change.

Mark allocation
The allocation of marks for each question is indicated on the paper. The maximum number of marks for
section A is 30 and for section B is 10.

Paper 2
Duration: 2 hours 30 minutes
Weighting: 45%
Paper 2 is based on part 2 of the syllabus, engaging with ethnography. There are two sections to paper 2
and students are required to answer three questions: one compulsory question in section A and two
questions from section B.
The same questions are set for SL and HL, but the assessment criteria are different.

Section A
Students must choose one of three key concepts and one of five real-world issues, and apply them to the
ethnographic material studied in one of the areas of inquiry.

Section B
Students must choose two of the other three areas of inquiry they have studied and select one question from
each. All questions refer to either a key concept or an inquiry-specific concept.
Students must choose different areas of inquiry for section A and section B. Students who choose the same
area of inquiry for section A and section B will have their marks capped in section B (on the section B question
where the area of inquiry is the same as section A). Additionally, students who choose two questions in
section B from the same area of inquiry will have their marks capped in the second question of section B.
Please refer to the assessment criteria.
Important note: Please be aware that a student who uses the same area of inquiry for all three questions
on paper 2 compromises his or her overall achievement as both essays in section B will be capped.

Questions
Section A
The question in section A is compulsory. To answer this question, a student is required to select one area of
inquiry, one key concept and one real-world issue. For every session the question format will remain the
same but the key concepts and real-world issues will vary, and these will be specified in the question. The
student is free to choose from any area of inquiry studied in class (not specified in the question).
In order for students to be prepared to answer the question in section A, they must have studied all nine key
concepts and four areas of inquiry. When formulating their arguments, students will need to demonstrate
their ability to apply and connect their anthropological knowledge to a real-world issue, which is grounded in
a contemporary example. Whatever form the response takes, students must recognize that any ethnographic
description is historically and geographically specific, and constructed by a particular person under particular
circumstances; answers should reflect these considerations.

Section B
To answer section B, a student is required to choose two questions from two different areas of inquiry. These
areas of inquiry must not be the same as the one chosen to answer section A.
If a student uses the same area of inquiry as used in their Section A response, the marks for the essay in
Section B will be capped. Please refer to the assessment criteria.
Additionally, if a student answers two questions from the same area of inquiry in section B, the marks for the
second essay in this section will be capped. Please refer to the assessment criteria.
In order for students to be prepared to answer two questions in Section B, they must have studied all nine
key concepts and four areas of inquiry with their inquiry-specific concepts. When formulating their arguments,
students will need to decide on the appropriate balance between description, generalization and specific
examples. Whatever form the response takes, students must recognize that any ethnographic description is
historically and geographically specific, and constructed by a particular person under particular
circumstances; answers should reflect these considerations.

Internal assessment

Purpose of internal assessment
Internal assessment is an integral part of the course and is compulsory for both SL and HL students. It
enables students to demonstrate the application of their skills and knowledge, and to pursue their personal
interests, without the time limitations and other constraints that are associated with written examinations. The
internal assessment should, as far as possible, be woven into normal classroom teaching and not be a
separate activity conducted after the course has been taught.
The internal assessment requirements at SL and at HL are different. At SL, students submit an observation
and a critical reflection exercise. At HL, students conduct fieldwork.

Guidance and authenticity
The observation and critical reflection exercise (SL) and fieldwork (HL) submitted for internal assessment
must be the student’s own work. However, it is not the intention that students should decide upon a title or
topic and be left to work on the internal assessment component without any further support from the teacher.
The teacher should play an important role during both the planning stage and the period when the student is
working on the internally assessed work. It is the responsibility of the teacher to ensure that students are
familiar with:
•

the requirements of the type of work to be internally assessed

•

the social and cultural anthropology course ethical guidelines

•

the assessment criteria; students must understand that the work submitted for assessment must
address these criteria effectively.

Teachers and students must discuss the internally assessed work. Students should be encouraged to initiate
discussions with the teacher to obtain advice and information, and students must not be penalized for seeking
guidance.
As part of the learning process, teachers can give advice to students on a first draft of the internally assessed
work. This advice should be in terms of the way the work could be improved, but this first draft must not be
heavily annotated or edited by the teacher. The next version handed to the teacher after the first draft must
be the final one."
It is the responsibility of teachers to ensure that all students understand the basic meaning and significance
of concepts that relate to academic honesty, especially authenticity and intellectual property. Teachers must
ensure that all student work for assessment is prepared according to the requirements of academic honesty
and must explain clearly to students that the internally assessed work must be entirely their own.
All work submitted to the IB for moderation or assessment must be authenticated by a teacher, and must not
include any known instances of suspected or confirmed academic misconduct. Each student must sign the
coversheet for internal assessment to confirm that the work is his or her authentic work and constitutes the
final version of that work. Once a student has officially submitted the final version of the work to a teacher (or
the coordinator) for internal assessment, together with the signed coversheet, it cannot be retracted.
Authenticity may be checked by discussion with the student on the content of the work, and scrutiny of one
or more of the following.
•

The student’s initial proposal

•

The first draft of the written work

•

The references cited

Social and cultural anthropology guide`

80

•

The style of writing compared with work known to be that of the student

•

The analysis of the work by a web-based plagiarism detection service such as www.turnitin.com.”d

The requirement for teachers and students to sign the coversheet for internal assessment applies to the work
of all students, not just the sample work that will be submitted to an examiner for the purpose of moderation.
If the teacher and student sign a coversheet, but there is a comment to the effect that the work may not be
authentic, the student will not be eligible for a mark in that component and no grade will be awarded. For
further details refer to the following IB publications.
•

Academic honesty in the IB educational context

•

Effective citing and referencing

•

Diploma Programme: From principles into practice

•

General regulations: Diploma Programme

The same piece of work cannot be submitted to meet the requirements of both the internal assessment and
the extended essay.

Group work
Due to the nature of the internal assessment tasks for both SL and HL, group work is not permitted. Fieldwork
sites can be similar or the same for students but the focus of the research must be clearly different and
students must undertake their fieldwork individually and independently.

Time allocation
Internal assessment is an integral part of the social and cultural anthropology course, contributing 20% to the
final assessment at SL and 25% at HL. This weighting should be reflected in the time that is allocated to
teaching the knowledge, skills and understanding required to undertake the work as well as the total time
allocated to carry out the work.
It is recommended that a total of approximately 30 hours (SL) and 60 hours (HL) of teaching time should be
allocated to the work. This should include:


time for the teacher to explain to students the requirements of the internal assessment



time for the teacher to explain the course ethical guidelines



class time for students to work on the internal assessment component, including the presentation
requirements for HL students, and ask questions



time for consultation between the teacher and each student



time to review and monitor progress, and to check authenticity.

Requirements and recommendations
Teachers and students will need to discuss the fieldwork at HL and some aspects of the observation and
critical reflection exercise at SL. Students should be encouraged to initiate discussions with the teacher to
obtain advice and information, and will not be penalized for seeking advice.
Given the nature of the research, students must take into account ethical questions and implications for
undertaking research with people, by seeking informed consent and ensuring confidentiality, for example.
Teachers are advised to refer the social and cultural anthropology students to the ethical guidelines for
internal assessment published in this section and to the ethical issues that have been discussed as part of
the course in relation to engaging in the practice of anthropology.
Social and cultural anthropology guide`

81

Ethical guidelines for internal assessment
Social and cultural anthropology students at both SL and HL must consider any ethical implications before
beginning their internal assessment task and throughout the whole project. The following guidelines must be
applied to all primary research methods, including fieldwork. These apply to students preparing for internal
assessment for first assessment in 2019.
•

Do no harm to the people who participate in fieldwork.

•

Respect the well-being of humans and the environment.

•

Maintain the safety of the ethnographer (student). Students should not undertake research that may
compromise their safety.

•

Obtain informed consent from the people who are the subjects of the research/observation in a form
appropriate to the context before you begin, providing sufficient information about the aims and
procedures of the research.

•

Fieldwork involving children needs the written consent of parent(s) or guardian(s). Students must
ensure that parents are fully informed about the implications for children who take part in such research.
Where research/fieldwork is conducted with children in a school, the written consent of the school
administration must also be obtained.

•

Maintain the anonymity of the people participating in the research/fieldwork, unless participants have
given explicit permission to the contrary.

•

Store all data collected securely in order to maintain confidentiality. This includes securing all files
and not sharing information via social media, and so on.

•

Be honest about the limits of your training.

•

Do not falsify or make up research/fieldwork data. Report on research findings accurately and
completely.

•

Report your research findings to the people involved in your research/fieldwork.

•

Do not use data for any purpose other than the research task/fieldwork for which it was collected.

•

Develop and maintain a working relationship with the people whom you study so that other
researchers can continue to work with them.

•

Check with your teacher when the right way to behave is not clear.

•

Participate in reviews of the ethical considerations in the fieldwork proposals of your peers.

Research/fieldwork that is conducted online is subject to the same guidelines. More detailed ethical guidance
can be obtained from professional anthropological organizations.

Health and safety guidelines
Schools are advised to follow best practice in health and safety for social and cultural anthropology for both
SL and HL internal assessments. This may mean undertaking a risk assessment evaluation with students as
part of the planning process depending on the nature of their research focus. Each school is ultimately
responsible for the health and safety of its students.

Social and cultural anthropology guide`

82

Dealing with sensitive issues
Undertaking research/fieldwork provides students with an opportunity to engage with interesting, stimulating
and personally relevant topics and issues. However, it should be noted that often such topics and issues can
also be sensitive and personally challenging. Teachers should be aware of this and provide guidance to
students on how to approach and engage with such topics and issues in a responsible manner. This guidance
may be that the area of research/fieldwork is not appropriate. Ethical considerations are of particular
relevance here.

Using assessment criteria for internal assessment
For internal assessment, a number of assessment criteria have been identified. Each assessment criterion
has level descriptors describing specific achievement levels, together with an appropriate range of marks.
The level descriptors concentrate on positive achievement, although for the lower levels failure to achieve
may be included in the description.
Teachers must judge the internally assessed work at SL and at HL against the criteria using the level
descriptors.


Different assessment criteria are provided for SL and HL.



The aim is to find, for each criterion, the descriptor that conveys most accurately the level attained by
the student, using the best-fit model. A best-fit approach means that compensation should be made
when a piece of work matches different aspects of a criterion at different levels. The mark awarded
should be one that most fairly reflects the balance of achievement against the criterion. It is not necessary
for every single aspect of a level descriptor to be met for that mark to be awarded.



When assessing a student’s work, teachers should read the level descriptors for each criterion until they
reach a descriptor that most appropriately describes the level of the work being assessed. If a piece of
work seems to fall between two descriptors, both descriptors should be read again and the one that more
appropriately describes the student’s work should be chosen.



Where there are two or more marks available within a level, teachers should award the upper marks if
the student’s work demonstrates the qualities described to a great extent; the work may be close to
achieving marks in the level above. Teachers should award the lower marks if the student’s work
demonstrates the qualities described to a lesser extent; the work may be close to achieving marks in the
level below.



Only whole numbers should be recorded; partial marks (fractions and decimals) are not acceptable.



Teachers should not think in terms of a pass or fail boundary, but should concentrate on identifying the
appropriate descriptor for each assessment criterion.



The highest level descriptors do not imply faultless performance but should be achievable by a student.
Teachers should not hesitate to use the extremes if they are appropriate descriptions of the work being
assessed.



A student who attains a high achievement level in relation to one criterion will not necessarily attain high
achievement levels in relation to the other criteria. Similarly, a student who attains a low achievement
level for one criterion will not necessarily attain low achievement levels for the other criteria. Teachers
should not assume that the overall assessment of the students will produce any particular distribution of
marks.



It is recommended that the assessment criteria and their descriptors be made available to HL students
at all times. SL students should not be provided with SL internal assessment criteria B–D before they
have completed the written report of their observation.

Social and cultural anthropology guide`

83

Using markbands for internal assessment
For internal assessment, markbands have been identified. Each markband has level descriptors describing
specific achievement levels for a piece of work in a holistic fashion, together with an appropriate range of
marks. The level descriptors concentrate on positive achievement, although for the lower levels failure to
achieve may be included in the description.
Teachers must judge the internally assessed work at SL and at HL using the markband level descriptors.
•

Different markbands are provided for SL and HL.

•

The aim is to find the descriptor that conveys most accurately the level attained by the student's work,
using the best-fit model. A best-fit approach means that compensation should be made when a piece
of work matches different aspects of a markband at different levels. The mark awarded should be one
that most fairly reflects the balance of achievement against the markband. It is not necessary for every
single aspect of a level descriptor to be met for that mark to be awarded.

•

When assessing a student’s work, teachers should read the level descriptors until they reach a
descriptor that most appropriately describes the level of the work being assessed. If a piece of work
seems to fall between two descriptors, both descriptors should be read again and the one that more
appropriately describes the student’s work should be chosen.

•

There are a number of marks available within a level; teachers should award the upper marks if the
student’s work demonstrates the qualities described to a great extent; the work may be close to
achieving marks in the level above. Teachers should award the lower marks if the student’s work
demonstrates the qualities described to a lesser extent; the work may be close to achieving marks in
the level below.

•

Only whole numbers should be recorded; partial marks (fractions and decimals) are not acceptable.

•

Teachers should not think in terms of a pass or fail boundary, but should concentrate on identifying the
appropriate level descriptor for each markband.

•

The highest level descriptors do not imply faultless performance but should be achievable by a student.
Teachers should not hesitate to use the extremes if they are appropriate descriptions of the work being
assessed.

•

It is recommended that the markbands be made available to students.

Introduction
Step 1: Observation and report
In the first two weeks of the course, students observe a context or an issue for one hour.
For their observation, students may first focus on either a context (such as the school itself, a church, a
restaurant, or a club, all of which are the focus of specific activities for defined groups, or more open public
spaces with specific functions, for example, a train station, a shopping mall, a playground) or an issue (such
as gender roles or differences, race, ethnicity). However, context-based observations should avoid settings
that have very few people, and issue-based observations must be grounded in concrete settings. Both

context-based and issue-based observations must be sharply focused. Teachers and students will need to
consider ease of access and opportunity in deciding the context or setting for the research.
Teachers must not provide guidance on conducting the observation beyond the choice of site and how to
write field notes.
Note: Students are not permitted to record their initial observation electronically, for example by using a
camera, but rather should make written notes on what they observe. The reason for this is that the purpose
of this initial observation is to experience the challenge of selective observation without the mediation of
technology. Students may choose to use technology for their second method as indicated in step 3.
Students should be given criterion A (without being given assessment criteria B–D or steps 2–4) before
writing the 450-word report of their one-hour observation; at this point in the internal assessment, the report
should be purely descriptive. This should be handed to the teacher and retained. No changes will be
permitted to this once it is submitted, and a copy of it is only returned to the student at the time of step 2 (four
to six months after the observation).
450 words

Step 2: Methodological and conceptual extension of initial fieldwork
This step provides an opportunity for students to apply their newly acquired knowledge of anthropology to
conduct further fieldwork. Teachers should return a copy of the observation report to the students to reflect
on. Using a key concept or inquiry-specific concept (which must be explicitly stated) to frame their research
and any reasonable method, students plan for additional research which, in most cases, will take place at
the original observation site. This should take place between four to six months after the initial observation.
Reasonable methods include:
•

participant observation

•

interviews

•

visual anthropology (photography, video)

•

surveys

•

life history.

Before returning to the field, students provide a 300-word written justification of the choice of method and
conceptual framework that they will use. Students should be given criterion B to help them write their
justification. Additionally, students should have the opportunity to submit a draft for discussion with their
teacher before submitting the finalized version and given approval to undertake their fieldwork. This
discussion may include clarifying the assessment criteria and ensuring that the focus of the study is solid.
300 words

Step 3: Second fieldwork data collection and analysis
Students conduct further research based on step 2.
Students produce a written report of no more than 400 words of the further research. This written report
should include analysis of data. The second research exercise should refer to and incorporate the key
concept or inquiry-specific concept and research method identified in step 2.
Students should be given criteria C–D and steps 3–4 together to focus their writing and more fully articulate
their discussion of the data.
400 words

85

Step 4: Critical reflection of fieldwork research, methods and concepts/area of inquiry
Students produce a critical reflection, which focuses on doing anthropology. This written report must
include:
•

a critical comparison and evaluation of the methods used in their two fieldwork experiences

•

a discussion of the position of the researcher and how this may have affected the results

•

an account of what has been learned through the process of gathering fieldwork data.

850 words

Suggestions for time allocation
The internal assessment is an integral part of the teaching of the course. Teachers are advised that while
students’ initial observations (step 1) should be done within the first two weeks, and the second fieldwork
(step 2) within four to six months of the first observations, the written report and reflection (steps 3 and 4)
should be done soon after step 2 to make it an authentic learning experience, enabling students to make
meaningful connections between their second fieldwork experience and writing up the final report. Too much
time between the steps may result in students feeling disconnected from their second fieldwork and this may
diminish the connections between the research and writing of the critical reflection.
The SL internal assessment is intended to be completed by the end of the first year of the course. Once
submitted to their teacher, students must not be allowed to go back and make changes.

Doing anthropology: Fieldwork
Duration: 60 hours
Weighting: 25%
Word limit: 2,400

Introduction
The internal assessment task is a demonstration of doing anthropology, with a specific focus on
methodology. The fieldwork enables students to gain personal experience of what it is like to be an
anthropologist. The research students undertake and the subsequent report they write are expected to focus
on:
•

the selection and justification of research methods and techniques

•

the application of research methods and techniques

•

the evaluation of research methods and techniques

•

a critical reflection on the research experience.

Step 1: Presentation
Students deliver a 10-minute presentation sharing their initial ideas about their fieldwork in the form of a
research proposal. This is followed by a Q&A session to a panel of their peers. During the presentation,
students should aim to present on the items listed in points 1–9 below. By the end of the presentation,
students should be in a position to revise and refine their initial research proposal.
Students should aim to include the following in their presentations.
1.

Identify the anthropological nature of the research

2.

Identify the area of inquiry

3.

Identify the key or inquiry-specific concepts or theory that will frame the research

4.

Identify the context/setting (fieldwork site)

5.

Identify a research question, which should be informed by reference to relevant literature

Appropriateness and justification of methods
6.

Identify at least two data collection techniques

7.

Identify potential methodological problems

8.

Propose a realistic timeline

Awareness of ethical considerations
9.

Identify potential ethical problems

Students will need to complete a fieldwork proposal form, which will identify and justify their selection with
regard to fieldwork choices. The fieldwork proposal form will need to demonstrate links to the literature review
and outline resources that support the research. This form must be included as an appendix to the report as
it will help inform the assessment of the critical reflection. The presentation is a formative assessment, which
is an essential prerequisite for a successful fieldwork project.

89

Please refer to the Social and cultural anthropology teacher support material for guidance on the presentation
peer review.

Step 2: Critical reflection
Students write a critical reflection on the initial research proposal in light of the panel discussion. They should
explore what, if anything, changed as a result of the presentation and discuss why it changed. The critical
reflection will be part of the formal assessment.
800 words

Step 3: Fieldwork
Students carry out fieldwork, employing at least two data collection methods/techniques.
Step 4: Research report and reflection
Students write a report and reflection on their research. The following are indicative of what should be
included.

Research report:
•

Research question

•

Area of inquiry and key concept or theory that framed the research

•

Reference to literature (at least three sources and no more than five)
These references may relate to the area of inquiry or concept but could also refer to methodological
and/or ethical issues.

•

Fieldwork data

•

Analysis and interpretation of data in relation to the research question, area of inquiry and key concept
or theory

•

Conclusion(s): research findings and implications. Why did this area of research matter?

Reflection on the research process:
•

Links back to the area of study and concepts—what I have learned about this from my own research?

•

Evaluation of the methods/problems/limitations that were faced—were any ethical problems
encountered?

•

Discussion of the position of the researcher

•

If the research was to be conducted again, what would you change in the light of your experience?

•

How did this research experience inform the way you know the world? (Link to TOK)

Guidance will need to be given on the conventions of how to present anthropological data.

HL – Internal assessment guidance
Introduction
The internal assessment in HL should be undertaken after having studied engaging with anthropology and
exploring at least one area of inquiry. Teachers are advised to explain the nature of this research task,
focusing on the practice of anthropology and its terminology, specifically the research methods and the
distinctive characteristics of anthropological research.
Preparing for the presentation

Choice of research topic and fieldwork setting
Students should, with the teacher’s guidance, choose their own research topic and develop a suitable,
focused research question framed within an area of inquiry and reflecting the student’s personal interest.
Students must develop a fieldwork proposal (Form SCA/HLIA/FP) to present to a panel of their peers prior
to beginning any research.
The teacher should approve each topic before the work is started, and should ensure that it complies with
the requirements of and meets the criteria for internal assessment.
In planning fieldwork, both teachers and students need to think initially in terms of context or setting, and
possible anthropological issues or questions. These should be related to the inquiry-specific concepts or
theories pertaining to the area of inquiry. Reference should be made to literature relating to the chosen topic.
Teachers should also provide guidance to students regarding potential ethical issues.
A student may then begin his or her research process by first focusing on either a context (such as the school
itself, a church, a restaurant, or a club, all of which are the focus of specific activities for defined groups, or
more open public spaces with specific functions, for example, a train station, a shopping mall, a playground)
or an issue (such as gender roles or differences, race, ethnicity, or rites of passage, related to the selected
area of inquiry).
If students pay particular attention to relating their research to concepts or theory linked to the area of inquiry,
superficiality will be avoided. Issue-based fieldwork projects must be grounded in concrete settings. Teachers
and students will need to consider ease of access and opportunity in deciding the context or setting for the
research. Ultimately, both must be sharply focused.
Students must be aware of the ethical guidelines when undertaking any research.

Choice of research methods
Once the issue and context have been decided on, methods and techniques of data collection need to be
explored. The required two data collection techniques need to be selected in terms of specific goals and in
relation to the kinds of data—qualitative and/or quantitative.
Ethnographers use a broad variety of techniques in collecting data, including interviewing, observation, notetaking, audio and visual recording, discussing recordings with members of the group being studied, keeping
journals, collecting censuses, life histories, questionnaires, using archival materials, material culture and
producing genealogies. Data may also be collected in a variety of forms that illustrate different aspects of a
given society and culture at a given time and place. These may include expressive forms and internal
accounts such as music, lyrics, literature, letters, stories and films. The nature of the data and the techniques
used to collect them depend on the goals of the research. Each technique provides a partial view and
therefore cannot stand alone, nor can it be used uncritically. It is essential that any such material should be
examined from an anthropological perspective. The body of data collected during fieldwork is often
substantial, and is used selectively in analysis and in writing up the results of the fieldwork. Fieldwork data is
often supplemented with materials gathered in libraries and museums.

Step 1: The presentation
Students are required to deliver a 10-minute presentation on their initial research proposal (step 1) to a
“panel”, which may consist of the class, or if the class is small, may also include the teacher. Members of the
panel should be instructed to make notes on each presentation from which to provide feedback to the
presenters. This information will be important for completion of the critical reflection (step 2).
Please refer to the Social and cultural anthropology teacher support material for guidance on presentation
peer review.
Social and cultural anthropology guide`

91

Step 2: The critical reflection
Teachers should provide guidance for students in the writing of their critical reflection in terms of:
•

taking into account feedback from the panel and how this impacted the initial proposal

•

the anthropological nature of the research

•

the appropriateness and justification of methods

•

the awareness of ethical considerations.

Step 3: Supporting the fieldwork
While students are expected to undertake their fieldwork independently, teachers need to monitor this
process through periodic consultation, ensuring attention is being paid to ethical issues and appropriate
recording of data is occurring. Advice may also be given regarding managing any practical challenges.

Preparing for the research report and reflection

Step 4: Research report and reflection
Teachers should give guidance on how to present anthropological data. The data will need to be interpreted
in terms of the research question and the area of inquiry, using a conceptual/theoretical framework, and
addressing ethical issues. The report should be analytical rather than descriptive and utilize critical evaluation
skills.
The format of the report is not prescribed. Students may choose to integrate both the research report and
the reflection, or they may address the two sections separately within a single report.
Teachers may give advice on:
•

how to incorporate references to relevant literature

•

how to present the data

•

how to integrate the area of inquiry, key concepts or theory with interpretation of the research data

•

how to develop an argument supported by findings

•

how to synthesize findings in relation to the research question

•

how to evaluate the research process, including methods and how these relate to the data, and ethical
issues

•

how to discuss the position of the researcher in terms of the construction of knowledge

•

how to reflect on the process of experiential learning.

Time allocation
The fact that the internal assessment is an integral component of the HL course, contributing 25% to the final
assessment, should be reflected in the total time allocated to the task, which should include some time for
fieldwork, classwork and homework.
It is recommended that the time given to the fieldwork should include time for:
•

the teacher to explain to students the requirements of the internally assessed work, and to give
suggestions for research

•

consultation between teacher and student on the choice of context and issue for the research

•

guidance on ethical issues

•

students to work on their topic in class

Social and cultural anthropology guide`

92

•

students to collect data

•

students to complete the presentation, critical reflection and research report and reflection

•

reviewing and monitoring progress

•

the teacher to check authenticity

•

student and teacher to complete the submission process.

Fieldwork proposal form
Completion of this form is a prerequisite to the fieldwork presentation students must make prior to starting
their fieldwork. The purpose of this form is to set out what they intend to investigate, why, and how they
expect to undertake this. The completion of this form is a formal requirement and it must be submitted as
part of the appendix for their internal assessment. While the form itself will not be assessed, it will inform the
first part of their assessed internal assessment—the critical reflection.

Engaging with anthropology—Teaching unit
PART 1: ENGAGING WITH ANTHROPOLOGY
Overview of engaging with anthropology
This unit of study introduces social and cultural anthropology and forms the basis on which the areas of inquiry should be explored. It introduces students to the discipline
of anthropology, in terms of both knowledge and practice. This unit is organized into three areas of anthropology, which provide a framework for how students will
engage with the course. Students are introduced to some of the questions and issues that they will explore within the areas of inquiry.
Engaging with anthropology covers:

•

the language of anthropology—key concepts and terminology

•

the practice of anthropology: doing anthropology—ethnographic methods and ethical issues

•

anthropological thinking: theories.

Teaching and learning focus
All students of social and cultural anthropology should be familiar with the set of key and inquiry-specific concepts, the methods used by anthropologists and the issues
associated with the construction of ethnographic accounts. While engaging with anthropology should be introduced as a discrete unit of study, the questions and
issues raised should also be integrated into the study of the areas of inquiry. In other words, the questions and issues from this unit of study should be returned to
throughout the teaching of the course as students become more familiar with anthropology and the work of anthropologists. What is studied here will inform student
understanding of the ethnographic material explored in the areas of inquiry.

Social and cultural anthropology guide`

107

Six “big” anthropological questions to think with and through

•

What is culture?

•

What does it mean to be a
person?

•

What does it mean to live in
society?

These “big” anthropological questions underpin the course and students’ exploration of the areas of inquiry and particular
cultures and societies, allowing them to reflect on these universal questions. An understanding of these big anthropological
questions should inform and be informed by the ethnographic material studied throughout the course. Students should have the
opportunity to reflect on these throughout their study. Their reflections on these big questions will be assessed in paper q, at both
HL and SL.
The aim of the big anthropological questions as tools to think with and through ethnographic material is that they facilitate
students moving “beyond the awareness of cultural diversity to a more fundamental grasp of our common humanity” (Ingold
1985).

•

How are we the same and
different from each other?

•

Why does anthropology
matter?

This exploration is closely aligned with the IB learner profile: “The aim of all IB programmes is to develop internationally minded
people who, recognizing their common humanity and shared guardianship of the planet, help to create a better and more peaceful
world”; and with the IB mission statement: “other people, with their differences, can also be right.”

•

To what extent is it possible to
know others?

Additionally, these big questions foster the development of citizens who are globally aware, internationally minded, and ethically
sensitive.

The language of anthropology
The language of anthropology is not to be confused with linguistic anthropology, which is the study of how language influences social life and how language changes
over time; rather, the language of anthropology here refers to the concepts and terminology used within the discipline. Students will be expected to be able to use,
explain and evaluate anthropological concepts and terms as they are understood within the context of social and cultural anthropology.
Anthropological concepts and terms provide an entry point to the discipline. As new theories are developed and applied, new terms and concepts enter the language of
the discipline while others may cease to be used. Students are encouraged to understand that theories are dynamic and of value in so far as they enable us to make
sense of the complex social worlds we inhabit.
Being able to use appropriate anthropological terms and concepts with confidence will demonstrate not only knowledge and understanding of the discipline, but also the
ability to analyse and evaluate ethnographic material.

The practice of anthropology: Doing anthropology
Anthropology as a discipline distinguishes itself from other social sciences by the emphasis that it places on ethnographic fieldwork as a method of data collection. The
production of anthropological knowledge is primarily undertaken by doing anthropology in the form of fieldwork, which is then described and analysed in the
ethnographic texts anthropologists produce. The aim of fieldwork and the writing of ethnography is to develop an understanding of a society or culture by “taking part” in
the lives of the locals and becoming so deeply immersed that, as Evans-Pritchard argued, anthropologists become “doubly marginal”, positioned between their own
society and the one they are studying (1983 [1937]: 243). Furthermore, “the strength of the anthropologist’s knowledge can thus be said to lie in his or her mastery of
both the local culture and a different culture (his or her own), and of tools of analysis, which makes it possible to give an analytical comparative account of both” (Eriksen
2009: 30).
This fieldwork based on participant observation may be supplemented by a variety of other data collection methods, such as interviews, statistical analysis or life
histories.
There are important ethical considerations that all anthropologists must consider before, during and after undertaking fieldwork. Professional anthropological bodies and
university departments provide anthropologists with ethical codes of conduct that articulate how anthropologists should behave, and are designed to protect both
anthropologists and their informants.
Students must explore the questions and issues related to the practice of anthropology as highlighted in this introductory unit, and revisit these through the study of
ethnographic materials in engaging with ethnography. Students are given the opportunity both to appreciate and demonstrate anthropological practice through the
internal assessment tasks at both SL and HL.

Anthropological thinking: Theories
How social and cultural anthropologists make sense of other people’s worlds cannot be fully appreciated without an understanding of theory. Anthropological theories
guide anthropological inquiry in relation to the questions asked, the research hypotheses, the choice of methodology used and the kind of evidence produced. It is in the
reading of ethnographic material that we are able to understand how features of societies and cultures have meaning in and of themselves or in relation to other features
or societies/cultures. Anthropologists not only use theories to better understand societies and cultures, but their work may also contribute to further developing theory as
a result of the direct study of these societies and cultures.
At this level, theories can be regarded as lenses used to frame data, to make sense of data, as a determining factor for the kinds of questions anthropologists ask, and
for how they ultimately shape the representations of the cultures or societies anthropologists write about. In other words, how we make sense of other people’s worlds
will be influenced by the particular theoretical lens we choose when generating and reading ethnographic material. If we take Franz Boas’ potlatch, for example, applying
different theoretical lenses to the data will provide us with different understandings of the Kwakwaka’wakw (see for example, Rosman and Rubel 1972; Kan 1986).
The development of anthropological theory from the mid-19th century can be seen historically as having taken a relatively linear path, with clearly dominant theories
emerging consecutively in different national anthropological traditions. However, after the 1960s anthropology experienced an explosion of different paradigm shifts
resulting in many, often overlapping and diverse theoretical approaches broadly covered by the term “postmodern”, with no single theory emerging as dominant in the
field.
In the teaching and learning of anthropological theories at this level, it is not possible, or even desirable, to present a complete overview and history of theoretical
developments within the discipline. Instead, it is useful to think in terms of a contrast between different emphases in the work of anthropologists. In other words, and as
this course is concerned with the processes shaping social and cultural life, anthropological theories can be considered as a framing device in terms of those placing
emphasis on society and those placing an emphasis on the importance of culture; or alternatively, those that are objectivist and structure-centred, and those that are
subjectivist and agency-centred. As Sherry B. Ortner argues, “Where functionalists asked, how do things hang together?”, interpretivists were more concerned with
asking, “what do they mean?”; where functionalists regarded social systems as being cohesive, Marxists questioned the very nature of capitalism, arguing that it was

Social and cultural anthropology guide`

111

exploitative and conflictive; where functionalists were more interested in the practical function of social institutions, Lévi-Strauss explored how “practical” institutions, such
as kinship, co-existed with “non-practical” institutions such as myth, both operating within a “structure” (2006: 1). So, social theorists were, and are, interested in very
different aspects of societies and cultures, and explored these from different perspectives depending on the questions about society and culture they were interested in.
However, as Ortner continues to argue, they were essentially all concerned with a common issue, that of human constraint. In other words, how human behaviour is
“shaped, moulded, ordered, and defined by external social and cultural forces and formations” (2006: 1).
While it is impossible to “neatly” categorize theories within anthropology, the two models presented below offer two alternative ways in which you can begin to think about
organizing some of the main theories. You may be aware of some or all of these theories, but you may not have thought of them in this way.
It should be noted that the theories must not be studied in isolation of the ethnographic material explored. In other words, there is no necessity to study theories in the
abstract, but rather to focus on the theories as they arise in the ethnographic material studied. Additionally, students are not expected to cultivate an in-depth of all the
theories presented, but should have (at least) secure knowledge of some and an awareness of others.
Model 1
This model presents three groups of theories: the first are those that are broadly associated with society, the second with culture, and the third are generally concerned
with how social and cultural relations are configured beyond the limitations of working within either society or culture, and often also working more explicitly across
societies/cultures.
Model 2
This model also presents three groups of theories: the first are broadly associated with structure-centred theories, the second with agency-centred theories and the third
with theories that focus more on perspectives that integrate both structure and agency.

In understanding anthropological
thinking in social and cultural
anthropology, students must have the
opportunity to explore the idea of

studies.
They should also explore how
anthropologists may ask the same
questions but answer them differently
depending on the theoretical lens
applied.

They should explore how applying
different theoretical lenses to the same
ethnographic material provides differing
insights into a culture or society.
They should be familiar with the
contexts of the emergence of diverse
contemporary theories to identify to
what extent they bring answers to new
problems.

SL students are expected to be able
to (AO2):

HL students are expected to be able
to (AO2 and AO3):

•

identify and explain the theories
relevant to the ethnographic
material studied

•

demonstrate an understanding of
how theory influences
ethnographic data

•

apply a theoretical lens to analyse
ethnographic data

•

compare and contrast the
application of theory in different
ethnographies

•

critically evaluate theories in
relation to ethnographic material
studied and in relation to each
other.

The ethnographic
method

Anthropological
thinking: Theories

The study of belonging allows for the exploration of some of the “big” anthropological questions identified in part one of the syllabus, engaging
with anthropology. There are clear opportunities to discuss the following questions in particular.

•

What does it mean to be a person?

•

What does it mean to live in society?

•

How are we the same and different from each other?

Teachers and students should address some of the particular methodological issues that might arise when anthropologists study belonging.
These could be general or specific to the ethnographic material used. It is important that these should include the particular ethical issues raised
by this area of inquiry and the ethnographic material studied. Questions you may wish to consider include:

•

What are the ethical issues associated with working with children and/or marginalized groups?

•

How might the positionality/reflexivity of the ethnographer influence the reader’s understanding of “belonging”?

•

What ethical and methodological issues might arise in the study of social exclusion?

•

What issues arise when moving from one level to another in the study of belonging? For example, how would you understand belonging at
a local level and simultaneously at a national or even global level too?

As with all areas of anthropological research, discussions on belonging have changed focus over the years and this is reflected in and by
changes in anthropological ways of thinking about belonging. In order to make sense of these developments and how the concept of
belonging has been explored by anthropologists in different social, cultural and historical contexts, it is important for students to be able to
make connections between theories and ethnographic material. The following suggestions are an indication of some of the more prevalent
theories likely to be represented in anthropological research on belonging.

•

Feminist theories

•

Globalization theories

•

Neo-Marxism: Racial formation theory; critical race theory

•

Phenomenology

•

Post-structuralism

•

Practice theory

•

Any other relevant theories discussed in the ethnographic material explored

The study of classifying the world allows for the exploration of some of the “big” anthropological questions identified in part one of the
syllabus, engaging with anthropology. There are clear opportunities to discuss the following questions in particular.

•

What does it mean to be a person?

•

Teachers and students should address some of the particular methodological issues that might arise when anthropologists study
classifying the world. These could be general or specific to the ethnographic material used. It is important that these should include
the particular ethical issues raised by this area of inquiry and the ethnographic material studied.
For this area of inquiry it is important to give a historical context to the development of ideas. Classic ethnographies need to be
examined in relation to more contemporary ones. A comparison between classic and contemporary ethnographies in terms of method
and approaches would also be useful.
Questions you may wish to consider include:

Anthropological
thinking: Theories

•

How do the methods of anthropologists today compare to those of the past?

•

What are the effects of the categorization of “self” and “Other”?

•

How do the social categories of ethnographer’s own culture affect his or her ability to understand the categories of the culture
under study?

•

How do the ways in which anthropologists classify other cultures raise issues of representation and power?

As with all areas of anthropological research, discussions on how we classify the world have changed focus over the years and this is
reflected in and by changes in anthropological ways of thinking about classifying the world. In order to make sense of these
developments and how the concept of classifying the world has been explored by anthropologists in different social, cultural and
historical contexts, it is important for students to be able to make connections between theories and ethnographic material. The
following suggestions are an indication of some of the more prevalent theories likely to be represented in anthropological research on

Is there a relationship between knowledge and morality?

•

How does a shared classification of knowledge create social cohesion?

•

Can you understand cultural categorisation without language?

•

To what extent are Lévi-Strauss’ binary categories still relevant in the construction of knowledge today?

Big anthropological
questions

The study of health, illness and healing allows for the exploration of some of the “big” anthropological questions identified in part one of
the syllabus, engaging with anthropology. There are clear opportunities to discuss the following questions in particular.




Doing anthropology:
The ethnographic
method

Anthropological
thinking: Theories

What does it mean to be a person?
How are we the same or different from each other?
Why does anthropology matter?

Teachers and students should address some of the particular methodological issues that might arise when anthropologists study health,
illness and healing. These could be general or specific to the ethnographic material used. It is important that these should include the
particular ethical issues raised by this area of inquiry and the ethnographic material studied. Questions you may wish to consider:

•

What ethical issues do anthropologists face when researching cases of illness?

•

How important is confidentiality when undertaking fieldwork into health and healing?

•

To what extent is reflexivity essential when dealing with indigenous systems of health and healing?

•

How can anthropologists exercise a balance of engagement and caution when interacting in potentially dangerous situations?

As with all areas of anthropological research, discussions on health, illness and healing have changed focus over the years and this is
reflected in and by changes in anthropological ways of thinking about health, illness and healing. In order to make sense of these
developments and how the concept of health, illness and healing has been explored by anthropologists in different social, cultural and
historical contexts, it is important for students to be able to make connections between theories and ethnographic material. The following
suggestions are an indication of some of the more prevalent theories likely to be represented in anthropological research on health, illness
and healing.

•

Feminist theories

•

Neo-Marxist theories

•

Structuralism

•

Symbolic theories

•

Any other relevant theories discussed in the ethnographic material explored

Differentiating between SL and HL
SL students are expected to be able to:

The following questions can be used as discussion points to make links between this area of inquiry and TOK. (This is not an exhaustive
list.)

•

To what extent can we know about what we cannot see?

•

Which ways of knowing might be applicable when understanding different ways of making sense of illness?

•

How are shamanic understandings of health and illness valued differently from biomedical ones?

•

How can we understand the efficacy of faith as a healing practice?

•

What assumptions about the body are implicit in biomedicine and how can they be contested?

•

How is western biomedicine different from, and the same as, an indigenous knowledge system?
