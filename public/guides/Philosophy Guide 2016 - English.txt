Introduction

The Diploma Programme

The Diploma Programme is a rigorous pre-university course of study designed for students in the 16 to 19
age range. It is a broad-based two-year course that aims to encourage students to be knowledgeable and
inquiring, but also caring and compassionate. There is a strong emphasis on encouraging students to
develop intercultural understanding, open-mindedness, and the attitudes necessary for them to respect
and evaluate a range of points of view.

The Diploma Programme model
The course is presented as six academic areas enclosing a central core (see figure 1). It encourages the
concurrent study of a broad range of academic areas. Students study: two modern languages (or a modern
language and a classical language), a humanities or social science subject, an experimental science,
mathematics and one of the creative arts. It is this comprehensive range of subjects that makes the Diploma
Programme a demanding course of study designed to prepare students effectively for university entrance.
In each of the academic areas students have flexibility in making their choices, which means they can
choose subjects that particularly interest them and that they may wish to study further at university.

The Diploma Programme

Choosing the right combination
Students are required to choose one subject from each of the six academic areas, although they
can choose a second subject from groups 1 to 5 instead of a group 6 subject. Normally, three subjects
(and not more than four) are taken at higher level (HL), and the others are taken at standard level (SL). The IB
recommends 240 teaching hours for HL subjects and 150 hours for SL. Subjects at HL are studied in greater
depth and breadth than at SL.
At both levels, many skills are developed, especially those of critical thinking and analysis. At the end of
the course, students’ abilities are measured by means of external assessment. Many subjects contain some
element of coursework assessed by teachers.

The core of the Diploma Programme model
All Diploma Programme students participate in the three course elements that make up the core of the
model. Reflection on all these activities is a principle that lies at the heart of the thinking behind the Diploma
Programme.
Theory of knowledge (TOK) is a course that is fundamentally about critical thinking and inquiry into the
process of knowing rather than about learning a specific body of knowledge. The TOK course examines the
nature of knowledge and how we know what we claim to know. It does this by encouraging students to
analyse knowledge claims and explore questions about the construction of knowledge. The task of TOK is to
emphasize connections between areas of shared knowledge and link them to personal knowledge in such
a way that an individual becomes more aware of his/her own perspectives and how they might differ from
others.
Creativity, action, service (CAS) is at the heart of the Diploma Programme. The emphasis in CAS is on helping
students to develop their own identities, in accordance with the ethical principles embodied in the IB
mission statement and the IB learner profile. It involves students in a range of activities alongside their
academic studies throughout the Diploma Programme. The three strands of CAS are creativity (arts, and
other experiences that involve creative thinking), action (physical exertion contributing to a healthy lifestyle)
and service (an unpaid and voluntary exchange that has a learning benefit for the student). Possibly, more
than any other component in the Diploma Programme, CAS contributes to the IB’s mission to create a better
and more peaceful world through intercultural understanding and respect.
The extended essay, including the world studies extended essay, offers the opportunity for IB students to
investigate a topic of special interest in the form of a 4,000-word piece of independent research. The area of
research undertaken is chosen from one of the students’ six Diploma Programme subjects or, in the case of
the interdisciplinary world studies essay, two subjects, and acquaints them with the independent research
and writing skills expected at university. This leads to a major piece of formally presented, structured
writing, in which ideas and findings are communicated in a reasoned and coherent manner, appropriate to
the subject or subjects chosen. It is intended to promote high-level research and writing skills, intellectual
discovery and creativity. An authentic learning experience, it provides students with an opportunity to
engage in personal research on a topic of their choice, under the guidance of a supervisor.

Approaches to teaching and approaches to learning
Approaches to teaching and learning across the Diploma Programme refers to deliberate strategies, skills and
attitudes that permeate the teaching and learning environment. These approaches and tools, intrinsically
linked with the learner profile attributes, enhance student learning and assist student preparation for the

Philosophy guide

The Diploma Programme

Diploma Programme assessment and beyond. The aims of approaches to teaching and learning in the
Diploma Programme are to:
•

empower teachers as teachers of learners as well as teachers of content

•

empower teachers to create clearer strategies for facilitating learning experiences in which students
are more meaningfully engaged in structured inquiry and greater critical and creative thinking

•

promote both the aims of individual subjects (making them more than course aspirations) and linking
previously isolated knowledge (concurrency of learning)

•

encourage students to develop an explicit variety of skills that will equip them to continue to be
actively engaged in learning after they leave school, and to help them not only obtain university
admission through better grades but also prepare for success during tertiary education and beyond

•

enhance further the coherence and relevance of the students’ DP experience

•

allow schools to identify the distinctive nature of an IB Diploma Programme education, with its blend
of idealism and practicality.

The five approaches to learning (developing thinking skills, social skills, communication skills, selfmanagement skills and research skills) along with the six approaches to teaching (teaching that is inquirybased, conceptually focused, contextualized, collaborative, differentiated and informed by assessment)
encompass the key values and principles that underpin IB pedagogy.

The IB mission statement and the IB learner profile
The Diploma Programme aims to develop in students the knowledge, skills and attitudes they will need
to fulfill the aims of the IB, as expressed in the organization’s mission statement and the learner profile.
Teaching and learning in the Diploma Programme represent the reality in daily practice of the organization’s
educational philosophy.

Academic honesty
Academic honesty in the Diploma Programme is a set of values and behaviours informed by the attributes
of the learner profile. In teaching, learning and assessment, academic honesty serves to promote personal
integrity, engender respect for the integrity of others and their work, and ensure that all students have an
equal opportunity to demonstrate the knowledge and skills they acquire during their studies.
All coursework—including work submitted for assessment—is to be authentic, based on the student’s
individual and original ideas with the ideas and work of others fully acknowledged. Assessment tasks that
require teachers to provide guidance to students or that require students to work collaboratively must be
completed in full compliance with the detailed guidelines provided by the IB for the relevant subjects.
For further information on academic honesty in the IB and the Diploma Programme, please consult the IB
publications Academic honesty, The Diploma Programme: From principles into practice and General regulations:
Diploma Programme. Specific information regarding academic honesty as it pertains to external and internal
assessment components of this Diploma Programme subject can be found in this guide.

The Diploma Programme

Acknowledging the ideas or work of another person
Coordinators and teachers are reminded that candidates must acknowledge all sources used in work
submitted for assessment. The following is intended as a clarification of this requirement.
Diploma Programme candidates submit work for assessment in a variety of media that may include audio/
visual material, text, graphs, images and/or data published in print or electronic sources. If a candidate uses
the work or ideas of another person, the candidate must acknowledge the source using a standard style of
referencing in a consistent manner. A candidate’s failure to acknowledge a source will be investigated by the
IB as a potential breach of regulations that may result in a penalty imposed by the IB final award committee.
The IB does not prescribe which style(s) of referencing or in-text citation should be used by candidates; this
is left to the discretion of appropriate faculty/staff in the candidate’s school. The wide range of subjects,
three response languages and the diversity of referencing styles make it impractical and restrictive to insist
on particular styles. In practice, certain styles may prove most commonly used, but schools are free to
choose a style that is appropriate for the subject concerned and the language in which candidates’ work is
written. Regardless of the reference style adopted by the school for a given subject, it is expected that the
minimum information given includes: name of author, date of publication, title of source, and page numbers
as applicable.
Candidates are expected to use a standard style and use it consistently so that credit is given to all sources
used, including sources that have been paraphrased or summarized. When writing text, a candidate must
clearly distinguish between their words and those of others by the use of quotation marks (or other method
such as indentation) followed by an appropriate citation that denotes an entry in the bibliography. If an
electronic source is cited, the date of access must be indicated. Candidates are not expected to show faultless
expertise in referencing, but are expected to demonstrate that all sources have been acknowledged.
Candidates must be advised that audio/visual material, text, graphs, images and/or data published in print
or in electronic sources that is not their own must also attribute the source. Again, an appropriate style of
referencing/citation must be used.

Learning diversity and learning support
requirements
Schools must ensure that equal access arrangements and reasonable adjustments are provided to
candidates with learning support requirements that are in line with the IB documents Candidates with
assessment access requirements and Learning diversity in the International Baccalaureate programmes: Special
educational needs within the International Baccalaureate programmes.

Introduction

Nature of the subject

Philosophy is a systematic critical inquiry into profound, fascinating and challenging questions, such as the
following.
•

What is it to be human?

•

Do we have free will?

•

What do we mean when we say something is right or wrong?

These abstract questions arise out of our everyday experiences, and philosophical tools such as critical and
systematic thinking, careful analysis, and construction of arguments provide the means of addressing such
questions. The practice of philosophy deepens and clarifies our understanding of these questions, as well as
our ability to formulate possible responses.
Studying philosophy provides an opportunity for students to engage with some of the world’s most
interesting and influential thinkers. It also develops highly transferable skills such as the ability to formulate
arguments clearly, to make reasoned judgments and to evaluate highly complex and multifaceted issues.
The emphasis of the Diploma Programme philosophy course is on “doing philosophy”, that is, on actively
engaging students in philosophical activity. The course is focused on stimulating students’ intellectual
curiosity and encouraging them to examine both their own perspectives and those of others.
Students are challenged to develop their own philosophical voice and to grow into independent thinkers.
They develop their skills through the study of philosophical themes and the close reading of a philosophical
text. They also learn to apply their philosophical knowledge and skills to real-life situations and to explore
how non-philosophical material can be treated in a philosophical way. HL students also engage in a deeper
exploration of the nature of philosophy itself.

Philosophy and international-mindedness
... an education for international-mindedness; an education designed to break
down the barriers of race, religion and class; an education that extolled the
benefits of cultural diversity; above all else, an education for peace.
(George Walker 2011: 19)
The DP philosophy course develops international-mindedness in students by encouraging them to engage
with multiple perspectives and to carefully consider alternative points of view. The course encourages
dialogue and debate, nurturing students’ capacity to interpret competing and contestable claims. In
addition to encouraging students to explore and draw upon a wide range of traditions and perspectives,
the course also provides an opportunity to engage in an examination of concepts and debates of global
significance. The flexibility of the DP philosophy course means that teachers have the opportunity to select
relevant examples themselves to explore with their students, ensuring that the course appropriately meets
their students’ needs and interests, whatever their location or cultural context.

Nature of the subject

Distinction between SL and HL
All SL and HL students follow a common core syllabus that encourages the development of certain skills,
attributes and attitudes as described in the “Assessment objectives” section of this guide. The common core
syllabus involves the study of the core theme, one optional theme and one prescribed text, as well as the
completion of the internal assessment exercise. In addition, students at HL must study one further optional
theme and the HL extension topic “Exploring philosophical activity”.
The difference in recommended teaching times at SL and HL signals a clear distinction between the demands
made on students. Students at HL are required to demonstrate their understanding of philosophy as an
activity by reflecting upon and evaluating the nature, function, methodology and purpose of philosophy.
This activity is assessed specifically in paper 3 taken only by HL students.

Philosophy and the Diploma Programme core
Philosophy and the extended essay
Undertaking an extended essay in philosophy provides students with an opportunity to undertake a
detailed philosophical investigation into a topic of special interest. The student is encouraged to engage
in serious, personal thought, to develop and explore in a disciplined and imaginative way a specific
philosophical question appropriate to the subject, and to arrive at a clear conclusion. The topic chosen
for a philosophy extended essay may be stimulated, for example, by work done in class, by current events,
by issues of contemporary debate, by discussion, by private reading and/or reflection, or by conceptual
features of belief systems not previously encountered by the student.
The treatment of the research question must focus on philosophical exploration and the construction of
an argument, which presupposes a careful, critical analysis of themes and/or texts. This approach, which
allows many different ways of philosophical reflection, is based on the emphasis of the Diploma Programme
philosophy course on doing philosophy. Within this context, the aim of a philosophical investigation is to
encourage students to develop the ability to reason and argue, and to learn to take an independent position
on philosophical issues. Philosophy provides rich scope for a wide variety of interesting extended essay
titles. Examples of suitable extended essays in philosophy include the following.
•

“An analysis of John Rawls’ procedure of justifying principles of social justice”

•

“The roots of wisdom according to the Tao Te Ching”

•

“An examination of the role played by reason in Anselm’s investigation of the concepts of
predestination and free will”

Detailed guidance on undertaking extended essays in philosophy can be found in the Extended essay guide.

Philosophy and creativity, action, service (CAS)
Studying philosophy provides excellent opportunities for students to make links to their CAS activities. One
of the aims of the DP philosophy course is to encourage students to examine critically their own experiences
and their ideological and cultural perspectives, and this includes their experiences in CAS. Ideas for effective
links that could be made between philosophy and CAS include the following.
•

Discussions of concepts such as moral responsibility, social justice, multiculturalism and tolerance
could link particularly well to students’ reflections on service activities undertaken as part of CAS.

•

Discussions of philosophical texts such as Peter Singer’s The Life You Can Save or Martha Nussbaum’s
Creating Capabilities: The Human Development Approach could provoke interesting discussions about
service activities undertaken as part of CAS.

•

Discussions about the nature of creativity as part of the aesthetics optional theme could link well to
activities undertaken for the creativity element of CAS.

Philosophy and theory of knowledge (TOK)
The TOK course (first exams 2015) engages students in reflection on the nature of knowledge and on how
we know what we claim to know. The course identifies eight ways of knowing: reason, emotion, language,
sense perception, intuition, imagination, faith and memory. Students explore these means of producing
knowledge within the context of various areas of knowledge: the natural sciences, the social sciences, the
arts, ethics, history, mathematics, religious knowledge systems and indigenous knowledge systems. The
course also requires students to make comparisons between the different areas of knowledge, reflecting
on how knowledge is arrived at in the various disciplines, what the disciplines have in common, and the
differences between them.
Philosophy allows us to explore and reflect on the nature and meaning of being human. By presenting an
opportunity to engage in these activities, the DP philosophy course shares many common concerns with
TOK. Like TOK, philosophy places a premium on the development of critical thinking skills, on encouraging
students to reflect on their own perspectives, and engaging with a diverse range of perspectives and
interpretations. However, TOK is not intended to be a course in philosophy, and care should be taken not to
turn the TOK course into an overly technical philosophical investigation into the nature of knowledge. While
there might be a degree of overlap in the terms used, the questions asked, or the tools applied to answer
these questions, the approach is quite different. The emphasis of the TOK course should be on applying
concepts to real-life situations that students encounter in their DP subjects and the real world. Throughout
this guide suggestions are made as to how effective links can be made between the philosophy and TOK
courses.

Prior learning
The philosophy course at both SL and HL requires no previous formal experience in philosophy, nor is
any particular background in terms of specific subjects studied for national or international qualifications
expected or required. The specific skills required to succeed in this course are developed within the teaching
of the course itself.

Links to the Middle Years Programme
Philosophy is sometimes offered explicitly as one of the disciplines within the individuals and societies
subject group of the IB Middle Years Programme (MYP). Regardless of which of the particular disciplines
from the subject group are offered, the fundamental concepts of MYP individuals and societies provide a
very useful foundation for students who go on to study the Diploma Programme philosophy course.
MYP individual and societies is a concept-driven curriculum aimed at helping the learner construct meaning
through improved critical thinking and the transfer of knowledge. At the top level are key concepts that
are broad, organizing, powerful ideas that have relevance within the DP philosophy course but also
transcend it, having relevance in other subject groups. These key concepts facilitate both disciplinary and
interdisciplinary learning as well as making connections with other subjects. Across the MYP there are 16 key
concepts, with the four in bold below being the focus for MYP individuals and societies.

Introduction

Approaches to the teaching and learning of
philosophy

Thinking skills

Being “thinkers” is explicitly identified as one of the learner profile attributes that all IB courses aim to
develop, and no course lends itself to developing students who are thinkers more than philosophy. In
addition to thinking skills such as problem-solving and lateral thinking, the DP philosophy course also aims
to encourage thinking dispositions and behaviours, such as intellectual curiosity. One central aim of the DP
philosophy course is for students to develop an inquiring and intellectually curious way of thinking, which
reflects the importance placed by many experts in thinking skills on related behaviours such as “curiosity,
flexibility, posing problems, decision making, being reasonable, creativity, risk taking, and other behaviours
that support critical and creative thought” (Costa, Kallick 2000).
An important aspect of teaching philosophy is creating an environment that encourages students’ critical
and creative thinking. One way to do this is through collaborative activities, as these can be a catalyst
to higher-order thinking. “Proponents of collaborative learning claim that the active exchange of ideas
within small groups not only increases interest among the participants but also promotes critical thinking”
(Gokhale 1995). Generating creative ideas, argumentation and problem-solving are examples of tasks where
collaboration can stimulate students’ thinking. Johnson and Johnson (1983) “found that when students
work cooperatively in groups, increased reasoning strategies and greater critical thinking competencies
result than in competitive or individualistic settings” (in Costa, Lowery 1989).

“Doing philosophy”
Socrates did not teach philosophy, he taught to philosophize.
(Daniel and Auriac 2011: 416)
The emphasis of the Diploma Programme philosophy course is on “doing philosophy”, that is, on engaging
students in philosophical activity and encouraging them to develop into independent thinkers. Clearly the
philosophy course is an opportunity to introduce students to some of the world’s most influential thinkers,
hence the inclusion of the study of a philosophical text as one component of the course. However, it is also
an opportunity for students to engage in philosophical activity themselves.
Leonard Nelson, the German philosopher, emphasized the importance of students engaging with
philosophy as an activity, commenting that effective philosophy teaching is “the art of teaching not
philosophy but philosophizing, the art not of teaching about philosophers but of making philosophers
of the students” (Nelson 1949). Each area of the course provides students with an opportunity to explore
different philosophical concepts and issues, and having a single underlying focus on “doing philosophy”
helps to give the course unity and coherence across these different elements.

Philosophy guide

Approaches to the teaching and learning of philosophy

Engaging with philosophical texts
The DP philosophy course emphasizes the importance of students engaging with a primary philosophical
text through the study of one work from the list provided in this guide. Teachers should select only one text
from this list to study with their students, who will be expected to demonstrate a detailed knowledge and
understanding of its content in the examination. Extracts from other texts, both primary and secondary,
can also be an extremely useful teaching resource. Using short extracts from texts in class is a particularly
effective way to expose students to philosophical writing prior to the introduction of the study of an entire
text. More guidance on using extracts from philosophical texts in lessons can be found in the Philosophy
teacher support material (March 2014).

Engaging with diverse perspectives
Engaging students with a variety of philosophical perspectives is an essential aspect of enabling them
to appreciate the diversity of approaches within philosophical thinking. This engagement with diverse
perspectives could be achieved in a variety of ways, for example, by using examples from more than one
historical period or more than one philosophical tradition, or by using examples from a variety of cultural
or geographic contexts. Suggested ways to engage students with a diverse range of perspectives can
be found in the introductory sections of each part of the syllabus content in this guide, as well as in the
suggested examples and discussion questions. More detailed support and guidance can also be found in
the Philosophy teacher support material.

Engaging with sensitive and controversial topics
Studying philosophy provides the opportunity for students to engage with exciting, stimulating and
personally relevant issues. However, it should be noted that often such topics can also be personally
challenging for students; for example, discussions of concepts such as life after death or ethical issues
such as abortion can be sensitive or invoke strong personal feelings in students. Teachers should provide
guidance to students on how to approach and engage with such topics in a sensitive and responsible
manner.

Syllabus

Syllabus content

Core theme: Being human
This compulsory theme explores the fundamental question of what it is to be human. This exploration takes
place through a discussion of key concepts such as identity, freedom, and human nature, and through a
consideration of questions such as what sets humans apart from other species, where the boundaries of
being human lie, and whether animals or machines could be considered persons.
One of the reasons we study philosophy is to search for a better understanding of ourselves, both as
individuals and as members of our communities, and this search is at the heart of this element of the course.
The core theme also provides an opportunity for students to engage with interpretations of the human
condition from diverse world perspectives. For example, discussions of the concept of the self could include
a wide range of examples from the Buddhist notion of anattā or “not-self” to Simone de Beauvoir’s rejection
of the concept of a solipsistic isolated self (De Beauvoir 1965).
The core theme is focused around six key concepts, represented in the diagram below.

Identity
Human
nature

Personhood

Being
human
The self
and the

Freedom

Figure 2
Each of these concepts creates a number of potential discussion questions, such as the following.
•

What does it mean to be human?

•

Is there such a thing as the self?

•

Can we really ever know the other?

•

Is how we interact with others what makes us human?

•

Has what it means to be human been changed/shaped by technologies such as the internet?

•

What can discoveries in neuroscience tell us about what it is to be human?

The core theme allows flexibility for teachers to explore topics of particular interest, such as the relationship
between gender and identity, or topical news stories on advances in robotics. There is opportunity for
teachers to explore a wide range of topics and to bring in stimulating examples. The table below provides

Optional theme 1: Aesthetics
Aesthetics is an area of philosophy that focuses on the nature of art, on the relations between art and
society, and on concepts such as beauty and taste. It allows students to explore philosophical questions
such as the following.
•

What is art?

•

What is an artist?

•

Are we all born artists?

•

Do all works of art arise from the same artistic impulse?

•

Can we identify works of art outside what a given society calls art?

•

Should art have any religious, moral or political message?

•

How do we define what is beautiful and what is ugly?

•

Why should we be concerned with works of art when they might not seem to have utility?

This theme covers art in all its different forms, for example, music, painting, sculpture, literature,
photography, film and drama. It provides an opportunity for reflection on everything from the very nature
of a work of art to the relations between art and society. The first topic explores the nature of art and the
relationship between art and creativity. Wollheim described the nature of art as “one of the most elusive of
the traditional problems of human culture” (1980). The second topic focuses on the artist and the artistic
process, while the third topic explores aesthetic experience and judgment. These topics provide the
opportunity to discuss positions such as Kant’s claim that an aesthetic experience of beauty is something
that all people should agree on if the object is indeed beautiful (Kant [1790] 2008).
This theme also incorporates a variety of diverse perspectives. For example, the concern in much ancient
Greek philosophy with beauty, harmony and unity could be contrasted with the emphasis in some Indian
traditions on the concepts of rasa (the emotional theme of a work of art) and sahrdaya (the sensitive
spectator). Exploring the relationship between art and society also presents an excellent opportunity to
look at non-representational art in Islamic cultures.

Links to the core theme
This optional theme provides a great deal of scope for making connections to the core theme. For
example, discussions could focus on the extent to which art is a reflection of the human condition
or whether art is something that differentiates humans from non-human animals. This theme
also allows for discussion of how the arts can contribute to our view of self and to our identity, or
whether art is always the product of human activity.

Links to TOK
This theme also links well with TOK, and in particular with discussions of the arts as an area of
knowledge. Discussions could explore TOK questions such as how the subjective viewpoint of an
individual can contribute to knowledge in the arts, or whether the arts have a social function as a
medium for social criticism.

Optional theme 2: Epistemology
Epistemology is the area of philosophy concerned with the study of the nature, origin, scope and limits of
human knowledge. This theme allows students to explore such questions as the following.
•

Can I know anything at all?

•

What role does experience and reason play in the acquisition of knowledge?

•

What is the relationship between knowledge and certainty?

•

Is certainty possible or is all knowledge relative?

•

Is knowledge culturally dependent?

•

How important is the continuous development of knowledge for the advancement of humanity?

•

What are the sources of knowledge?

•

What are the limits of knowledge?

The first topic of this theme explores the nature and sources of knowledge while the second focuses on
the limits and problems of knowledge. In addition to an introduction to classical debates in epistemology,
these topics provide an opportunity to study more recent approaches in epistemology such as reliabilism
and contextualism. The third topic examines the application of knowledge in society, bringing up questions
about access to knowledge, and the relationship between knowledge, control and power. It also explores
the connection between knowledge and technology.
While this theme draws generally on an approach where rationalism and empiricism have played a leading
role, there is also an opportunity to explore a variety of different perspectives. For example, discussions
over access to knowledge could provide an opportunity to explore feminist epistemology, or discussions
of justification could explore the focus on the source of beliefs in much Indian Grammarian philosophy.
Alternatively, discussions of the concept of truth could contrast the Chinese understanding of truth as a way
of life and self-realization with the Western understanding of truth as a relationship between language and
reality.

Links to the core theme
Links between this optional theme and the core theme could be made, for example, through
discussions of the idea of self-knowledge and whether the way we gain knowledge of our
own beliefs and desires is different to the way we gain knowledge of the external world. These
discussions of whether the self has privileged access to its own thoughts could link extremely well
to discussions of the concept of the self in the core theme.

Links to TOK
This theme has obvious links to TOK, although care should be taken to ensure that the TOK course
does not turn into an epistemology course where the primary focus is a technical investigation of
the nature of knowledge. Useful links to TOK could focus on questions of how we gain knowledge
of the external world, how we can know if our senses are reliable, or whether we need prior
concepts before perception can take place.

Optional theme 3: Ethics
Ethics is an area of philosophy that explores the possible grounds for making moral decisions and examines
concepts such as freedom, values, responsibility and virtue. This theme allows students to explore questions
such as the following.
•

Are there fundamental moral principles that apply in every situation?

•

How do we decide if a particular action is right or wrong?

•

How should we treat people?

•

Are moral decisions culturally influenced?

•

What do we mean when we say something is right or wrong?

The first topic for study focuses on normative ethics, exploring moral theories and how we make ethical
decisions. It also reflects on moral principles themselves, and debates such as whether moral principles
are universal or relative. The second topic for study focuses on meta-ethics, on the origins and nature of
moral values and foundations for moral judgment. It also explores debates surrounding ethical language,
including the significance of calling something right or wrong. The third topic for study focuses on applied
ethics, exploring approaches to a variety of important issues, many of which are of international concern.
This theme deals with ethical questions from a variety of perspectives. For example, discussions of the
concept of duty could contrast the Kantian approach to duty with the Buddhist concept of dharma.
Discussions of virtue could compare ancient Greek virtue theorists such as Aristotle with the emphasis on
virtue and character found in Buddhist texts such as the Digha Nikaya (Rhys Davids 2007).

Links to the core theme
Links between this optional theme and the core theme can be made by exploring questions such as
whether moral behaviour is found only in human beings, or whether human beings are inherently
selfish or altruistic. Applied ethical issues such as abortion and cloning also raise interesting questions
over when human life begins and over definitions of personhood.

Links to TOK
This theme links very clearly to explorations of ethics as an area of knowledge in TOK. There is
potential for discussions of the role of emotion, intuition and reason in ethical decision-making.
There is also potential for interesting discussions of language in ethics and, in particular, the nature
of non-literal language such as ethical language.

Optional theme 4: Philosophy and contemporary society
This theme provides an opportunity for students to explore some of the most pressing issues facing society
in the 21st century. It invites philosophical discussion of questions such as the following.
•

Why is culture so hard to define?

•

Are cultures distinct or are they always overlapping and interacting?

•

Is censorship of information justifiable?

•

What is the impact of technology on society?

•

Is technology a tool used by society, or does technology shape society?

It is important to note that the questions raised by this theme should be explored in an explicitly
philosophical, rather than sociological or anthropological, way.
The first topic for study is multiculturalism. This topic provides a space for discussions of cultural and
religious diversity in contemporary society, as well as questions about whether tolerance of different groups
in society is the same as seeing everyone as equal citizens. The second topic is liberty and rights, allowing
for the exploration of issues such as censorship. The third topic is technology and media, which explores the
role that technology plays in contemporary society, focusing particularly on the extent to which technology
is a tool used by society, or something that shapes society. It also explores the impact of the media on
contemporary life.
This theme lends itself to a wide variety of perspectives. For example, the treatment of marginalized groups
in society can raise questions about the significance of gender in contemporary society, or controversies
about affirmative action. Discussions of the treatment of marginalized groups in society could also lead
particularly well into more general discussions about the dominance of particular paradigms or cultures and
the marginalization of particular perspectives.

Links to the core theme
This theme provides scope for interesting links to the core theme, particularly in relation to culture
and identity. For example, discussions of the treatment of minority or marginalized groups in
society would provide an excellent opportunity for discussions of cultural identity. Links could
also, for example, be made between the concept of liberty and the concept of freedom in the core
theme, or through discussions of the impact of technologies such as social networking on identity,
for example, Dreyfus’ claim that the internet “frees people to develop new and exciting selves”
(2004).

Links to TOK
This theme also links to TOK, particularly in terms of culture and shared knowledge. There is scope
to explore whether it is possible to have knowledge of a culture or a society in which we have
not been raised, and whether there exists a neutral position from which we can make judgments
about competing claims from groups with different traditions and different interests.

Optional theme 5: Philosophy of religion
Philosophy of religion focuses on some of the central concepts in religious traditions, raising fundamental
questions about the nature of our existence. This optional theme explores philosophical questions about the
nature and existence of God, the nature of religious language, and different aspects of religious experience
and behaviour. It explores questions such as the following.
•

Can God be defined?

•

Can we prove the existence of a higher being through reasoning or experience?

•

What is the nature and scope of religious language?

•

Is spirituality possible without religion or belief in a higher being?

•

Could religion be seen as a purely social phenomenon?

The first topic focuses on exploring the nature and existence of God, allowing for discussion of different
beliefs about God, and different versions of theism such as monotheism and polytheism. It also looks
at some of the attributes ascribed to God in different traditions, such as the traditional Judeo-Christian
concept of God as omniscient and omnipotent. This topic also focuses on the question of whether we have
reason to think that God does or does not exist, exploring some of the main arguments for and against the
existence of God.
The second topic examines religious language and whether it is possible to talk about the infinite and
divine in language used to talk about the finite and the human. The third topic explores different types of
religious experience and behaviour such as meditation, prayer and near-death experiences. It also examines
controversies over claims to have experienced the divine, providing the potential for interesting links to
psychology and neuroscience.
This theme encourages engagement with a wide variety of different philosophical perspectives. For
example, discussions on the nature of religious language could explore the way that religious language is
used symbolically and metaphorically in the Sikh text the Guru Granth Sahib, or the suggestion that God can
only be talked about in terms of what he is not by exploring Maimonides’ writing on the Via Negativa in his
Guide for the Perplexed (1995).

Links to the core theme
This optional theme provides opportunities for links to the core theme by exploring questions
such as whether religion can give meaning to human life or provide insight into what it is to be
human. It also allows for discussions of the contribution of religion to an understanding of the self
and the role of community in being human, for example, through discussion of the centrality of the
concept of Ummah in Islam.

Links to TOK
There are also links to TOK regarding faith as a way of knowing, including questions such as the
relationship between faith and reason, and whether faith is essentially irrational. This theme also
raises TOK questions about whether it is possible to know God, whether it is possible to use human
language to describe the divine and how we decide between the competing claims of different
systems of religious knowledge.

Optional theme 6: Philosophy of science
Philosophy of science focuses on exploring the assumptions, methods and implications of science. This
theme provides an opportunity to explore questions such as the following.
•

What differentiates science from pseudoscience or non-science?

•

Does science aim at truth?

•

What is the central feature of science?

•

Are all elements of the universe, including human action, ultimately determined?

•

Should scientists be held morally responsible for the uses of their inventions?

The first topic focuses on exploring the nature and methodologies of science. It includes a study of the
differences between science and non-science, something Popper identified as the central question for
philosophy of science (Popper [1934] 2002). The second topic focuses on science and the self, allowing
opportunity for exploration of the more metaphysical elements of the philosophy of science as well as
opportunity to make connections to the core theme. The third topic focuses on the relationship between
science and society, discussing issues such as the moral responsibilities of scientists.
This theme provides numerous opportunities to explore topics from a variety of perspectives, for example,
discussions of the relationship between science and society could explore questions about the effect that
male dominance of the scientific profession has had on scientific knowledge and practice. This optional
theme also provides an excellent opportunity to study influential Islamic philosophers of science such as
Ibn Al-Haytham or the biologist Al-Jahiz. (See, for example, Jim Al-Khalili’s 2010 text Pathfinders: The Golden
Age of Arabic Science.)

Links to the core theme
Links between this optional theme and the core theme could be made, for example, in discussions
of the view of ourselves as being purely material entities who behave entirely according to natural
laws. The topic “cognitive science and the concept of the self” also presents particularly rich
opportunities for links to be made to the exploration of the concept of self in the core theme.

Links to TOK
Links between this optional theme and TOK could be made, for example, through discussion of
the role of imagination and intuition in the natural sciences. Students could discuss, for example,
Feyerabend’s claim that no description of the scientific method could be broad enough to
encompass all the approaches and methods used by scientists, and that imposing prescriptive
scientific method would stifle creativity ([1975] 2010). Discussion of the role of observation in the
sciences could also link to TOK discussions of whether observation involves both perception and
cognition, or debates about the objectivity of observations.

Optional theme 7: Political philosophy
Political philosophy is an area of philosophy that focuses on the study of people in societies, the claims
people have on each other in the form of rights and obligations, and their demands for justice, equality and
liberty. Political philosophy is also concerned with an analysis of the state and its institutions. This theme
provides an opportunity for students to explore questions such as the following.
•

Under which conditions can political obligation arise and what is its extent?

•

Are freedom and equality compatible?

•

Can justice be an ideal as well as a process?

•

How are laws justified and are there aspects of human life that laws should not attempt to regulate?

•

Are human rights inalienable and universal?

The first topic for study deals with civil society, the state and government. It focuses on concepts such as
sovereignty, authority and power, as well as different forms of government. The second topic focuses on
justice, including the relationship between justice and fairness, and the distinction between retributive and
distributive justice. The third topic focuses on rights, including the distinction between human rights and
legal rights, and the relationship between rights, duties and responsibilities.
This optional theme provides an opportunity to engage with diverse perspectives by exploring questions
such as whether the Universal Declaration of Human Rights has a Western bias. Students could discuss
examples or short extracts of text from a diverse array of political philosophers from different traditions, for
example, ranging from Confucius in the 5th century BC, to Ibn Khaldun in the 14th century, to 20th century
classics such as John Rawls’ Theory of Justice (1971).

Links to the core theme
This theme provides excellent opportunities to make links to the core theme, in particular to the
concept of freedom and questions such as whether there are aspects of human life that laws
should not attempt to regulate. The topic on rights also raises interesting issues over the potential
similarities and differences in the rights accorded to humans and to non-human animals.

Links to TOK
There are many opportunities to make interesting links between this optional theme and TOK, for
example, discussions of whether there is an objective standard for justice could link well to wider
TOK discussions about subjectivity and objectivity. Similarly, discussions of fairness could explore
students’ intuitions about what is fair and the wider role of intuition as a way of knowing.

Prescribed texts
This element of the course provides an opportunity for students to gain an in-depth knowledge and
understanding of a primary philosophical text. This is a challenging but rewarding part of the course,
providing an opportunity for the student as a philosopher to engage in dialogue with another philosopher.
Students at both HL and SL are required to study one text from the list of prescribed philosophical texts,
found below. The study of the text should focus on the text itself, not on a commentary on the text. It is
strongly advised that the study take place in class with the support and direction of the teacher. The texts
should be studied in their entirety, except in the case of Plato and De Beauvoir where the lengths of the
texts concerned has meant that particular sections of the texts have been specified for study.
Teachers should select only one text from the list below to study in full with their class. However, teachers
are also encouraged to use extracts from other philosophical texts to support their teaching of the other
elements of the course. More guidance on the effective use of philosophical texts can be found in the
Philosophy teacher support material.

HL extension: Exploring philosophical activity
This element of the course is an opportunity for HL students to engage in a deeper exploration of the nature,
function, meaning and methodology of philosophy. This allows them to deepen their understanding of
philosophy as an activity by providing a space in the course for critical examination of philosophy itself, and
its methods. It is also an opportunity for students to reflect on their own experience of “doing philosophy”.

Figure 3
This aspect of the course focuses on the fundamental question of what philosophy is and how we do it.
Discussions of the nature, function, meaning and methodology of philosophy can be introduced by asking
students to reflect on their own experiences of philosophical activity in other areas of the course. For
example:
•

when studying the core theme, a student could contrast the contribution of philosophical activity to
the debate about the human condition with that of science or religion

•

when studying a prescribed text, the student could consider how a philosopher formulates, poses and
writes about philosophical problems, or responds to the work of other philosophers

•

when discussing an extract from a philosophical text, the student might explore why certain
philosophers choose to write in dialogue form, prose, fiction, monologue, poetry, aphorism and so on.

The HL extension is an opportunity for students to deepen their understanding of philosophy as an activity.
This can be done in a number of ways, but examples of good discussion questions/topics include the
following.
Nature

Function

Meaning

Methodology

•

Why might some people define philosophy as a discipline that is centred on
dealing with questions?

•

Is philosophy more a skill than a body of information?

•

Why is it that philosophy once included areas of knowledge that are now distinct
(for example, natural philosophy is now physics)?

•

Why are there so many diverse views on the meaning and methods of philosophy?

•

What should the goal of philosophy be?

•

Does philosophical activity involve more than abstract thinking? Why might so
much Indian philosophy emphasize the association of philosophy with practice
(Sadhana)?

•

What sort of knowledge can philosophy yield?

•

Should philosophy be regarded as a discipline in its own right, or does philosophy
simply try to analyse the foundations and assumptions of other disciplines? Do
you think that philosophy constitutes the total system of human knowledge?

•

Is the main purpose of philosophy to enable us to evaluate critically our own
beliefs and attitudes?

•

Can philosophical activity inform our understanding of who we are and our place
in the world?

•

Is philosophy an exchange of ideas?

•

Why did Camus claim that the only real philosophical problem is suicide? (Camus 1995)

•

Does philosophy have a primarily social function?

•

Does philosophy bring order and/or beauty to our thoughts?

•

What is the relationship between philosophy and religion? Why do some thinkers
maintain that philosophy is ultimately concerned with the cognition of God?

•

Is conceptual analysis the primary methodology of philosophy?

•

Why is the production of rational and cogent arguments so central to philosophy?

•

Can philosophy be done in isolation?

•

How important is awareness of past and current responses when exploring
philosophical questions?

•

How relevant are the findings of other disciplines to philosophical discussions?

This element of the course provides excellent opportunities for making links to TOK, particularly to the
methodology element of the knowledge framework used to compare areas of knowledge in the TOK course.
Reflecting on the scope and methods of philosophy should provide opportunities to compare and contrast
with the scope and methods of other disciplines, helping students to gain a deeper understanding of the
different scope and methods of different areas of knowledge.
The assessment of the HL extension element presents students with a previously unseen philosophical
text. Students are asked to write a response to this text in which they compare and contrast the view of
philosophical activity presented in the unseen text with their own experiences of philosophical activity.
More guidance on preparing students for this component (including assessment samples, sample lesson
plans, suggestions of appropriate texts, and guidance on how to write a paper 3 essay) can be found in the
Philosophy teacher support material.

Assessment

Assessment in the Diploma Programme

General
Assessment is an integral part of teaching and learning. The most important aims of assessment in the
Diploma Programme are that it should support curricular goals and encourage appropriate student
learning. Both external and internal assessments are used in the Diploma Programme. IB examiners mark
work produced for external assessment, while work produced for internal assessment is marked by teachers
and externally moderated by the IB.
There are two types of assessment identified by the IB.
•

Formative assessment informs both teaching and learning. It is concerned with providing accurate
and helpful feedback to students and teachers on the kind of learning taking place and the nature of
students’ strengths and weaknesses in order to help develop students’ understanding and capabilities.
Formative assessment can also help to improve teaching quality, as it can provide information to
monitor progress towards meeting the course aims and objectives.

•

Summative assessment gives an overview of previous learning and is concerned with measuring
student achievement.

The Diploma Programme primarily focuses on summative assessment designed to record student
achievement at, or towards the end of, the course of study. However, many of the assessment instruments
can also be used formatively during the course of teaching and learning, and teachers are encouraged to
do this. A comprehensive assessment plan is viewed as being integral with teaching, learning and course
organization. For further information, see the IB Programme standards and practices document.
The approach to assessment used by the IB is criterion-related, not norm-referenced. This approach to
assessment judges students’ work by their performance in relation to identified levels of attainment, and
not in relation to the work of other students. For further information on assessment within the Diploma
Programme, please refer to the publication Diploma Programme assessment: Principles and practice.
To support teachers in the planning, delivery and assessment of the Diploma Programme courses, a variety
of resources can be found on the OCC or purchased from the IB store (http://store.ibo.org). Additional
publications such as specimen papers and markschemes, teacher support materials, subject reports and
grade descriptors can also be found on the OCC. Past examination papers as well as markschemes can be
purchased from the IB store.

Methods of assessment
The IB uses several methods to assess work produced by students.

Assessment criteria
Assessment criteria are used when the assessment task is open-ended. Each criterion concentrates on
a particular skill that students are expected to demonstrate. An assessment objective describes what
students should be able to do, and assessment criteria describe how well they should be able to do it. Using
assessment criteria allows discrimination between different answers and encourages a variety of responses.

Philosophy guide

35

Assessment in the Diploma Programme

Each criterion comprises a set of hierarchically ordered level descriptors. Each level descriptor is worth one
or more marks. Each criterion is applied independently using a best-fit model. The maximum marks for each
criterion may differ according to the criterion’s importance. The marks awarded for each criterion are added
together to give the total mark for the piece of work.

Markbands
Markbands are a comprehensive statement of expected performance against which responses are judged.
They represent a single holistic criterion divided into level descriptors. Each level descriptor corresponds
to a range of marks to differentiate student performance. A best-fit approach is used to ascertain which
particular mark to use from the possible range for each level descriptor.

Markschemes
This generic term is used to describe markschemes that are prepared for specific examination papers.
Analytic markschemes are prepared for those examination questions that expect a particular kind of
response and/or a given final answer from the students. They give detailed instructions to examiners on
how to break down the total mark for each question for different parts of the response. A markscheme
may include the content expected in the responses to questions or may be a series of marking notes giving
guidance on how to apply criteria.

Inclusive assessment arrangements
Inclusive assessment arrangements are provided for candidates with assessment access requirements.
These arrangements enable candidates with diverse needs to access the examinations and demonstrate
their knowledge and understanding of the constructs being assessed.
The IB document Candidates with assessment access requirements provides details on all the inclusive
assessment arrangements available to candidates with learning support requirements. The IB document
Learning diversity in the International Baccalaureate programmes: Special educational needs within the
International Baccalaureate programmes outlines the position of the IB with regard to candidates with diverse
learning needs in the IB programmes. For candidates affected by adverse circumstances, the IB documents
General regulations: Diploma Programme and the Handbook of procedures for the Diploma Programme provide
details on access consideration.

Responsibilities of the school
The school is required to ensure that equal access arrangements and reasonable adjustments are provided
to candidates with learning support requirements that are in line with the IB documents Candidates with
assessment access requirements and Learning diversity in the International Baccalaureate programmes: Special
educational needs within the International Baccalaureate programmes.

Assessment

Internal assessment

Purpose of internal assessment
Internal assessment is an integral part of the course and is compulsory for both SL and HL students. It
enables students to demonstrate the application of their skills and knowledge, and to pursue their personal
interests, without the time limitations and other constraints associated with written examinations. The
internal assessment should, as far as possible, be woven into normal classroom teaching and not be a
separate activity conducted after a course has been taught.
The internal assessment requirements at SL and at HL are the same.

Requirements and recommendations
The internal assessment exercise for students at both SL and HL requires them to produce a philosophical
analysis of a non-philosophical stimulus. The exercise is worth 25 marks and the word limit is 2,000 words,
excluding bibliography or references. The word limit also does not include the copy/description of the
stimulus, which must be included with the response.

Guidance and authenticity
The philosophical analysis submitted for internal assessment must be the student’s own work. However,
it is not the intention that students should decide upon a title or topic and be left to work on the internal
assessment component without any further support from the teacher. The teacher should play an important
role during both the planning stage and the period when the student is working on the internally assessed
work. It is the responsibility of the teacher to ensure that students are familiar with:
•

the requirements of the type of work to be internally assessed

•

the assessment criteria; students must understand that the work submitted for assessment must
address these criteria effectively.

Teachers and students must discuss the internally assessed work. Students should be encouraged to initiate
discussions with the teacher to obtain advice and information, and students must not be penalized for
seeking guidance. As part of the learning process, teachers can read and give advice to students on one
draft of the work. The teacher should provide oral or written advice on how the work could be improved,
but must not write comments on the draft work or edit it. The next version handed to the teacher must be
the final version for submission.
It is the responsibility of teachers to ensure that all students understand the basic meaning and significance
of concepts that relate to academic honesty, especially authenticity and intellectual property. Teachers
must ensure that all student work for assessment is prepared according to the requirements and must
explain clearly to students that the internally assessed work must be entirely their own. Where collaboration

Internal assessment

between students is permitted, it must be clear to all students what the difference is between collaboration
and collusion.
All work submitted to the IB for moderation or assessment must be authenticated by a teacher, and must
not include any known instances of suspected or confirmed malpractice. Each student must confirm that
the work is his or her authentic work and constitutes the final version of that work. Once a student has
officially submitted the final version of the work to the teacher it cannot be retracted. The requirement to
confirm the authenticity of the work applies to all students, not just the sample work that will be submitted
to the IB for the purpose of moderation. For further details refer to the IB publications Academic honesty, The
Diploma Programme: From principles into practice and the relevant articles in General regulations: Diploma
Programme.
Authenticity may be checked by discussion with the student on the content of the work, and scrutiny of one
or more of the following.
•

The student’s initial proposal

•

The first draft of the written work

•

The references cited

•

The style of writing compared with work known to be that of the student

•

The analysis of the work by a web-based plagiarism detection service such as www.turnitin.com

The same piece of work cannot be submitted to meet the requirements of both the internal assessment and
the extended essay.

Group work
Group work may not be undertaken by students.

Time allocation
Internal assessment is an integral part of the philosophy course, contributing 25% to the final assessment in
the SL course and 20% to the final assessment in the HL course. This weighting should be reflected in the
time that is allocated to teaching the knowledge, skills and understanding required to undertake the work,
as well as the total time allocated to carry out the work.
It is recommended that a total of approximately 20 hours (SL and HL) should be allocated to the work. This
should include:
•

time for the teacher to explain to students the requirements of the internal assessment

•

class time for students to work on the internal assessment component

•

time for consultation between the teacher and each student

•

time to review and monitor progress, and to check authenticity.

Internal assessment

Using assessment criteria for internal assessment
For internal assessment, a number of assessment criteria have been identified. Each assessment criterion has
level descriptors describing specific achievement levels, together with an appropriate range of marks. The
level descriptors concentrate on positive achievement, although for the lower levels failure to achieve may
be included in the description.
Teachers must judge the internally assessed work at SL and at HL against the criteria using the level
descriptors.
•

The same assessment criteria are provided for SL and HL.

•

The aim is to find, for each criterion, the descriptor that conveys most accurately the level attained
by the student, using the best-fit model. A best-fit approach means that compensation should be
made when a piece of work matches different aspects of a criterion at different levels. The mark
awarded should be one that most fairly reflects the balance of achievement against the criterion. It is
not necessary for every single aspect of a level descriptor to be met for that mark to be awarded.

•

When assessing a student’s work, teachers should read the level descriptors for each criterion until
they reach a descriptor that most appropriately describes the level of the work being assessed. If a
piece of work seems to fall between two descriptors, both descriptors should be read again and the
one that more appropriately describes the student’s work should be chosen.

•

Where there are two or more marks available within a level, teachers should award the upper marks
if the student’s work demonstrates the qualities described to a great extent; the work may be close
to achieving marks in the level above. Teachers should award the lower marks if the student’s work
demonstrates the qualities described to a lesser extent; the work may be close to achieving marks in
the level below.

•

Only whole numbers should be recorded; partial marks (fractions and decimals) are not acceptable.

•

Teachers should not think in terms of a pass or fail boundary, but should concentrate on identifying
the appropriate descriptor for each assessment criterion.

•

The highest level descriptors do not imply faultless performance but should be achievable by a
student. Teachers should not hesitate to use the extremes if they are appropriate descriptions of the
work being assessed.

•

A student who attains a high achievement level with one criterion will not necessarily attain high
achievement levels in the other criteria. Similarly, a student who attains a low achievement level for
one criterion will not necessarily attain low achievement levels for the other criteria. Teachers should
not assume that the overall assessment of the students will produce any particular distribution of
marks.

•

It is recommended that the assessment criteria be made available to students.

Internal assessment details—SL and HL
Philosophical analysis of a non-philosophical stimulus
Duration: 20 hours
Weighting: SL 25%, HL 20%
Students at both SL and HL must produce a philosophical analysis of a non-philosophical stimulus. Students
should identify a philosophical issue raised by the stimulus and analyse it in a philosophical way.
Suitable stimuli for analysis include, but are not limited to:
•

novels, plays, or poems

•

song lyrics

•

cartoons, paintings, photographs or other visual images

•

films, television and radio programmes

•

advertisements

•

newspaper articles/letters

•

pamphlets.

Students should select a non-philosophical stimulus. Short stimuli such as newspaper articles can be
analysed in their entirety, but where novels or plays are used, no more than two pages should be selected
for analysis. In the case of television or radio programmes, no more than two scenes should be selected for
analysis.
When the source material is an image or contains 200 words or fewer, students must include a copy of this
material with their response. When the source material contains more than 200 words or is, for example, a
scene from a film, students must include a description of the stimulus with their response. Descriptions of
stimuli must be no more than 200 words. All stimulus material must be accurately referenced.
