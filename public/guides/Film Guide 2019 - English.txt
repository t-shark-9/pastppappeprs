The Diploma Programme
The Diploma Programme is a rigorous pre-university course of study designed for students in the 16 to 19
age range. It is a broad-based two-year course that aims to encourage students to be knowledgeable and
inquiring, but also caring and compassionate. There is a strong emphasis on encouraging students to develop
intercultural understanding, open-mindedness and the attitudes necessary for them to respect and evaluate
a range of points of view.

The Diploma Programme model
The course is presented as six academic areas enclosing a central core (see figure 1). It encourages the
concurrent study of a broad range of academic areas. Students study two modern languages (or a modern
language and a classical language), a humanities or social science subject, an experimental science,
mathematics and one of the creative arts. It is this comprehensive range of subjects that makes the Diploma
Programme a demanding course of study designed to prepare students effectively for university entrance. In
each of the academic areas, students have flexibility in making their choices, which means they can choose
subjects that particularly interest them and that they may wish to study further at university.

Figure 1
Diploma Programme model

Choosing the right combination
Students are required to choose one subject from each of the six academic areas, although they can, instead
of an arts subject, choose two subjects from another area. Normally, three subjects (and not more than four)
are taken at higher level (HL), and the others are taken at standard level (SL). The IB recommends
240 teaching hours for HL subjects and 150 hours for SL. Subjects at HL are studied in greater depth and
breadth than at SL.

Film guide

2 / 75

At both levels, many skills are developed, especially those of critical thinking and analysis. At the end of the
course, students’ abilities are measured by means of external assessment. Many subjects contain some
element of coursework assessed by teachers.

The core of the Diploma Programme model
All Diploma Programme students participate in the three course elements that make up the core of the model.
Theory of knowledge (TOK) is a course that is fundamentally about critical thinking and inquiry into the
process of knowing rather than about learning a specific body of knowledge. The TOK course examines the
nature of knowledge and how we know what we claim to know. It does this by encouraging students to
analyse knowledge claims and explore questions about the construction of knowledge. The task of TOK is
to emphasize connections between areas of shared knowledge and link them to personal knowledge in such
a way that an individual becomes more aware of his or her own perspectives and how they might differ from
others’.
Creativity, activity, service (CAS) is at the heart of the Diploma Programme. The emphasis in CAS is on
helping students to develop their own identities, in accordance with the ethical principles embodied in the IB
mission statement and the IB learner profile. It involves students in a range of activities alongside their
academic studies throughout the Diploma Programme. The three strands of CAS are creativity (arts and
other experiences that involve creative thinking), activity (physical exertion contributing to a healthy lifestyle)
and service (an unpaid and voluntary exchange that has a learning benefit for the student). Possibly, more
than any other component in the Diploma Programme, CAS contributes to the IB’s mission to create a better
and more peaceful world through intercultural understanding and respect.
The extended essay, including the world studies extended essay, offers the opportunity for IB students to
investigate a topic of special interest, in the form of a 4,000-word piece of independent research. The area
of research undertaken is chosen from one of the students’ six Diploma Programme subjects or, in the case
of the interdisciplinary world studies essay, two subjects, and acquaints them with the independent research
and writing skills expected at university. This leads to a major piece of formally presented, structured writing,
in which ideas and findings are communicated in a reasoned and coherent manner, appropriate to the subject
or subjects chosen. It is intended to promote high-level research and writing skills, intellectual discovery and
creativity. An authentic learning experience, it provides students with an opportunity to engage in personal
research on a topic of their choice under the guidance of a supervisor.

Approaches to teaching and learning
Approaches to teaching and learning (ATL) across the Diploma Programme refers to deliberate strategies,
skills and attitudes that permeate the teaching and learning environment. These approaches and tools,
intrinsically linked with the learner profile attributes, enhance student learning and assist student preparation
for the Diploma Programme assessment and beyond. The aims of approaches to teaching and learning in
the Diploma Programme are to:
•

empower teachers as teachers of learners as well as teachers of content

•

empower teachers to create clearer strategies for facilitating learning experiences in which students are
more meaningfully engaged in structured inquiry and greater critical and creative thinking

•

promote both the aims of individual subjects (making them more than course aspirations) and linking
previously isolated knowledge (concurrency of learning)

•

encourage students to develop an explicit variety of skills that will equip them to continue to be actively
engaged in learning after they leave school, and to help them not only obtain university admission
through better grades but also prepare for success during tertiary education and beyond

•

enhance further the coherence and relevance of the students’ Diploma Programme experience

•

allow schools to identify the distinctive nature of an IB Diploma Programme education with its blend of
idealism and practicality.

The five approaches to learning (developing thinking skills, social skills, communication skills, selfmanagement skills and research skills) along with the six approaches to teaching (teaching that is inquirybased, conceptually focused, contextualized, collaborative, differentiated and informed by assessment)
encompass the key values and principles that underpin IB pedagogy.
DP Approaches to teaching and learning website.

The IB mission statement and the IB learner
profile
The Diploma Programme aims to develop in students the knowledge, skills and attitudes they will need to
fulfill the aims of the IB, as expressed in the organization’s mission statement and the learner profile.
Teaching and learning in the Diploma Programme represent the reality in daily practice of the organization’s
educational philosophy.
The DP film syllabus is closely linked to this, striving to develop internationally minded people who are:
•

inquirers

•

knowledgeable

•

thinkers

•

communicators

•

principled

•

open-minded

•

caring

•

balanced

•

risk-takers

•

reflective.

Academic honesty
Academic honesty in the Diploma Programme is a set of values and behaviours informed by the attributes of
the learner profile. In teaching, learning and assessment, academic honesty serves to promote personal
integrity, engender respect for the integrity of others and their work, and ensure that all students have an
equal opportunity to demonstrate the knowledge and skills they acquire during their studies.
All coursework—including work submitted for assessment—is to be authentic, based on the student’s
individual and original ideas with the ideas and work of others fully acknowledged. Assessment tasks that
require teachers to provide guidance to students or that require students to work collaboratively must be
completed in full compliance with the detailed guidelines provided by the IB for the relevant subjects.
For further information on academic honesty in the IB and the Diploma Programme, please consult the
following IB publications.

Specific information regarding academic honesty as it pertains to external and internal assessment
components of DP film can be found in this guide.

Acknowledging the ideas or work of another
person
Coordinators and teachers are reminded that candidates must acknowledge all sources used in work
submitted for assessment. The following is intended as a clarification of this requirement.
Diploma Programme candidates submit work for assessment in a variety of media that may include audiovisual material, text, graphs, images and/or data published in print or electronic sources. If a candidate uses
the work or ideas of another person, the candidate must acknowledge the source using a standard style of
referencing in a consistent manner. A candidate’s failure to acknowledge a source will be investigated by the
IB as a potential breach of regulations that may result in a penalty imposed by the IB final award committee.
The IB does not prescribe which style(s) of referencing or in-text citation should be used by candidates; this
is left to the discretion of appropriate faculty/staff in the candidate’s school. The wide range of subjects, three
response languages and the diversity of referencing styles make it impractical and restrictive to insist on
particular styles. In practice, certain styles may prove more commonly used, but schools are free to choose
a style that is appropriate for the subject concerned and the language in which candidates’ work is written.
Regardless of the reference style adopted by the school for a given subject, it is expected that the minimum
information given includes: name of author; date of publication; title of source; page numbers, as applicable;
date of access (electronic sources); URL (electronic sources).
The following criteria must be applied.
•

Students are expected to use a standard style and use it consistently so that credit is given to all sources
used, including sources that have been paraphrased or summarized.

•

When writing, students must clearly distinguish (in the body of the text) between their words and those
of others by the use of quotation marks (or other method, such as indentation) followed by an
appropriate citation that denotes an entry in the bibliography.

•

Students are not expected to show faultless expertise in referencing, but are expected to demonstrate
that all sources have been acknowledged.

•

Students must be advised that any audio-visual material, text, graphs, images and/or data that is crucial
to their work and that is not their own must also be attributed. Again, an appropriate style of
referencing/citation must be used.

Learning diversity and learning support
requirements
Schools must ensure that equal access arrangements and reasonable adjustments are provided to
candidates with learning support requirements that are in line with the following IB documents.
•

Candidates with assessment access requirements

•

Technical requirements for this course
Any school undertaking the DP film course must ensure they have the necessary technical equipment and
instructor expertise required to meet the course aims, objectives and formal assessment requirements, as
described in this guide.
Failure to ensure this will result in problematic assessment material and could lead to students not receiving
grades for this subject in their final diploma.

Nature of the subject

Film
Film is a powerful and stimulating art form and practice.
The DP film course aims to develop students as proficient interpreters and makers of film texts. Through the
study and analysis of film texts, and through practical exercises in film production, the film course develops
students’ critical abilities and their appreciation of artistic, cultural, historical and global perspectives in film.
Students examine film concepts, theories, practices and ideas from multiple perspectives, challenging their
own viewpoints and biases in order to understand and value those of others.
DP film students experiment with film and multimedia technology, acquiring the skills and creative
competencies required to successfully communicate through the language of the medium. They develop an
artistic voice and learn how to express personal perspectives through film.
The film course emphasizes the importance of working collaboratively. It focuses on the international and
intercultural dynamic that triggers and sustains contemporary film, while fostering in students an appreciation
of the development of film across time, space and culture. DP film students are challenged to understand
alternative views, to respect and appreciate the diverse cultures that exist within film, and to have open and
critical minds.
DP film students require courage, passion and curiosity.
•

Courage—to experiment and create, to explore ideas through action and to harness imagination.

•

Passion—to communicate and to act communally, and to research and formulate ideas, communicating
discoveries in a variety of forms.

•

Curiosity—about themselves and others and the world around them, and about the limitless possibilities
of human expression through film.

At the core of the DP film course lies the need for creative exploration and innovation. Students are
challenged to acquire and develop critical thinking, reflective analysis and the imaginative synthesis that is
achieved through practical engagement in the art, craft and study of film.
Culture and film
For this film guide, culture (which is a central component of the course) is defined as learned and shared
beliefs, values, interests, attitudes, products and patterns of behaviour created by society. This view of culture
includes an organized system of symbols, ideas, explanations, beliefs and material production that humans
create and manipulate in their daily lives. Culture is dynamic and organic, and it operates on many levels in
the global context—international, national, regional and local, as well as among different social groups within
a society. Culture is seen as fluid and subject to change.
Culture provides the overall framework within which humans learn to organize their thoughts, emotions and
behaviours in relation to their environment. Within this framework, cultural context, which specifically
appears throughout the taught syllabus and assessment tasks of the DP film course, refers to the conditions
that influence, and are influenced by, culture. These include economic, geographical, historical, institutional,
political, social and technological factors.

Distinction between SL and HL
The film syllabus articulates a differential between the SL and HL courses. It allows for greater breadth and
depth in the teaching and learning at HL through an additional assessment task. This task requires HL
students to reflect on the subject matter, skills and experiences encountered in the core syllabus areas in
order to formulate their own intentions for a completed film based on their experiences as developing
international filmmakers. They work collaboratively as a core production team in order to effectively
communicate on screen.

Film and the Diploma Programme core
Film and the extended essay
An extended essay (EE) in film within the DP core provides students with an opportunity to undertake
independent research into a topic of special interest. Students are encouraged to apply a range of skills in
order to develop and explore a focused research question appropriate to film in an imaginative and critical
way. It requires them to test and validate their research by considering its effect on the art form and practice
of film.
Students working on an EE in film must frame an appropriately focused research question. It is the task of
the supervisor to ensure that this research question leads the student along a path that uses appropriate
primary filmic sources and secondary sources that encourage the application of relevant film concepts,
theories, practices or ideas. The essay topic may relate to a specific area of the DP film course, but this is
not a requirement and other areas of the subject may be explored. It is important that the topic reflects the
student's particular interest and enthusiasm within the subject area.
Examples of suitable extended essays in film include the following.
•

Are the claims that the television series The Bridge (2011), Veronica Mars (2004) and Mad Men (2007)
should be classified as updates to classic film noir justified?

•

How did the legacy of the classical European avant-garde cinema contribute to the French New Wave?

•

How effectively can the theories of the male gaze and the female spectator be explored in specific film
texts?

•

To what extent can film director Julie Dash (b. 1952) be considered as an auteur?

•

To what extent do the film cultures of Bollywood and Tollywood (Telugu cinema) differ in terms of
cinematic style, form and context?

•

To what extent have the films of director Apichatpong “Joe” Weerasethakul (b. 1970) challenged the
traditional Thai film studio system?

Students must ensure that their EE does not duplicate other work they are submitting for the diploma. For
example, it must not be based on the same films the student has studied for any assessment tasks as part
of the DP film course. Supervisors play an important role in guiding students on these distinctions. Students
risk their diploma if academic misconduct is detected.
Detailed guidance on undertaking extended essays in film can be found in the Extended essay guide.

Film and creativity, activity, service
Creativity, activity, service (CAS) experiences can be associated with each of the subject groups of the DP.
Film students have excellent opportunities for making links between film and the CAS strands. The practical
nature of the subject combines effectively with a range of CAS activities that complement the academic rigour
of the Diploma Programme.
Film teachers can assist students in making links between their subjects and their CAS experiences, where
appropriate. This will provide students with relevance in both their subject learning and their CAS learning
through purposeful discussion and real experiences. It will motivate and challenge the students, strengthen
subject understanding and knowledge, and allow students to enjoy different approaches to their subjects.
As a result of the knowledge and understanding students develop about issues or themes as part of the
taught content of the subject, they might then investigate, plan, act, reflect on and demonstrate CAS
experiences in a more informed and meaningful way. Similarly, CAS experiences outside of the classroom
might ignite students’ passion for addressing a particular issue or theme inside the film classroom.
Film students might choose, for example, to engage with CAS through:
Film guide

8 / 75

•

participation in a range of artistic activities, workshops and festivals created in collaboration with others

•

planning and executing film projects for the school, local or wider community

•

planning and creating films that target a specific audience with specific needs.

CAS experiences can be a single event or may be an extended series of events. It is important to note that
CAS experiences must be distinct from, and may not be included or used in, the student’s DP course
requirements.

Film and theory of knowledge
The theory of knowledge (TOK) course engages students in reflection on the nature of knowledge and on
how we know what we claim to know. The course identifies eight ways of knowing: reason, emotion,
language, sense perception, intuition, imagination, faith and memory. Students explore these means of
producing knowledge within the context of various areas of knowledge: the natural sciences, the social
sciences, the arts, ethics, history, mathematics, religious knowledge systems and indigenous knowledge
systems. The course also requires students to make comparisons between the different areas of knowledge:
reflecting on how knowledge is arrived at in the various disciplines, what the disciplines have in common,
and the differences between them.
The arts subjects complement the TOK ethos by revealing interdisciplinary connections and allowing
students to explore the strengths and limitations of individual and cultural perspectives. Just as in TOK,
studying the arts requires students to reflect on, and question, their own bases of knowledge. In addition, by
exploring other DP subjects through an arts approach, students can gain an understanding of the
interdependent nature of knowledge and are encouraged to become “active, compassionate and lifelong
learners who understand that other people, with their differences, can also be right” (IB mission statement).
The arts can help us understand ourselves, our patterns of behaviour and our relationships to each other
and our wider environment. Students of the arts subjects study the various artistic approaches through which
knowledge, skills and attitudes from different cultural traditions are acquired, developed and transmitted.
They analyse artistic knowledge from various perspectives and acquire knowledge through experiential
means as well as more traditional academic methods. Questions related to TOK activities that a film student
might consider include the following.
•

Are certain ways of knowing employed in radically different ways in the arts as opposed to other areas
of knowledge?

•

How do artistic judgments differ from other types of judgment, such as moral judgments?

•

Is it possible for film to represent the world without transforming it?

•

To what extent do you agree with Michael Haneke’s (b. 1942) claim that “film is 24 lies per second at
the service of truth, or at the service of the attempt to find the truth?”

•

To what extent is imagination a fundamental requirement for viewing film?

•

What moral responsibilities do filmmakers have?

•

What, if anything, do the different subjects that make up the arts have in common?

•

Why might we be more concerned with process rather than product in the search for knowledge?

Film and international-mindedness
International-mindedness represents an openness and curiosity about the world and its people that begins
with students understanding themselves in order to effectively connect and collaborate with others. The arts
provide a unique opportunity for students to recognize the dynamic cultural influences around them and the
significance of diversity in the making of film. The DP film course gives students the opportunity to study a
wide variety of film texts and filmmakers from a range of contrasting contexts. Through creating, investigating,
critically analysing and appreciating differing cinematic forms and styles, students deepen their
understanding of film, as well as their knowledge, understanding and experience of the arts within the global
Film guide

9 / 75

community. They become more informed and reflective, and develop their abilities to become enriched
practitioners, communicators, collaborators and creative thinkers. They learn to acknowledge the elements
that appear in all cinematic forms and filmic traditions, and also to recognize the unique ways in which
particular cultures express and represent their values and identity through shared artistic endeavour.

Engaging with sensitive topics
Studying film enables students to engage with exciting, stimulating and personally relevant topics and issues.
However, it should be noted that often such topics and issues can also be sensitive and personally
challenging for some students. Teachers should be aware of this and provide guidance on how to approach
and engage with such topics in a responsible manner. Consideration should also be given to the personal,
political and spiritual values of others, particularly in relation to race, gender or identity.

Prior learning
The film course at both SL and HL requires no previous experience.
The course is designed to enable students to experience film on a personal level; achievement in this subject
is reflected in how students develop, extend and refine the knowledge, skills and attitudes necessary for
studying film.
The film course provides a relevant learning opportunity for a diverse range of students as it offers an
appropriate foundation for further study in film, creative arts and other related subjects. In addition, by instilling
discipline and refining communication, as well as creative and collaborative skills, it offers an extremely
valuable course of study for students who may wish to pursue a career or further education studies in areas
unconnected to film.

Links to the Middle Years Programme
DP film builds upon some of the conceptual areas and skills within the arts as outlined in the Middle Years
Programme (MYP) arts guide.
MYP arts provides students with the opportunity to develop as artists, as well as to learn about the arts
through conceptual understandings that are essential to the subject. Learning in the arts takes place within
contexts relevant to the student, whether personally, locally, nationally, internationally or globally significant.
Throughout the MYP arts course, students are required to develop knowledge, think creatively and make
connections between, and respond to, their own work as well as that of others.
MYP arts, and specifically the discipline of media, provides a solid introduction for the DP film course. In
thinking creatively, arts students become successful learners of media through a cycle of creativity. Emphasis
is placed on the artistic process, allowing the students to plan, create, share, reflect and evaluate the process
of presenting media. Students further develop their repertoire in order to engage and convey feelings,
experiences and ideas, and to build on the skills developed in the Primary Years Programme (PYP).
In MYP arts, students are provided with opportunities to prepare for the DP film course through:
•

understanding the role of media in original and displaced contexts, and to use this understanding to
inform their work as artistic communicators

•

discovering the aesthetics of film and media, and analysing and expressing this in various forms

•

acquiring, developing and applying skills in the process of making and sharing media

•

thinking creatively, developing curiosity, and purposefully exploring and challenging boundaries

•

constructing meaning and transferring learning to new settings

•

responding to their world, to their own art and its audience, and to the work of others.

Further detail on arts in the MYP can be found in the Arts guide.

Film and academic honesty
Assessment tasks across the arts vary considerably, from multimedia comparative studies, formal written
work and the presentation of practical work to the collection of ideas and stimuli that inspire the creative
process. Although guidelines for maintaining academic honesty are consistent for all subjects and
components, the variety and richness of tasks in the DP arts means that each component raises its own
challenges for maintaining academic honesty. For more information, please see Academic honesty in
Diploma Programme.

Referencing sources
If a student uses any content from any source, including the internet, these must be acknowledged
consistently following the protocol of the referencing style chosen by the school. This referencing style must
clearly identify the section of the work that is being attributed and its origin. When the student is aware that
another person’s work or ideas have influenced their own but it has not been referred to directly in their work,
the source must be included as a reference in a list of sources within the student’s research. This is
particularly relevant to the arts where the creative process will be the result of many stimuli, influences and
sources of inspiration.
Film students need to be aware of their responsibility as artists to be the original creators of, or have a
significant role in the creation of, the images and sound used in their film work. Students should therefore be
encouraged to find creative solutions to technical and artistic challenges in their work rather than seeking to
use the work of others in their original filmmaking.
Further information about academic honesty can be found here.
Academic honesty
Key opportunities for guiding students on academic honesty issues are identified in each of the assessment
tasks later in this guide.

Authenticity
Most of the assessment tasks in the arts are completed as coursework, and so have strict conditions under
which student work must be completed, presented and—in the case of internally assessed work—assessed.
There are also formal requirements that must be followed to ensure that the work received by examiners and
moderators is consistent and can be assessed against marking criteria. Since these conditions and formal
requirements are designed to provide each student with equal opportunity to demonstrate achievement,
failure to follow them is a form of academic misconduct as it can lead to students being unfairly advantaged.
Coursework authentication form (CAF)
During the creation of assessment work in film, teachers are required to meet with students at various
intervals in order to discuss the progress being made by each student and to verify the origin and credibility
of the coursework being created. These one-to-one interactions, which might be formal meetings and/or
informal discussions in the classroom, provide the teacher with the necessary evidence to authenticate each
student’s work.
For some of the assessment tasks for the DP film course, teachers must provide a written summary of the
authentication conversations using the DP film Coursework authentication form (CAF), which is submitted to
the IB as part of the upload of external assessment material. Further details regarding the authentication
requirements for each assessment task are identified later in this guide.
By the very practical nature of arts subjects, the creation and progress of student work for some of the
assessment tasks is continually witnessed by teachers. Therefore, not all components will require written
teacher comments on the CAF. However, it is expected that the teacher will continue to scrutinize the ongoing
work of each candidate and seek assurance that every element of the work is authentic.

Approaches to teaching and learning in film

Approaches to the teaching of film
The taught syllabus for this course has been designed to reflect the dynamic nature of film and filmmaking.
While the syllabus provides details of core teaching requirements, the flexibility of the film course allows for
a variety of approaches and teaching styles. In designing and delivering the curriculum, teachers have a free
choice in the selection of films, filmmakers, production roles, film concepts and contexts they cover. In the
assessment tasks, students are also encouraged to identify material for study based on their own personal
interests and what inspires and excites them in film.
Teachers are encouraged to interpret the taught syllabus creatively according to local circumstances and the
context of the school. This is an international film programme. How teachers choose to explore films and
filmmaking practices from various spaces, times and cultures is left to their own discretion. Teachers should
not only teach content and production skills that they themselves are familiar with and knowledgeable about,
but should also be risk-takers and expose students to unfamiliar concepts and contexts.
It is possible to run the DP film course with just one student. Teachers in this situation must find creative
opportunities to meet the requirement in the taught course for collaboration (which is an assessment
requirement in the HL course).
The programme embodies many of the approaches to teaching and learning (ATL) skills that empower
teachers and students to facilitate meaningful learning experiences. Teachers should consider how their
planning of the two-year course ensures that the teaching of film is:
•

based on inquiry

•

focused on conceptual understanding

•

developed in local and global contexts

•

focused on effective teamwork and collaboration

•

differentiated to meet the needs of all learners

•

informed by assessment.

For more information about approaches to teaching in the DP, please visit the DP Approaches to teaching
and learning subject website here.

Approaches to learning in film
The DP film course is student-centred and places student exploration at the heart of a holistic learning
experience. Learning about film relies on action, and the course must be experienced practically.
Collaboration is essential to learning in film, and students should experience and reflect on its processes,
benefits and challenges.
The film course is designed to enable students to learn through cognitive, metacognitive and affective skills,
as outlined in the DP approaches to teaching and learning guide. Students should experience a taught film
curriculum that develops the following skills.
•

Thinking skills

•

Communication skills

•

Social skills

Film guide

15 / 75

•

Self-management skills

•

Research skills

Film students learn through problem-solving and inquiry. They communicate their learning through action,
project planning, workshops, presentations and screenings, as well as oral, visual and written expression.
The course requires higher-order thinking skills, such as analysis and synthesis. Students should also learn
what is relevant and useful for their own investigations, and how to put their knowledge and understanding
into practice by transforming ideas into action.
For more information about approaches to learning in the DP, please visit the DP Approaches to teaching
and learning subject website here.
The selection of materials for assessment
The assessment tasks for the DP film course are intentionally student-centred. Teachers should encourage
students to identify and select material for study that will best help them to fulfill the requirements of each
task and to provide the best opportunity for fulfilling the assessment criteria. Therefore, the task instructions
and assessment criteria should be shared with the students and become a regular focus of interaction.

The film journal
From the beginning of the course, and at regular intervals, it is recommended that each student should
maintain a film journal. This is the student’s own record of his or her development as a DP filmmaker. It
should be used to record or retain the following.
•

Reflections on challenges and achievements

•

Creative ideas

•

Completed work

•

Critical analyses and experiences of watching films

•

Detailed evaluations and feedback

•

All documentation associated with practical filmmaking (such as scripts, storyboards and schedules)

•

Feedback from peers, teachers and others

•

Research into primary and secondary materials

•

Skills acquisition and development

Students should be encouraged to find the most appropriate ways of recording their development and have
free choice in deciding what form the film journal takes. Owing to the nature of the subject, the journal will
most likely include a significant number of digital files and elements. The content of the journal should focus
specifically on the analysis of learning experiences, rather than being simply a record of successes or an
exhaustive chronicle of everything the student experiences in the film course.
Although the film journal itself is not directly assessed or moderated, students are likely to select, adapt and
present for assessment large extracts from it. It is therefore regarded as a highly valuable activity of the film
course, developing the student’s ability to document the processes and skills involved in research, planning,
practical production and reflection.

Research
When carrying out research, students should consult a range of reliable primary and secondary sources. The
suitability of the sources for each assessment task will depend on its nature and use, and on the film texts,
concepts, theories, practices and ideas being investigated. As well as the more obvious sources (books,
Film guide

16 / 75

websites, videos and articles), research may also include live experiences and encounters such as
workshops, lectures, correspondence with experts and screenings. All sources consulted during the course
must be cited following the protocol of the referencing style chosen by the school and be maintained as an
ongoing list of sources.
Please note that each of the assessment tasks for the DP film course require a list of sources (as well as intext or on-screen citations) to be submitted as part of the formal requirements.

Health and safety
All schools are required to follow health and safety guidelines in their film-production work, observing
standard regulations on film production. Each school should recognize and accept the responsibilities and
obligations to provide a safe and healthy working environment for film students. Schools are ultimately
responsible for the health and safety of students and staff in all film-production work.
•

Students must be supported in making safe choices while filming, with teachers actively guiding them
to assess and avoid risk or injury throughout the course.

•

When working with adults or members of the wider community, teachers must ensure that all of the
appropriate safeguarding measures (as defined by the individual school) have been taken to enable
students to work safely with others.

Teachers are advised to carry out their own regular risk assessments during the course and to involve
students in this process.

Ethics and film work
As part of the collective consideration of the school, film students must be supported in maintaining an
ethical perspective during their course. Schools must be vigilant to ensure that work undertaken by the
students is appropriate for the context of the school and the age of the students.
Student work in the DP film course must not:
•

damage the environment

•

glamorize the taking of drugs

•

incite or condone intolerance or hatred of others

•

include excessive or gratuitous violence

•

make reference to, or represent, explicit sexual activity.

Please note this list is illustrative and not exhaustive.

courses, as stated in the document General regulations: Diploma Programme (page 4 article 8.2)
It is anticipated that most taught activities for DP film will cover several different parts of the course at once,
so the time allocations indicated in the “Core syllabus areas” table are neither prescriptive nor restrictive.
Careful planning of class activities, film screenings and, where feasible, lectures from film scholars and
workshops with industry professionals, is needed to ensure the best use of the time and resources
available.

Syllabus details
The suggestions for taught activities outlined in the syllabus content that follows are intended to stimulate a
broad range of exciting and engaging approaches to fulfilling the requirements of the course. These are not
intended to be prescriptive nor restrictive activities, but illustrate many possible pathways to fully preparing

18 / 75

students for the demands of the film assessment tasks. Further resources to underpin the planning and
delivery of this course can be found in the Film teacher support material.

Syllabus content

Overview of the course
Core areas
The film syllabus consists of the following core areas.
•

Reading film

•

Contextualizing film

•

Exploring film production roles

•

Collaboratively producing film (HL only)

The core syllabus areas for DP film have been designed to fully connect with each assessment task. These
areas must be central to the planning and designing of the taught film programme that is developed and
delivered by the teacher. Students are required to understand the relationship between these areas and how
each one informs and shapes their work in film.

The inquiry cycle
The film course is intended to be taught through dynamic cycles of inquiry, action and reflection.
“Through inquiry, action and reflection, IB programmes aim to develop a range of thinking, selfmanagement, social communication and research skills referred to in IB programmes as ‘approaches
to learning’” What is an IB education? (2013:5).

Inquiry
Inquiry in the film course involves both structured inquiry into established bodies of knowledge and
engagement with complex problems in order to better understand them. Through this process, students
should be encouraged to examine possibilities for further inquiry, experimentation, exploration and personal
development in order to reach a deeper level of understanding.
Film guide

19 / 75

Action
Action in the film course is both a strategy and an outcome, ensuring that learning emerges out of practical,
real-world experiences. Action involves learning by doing, the practical application that enhances learning
not only of acquired subject knowledge, but also further develops skills, processes and products involved in
the study, application and appreciation of film.

Reflection
Reflection in the film course requires students to become critically aware of their own development as
international filmmakers and calls on them to scrutinize their influences, methods and conclusions, as well
as the products and performances that grow from their experiences and endeavours. Students experience
presenting work in a variety of formats, consider the potential impact of this work and evaluate the extent to
which they can fulfill intentions.

Taught content
To fully prepare students for the demands of the film assessment tasks, teachers are expected to ensure
that their planning addresses each of the requirements stated in the following table, which is represented as
the interplay between inquiry, action and reflection.

Reading film
For this area of the course, it is essential that students understand how meaning is constructed within and
through film texts and are able to view the production of these texts in a broader framework. Students should
be able to acquire and use the appropriate tools for analysing films from various cultural contexts and place
these within wider critical perspectives. Students should be able to identify how film uses a range of film
elements to represent experiences and stories. Students should develop both their own enjoyment of film
and lifelong habits of critical inquiry, engaging them as both a filmmaker and as an audience member.

Preparing for external assessment
The taught activities outlined below are expected to be delivered prior to students commencing the formal
textual analysis assessment task, for which they will be required to examine a film text that they have not
previously studied.
Terminology
Cultural context
For the purposes of the DP film course, cultural context refers to the conditions that influence and are
influenced by culture. Cultural context appears in both the taught syllabus and the assessment tasks, and
involves consideration of some of the following factors, some of which may be blended (such as socioeconomic factors).
•

Economic (for example, the economic classes and issues explored within a film’s narrative)

•

Geographical (for example, the geographical location of a film’s origin)

•

Historical (for example, the period in time in which a film was created)

•

Institutional (for example, the production, distribution and exhibition factors involved for a film)

•

Political (for example, a film that attempts to persuade, subvert or create a political effect)

•

Social (for example, the communities, identities or issues represented in a film)

•

Technological (for example, the tools, products and methods used to create a film)

Film elements
For the purposes of the DP film course, film elements has been chosen as an umbrella term to cover factors
that are broadly associated with film language, formalist film analysis and terminology pertaining to the
creation and reception of film texts. Therefore, consideration of film elements in both the taught syllabus and
assessment tasks may involve consideration of a variety of the following. (This list is not exhaustive.)
•

Cinematography (such as colour, composition, exposure, framing, focus scale, movement, shot type,
and so on)

•

Critical response and reception

•

Editing (such as continuity, cut, dissolve, match, montage, pace, transition, and so on)

•

Filmmakers’ influences, intentions and vision

•

Genre, codes and conventions

•

Mise-en-scène (such as acting and figure behaviour, art direction, costume and make up, décor,
lighting, set and setting, space, and so on)

•

Motifs, symbols and themes

•

Narrative structure

•

Sound (such as dialogue, sound editing, sound effects and foley, soundtrack and music or score,
diegetic and non-diegetic, and so on)

Reading film: Inquiry
Teachers should develop tasks and activities that enable students to explore a variety of film texts (including
narrative, documentaries, television shows and shorts) that originate from various cultural contexts in order
for students to gain an understanding of how film elements combine to create meaning. Students should be
Film guide

22 / 75

able to research and respond to a variety of film texts, using both primary and secondary sources, identifying
how the film texts are constructed and the ways in which choices in film elements create meaning. They
must have experience of acquiring and developing technical and critical film terminology to support their
analysis.
Taught activities for this area might include the following.

viewer?
 Students examine the use of jump cuts in the
sequence and share their findings with a partner.
Q. How does the opening ceremony represent and
reflect the historical struggles of the Chinese
people?
 After viewing the opening ceremony, students use
online resources to research Zhang Yimou and to
help identify some of the themes and motifs
encountered in the clip. The class holds a
discussion on the relationship between Yimou’s
work in film, the opening ceremony and Chinese
culture.
Q. How are both diegetic and non-diegetic sounds
used in the scene to convey meaning?
 After viewing the film, students study the closing
scene in order to identify the different sources of
sound being used. As a class, hypothesize how
both diegetic and non-diegetic sounds help to
convey meaning and to serve as a climax to the
film.

Activities
Q. How does the film attempt to address the politics
of climate change by challenging and/or fulfilling
the genre conventions of the documentary?
 After screening, students choose an extract from
the film and research genre conventions of a
documentary. Students analyse how their extract
challenges and/or fulfills specific documentary
conventions and then create a blog post that
explores how effective the political message of the
film is, given their findings.
Q. How do specific components of the selected film’s
mise-en-scène differ in their representation of
female characters?
 After screening, students identify a female
character from the film and create a graphic
representation
of
selected
and
specific
components of mise-en-scène that are used to
convey meaning about that character. As a class,
students present and share their findings.
Q. What are some contextually specific components
of mise-en-scène?
 After screening, students choose a sequence or
shot and identify components of mise-en-scène
that they think might be contextually specific to the
geographic origin of the film. Using online research
resources, students create a graphic presentation
identifying their findings.
Q. How many film elements can be identified in the
selected film’s opening sequence, and how do
they work together to create and convey meaning,
mood and tone?
 Using online and course resources, students
create a working list of as many cinematography,
editing and sound terms as possible. The class
watch the opening sequence of Citizen Kane
multiple times while each student tries to identify
respective components of each film element in
turn. As a group, share ideas and opinions about
the relative importance and effect of each one as
encountered in the sequence.

24 / 75

Reading film: Reflection
Teachers should develop tasks and activities that enable students to consider and link film elements and
cultural contexts within film texts they have studied, as well as to other films they have experienced.
Students should be able to reflect on their analysis of film elements and film texts in both formal and informal
presentations. They should have experience of presenting work as a written textual analysis.
Taught activities for this area might include the following.

 Individual students or small groups research,
identify and independently screen a film with an
unconventional and/or non-linear narrative. After
screening, students collaborate to create graphic
narrative maps and charts demonstrating the
different ways that the narrative in the film can be
understood and represented.
Q. How do formal film elements such as mise-enscène, cinematography, editing and sound work
together to create specific meaning in a film?
 In pairs, students choose a five-minute extract
from the film. Ask students to collaborate in
deconstructing the sequence and identifying all
formal film elements present. Student pairs then
create and formulate a working draft of a shooting
script replicating the studied sequence.
Q. How do critical response and reception change
over time and alter our understanding of a film’s
importance or cultural significance?
 In small groups, students conduct research to
identify a film whose reputation or significance has
changed over time. Once a film title is chosen,
students conduct additional research using both
primary and secondary materials as well as
contemporaneous film reviews and academic or
scholarly reappraisals to compile a formal
presentation of their findings.
Q. How do directors plan and execute a selected
scene or sequence according to their intentions?
 Students participate in small groups to choose and
screen an Anatomy of a scene episode and
prepare extensive written notes on the technical
and formal decisions undertaken by a director in
the creation of scene.

Contextualizing film
For this area of the course, it is essential that students understand how film has evolved and developed
across time, space and culture. Students should be able to identify and explore a range of films from
contrasting cultural contexts and should consider the frameworks that exist within various areas of film
focus. Students need to be able to develop an awareness of links and relationships between individual and
collective cinematic experiences and express their findings in a variety of ways.

Culture across time and space
The cultural diversity of film is a powerful component of its status as a significant art form. Students are
expected to reflect this diversity in their contextualizing film work. Teachers are urged to counsel their
students in identifying work for this core area that challenges existing assumptions and exposes them to
unfamiliar and globally minded subject matter.
For this film course, culture is defined as learned and shared beliefs, values, interests, attitudes, products
and all patterns of behaviour created by society. This view of culture includes an organized system of
symbols, ideas, explanations, beliefs and material production that humans create and manipulate in their
daily lives. Culture is dynamic and organic, and it operates on many levels across both time (historical) and
space (geographical). It is important that culture is seen as fluid and subject to change.

Preparing for external assessment
The taught activities outlined below are expected to be delivered prior to students commencing the formal
comparative study assessment task, for which students will be required to examine an area of film focus
and related film texts they have not previously studied in depth.
Terminology
Cultural context

Economic (for example, the economic classes and issues explored within a film’s narrative)

•

Geographical (for example, the geographical location of a film’s origin)

•

Historical (for example, the period in time in which a film was created)

•

Institutional (for example, the production, distribution and exhibition factors involved for a film)

•

Political (for example, a film that attempts to persuade, subvert or create a political effect)

•

Social (for example, the communities, identities or issues represented in a film)

•

Technological (for example, the tools, products and methods used to create a film)

Film focus
For the purposes of the DP film course, film focus has been chosen as an umbrella term for the frameworks
that exist to help understand and categorize films in order to identify and explore connections, links and
relationships between them. In both the taught syllabus and assessment tasks, areas of film focus include
the following.
•

Film movements (such as French New Wave, German expressionism, Third Cinema, and so on)

•

Film genre and film style (such as film noir, romantic comedy, science fiction, Western, and so on)

•

Film theory (such as auteur theory, feminism, Marxist film theory, and so on)

Contextualizing film: Inquiry
Teachers should develop tasks and activities that enable students to examine and research the evolution of
film across space, time and culture. Students should be able to explore a variety of film traditions, conventions
and areas of film focus in order to formulate clearly defined topics for further study. They should have
experience of engaging with multiple film texts from a variety of contrasting cultural contexts.
Taught activities for this area might include the following.

Q. What specific innovations in film style were
developed by early silent filmmakers that later
proved influential?
 Students identify an early silent filmmaker, locate
two representative films and identify specific
innovations in their film style. They present their
research to others by selecting eight still images
from the two chosen films in order to guide a
discussion of influential elements of the chosen
filmmaker’s style.
Q. The Great Train Robbery is considered to be the
first major Western film. How does this genre
change over time?
 After screening the film, students form small
groups and are assigned successive decades from
the 1910s to the present day. Each group identifies
and researches key Western films from their
decade—including clips, where appropriate—and
presents their findings to the class. The final
presentations are combined to create a multimedia
genre timeline.
Q. Who are some of the world’s current leading
auteurs?
 Students research and identify a current
filmmaking auteur working from a contrasting
cultural context to their own. Students create a
physical or online portfolio for their auteur: charting
their biography, major works, key aspects of their
personal style and technique. Combine the final
portfolios to create a course-wide “yearbook” or
Who’s who? in contemporary filmmaking to share
as a resource.
Q. Where are historical and contemporary film
movements located or geographically based?
 Students form small groups and identify and
research an historical or contemporary film
movement from a contrasting cultural context,
gathering and compiling information on key
members and practitioners, years of activity, key
film texts and titles, and defining characteristics.
Using Google Earth or another online mapping
system (or an analog map), students geotag
important locations relevant to their film movement
and embed their findings. Consider having
students create a recorded “tour” of their
movement to share with the class.

Q. To what extent was Eisenstein’s (b. 1898)
montage theory and practice politically effective,
and how has it influenced other filmmakers?
 After screening, students research Eisenstein’s
montage theory and identify a specific method of
montage employed in a chosen extract from
October. Students then research and locate an
extract from another film that also employs this
method. Students present their comparison
extracts to the class for an informal discussion on
the political and artistic effectiveness of both clips.
Q. How do film movements organize and define their
intentions to themselves and to the world?
 Students review Vow of Chastity and conduct
preliminary research on films connected to the
Dogme 95 movement. With a partner or in a small
group, students identify and select another
historical or contemporary film movement and
research the central beliefs and artistic techniques
of that movement. Together, students create their
own “manifesto” or vow for their selected
movement and share their findings with others.
Q. How do sub-genres, revisionist genres and/or
hybrid genres emerge from, and alter, an original
genre’s conventions and codes?
 Students identify and research a sub-genre,
revisionist genre and/or hybrid genre, and locate
at least two film titles that exemplify their selection
while listing its defining conventions and codes.
Using analog or online charting materials, students
create a family tree or genealogy of their selected
sub-genre, revisionist genre and/or hybrid genre,
going back to its original genre and earliest film
example. With additional research, students seek
to fill in—as completely as possible—example
films back to the beginning of their chart. Students
share their results.
Q. What are the different codes, conventions and
formal techniques used to visually represent
teenagers and adolescents within the coming-ofage genre?
 In pairs or small groups, students identify and
locate two films or television episodes from
contrasting cultural contexts that both seek to
represent teenage and/or adolescent experience.
Students select a brief extract from each film or
episode and create an audio commentary synced
to the extract that evaluates, critiques and explores
the differences and similarities in both clips.

Contextualizing film: Reflection
Teachers should develop tasks and activities that enable students to reflect on their learning in this area,
formulating a rationale for the arguments they have developed and comparisons they have made. Students
should have experience of presenting work as a recorded multimedia comparative study and consider how
best to present audio-visual material.
Taught activities for this area might include the following.

Q. How are arguments formulated and justified in the
study and analysis of film?
 Return to two previously screened and studied film
titles. Ask students to research and develop as
many different (even if overlapping or
contradictory) topics and arguments for connecting
and comparing the two films according to a shift in
film focus from film movements to film genre and
style to film theory. Compile these topics and
arguments, and share with the class. Conduct a
class discussion to determine the strongest and
weakest topics and arguments, as well as the type
of evidence that might work best according to the
chosen approach.
Q. How is evidence best presented in the study and
analysis of film?
 Return to the compiled list of possible film topics
and arguments (above), and place students in
paired groupings. Ask student pairs to randomly
select one of the chosen topics and arguments.
One student, independently of their partner and
without consultation, creates a brief 10–15-slide
presentation that offers visual and written
justification and evidence for the selected
approach without using any film clips. Afterwards,
the remaining student independently and without
consultation, records an audio track to accompany
the presentation. Students share the final
multimedia presentations and discuss the
effectiveness of the visual, written and audio
components.
Q. What are the most appropriate ways of referencing
film clips in presentation work?
 Paired students return to their recorded multimedia
presentation (above) and consult on the most
appropriate clips from the two films under
consideration. Working together, the students
judiciously select and edit clips into their
presentations, removing and/or adding needed
visual, written and audio evidence. Students share
their presentations for peer and teacher informal
evaluation.

Exploring film production roles
For this area of the course, students are required to explore various film production roles through
engagement with all phases of the filmmaking process. The development of film production skills is a complex
process that requires creativity, imagination and problem-solving skills, as well as meticulous organizational
and analytical skills. It almost always involves close collaboration with others and can demand a scrupulous
attention to detail and a willingness to persevere.
Teachers should guide students through initial creative exercises, gradually leading them towards more
substantial projects. Students should learn the overall structure of filmmaking, the formulation of filmmaking
intentions, the skills, responsibilities and professional expectations associated with each film production
role and the nature of the relationships in a production team. Students should be encouraged to work in a
variety of film production roles to enable them to explore their skills and aptitudes in different fields.

Preparing for internal assessment
It is intended that the work undertaken within this core syllabus will not only inform the approach students
take for the film portfolio assessment task, but also provide much of the material required to complete the
assessment task. Therefore, students must begin retaining and collating work from day one of the course to
ensure they have enough material to fulfill the formal requirements of the task.
Terminology
Film production roles
For the purposes of the DP film course, students are required to experience working in a variety of film
production roles. These roles are as follows.
•

Cinematographer—responsible for the camera and for achieving the artistic and technical decisions
related to the framed image. Click here to see a more detailed description of the cinematographer role.

•

Director—responsible for the artistic and logistic aspects of the production, visualizing the script and
guiding the other individuals involved in the film in order to fulfill their artistic vision. Click here to see a
more detailed description of the director role.

•

Editor—responsible for assembling the raw footage, selecting shots and constructing the film in order
to meet the artistic vision for the film. Click here to see a more detailed description of the editor role.

•

Sound—responsible for capturing, creating, sourcing and assembling the audio elements of the film.
Click here to see a more detailed description of the sound role.

•

Writer—responsible for writing the screenplay, for updating the script during production and for
supporting others in realizing the artistic intentions for the film. Click here to see a more detailed
description of the writer role.

•

One other clearly defined film production role not specified above (see below).

The intention of the optional “one other clearly defined film production role” is to ensure that as new
technologies emerge over time, centres that become equipped with appropriate film technologies and
expertise can incorporate them into their film courses to further broaden the production experiences of their
candidates. This may be any role deemed a creative role within the filmmaking process such as animator, art
director, costume designer, production designer, production illustrator or special effects. Film teachers are
not expected to teach these optional roles as part of the core syllabus; however, students who show
enthusiasm or aptitude in these areas may wish to explore outside of the more traditional film roles offered.
Filmmaker intentions
For the purposes of the DP film course, filmmaker intentions are specific aims that students formulate in
order to guide their work in each chosen film production role. These intentions are likely to arise from
exposure to influences from films and filmmakers, and should be used to lead the practical exploration and
experimentation in each film production role. Filmmaker intentions should be authentic and meaningful
personal goals that the student is passionate about fulfilling.
These intentions could be as simple as developing a new skill or attempting a specific technique in their
production work (such as creating a silhouette as a cinematographer or using a mask to create the effect of
binoculars as editor) or might be more abstract, attempting to create work that echoes a recognizable film
style or the creation of a particular mood through their filmmaking work (such as the photographic feel of
Grapes of Wrath [1940] or the use of photographic stills seen in Run Lola Run [1998]).
Film guide

30 / 75

Students may or may not necessarily fulfill their stated filmmaker intentions in their production work, and
they should be encouraged to reflect on the process of learning in this area. This work goes to the heart of
the IB learner profile and requires students to approach their learning with forethought, independence and a
willingness to fail and try again. This is the very essence of being a risk-taker. Students are bound to come
across successes and challenges in equal measure as they attempt to fulfill their filmmaker intentions. It is
important that, from the outset, students perceive the value of failure as part of their process of learning in
this work.

Exploring film production roles: Inquiry
Teachers should develop tasks and activities that enable students to engage with various film texts, seeking
influence and inspiration in order to guide their own production work. Students should research a variety of
film production roles and acquire an understanding of industry practices and essential skills required for a
minimum of three roles. They should have experience of examining their own personal interests and
inspirations in order to identify filmmaker intentions.
Taught activities for this area might include the following.

Q. What is the effect of the dolly-zoom and how is it
achieved?
 Students watch examples and research the dollyzoom (also called reverse-tracking, reverse-zoom
or vertigo shot). Students propose a scene (from
an existing or original script) where this effect
could be used to create meaning. Students
research what technology is required to achieve
this shot and how to do it.
 Extension activity: Students attempt to create their
own dolly-zoom.
Q. To what extent can a screenwriting formula be
identified in a film?
 Having carried out research into Field’s structure,
students locate a copy of the script from a chosen
film and break it down to clearly identify where
each plot state begins and ends. Students share
their findings with the class and examine the
extent to which all of the films selected match the
structure.
 Extension activity: Students locate and research
films that subvert the three-act structure.
Q. How can editing techniques be used to suggest an
alternative reality?
 Students watch examples of films and make notes
on the editing techniques used to differentiate
between realities. Students identify transitions,
pace and the links between image and sound to
make these story transitions believable. Students
write their own sequence where there is a
transition between two worlds and plan what tools
they will use to create this transition.
 Extension activity: Students re-edit existing film
material or create their own film, manipulating the
footage through editing techniques and effects to
suggest moments of alternative reality, such as
flashbacks, hallucinations and transitions into
other worlds. Students analyse the effectiveness
of their own work and that of others in the class.
Q. Why is it important for the director to pre-plan
blocking?
 Students do preliminary research on the basic
premise of the film (Wikipedia or IMDb will suffice

the class and ask students to map out the
movement of each character and the camera.
Repeat this activity two or three times. Ask
students to discuss any observations they have
made regarding actor or camera movement. Why
is blocking important?
 Extension activity: Provide students with a onepage script (with three or more characters, to be
appropriately challenging) for them to block the
scene on paper and with actors.
Q. How significant is the contribution of sound design
to the overall effectiveness of a film?
 Students research how sound was created for two
of the films watched. In small groups, students
select a five-minute sequence that has an
example of dialogue, soundtrack and sound
effect. Students make a list of all the sounds in the
five-minute sequence under each heading. Select
a second scene and watch it without sound.
Students list all of the sounds one might hear and
then play back the scene to see if anything was
missed. This activity can be repeated with
numerous scenes as it brings greater awareness
to the sound role.

Exploring film production roles: Action
Teachers should develop tasks and activities that enable students to acquire, develop and apply practical
filmmaking skills and techniques, in a variety of forms and a minimum of three film production roles.
Students should experience working both individually and collaboratively as creative risk-takers on a variety
of filmmaking exercises and experiments in order to fulfill their filmmaker intentions. They should have
experience of collaborating to create at least one completed film, working in one film production role.
Taught activities for this area might include the following.

Q. How can the juxtaposition of images create new
meaning?
 Students research the “Kuleshov” effect and
screen the given montage examples. Students
make notes on each scene and discuss how the
juxtaposition of images creates a third distinct
meaning. Students then select two opposing
images/concepts and create a 30-second
montage. An example would be to juxtapose
images of water use in rural Kenya versus North
America to provide a new global perspective on
water. Still images, screen grabs and video
footage are all appropriate. These are shared with
the class.
Q. What shots are required for basic coverage?
 Students research the cinematic techniques
required for basic coverage. In groups of three,
students plan, shoot and edit a short scene that is
based around a part of a card or chess game. The
students should focus on the portrayal of space
and the relationship between the characters and
the game while obtaining all necessary shots for
appropriate coverage (such as master shot, insert
shots, reaction shots) and paying attention to the
rule of thirds, the 180-degree rule, eye-lines, and
continuity of hands, cards or chess pieces. This

activity is also useful for directing and editing as
students view and reflect on their work.
Q. To what extent does genre convention dictate
direction?
 Students are given four contrasting genres to work
with. Working in groups of four, each student will
become responsible for directing the scene in the
allocated genre. After reviewing notes on genre
from the “Contextualizing film” areas, students
take turns to direct each other in the scene using
the appropriate conventions. Dialogue must
remain the same, but actor and camera blocking,
lighting and other mise-en-scène elements may be
changed so that the sequence is representative of
each selected genre. Each director should have a
plan of how to work with the actors and have
storyboards or sketches to consult on set. The
directors should debrief as a team, discussing the
problems and solutions of working with the actors
and the camera, and identifying how their own
work could be improved.
Q. How is a screenplay different to a written story?
 Ask students to research the correct formatting for
a screenplay. Students select a short story or fairy
tale and adapt it into a screenplay using
appropriate formatting. Students should avoid the
temptation of including camera and editing
directions in the screenplay.
Q. How can sound be used as a suggestive device in
film?
 Students create three or four diegetic sounds
(sounds that originate from a source within the
world of the film) and non-diegetic sounds (sounds
that come from a source outside of the world of the
film, such as those that have been added for mood
or effect) for a short sequence of film. The sounds
that students create should attempt to evoke a
specific mood, suggest an emotional shift in the
narrative, create anxiety or be used to develop a
particular character. When the students have
created the sounds and applied them to the
sequence, they share their work and assess the
most effective techniques used.

Exploring film production roles: Reflection
Teachers should develop tasks and activities that enable students to reflect on their acquisition of skills and
chart their learning in a variety of film production roles. Students should be able to reflect on the successes
and challenges of their exercises, experiments and complete films, evaluating the impact this work has had
on them as a filmmaker and the extent to which their filmmaker intentions were fulfilled. They should have
experience of collating evidence of their explorations in a portfolio, presenting work in both visual and written
forms.

Q. How does a director work with actors?
 Students create a workshop for the film class that
explains and explores techniques a director might
use to prepare actors for their roles (such as
rehearsals, working with character, camera
blocking). The workshop could be recorded so that
participants can see the results of working on
character.
Q. How can a leitmotif define a character?
 Students research leitmotifs, playing the selected
clips with the original music in place. Students
should start to experiment with playing alternative
leitmotifs over other clips from famous films (such
as “The Imperial March” from Star Wars or the
Jaws theme played over the character of “Boo” in
Monsters Inc.). With a partner, students reflect on
the effect this has on the film and discuss the
impact on mood, foreshadowing and audience
expectation.
 Extension activity: Students create their own
personal leitmotif for a film clip.
Q. How important is the order of shots to a sequence?
 Students use footage from one film and re-edit it in
three different ways. Students reflect on how the
order and choices of the director can make a
significant impact on the overall scene.

A film of the students’
choice (existing or

acts in mind, students create a treatment and a
pitch for their selected film. Students reflect on
what details need to be included and what can be
left out when trying to pitch a film script.

Collaboratively producing film (HL only)
Engagement in the collaborative creation of original finished work defines the HL experience for this course.
HL students will need to build on the subject matter, skills and experiences encountered in the other core
syllabus areas (reading film, contextualizing film and exploring film production roles) and engage in a
process of synthesis. This task requires creative cooperation, team work, open-mindedness and problemsolving to successfully take original films from inception to completion.
The collaborative nature of this syllabus area is fundamental, acknowledging that successful filmmaking most
often depends on the combined effort of those involved in the process. Students will experience working as
members of core production teams, in addition to their work in discrete film production roles.

Preparing for internal assessment
It is intended that the work undertaken within this core syllabus area will inform the approach students
eventually take for the collaborative film project assessment task. These taught activities are expected to be
delivered prior to students commencing the task, after which they are required to form new core production
teams and to initiate entirely new ideas and plans for completed films.

Film guide

Terminology
Core production team
For this DP Film guide, a core production team is a group of students who are fully responsible for defining
the scope of original completed films and for ensuring that all creative and logistical aspects of pre-production,
production and post-production are carried out successfully. For this taught area, students are required to
work collaboratively as part of a core production team of two to four students from within the school
community. Students can choose to work collaboratively. They may choose to work with fellow students from
their film class, with students from other film classes in the school, or with students in the school who are not
studying film. They can also choose to work with a combination of all three options.
While each student in the group will take on one single film production role (defined below) for each
completed film, it is expected that, as members of the core production team, each student will take on
numerous other responsibilities and tasks during the project in order to support the cooperative realization of
each completed film. This flexible and supportive collaboration is central to this taught area and each student
should keep a record of the nature of their collaborations. They should reflect on their approaches to team
work, problem-solving, time management and conflict resolution as a member of the core production team,
and should evaluate the successes and challenges encountered as part of the creative process.
Film production roles
For the purposes of the DP film course, students are required to experience working in a variety of film
production roles. These roles are as follows.
•

Cinematographer—responsible for the camera and for achieving the artistic and technical decisions
related to the framed image. Click here to see a more detailed description of the cinematographer role.

Please note: The “one other clearly defined film production role” that appears in the “Exploring film
production roles” syllabus area is not available as an option for this taught area.

Collaboratively producing film: Inquiry
Teachers should develop tasks and activities that enable students to reflect on their experiences of watching
films and consider how exposure to films and filmmakers might guide and influence their own work, enabling
them to set clear intentions for filmmaking. Students should be able to consider how the film elements, areas
of film focus, film production roles and cultural contexts they have explored in the DP film course can
inform and shape their own filmmaking practices. They should have experience of forming core production
teams in order to collaboratively create plans for making at least one original completed film, identifying the
roles, responsibilities, skills and techniques required, and formulating intentions for the completed films.
Taught activities for this area might include the following.

Q. Where do inspirations for filmmaking come from?
 Students reflect on films they have watched over
the length of the course and list the films, directors,
key moments and work of individual technicians
that have been inspirational to them. This can be
used as the basis for a short presentation to the
class.
Q. What makes a credible film pitch?
 As a group, the students work together to devise a
pitch for a new Pixar animated film dealing with the
problems of being a teenager. The pitch should
present the group’s ideas and include illustrations
or photos to illustrate key moments—at least two
images for the beginning, middle and the end of
the film. The pitch should be presented to a panel
of peers who critique the delivery and content of
the pitch.
Q. What makes a credible film treatment?
 In groups, students use a poem or song lyric as the
basis for a film treatment, writing their prose to
include details of the intended directorial style.
Each group prepares a treatment that shows the
influence of a specific genre, movement or
tradition. For example, in the style of the romantic
comedy genre, in the style of the French New
Wave movement or in the style of German
expressionism. Treatments should be shared with
the class and the most engaging aspects
identified.

Collaboratively producing film: Action
Teachers should develop tasks and activities that enable students to engage in the pre-production,
production and post-production phases, working as part of a core production team to create at least one
completed film. Students should be able to make creative choices in film production roles and collaborate
in a variety of other activities to support the cooperative realization of at least one completed film. They should
have experience of documenting their pre-production, production and post-production experiences.

 Having looked at a variety of storyboards from
existing films, each student chooses a one-act play
script and creates a storyboard for a new film
adaptation. The boards, which can be drawn or use
photographs, should convey the essential
elements for the film as well as communicating a
directorial style (for example, how might Aesop’s
Fox and Crow be different if it was directed by Tim
Burton instead of Quentin Tarantino?).

The script for a one-act
play (these can be
found online or the
school theatre
department might be
able to provide a
selection of scripts).

involved with pre-production, production and postproduction. Students should reflect on how the
group worked together. This exercise is best
delivered prior to the students beginning their
collaborative film project as it draws out the group’s
strengths, weaknesses and compatibility. This
work is screened to the rest of the class in order to
identify the most “credible” features of the work.
Q. How do the professionals do it?
 Students select a short scene from a feature film to
recreate. Students should work within their chosen
role and are expected to collaborate with all team
members. Students will need to carefully screen
the clip, making note of shots, angles, blocking, art
direction, movement, dialogue, sound effects,
soundtrack, transitions and pacing. Teachers
should check the clip before students begin to
ensure it is appropriately challenging and should
provide marks for how accurately students have
recreated their scene.
Q. What are the traditional filmmaking techniques
used for special effects?
 In a group, students plan and film a “wizard battle”.
This magical skirmish should be accomplished
using as many special effects from the early history
of film as possible, such as stopping the camera,
running footage backwards, simple stop-motion,
on-set effects, make-up, lighting, and other
techniques they have identified from Méliès’ films.
When finished, the group should screen their film
and give a class presentation on how the effects
were accomplished.

Collaboratively producing film: Reflection
Teachers should develop tasks and activities that enable students to evaluate the strengths and weaknesses
of their own individual work in film production roles. Students should be able to reflect on their
collaborations as part of a core production team, evaluating the successes and challenges of the process
and the extent to which at least one completed film fulfilled stated intentions. They should have experience
of presenting work in both audio-visual and written forms.
Taught activities for this area might include the following.

Directorial intention

An interview from a
director on a specific
film, such as Martin
Scorsese (b. 1942).

Q. To what extent do films fulfill defined intentions?
 Students select one of their created films and
produce a written critique of their own work in order
to judge the extent to which they feel the films
fulfilled their original intentions and justifying their
decisions made. This assignment is then
discussed in groups or with the class.
Q. What are the challenges and benefits of working
collaboratively?
 Students screen and reflect on their collaborative
work and evaluate the success of the creative
collaboration. They discuss the challenges and
successes of the collaboration and identify
personal goals for future collaborative work.
Q. How does directorial intent change with the
creation of the film?
 Students read or watch an interview with a director
on a specific film they have seen and reflect on
how the director’s intentions were realized in the

film. This could be done as a class or individually
by students. Students reflect on their own
intentions and whether they are drawn to certain
styles, themes or characters.
Q. What are the benefits of running a test screening
when making a film?
 Students screen their films for the audience, who
will watch without (as far as possible) knowing the
content of the films or the identity of the production
team. They answer the following four questions.
• Why do you think this film was made?

• What do you think this film says to its
audience?

• What makes you think that?
• What is your reaction to the film?
The production team should listen to reactions
without responding or attempting to explain what
the audience does not understand. Students
should reflect on this experience, considering
where they have been successful and how they
could improve their work further.

Assessment in the Diploma Programme

General
Assessment is an integral part of teaching and learning. The most important aims of assessment in the
Diploma Programme are that it should support the subject aims and objectives and encourage a variety of
approaches to student learning. Both external and internal assessments are used in the DP. IB examiners
mark work produced for external assessment, while work produced for internal assessment is marked by
teachers and externally moderated by the IB.
There are two types of assessment identified by the IB.
•

Formative assessment informs both teaching and learning. It is concerned with providing accurate and
helpful feedback to students and teachers on the kind of learning taking place and the nature of
students’ strengths and weaknesses in order to help develop students’ understanding and capabilities.
Formative assessment can also help to improve teaching quality, as it can provide information to
monitor progress towards meeting the course aims and objectives.

•

Summative assessment gives an overview of previous learning and is concerned with measuring
student achievement.

The DP primarily focuses on summative assessment designed to record student achievement at, or towards
the end of, the course of study. However, many of the assessment instruments can also be used formatively
during the course of teaching and learning, and teachers are encouraged to do this. A comprehensive
assessment plan is viewed as being integral with teaching, learning and course organization. For further
information, see the IB Programme standards and practices document.
The approach to assessment used by the IB is criterion-related, not norm-referenced. This approach to
assessment judges students’ work by their performance in relation to identified levels of attainment, not in
relation to the work of other students. For further information on assessment within the DP, please refer to
the publication Diploma Programme assessment: Principles and practice.
To support teachers in the planning, delivery and assessment of the DP courses, a variety of resources can
be found on the DP Film subject website or purchased through the IB store at ibstore.ibo.org.
Teachers are free to decide the order in which students undertake the assessment tasks; however, it should
be noted that the submission deadline for internal assessment tasks (20 April/20 November) falls before the
deadline for external tasks (30 April/30 November).

Methods of assessment
The IB uses several methods to assess work produced by students.

Assessment criteria
Assessment criteria are used when the assessment task is open-ended. Each criterion concentrates on a
particular skill that students are expected to demonstrate. An assessment objective describes what students
should be able to do, and assessment criteria describe how well they should be able to do it. Using
assessment criteria allows discrimination between different tasks and encourages a variety of responses.
Each criterion comprises a set of hierarchically ordered level descriptors. Each level descriptor is worth one
or more marks. Each criterion is applied independently using a best-fit model. The maximum marks for each
criterion may differ according to the criterion’s importance. The marks awarded for each criterion are added
together to give the total mark for the piece of work.

Film guide

41 / 75

Markbands
Markbands are a comprehensive statement of expected performance against which responses are judged.
They represent a single holistic criterion divided into level descriptors. Each level descriptor corresponds to
a range of marks to differentiate student performance. A best-fit approach is used to ascertain which
particular mark to use from the possible range for each level descriptor.

Inclusive assessment arrangements
Inclusive assessment arrangements are available for candidates with assessment access requirements.
These arrangements enable candidates with diverse needs to access the examinations and demonstrate
their knowledge and understanding of the constructs being assessed.
The IB document Candidates with assessment access requirements provides details on all the inclusive
assessment arrangements available to candidates with learning support requirements. The IB document
Learning diversity and inclusion in IB programmes outlines the position of the IB with regard to candidates
with diverse learning needs in the IB programmes. For candidates affected by adverse circumstances, the
IB documents General regulations: Diploma Programme and the Handbook of procedures for the Diploma
Programme provide details on access consideration.

Responsibilities of the school
The school is required to ensure that equal access arrangements and reasonable adjustments are provided
to candidates with learning support requirements that are in line with the IB documents Candidates with
assessment access requirements and Learning diversity and inclusion in IB programmes.

Introduction
Students at both SL and HL demonstrate their knowledge and understanding of how meaning is constructed
in film. They do this through a written analysis of a prescribed film text, based on a chosen extract (lasting
no more than five minutes) from that film. Students consider the cultural context of the film and a variety of
film elements in their analysis, which is written using appropriate subject-specific terminology.
Each student submits the following for assessment.
a.

A written textual analysis (1,750 words maximum) and a list of all sources used.

Film guide

45 / 75

Preparation process
Selecting a film text
•
The IB releases a prescribed list of 10 films each year in the September edition of the DP Coordinators
notes.
•

The list is valid for two years for each individual year group of students.

•

Teachers select three to five film texts from the prescribed list for each DP film class they teach.
Teachers must ensure that the films they select are not studied in class at any point during the two-year
course, so it is advised that teachers familiarize themselves with the list as soon as it is released and
make any necessary adjustments to their planning.

•

Teachers share the titles of the three to five selected film texts with their students one month before
the task is due to be submitted to the teacher. While the selected film texts cannot be studied in depth
in class, a collective screening of the selected films is considered an appropriate way of ensuring that
students have access to the films and to enable them to make their final choices.

•

Each student chooses one film text from those selected by the teacher before undertaking the process
for assessment outlined below. The chosen film text must not have been previously studied by the
student and, once selected, the chosen film text cannot be used by the student in any other assessment
task for the DP film course or the extended essay.

Assessment process
In preparation for this task, students at SL and HL must have undertaken the activities outlined within the
“Reading film” section as part of the core syllabus. Students then undertake the following process for
assessment.

Inquiry
•
Each student identifies an extract from the chosen film text for analysis. The extract may be up to five
minutes in length and must be a single, continuous sequence of the film.
•

Each student carries out research into the chosen film text. This research should include consideration
of the cultural context of the chosen film text as well as a variety of film elements identified by the
student.

•

Each student carries out a detailed analysis of the selected extract, paying particular attention to how
meaning is constructed through the use of a variety of film elements (defined above) and formulating
their own interpretations.

•

Each student considers how the identified film elements in the selected extract relate to the cultural
context of the film, to the film text as a whole and, where appropriate, to other films, as identified by
the student.

Action
•
As a result of the inquiry process, each student completes a written analysis of the chosen film text and
extract (1,750 words maximum) using relevant and accurate subject-specific terminology. Each student
may incorporate supporting visual evidence where relevant and appropriate.
Reflection
•
Each student reflects on the learning undertaken in this task in order to review and refine their textual
analysis ahead of submission.

Task details
The textual analysis (1,750 words maximum) is not intended to be a thesis-driven essay. The focus of the
work should be on how meaning is created through the use of film elements in the chosen film text, with
consideration of the cultural context of the film and communicated through the use of relevant and accurate
subject-specific terminology common to the study of film and appropriate for film analysis.

Film guide

46 / 75

In this task, the examiner is looking for evidence of the extent to which the student is able to demonstrate an
understanding of:
•

the cultural context of the chosen film text

•

the use of film elements to construct meaning in the selected extract, using appropriate subject-specific
terminology

•

how the identified film elements in the selected extract relate to the cultural context of the film, to the
film text as a whole and, where appropriate, to other films, as identified by the student.

At the start of the textual analysis, students should clearly state which film elements they are going to
discuss.

Supporting visual evidence
Students may use carefully selected and relevant illustrations such as screen-grabs, visuals or diagrams
considered necessary to support their analysis of the chosen film text. These illustrations must be clearly
labelled and appropriately referenced to acknowledge the source, following the protocol of the referencing
style chosen by the school. The labels, which are excluded from the final word limit of the textual analysis,
should contain the minimum information needed to ensure the examiner understands the significance of the
illustration. Labels must not include commentary, as this will be considered as part of the textual analysis
discussion and therefore included in the word count.
Preparing the work for submission
The textual analysis should adopt a formal, academic register and may be written in the first person, reflecting
the student's personal opinion and reaction, where appropriate.
The finished textual analysis will be submitted online and students must ensure that their work is clear and
legible when presented in a digital, on-screen format. The textual analysis should be constructed using a
common page size (A4 or US Letter) and be typed in a legible sans serif 12-point font. Students must state
the number of words used at the end of the textual analysis.
The textual analysis must not be labelled with the student’s name in order to ensure anonymity in the marking
process.

Academic honesty and in-text citation
All sources must be acknowledged following the protocol of the referencing style chosen by the school.
•

If a student uses work, ideas or images belonging to another person in the textual analysis, the student
must acknowledge the source as an in-text citation.

•

Students must also submit a separate list of these sources using a standard style of referencing in a
consistent manner.

•

A student’s failure to appropriately acknowledge a source will be investigated by the IB as a potential
breach of regulations that may result in a penalty imposed by the IB final award committee.

Further information about citations can be found in the IB’s Effective citing and referencing guide.

The role of the teacher
Teachers must ensure that their students are appropriately prepared for the demands of this task through
the careful planning and delivery of the “Reading film” core syllabus areas.
Teachers are required to meet with students at each stage of inquiry, action and reflection to discuss the
progress made to date, and to verify the authenticity of the coursework being created by each student. The
key outcomes of these one-to-one interactions, which might be formal meetings and/or informal discussions
in the classroom, must be summarized by the teacher on the DP film Coursework authentication form (CAF),
which is submitted to the IB as part of the upload of external assessment material.

Film guide

47 / 75

The teacher should also:
•

ensure that the selected film has not been studied by the student before and that it is not used in any
other assessment task for the DP film course or the extended essay

•

ensure that students acknowledge all sources used, reference them as in-text citations appropriately
throughout the textual analysis and include them in the list of sources (which is excluded from the word
limit)

•

give feedback on one draft of the written textual analysis. Please note that the drafting and redrafting
of the textual analysis in response to teacher feedback is not permitted

•

encourage each student to reflect on their learning and experiences associated with this task.

Formal requirements of the task
Each student submits the following for assessment.
a.

A written textual analysis (1,750 words maximum) and a list of all sources used.

The procedure for submitting the assessment materials can be found in the Handbook of procedures for the
Diploma Programme.
Students should be informed that where the submitted materials exceed the maximum word limit for the
textual analysis, examiners will only assess the work that falls within the prescribed limits. Submitted work
must not contain any appendices as these will not be read by examiners.

Comparative study (SL and HL)
SL 30%, HL 20%

Introduction
Students at SL and HL carry out research into a chosen area of film focus, identifying and comparing two
films from within that area and presenting their discoveries as a recorded multimedia comparative study.
Each student submits the following for assessment.
a.

A recorded multimedia comparative study (10 minutes maximum).

b.

A list of all sources used.

Terminology
Film focus
For this task, students select an area of film focus that interests and excites them from one of the following.
•

Film movements (such as French New Wave, German expressionism, Third Cinema, and so on)

•

Film genre and film style (such as film noir, romantic comedy, science fiction, Western, and so on)

•

Film theory (such as auteur theory, feminism, Marxist film theory, and so on)

Cultural context
For this assessment task, cultural context involves consideration of some of the following factors, some of
which may be blended (such as socio-economic factors).Economic
•

Geographical

•

Historical

•

Institutional

•

Political

•

Social

•

Technological

Preparation process
The early stages of this task require students to carry out research into film concepts, theories, practices and
ideas that interest and excite them, and that will ensure maximum potential for meeting the needs of the
assessment task criteria. From this research, they identify the task components for a recorded multimedia
comparative study.
Terminology
Task components
For this assessment task, each student identifies, selects and researches each of the following task
components.
1.

One area of film focus (from the list above).

2.

Two films for comparison from within the chosen area of film focus, one of which originates from a
contrasting time (historical) or space (geographical) to the personal context of the student, and the other
film identified for comparison must arise from a contrasting cultural context to the first film. Students
are required to select films they have not previously studied in depth. The selected films cannot come
from the prescribed list of film texts provided for the textual analysis assessment task and, once
selected, the films cannot be used by the student in any other assessment task for the DP film course
or the extended essay.

3.

A clearly defined topic for a recorded multimedia comparative study, which links both the selected films
and the identified area of film focus.

Film guide

The assessment criteria for this task requires students to provide a strong justification for the choice of task
components as part of the recorded multimedia comparative study. This includes the student’s justification
for how the films arise from contrasting cultural contexts.

Assessment process
In preparation for this task, students at SL and HL must have undertaken the activities outlined within the
“Contextualizing film” section as part of the core syllabus. Students then undertake the following process for
assessment.

Inquiry
•
Each student carries out broad research, using both primary and secondary sources, in order to
investigate possible areas of film focus and films for comparison from within the areas of film focus,
using materials from a range of sources, including original films, critiques, publications and other media.
Each student decides the selection of the task components, which includes a clearly defined topic for
the comparative study. Each student defines the cultural context of the selected films and justifies why
these task components were chosen for the comparative study.
•

Each student undergoes a process of comparing and contrasting their selected films (and carrying out
further focused research into the task components) in order to deepen their understanding of each
film.

Action
•
Each student assembles their findings, developing a personal and critically reflective perspective, and
identifies and gathers appropriate audio-visual material to support the study.
•

As a result of the inquiry and action processes outlined above, each student prepares a recorded
multimedia comparative study (10 minutes maximum) for submission, ensuring a balance between
visual and spoken elements, while making clear reference to their sources as on-screen citations. The
primary weight of evidence for the study should be selected from the two chosen films.

Reflection
•
Students reflect on the learning undertaken in this task, and review and refine their comparative study
ahead of submission.

Task details
The comparative study is a recorded multimedia presentation (10 minutes maximum) comprising sound and
images. The selection and assembly of the material for submission is an important aspect of the task, and
students should ensure that information is communicated clearly, logically and audibly in a visually
appropriate manner.
In this task, the examiner is looking for evidence of the extent to which students are able to demonstrate an
understanding of the following.
•

The task components selected for the study (the area of film focus, two films and the topic), which
should include the cultural context of the selected films and a justification of why these components
were chosen for the comparative study.

•

The links that exist between the selected films, as well as the student’s ability to identify connections,
similarities and differences while relating these back to the chosen area of film focus. Students should
ensure they give equal weight to both of the films selected for study in their analysis.

•

How to effectively construct a comparative study in order to present the work undertaken clearly,
logically and in a visually appropriate manner, supporting their work throughout with accurate and
appropriate film terminology.

Recorded commentary
The comparative study must contain a recording of the student’s voice throughout, introducing the study and
justifying the chosen topic and selected films, as well as providing the commentary for the main body of the
work. This voiced commentary may be recorded numerous times until the student is happy with the material.
Students may also, if they choose, use a pre-written script (which must be the student’s own work) to be
Film guide

52 / 75

read, recorded and edited into the comparative study. They may also include breaks in their recorded
commentary to enable other audio-visual material included in the study to be clearly heard, and likewise
should reduce the volume of audio-visual material during the recorded commentary to ensure it is entirely
audible.
Please note: The student must not appear on screen at any time in the comparative study.

Use of audio-visual material and copyright
On-screen text, keynote slides, still images, animations, audio recordings and carefully selected and relevant
clips from the selected films are all permitted within the comparative study, where appropriate. The primary
weight of audio-visual evidence must come from the two chosen films and the student’s recorded voice. While
the length of film clips a student can use is not dictated, the clip length should directly match the specific
point being made by the student in the recorded commentary.
•

Each student must use legal copies of their two chosen films in order to extract the video or audio
content for editing into the comparative study. Once the final comparative study has been submitted for
assessment to the IB, each student must ensure that the extracted media files are destroyed.

•

Students must be aware that their work is solely for academic purposes and that they are not permitted
to share or distribute any copyright-protected content used in the comparative study outside of the IB
without the express written consent of the copyright holder(s).

•

Students are required to clearly reference the two chosen films in the submitted list of sources.

•

It is the responsibility of the student to obtain, extract and delete any copyright materials used for this
task.

Black slate
The comparative study must begin with a 10-second black slate (included in the total time limit) that clearly
states the chosen task components using on-screen text. The student’s recorded commentary, which
begins simultaneously with the black slate, should address the justification of these task components.

Preparing the work for submission
The comparative study should adopt a formal, academic register and may be delivered in the first person, as
appropriate, presenting the student’s personal opinion and perspective as a film student.
The finished comparative study will be submitted online. Students must ensure that their recorded voiceover
is clear and audible, and that any text is legible when viewed on screen. Overcrowded or inaudible materials
may result in examiners being unable to interpret and understand the intentions of the work, which will result
in the examiner being unable to reward the full scope of the work. Where appropriate, students may use
subtitles to facilitate understanding.
The comparative study must not be labelled with the student’s name in order to ensure anonymity in the
marking process.

Further examples of possible task components can be found in the Film teacher support material.

Academic honesty and on-screen citation
All sources must be acknowledged following the protocol of the referencing style chosen by the school.
•

If a student uses work, ideas or images belonging to another person in the comparative study, the
student must acknowledge the source as an on-screen citation during the submitted multimedia study,
either as a voiced reference as part of the recorded commentary or as on-screen text.

•

Students must also submit a separate list of these sources using a standard style of referencing in a
consistent manner.

•

A student’s failure to appropriately acknowledge a source used in the recorded multimedia comparative
study (as outlined in the “Use of audio-visual material and copyright” section), will be investigated by
the IB as a potential breach of regulations that may result in a penalty imposed by the IB final award
committee.

Further information about citations can be found in the IB’s Effective citing and referencing guide.

The role of the teacher
Teachers must ensure that their students are prepared for the demands of this task through the careful
planning and delivery of the “Contextualizing film” core syllabus areas.
It is important for students to have exposure to a range of film movements, genres, styles and theories as
part of the taught content of the DP film course in order to enable them to approach this assessment task
with a broad foundation in the subject area. Teachers are reminded that films previously studied in depth
may not be used by students for this assessment.
Teachers are required to meet with students at each stage of inquiry, action and reflection to discuss the
progress made to date, and to verify the authenticity of the coursework being created by each student. The
key outcomes of these one-to-one interactions, which might be formal meetings and/or informal discussions
in the classroom, must be summarized by the teacher on the DP film Coursework authentication form, which
is submitted to the IB as part of the upload of assessment material.
The teacher should also:
•

discuss each student’s choice of task components (the area of film focus, two films and topic),
encouraging them to engage with films that contrast with the student’s own personal context in terms
of time (historical) and space (geographical). It is important that the two selected films are authentically
identified and chosen by the student and not by the teacher

Film guide

54 / 75

•

ensure that the two films chosen for comparison have not been studied by the student before and that
they are not used by the student in any other assessment task for the DP film course or the extended
essay

•

ensure that students acknowledge all sources used and reference them as on-screen citations
appropriately throughout the comparative study and include them in the separate list of sources

•

assist students with setting up the necessary technical hardware and software to enable the recording
of the student’s voiceover and facilitate the student’s assembly of their chosen visual and audio
components

•

give verbal or written feedback to one draft version of the recorded multimedia comparative study.
Please note that the drafting and redrafting of the work in response to teacher feedback is not permitted

•

encourage each student to reflect on their learning and experiences associated with this task.

Formal requirements of the task
Each student submits the following for assessment.
a.

A recorded multimedia comparative study (10 minutes maximum).

b.

A list of all sources used.

The procedure for submitting the assessment materials can be found in the Handbook of procedures for the
Diploma Programme.
Students should be informed that where the submitted materials exceed the maximum time limit for the
comparative study, examiners will only assess the work that falls within the prescribed limits. Materials that
fall under the minimum time limit are likely to be self-penalising. Submitted work must not contain any
appendices as these will not be read by examiners.

Internal assessment

Purpose of internal assessment
Internal assessment is an integral part of the course and is compulsory for both SL and HL students. It
enables students to demonstrate the application of their skills and knowledge, and to pursue their personal
interests, without the time limitations and other constraints that are associated with written examinations. The
internal assessment should, as far as possible, be woven into normal classroom teaching and not be a
separate activity conducted after a course has been taught.
The internal assessment requirements at SL and at HL are different. SL and HL students complete the film
portfolio but only HL students complete the collaborative film project.

Guidance and authenticity
The film portfolio (SL and HL) and collaborative film project (HL only) submitted for internal assessment must
be the student’s own work. The teacher should play an important role during both the planning stage and the
period when the student is working on the internally assessed work. It is the responsibility of the teacher to
ensure that students are familiar with:
•

the requirements of the type of work to be internally assessed

•

the assessment criteria; students must understand that the work submitted for assessment must
address these criteria effectively.

Teachers and students must discuss the internally assessed work. Students should be encouraged to initiate
discussions with the teacher to obtain advice and information, and students must not be penalized for seeking
guidance. As part of the learning process, teachers should read and give advice to students on one draft of
the work. The teacher should provide oral or written advice on how the work could be improved, but not edit
the draft. The next version handed to the teacher must be the final version for submission.
It is the responsibility of teachers to ensure that all students understand the basic meaning and significance
of concepts that relate to academic honesty, especially authenticity and intellectual property. Teachers must
ensure that all student work for assessment is prepared according to the requirements and must explain
clearly to students that the internally assessed work must be entirely their own. Where collaboration between
students is permitted, it must be clear to all students what the difference is between collaboration and
collusion.
All work submitted to the IB for moderation or assessment must be authenticated by a teacher, and must not
include any known instances of suspected or confirmed malpractice. Each student must confirm that the work
is his or her authentic work and constitutes the final version of that work. Once a student has officially
submitted the final version of the work it cannot be retracted. The requirement to confirm the authenticity of
work applies to the work of all students, not just the sample work that will be submitted to the IB for the
purpose of moderation. For further details, refer to the IB publications Academic honesty, the Diploma
Programme: From principles into practice and the relevant articles in General regulations: Diploma
Programme.
Authenticity may be checked by discussion with the student on the content of the work, and scrutiny of one
or more of the following.
•

The student’s initial proposal

•

One draft of the work

•

The references cited

•

The style of writing compared with work known to be that of the student

Film guide

59 / 75

•

The analysis of written work, where appropriate, by a web-based plagiarism detection service such as
www.turnitin.com

The same piece of work cannot be submitted to meet the requirements of both the internal assessment and
the extended essay.

Time allocation
Internal assessment is an integral part of the DP film course, contributing 40% of the final assessment in the
SL course and 60% in the HL course. This weighting should be reflected in the time that is allocated to
teaching the knowledge, skills and understanding required to undertake the work, as well as the total time
allocated to carry out the work.

Using assessment criteria for internal assessment
For internal assessment, a number of assessment criteria have been identified. Each assessment criterion
has level descriptors describing specific achievement levels, together with an appropriate range of marks.
The level descriptors concentrate on positive achievement, although for the lower levels failure to achieve
may be included in the description.
Teachers must judge the internally assessed work at SL and at HL against the criteria using the level
descriptors.
•

The same assessment criteria are provided for SL and HL in the film portfolio.

•

The aim is to find, for each criterion, the descriptor that conveys most accurately the level attained by
the student, using the best-fit model. A best-fit approach means that compensation should be made
when a piece of work matches different aspects of a criterion at different levels. The mark awarded
should be one that most fairly reflects the balance of achievement against the criterion. It is not
necessary for every single aspect of a level descriptor to be met for that mark to be awarded.

•

When assessing a student’s work, teachers should read the level descriptors for each criterion until
they reach a descriptor that most appropriately describes the level of the work being assessed. If a
piece of work seems to fall between two descriptors, both descriptors should be read again and the one
that more appropriately describes the student’s work should be chosen.

•

Where there are two or more marks available within a level, teachers should award the upper marks if
the student’s work demonstrates the qualities described to a great extent; the work may be close to
achieving marks in the level above. Teachers should award the lower marks if the student’s work
demonstrates the qualities described to a lesser extent; the work may be close to achieving marks in
the level below.

•

Only whole numbers should be recorded; partial marks (fractions and decimals) are not acceptable.

•

Teachers should not think in terms of a pass or fail boundary, but should concentrate on identifying the
appropriate descriptor for each assessment criterion.

•

The highest level descriptors do not imply faultless performance but should be achievable by a student.
Teachers should not hesitate to use the extremes if they are appropriate descriptions of the work being
assessed.

•

A student who attains a high achievement level in relation to one criterion will not necessarily attain high
achievement levels in relation to the other criteria. Similarly, a student who attains a low achievement
level for one criterion will not necessarily attain low achievement levels for the other criteria. Teachers
should not assume that the overall assessment of the students will produce any particular distribution
of marks.

•

It is recommended that the assessment criteria be made available to students.

Film portfolio (SL and HL)
SL 40%, HL 25%

Introduction
Students at SL and HL undertake a variety of filmmaking exercises in a range of film production roles in
order to fulfill defined filmmaker intentions. They acquire and develop practical skills and techniques
through participation in film exercises, experiments and the creation of at least one completed film. Students
reflect on how learning has further contributed to their understanding of film production roles and the extent
to which their filmmaker intentions were fulfilled.
Each student submits a film portfolio for assessment, containing the following.
a.

Portfolio pages (9 pages maximum: 3 pages maximum per film production role) and a list of all
sources used.

b.

A film reel (9 minutes maximum: 3 minutes maximum per film production role, including one
completed film).

Terminology
Film production roles
For this assessment task, students must work in three discrete film production roles selected from the
following list.
•

Cinematographer

•

Director

•

Editor

•

Sound

•

Writer

•

One other clearly defined film production role not specified above (see below).

The intention of the optional “one other clearly defined film production role” is to ensure that as new
technologies emerge over time, centres that become equipped with appropriate film technologies and
expertise can incorporate them into their film courses to further broaden the production experiences of their
candidates. This may be any role deemed a creative role within the filmmaking process such as animator, art
director, costume designer, production designer, production illustrator or special effects. Film teachers are
not expected to teach these optional roles as part of the core syllabus; however, students who show
enthusiasm or aptitude in these areas may wish to explore outside of the more traditional film roles offered.
Please note: The “one other clearly defined film production role” may only count as one of the three film
production roles selected for this assessment. The other two roles must come from the prescribed list.
Filmmaker intentions
For this assessment task, students are required to identify specific intentions for their work in each chosen
film production role. These filmmaker intentions, which are likely to arise from exposure to influences from
other films and filmmakers, are intended to lead the process of practical exploration and experimentation in
each film production role. Therefore, the filmmaker intentions should be authentic and meaningful
personal goals that the student is passionate about fulfilling.
Students may or may not necessarily fulfill their stated filmmaker intentions in their production work, and
they should be encouraged to reflect on the process of learning in this area.

Preparation process
Creative risk-taking
This assessment task calls for students to take the lead in approaching unfamiliar situations, and to explore
and develop new skills and techniques in order to make discoveries. This task goes to the heart of the
IB learner profile and requires students to approach their learning with forethought, independence and a
willingness to fail and try again. This is the very essence of being a risk-taker. Students are bound to come
across successes and challenges in equal measure as they grapple with film production roles and the
Film guide

61 / 75

associated technologies. They should therefore be encouraged to embrace these challenges and give equal
value to the areas that pushed and developed them as to the areas that come more naturally. It is important
that students perceive the value of failure as part of their process of learning in this task from the outset.
Students should be reminded that creative risk-taking does not allow for breaching rules regarding ethical
content or the disregard of health and safety considerations.

Assessment process
In preparation for this task, students at SL and HL must have undertaken the activities outlined within the
“Exploring film production roles” section as part of the core syllabus. Students then undertake the following
process for assessment.

Inquiry
•
Each student reflects on their experiences of watching, discussing and writing about films. They identify
areas of filmmaking that excite and inspire them, and develop filmmaker intentions they would like to
achieve through production work.
•

Using both primary and secondary sources, each student carries out research into three selected film
production roles they would like to work in, and acquires an understanding of how these discrete roles
contribute to filmmaking, as well as an understanding of the industry practices and techniques required
to work in these areas.

•

Each student formulates a plan for practically exploring the chosen film production roles in order to
acquire, develop and apply skills, and to fulfill their stated filmmaker intentions.

Action
•
Each student undertakes a range of practical production activities in the chosen film production roles
they have selected. They experience working both individually and collaboratively in both teacherinitiated and self-initiated film activities, grappling with the skills associated with the film production
roles and attempting to effectively fulfill their stated filmmaker intentions. This must include the
creation of at least one completed film (3 minutes maximum).
Reflection
•
Making clear links to the identified films and filmmakers that inspired this work, each student reflects on
their explorations and on the impact this learning has had on their understanding of the three film
production roles in which they have worked, and the extent to which they fulfilled their filmmaker
intentions.
•

As a result of the outlined inquiry, action and reflection processes, each student compiles a film portfolio
for assessment containing portfolio pages (9 pages maximum: 3 pages maximum per film production
role), a list of all sources used and a film reel (9 minutes maximum: 3 minutes maximum per film
production role, including one completed film).

Task details
For this assessment task, students are required to work in three clearly defined film production roles for
which they will be generating evidence for submission. Students must be made aware of the specific
requirements of this task from early on in the DP film course to ensure that they make informed choices about
which film production roles they wish to select, and to create and maintain a digital space in which to retain
the clips of evidence they generate.
Students are required to define filmmaker intentions for each film production role.
•

These intentions must be authentically identified by the student and must lead all practical production
activities for this assessment task.

•

Students should clearly identify in their written materials the influences that have helped shape their
filmmaker intentions.

•

Students are expected to reflect on the extent to which their filmmaker intentions have been fulfilled
in their work, and the ways in which this work has further shaped their understanding of how each film
production role contributes to effective filmmaking.

Film guide

62 / 75

Ethical filmmaking
As part of the collective consideration of the school, film students must be supported in maintaining an ethical
perspective during their course. Schools must be vigilant to ensure that work undertaken by the student is
appropriate for the context of the school and the age of the students.
Student work for this assessment task must not:
•

damage the environment

•

glamorize the taking of drugs

•

incite or condone intolerance or hatred of others

•

include excessive or gratuitous violence

•

make reference to, or represent, explicit sexual activity.

In this task, the moderator is particularly interested in the extent to which students can evaluate their
acquisition, development and application of film production skills and the ways in which these contribute to a
greater understanding of how film production roles contribute to effective filmmaking. They are also looking
for evidence of:
•

understanding of each selected film production role and filmmaker intentions for working in these
roles

•

the student’s engagement with the film production roles and the experience of practical exploration
in order to fulfill their filmmaker intentions and hone their skills

•

reflection and evaluation of their ongoing film production work and the impact this learning has had on
their understanding of the three film production roles in which they have worked, and the extent to
which they fulfilled their filmmaker intentions.

Please note: No element of the work submitted for this assessment may appear in any other DP film
assessment (including the HL collaborative film project task).

Gathering evidence for assessment
During the two-year course, students must participate in a variety of original production activities in their three
chosen film production roles in order to generate numerous clips of evidence for this task. This evidence
may take the form of the following types of film material.
Evidence

Description

Exercises and
experiments

These are the best clips from film exercises or experimental activities that demonstrate
proficiency in the production skills appropriate to each film production role. The
activities might have been initiated for the sake of training, the improvement of skills or
the discovery of something previously unrealized. They may be undertaken without
necessarily intending to create a completed film or a finished product to be seen by an
audience and can be teacher-led or initiated by the student.

Completed
films and
excerpts

These are completed projects that have all technical parts or elements in place and
are intended as either fully completed films or as excerpts from completed films that
are suitable for screening to an audience. As part of this assessment task, students
must submit at least one completed film (3 minutes in length maximum) on which they
have worked in one film production role. Completed films submitted for assessment
must not include credits, in order to ensure student anonymity. The creation of
completed films must not be teacher-led.

Working with others
Students may choose to work with other people in the creation of their film production work, or may work
independently if they wish. Students can choose to work collaboratively in production teams with fellow
students from their film class, with students from other film classes in the school, or with students in the
school who are not studying film. They can also choose to work with a combination of all three options.

Film guide

63 / 75

Where production work is collaborative, all film production roles must be taken on by students from the
same school, and there must not be any duplication of film production roles within the production team
(that is, there should be only one cinematographer, only one director, and so on). Professionals or students
from other schools may not be part of the production team.
Where students choose to work with individuals who are not part of the DP film class, teachers must ensure
that they are able to regularly oversee production work and schedule consultations with the students to
ensure that they are able to verify the authenticity of the work being produced for assessment.
Actors appearing in production work may be adults or members of the wider community; however, teachers
must ensure that all of the appropriate safeguarding measures (as defined by the individual school) have
been taken when students are working with other adults.
Please note: No part of the work undertaken in this project can be used for the collaborative film project
assessment task.

Structuring the portfolio pages
The portfolio pages should present an edited collection of key learning experiences intended to showcase
the filmmaker’s intentions, approach, planning work and development of skills in a variety of film production
roles.
The portfolio pages (9 pages maximum: 3 pages maximum per film production role) provide documentary
evidence of the student’s work in each of the three roles undertaken during the task. They should clearly
articulate the process involved in acquiring and developing production skills in each of the three film
production roles, and provide evidence of the application and exploration of these skills in practice. The
pages should also indicate key influences from research and provide a sense of the student voice as they
grapple with challenges in order to further develop their understanding of each role.
The portfolio pages should contain a balance between written work and visual evidence, and are likely to
consist of annotated extracts from the student’s planning documentation (including excerpts from scripts,
storyboards and planning notes).The layout and word count for the portfolio pages are intentionally not
prescribed for this task in order to provide students with creative freedom in determining how best to present
their explorations and findings.
The portfolio pages should contain a table of contents and a list of the clips submitted to evidence each
specific film production role (providing the timecode and a brief description for each clip on the film reel).
These are excluded from the overall page count.

Supporting visual evidence
Students are encouraged to use relevant illustrations, charts, mind maps, visuals, diagrams or designs in
their portfolio pages. They may also include their own photographs, images or scans, as necessary, ensuring
they are of an appropriate quality. All illustrations must be clearly labelled and appropriately referenced to
acknowledge the source, following the protocol of the referencing style chosen by the school.
Preparing the work for submission
The portfolio pages are assessed on screen and students must ensure that their work is clear and legible
when presented in a digital, on-screen format. The work should be created using a common page size (A4
or US Letter) and be typed in a legible sans serif 12-point font. The portfolio pages may contain legible
handwriting.
The film portfolio must not be labelled with the student’s name or include any credits in order to ensure
anonymity in the marking process.

Structuring the film reel
Students are required to select clips of evidence from their gathered film production work in order to assemble
a film reel for assessment. The film reel, which is submitted as one single video file, must contain three
chapters (one for each discrete film production role) and be structured as follows.
Film reel

Students are strongly encouraged to submit multiple clips of evidence for film production roles 1 and 2, as
long as the combined material for each role does not exceed 3 minutes maximum. The recommended
minimum length of each clip is 30 seconds. Students must submit a completed film (without credits) for film
production role 3.
Teachers should remind students that the clips of evidence submitted in the film reel should represent the
best work in each selected film production role and that the work will be judged on how it best fulfills the
assessment criteria for the task. Materials submitted that do not provide sufficient evidence of skill in the
selected production role will result in a compromised mark for that role.

Black slate
The film reel must be structured using a 10-second black slate (excluded from the total time limit), which is
placed before each of the three film production roles in order to identify each clip of evidence submitted
per role and the length of each clip.

Use of audio-visual material and copyright
In this task, students are expected to be the original creators of, or have a significant role in the creation of,
all of the material submitted for assessment. Therefore, submitted work for this task must not contain any
copyright material.
Materials sourced from creative commons websites or copyright-free materials (such as sound effects or
sample graphics) are permitted in this task; however, these should be kept to a minimum. Students who
choose to include creative commons or copyright-free materials are required to clearly state in their portfolio
pages why they chose to use the creative commons or copyright-free materials, where the materials can be
seen or heard in the film reel and the ways in which the student has adapted or altered that material for use
in this task. The materials must also be appropriately referenced in the submitted list of sources.
Students should make every effort to ensure that all images and sounds contained within their film reel are
deliberately planned, managed and included as an intentional part of the work. Students should therefore
make every effort, where achievable, to prevent situational advertising, branding and unintentional
background images and audio from appearing in their film work.

Academic honesty
All sources must be acknowledged following the protocol of the referencing style chosen by the school.
Film guide

65 / 75

•

If a student uses work, ideas or images belonging to another person in the film portfolio, the student
must acknowledge the source using a standard style of referencing in a consistent manner.

•

A student’s failure to acknowledge a source, which includes the use of creative commons or
copyright-free material used in the film reel (as outlined in the “Use of audio-visual material and
copyright” section), will be investigated by the IB as a potential breach of regulations that may result in
a penalty imposed by the IB final award committee.

The role of the teacher
Teachers must ensure that their students are appropriately prepared for the demands of this task through
the careful planning and delivery of the “Exploring film production roles” core syllabus area. Only specific
elements of this task may be teacher-led, and students should be made fully aware of the assessment criteria
against which their work will be judged. Exercises and experiments that are led by the teacher must still
demonstrate student initiative and voice. The teacher should stress the importance of risk-taking, trial and
error, and the value of failure in developing the skills required for the film portfolio.
While students are working on this assessment task, the teacher should:
•

discuss with each student their filmmaker intentions, influences, exploration with techniques, as well
as ethical considerations and the age-appropriateness of the subject matter

•

ensure that students work in three separate roles, as outlined in the guide

•

assist with sourcing and maintaining the necessary technical hardware and software to enable students
to effectively work in a variety of film production roles and to facilitate the student’s assembly of their
film portfolio. It is important that the submitted exercises, experiments, completed films and excerpts
from completed films and accompanying portfolio pages are the student’s own choice

•

remind students that their work will be assessed on how it best fulfills the assessment criteria for the
task, and not judged on how many clips or portfolio pages are submitted

•

ensure each student acknowledges all sources used throughout the film portfolio and includes them in
the list of sources (which is excluded from the page count)

•

give feedback on one draft of the film portfolio

•

meet with students at each stage of inquiry, action and reflection to discuss the progress made to date
and to verify the authenticity of the work being created by each student

•

authenticate the completed film portfolio and provide comments on each student’s submission to assist
with moderation.

Formal requirements of the task
Each student submits a film portfolio for assessment, containing the following.
a.

Portfolio pages (9 pages maximum: 3 pages per film production role) and a list of all sources used.

b.

A film reel (9 minutes maximum: 3 minutes maximum per film production role).

The procedure for submitting the assessment materials can be found in the Handbook of procedures for the
Diploma Programme.

Film guide

66 / 75

Students should be informed that where the submitted materials exceed the maximum page and time limits
for each film production role within the film portfolio, moderators will only assess the work that falls within
the prescribed limits. Submitted work must not contain any appendices as these will not be read by
moderators.

Collaborative film project (HL only)
HL 35%

Introduction
Making clear links to films and filmmakers they have encountered, concepts and contexts explored, and skills
and techniques acquired, students at HL work collaboratively to plan and create an original completed film.
Students work in core production teams of two to four students for this project, with each individual writing
a project report that supports and evidences their chosen film production role taken during the production
phases.
The focus of this task is on the nature of collaboration throughout the creative process and on the individual
student’s ability to effectively contribute to the successful realization of the group’s agreed intentions.
Each student submits the following.
a.

A project report (2,000 words maximum) and a list of all sources used.

b.

A completed film (7 minutes maximum).

Terminology
Core production team
For the purposes of this assessment task, students are required to work collaboratively as part of core
production teams of two to four students from within the school community. Students can choose to work
collaboratively with other DP film students from the same class (including SL students), with students from
the school who are not part of the DP film course (including film students in the year below or students who
are not taking DP film) or a mix of both. The core production team is fully responsible for defining the scope
of the original film and for ensuring that all creative and logistical aspects of pre-production, production and
post-production are carried out successfully.
While each student in the group will take on one single film production role (defined below) it is expected
that, as members of the core production team, each student will take on numerous other responsibilities
and tasks during the project in order to support the cooperative realization of the completed film. This flexible
and supportive collaboration is central to this assessment task and each student should keep a record of the
nature of their collaborations. They should reflect on their approaches to team work, problem-solving, time
management and conflict resolution as a member of the core production team, and should evaluate the
successes and challenges encountered as part of the creative process.
Film production roles
For the purposes of this assessment task, students must take responsibility for one of the following film
production roles (one discrete role per student in the group) for which they will be assessed.
•

Cinematographer

•

Director

•

Editor

•

Sound

•

Writer

Please note: The “one other clearly defined film production role not specified above” that appears in the
film portfolio assessment task is not available as an option for this HL task.

Preparation process
In preparation for this task, HL students should reflect on their own personal experiences, interests and skills
in film. This is essentially an audit of the experiences of the DP film course to date, and a process of
identifying where each individual is at the start of the project, and what they are able to bring to the task.
Students then use the outcome of this process to support the formation of the core production teams and
the sharing of ideas in order to formulate a plan for an original film.

Film guide

69 / 75

Assessment process
In preparation for this task, students at HL must have undertaken the activities outlined within the
“Collaboratively producing film” section of the core syllabus. Students then undertake the following process
for assessment.

Inquiry
•
Each student joins a core production team, making a group of two to four students from the school
community. Each member of the core production team discusses the contexts within which they will
work, developing an overall framework for their original film (which is inspired by research), considering
both theoretical approaches, such as genre and style, as well as practical considerations.
•

Each core production team collaboratively creates a plan for an original film. The group clearly
identifies their agreed intentions for the film, the roles each member of the core production team will
take and the influences that have informed the group’s plan.

•

Each core production team seeks approval for the plan for filming from the teacher. Once approved,
each student begins planning their involvement in the production, including the selection of their one
film production role.

Action
•
Each core production team collaboratively engages in the pre-production, production and postproduction phases in order to produce the completed film. Each student is expected to participate in all
three phases of production regardless of the individual film production role they have taken for
assessment purposes.
•

Each student carries out their one film production role, making considered creative choices and
deploying their skills in order to contribute to the overall effectiveness of the film.

Reflection
•
Each student reflects on the collaborative creation of the completed film through the production phases,
and critiques both their own individual contribution throughout the collaborative film project, as well as
the quality of the final product.
•

As a result of the inquiry and action processes, each student presents and documents their individual
contribution to the completion of the completed film piece as a project report.

Task details
The original film created by each core production team should be a maximum of 7 minutes in length. The
completed film submitted for assessment must not include credits, in order to ensure student anonymity.
In this task, the moderator is looking for evidence of the extent to which students are able to demonstrate an
understanding of:
•

the core production team’s agreed intentions, the discrete film production roles taken and the
influences that have informed the group’s plan

•

the creative choices made in their one chosen film production role and the ability to deploy their skills
in order to contribute to the success of the final film

•

the ability to evaluate their participation in the collaborative phases of production and to critique the
strengths and weaknesses of their own work.

Ethical filmmaking
DP film students must be supported in maintaining an ethical perspective during their course. Schools must
be vigilant to ensure that work undertaken by the student is appropriate for the context of the school and the
age of the students.
Student work for this assessment task must not:
•

damage the environment

Film guide

70 / 75

•

glamorize the taking of drugs

•

incite or condone intolerance or hatred of others

•

include excessive or gratuitous violence

•

make reference to, or represent, explicit sexual activity.

Working with others
Only students from the school are permitted to be members of the core production team. These can be
DP film students (including SL students) or other students from the school who are not part of the course
(including film students in the year below or students who are not taking DP film), as long as the size of the
core production team is between two and four students. Each member of the core production team must
have one discrete film production role from the list provided.
Where students choose to form core production teams with individuals who are not part of the DP film
class, teachers must ensure that they are able to regularly observe team meetings, monitor production work
and schedule consultations with the students to ensure that they are able to verify the authenticity of the work
being produced for assessment.
Core production teams are permitted to enlist the help of other people in the creation of their original films,
such as production assistants, actors and crew members, so long as all key decision-making is still made by
the two to four members of the core production team. These additional individuals (with the exception of
actors) must be students from the same school. Actors may be adults or members of the wider community;
however, teachers must ensure that all of the appropriate safeguarding measures (as defined by the
individual school) have been taken when students are working with other adults.
Please note: No part of the work undertaken in this project can be used for the film portfolio assessment task
by any HL students involved in the project. Likewise, work undertaken for the film portfolio assessment task
cannot be submitted for this HL task. SL students who volunteer to be involved in the project, however, are
permitted to evidence their work in a clearly defined film production role for assessment purposes in the
film portfolio task.

Structuring the project report
The project report (2,000 words) is a written account of the student’s involvement in the collaborative film
project. The project report should demonstrate the student’s ability to evaluate and reflect upon the
collaborative creation of their completed film, supported by carefully selected evidence of their individual
contributions to the finished product, working in their one film production role.
Students should order their project report using the following headings.
1.

Production proposal

2.

Creative work in the production phases

3.

Critique and reflection

The project report should contain a table of contents (excluded from the page count), which should also
clearly state the number of words the student has used.

Supporting visual evidence
Students may use carefully selected and relevant illustrations, charts, mind maps, visuals, diagrams or
designs considered necessary in the project report. They may also include their own photographs, images
or scans, as necessary, ensuring they are of an appropriate quality. All illustrations must be clearly labelled
and appropriately referenced to acknowledge the source, following the protocol of the referencing style
chosen by the school. The labels, which are excluded from the final word limit of the project report, should
contain the minimum information to ensure the examiner understands the significance of the illustration.
Labels must not include commentary, as this will be considered as part of the project report discussion and
therefore included in the word count.

Film guide

71 / 75

Preparing the work for submission
The project report is assessed on screen so students must ensure that their work is clear and legible when
presented in a digital, on-screen format. The project report should be created using a common page size (A4
or US Letter) and be typed in a legible sans-serif 12-point font. The work may also contain legible handwriting.
The collaborative film project work must not be labelled with the student’s name or include any credits in
order to ensure anonymity in the marking process.

Use of audio-visual material and copyright
In this task, students are expected to be the original creators of, or have a significant role in the creation of,
all of the material submitted for assessment. Therefore, submitted work for this task must not contain any
copyright material.
Materials sourced from creative commons websites or copyright-free materials (such as sound effects or
sample graphics) are permitted in this task; however, these should be kept to a minimum. Students who
choose to include creative commons or copyright-free materials are required to clearly state in their project
report why they chose to use the creative commons or copyright-free materials, where the materials can be
seen or heard in the completed film and the ways in which the student has adapted or altered that material
for use in this task. The materials must also be appropriately referenced in the submitted list of sources.
Students should make every effort to ensure that all images and sounds contained within the completed film
are deliberately planned, managed and included as an intentional part of the film’s narrative. Students should
therefore make every effort, where achievable, to prevent situational advertising, branding and unintentional
background images and audio from appearing in their film work.

Academic honesty
All sources must be acknowledged following the protocol of the referencing style chosen by the school.
•

If a student uses work, ideas or images belonging to another person in the collaborative film project,
the student must acknowledge the source using a standard style of referencing in a consistent manner.

•

A student’s failure to acknowledge a source, which includes the use of creative commons or
copyright-free material used in the completed film (as outlined in the “Use of audio-visual material
and copyright” section), will be investigated by the IB as a potential breach of regulations that may result
in a penalty imposed by the IB final award committee.

The role of the teacher
Teachers must use sound judgment as to how much assistance or support can be provided, remembering
at all times that this is a student-oriented task. In general, teacher assistance in work intended for assessment
should be confined to asking questions, making suggestions and offering technical guidance. The situation
is comparable to a teacher commenting on a draft of an essay, offering pointers for ways to improve the work
but refraining from doing any of that work for the student.
Teachers must ensure that their students are appropriately prepared for the demands of this task through
the careful planning and delivery of the “Collaboratively producing film” core syllabus activities. This
assessment task must not be teacher-led and students should be made fully aware of the assessment criteria
against which their work will be judged.
Teachers are required to meet with students at each stage of inquiry, action and reflection to discuss the
progress made to date, and to verify the authenticity of the coursework being created by each student. The
key outcomes of these one-to-one interactions, which might be formal meetings and/or informal discussions
in the classroom, must be summarized by the teacher on the DP film Coursework authentication form (CAF),
which is submitted to the IB as part of the upload of external assessment material.
The teacher should also:
•

discuss with each student their intentions and influences, including but not limited to proposed
techniques and methods, as well as age-appropriateness of subject matter

•

ensure that health and safety matters are fully addressed for all participants

Film guide

72 / 75

•

ensure that students are acknowledging all sources used, and referencing them appropriately

•

ensure that students have worked with an appropriate number of other students to form core
production teams, as outlined above

•

assist with sourcing and maintaining the necessary technical hardware and software to enable students
to effectively work in their discrete film production roles and create their completed films

•

use their best judgment in assisting students, keeping in mind that this is an assessment task. Their
help should generally be limited to asking questions and making suggestions

•

ensure that students correctly identify in their work the one role they have worked in

•

support students in working collaboratively and in ensuring they fulfill their commitment to the rest of
the core production team throughout the production phases

•

authenticate the completed work and provide comments on each student’s submission to assist with
moderation. While this is a collaborative creative project, it is essential that teachers assess each
student’s individual contribution to the completed films.

Teachers are not permitted to participate in the production of the completed film in any capacity other than
as described above.

Formal requirements of the task
Each student submits the following for assessment.
a.

A project report (2,000 words maximum) and a list of all sources used.

b.

A completed film (7 minutes maximum).

The procedure for submitting the assessment materials can be found in the Handbook of procedures for the
Diploma Programme.
Students should be informed that where the submitted materials exceed the maximum word and time limits
for the collaborative film project, moderators will only assess the work that falls within the prescribed limits.
