Either

1.    Symphony No. 1 in D Major, Op. 25 “Classical” by S Prokofiev
      Melody writing in the classical period (1750–1820) has been described as concise,         
      balanced, organized, elegant and perfectly shaped.  Which of these characteristics would
      apply to Prokoviev’s melodies in his “Classical” symphony, and which would not?  Make
      clear reference to the score in your answer.                                               [20 marks]

Or

2.    The Yellow River Piano Concerto by X Xian
      Many musicologists maintain that The Yellow River Piano Concerto is a fusion of
      traditional Chinese music and western art music.   With clear reference to the score,
      discuss at least three examples that support this point of view.                      [20 marks]

      works, emphasizing the presence of any significant musical links. Make clear reference
      to both scores in your answer.                                                         [20 marks]
