This markscheme is confidential and for the exclusive use of
examiners in this examination session.

Subject Details: Physics HL Paper 2 Markscheme
Mark Allocation

Candidates are required to answer ALL questions in Section A [45 marks] and TWO questions in
Section B [2 % 25 marks]. Maximum total = [95 marks].

1.   A markscheme often has more marking points than the total allows. This is intentional.

2.   Each marking point has a separate line and the end is shown by means of a semicolon (;).

3.   An alternative answer or wording is indicated in the markscheme by a slash (/). Either wording can
     be accepted.

4.   Words in brackets ( ) in the markscheme are not necessary to gain the mark.

5.   Words that are underlined are essential for the mark.

6.   The order of marking points does not have to be as in the markscheme, unless stated otherwise.

7.   If the candidate’s answer has the same “meaning” or can be clearly interpreted as being of
     equivalent significance, detail and validity as that in the markscheme then award the mark.
     Where this point is considered to be particularly relevant in a question it is emphasized by
     OWTTE (or words to that effect).

8.   Occasionally, a part of a question may require an answer that is required for subsequent
     marking points. If an error is made in the first marking point then it should be penalized. However, if
     the incorrect answer is used correctly in subsequent marking points then follow through marks
     should be awarded. When marking indicate this by adding ECF (error carried forward) on the script.

9.   Do not penalize candidates for errors in units or significant figures, unless it is specifically referred
     to in the markscheme.

                                               SECTION A

1.   (a)   smooth curve that goes through all error bars;                                           [1]
           Do not allow thick or hairy or doubled lines, or lines where the curvature changes
           abruptly.
           Do not allow lines that touch horizontal ends of error bars but miss the verticals.

     (b)   (i)    (no)
                  reference to going through all the error bars;
                  the line is a curve/not straight / straight line would not pass through all the
                  points / equal increments in l give rise to unequal increments in d;              [2]

                                                                    (allow from curve or
           (ii)   mentions or shows clear extrapolation to l axis; 
                                                                    straight line)
                  read-off to within a square (0.50 ± 0.05 m);                                      [2]
                  Award [1max] if no extrapolation seen on graph.
                  Answer must match read-off to 2+sig fig.

     (c)   two data points on line correctly read and more than 0.5 apart on l-axis;
            d 2= kl or d= k l ;
           two or more correct calculations of k from readings;
           comment that two or more values are not equal (even with error bar consideration)
           therefore hypothesis is not valid;                                                       [4]
           Award [3 max] if l-axis values differ by less than 0.5.



2.   (a)   temperature is a measure of the (average) kinetic energy of the molecules;
           at the boiling point, energy supplied (does not increase the kinetic energy) but
           (only) increases the potential energy of the molecules/goes into increasing the
           separation of the molecules/breaking one molecule from another / OWTTE;                  [2]

     (b)   (energy gained by cold water is) 0.300 × 4180 × [34.6 − 15.2] / 24327;
           (energy lost by cooling water is) 0.012 × 4180 × [100 − 34.6] / 3280;
           (energy lost by condensing steam is) 0.012L;

                                                                                    ;               [4]
                                              0.012
           Award [4] for 1.75 × 106 (J kg–1).
           Award [2 max] for an answer that ignores cooling of condensed steam.

     (c)   some of the energy (of the condensing steam) is lost to the surroundings;
           so less energy available to be absorbed by water / rise in temperature of the water
           would be greater if no energy lost;                                                      [2]

3.   (a)   X: graph is a straight line and through the origin / resistance is constant;
              so because V ∝ I it is ohmic;
           Y: not ohmic because graph is not straight/is curved / resistance is not constant;   [3]

           constancy or otherwise.

           between system and surroundings / no energy enters/leaves system;
           a rapid compression means that there is insufficient time (for energy transfer) /

                  proportional to the rate of change of flux/flux linkage; 
                  speed greater so time for change shorter / flux (linkage) is unchanged;
                  greater rate of change (of flux etc) gives a greater (induced) emf;               [3]

8.   Part 1 Energy sources and the greenhouse effect

     (a)   (i)    methane/CH4, water vapour/H2O, carbon dioxide/CO2, nitrous oxide/N2O;               [1]
                  Award [1] for two of the above.

           (ii)   Mechanism [2]:
                  mention of resonance;
                  natural frequency of (resonating) greenhouse gas molecules is same as that of
                  infrared radiation from Earth;
                  or
                  mention of energy level differences;
                  differences between energy levels of greenhouse gas molecules matches
                  energy of infrared radiation from Earth;

                  Explanation [2]:
                  less infrared trapped if absorption is reduced;
                  so more infrared is transmitted through atmosphere;
                  or
                  more infrared is trapped if absorption is increased;
                  so more infrared is re-radiated back to Earth;                                  [4 max]
                  Allow only one variant for each alternative.

           (iii) no radioactive waste;
                 no radiation risks to users;
                 lower expense of decommissioning / easier to decommission / easier to
                 install / lower set-up cost;
                 transportation and storage less hazardous/safer;
                 simpler technology;
                 cannot be used for military purposes;
                 fossil fuels can be extracted/found more easily;
                 no chance of catastrophic accident/meltdown/Chernobyl;                           [1 max]

     (b)   U-235 is (much) more fissionable that U-238 / U-238 is a good absorber of
           neutrons / U-238 removes neutrons from the reaction / U-238 cannot produce a
           chain/sustainable reaction;
           (naturally occurring) uranium (ore) contains more U-238 (atoms) than U-235
           (atoms) / very little U-235 in ore;
           in fuel enrichment, U-238 is removed / the percentage of U-235 is increased / the
           ratio of U-235 to U-238 is increased / amount of U-235 increases;                          [3]

9.   Part 1 Newton’s laws and momentum

     (a)   the net (external) force acting on the system is zero / no force acting on system /
           system is isolated;                                                                               [1]

     (b)   (i)    no external force/system is isolated so change  (do not accept momentum
                                                                  
                  in momentum is zero;                             is conserved/constant)
                  force on ball must be equal and opposite to force on the person;
                  so ball and person/Earth/pond move in opposite directions;                                 [3]

           (ii)   Newton’s second law states that the rate of change of momentum is
                  equal/proportional/directly proportional to the force acting;
                  the horizontal force acting on the ball is zero therefore the momentum must
                  be constant/the rate of change of momentum is zero;                                        [2]
                  or
                  Newton’s second law can be expressed as the force acting is equal to the
                  product of mass and acceleration;
                  the horizontal force acting on the ball is zero therefore the acceleration is
                  zero so velocity is constant (and therefore momentum is constant);
