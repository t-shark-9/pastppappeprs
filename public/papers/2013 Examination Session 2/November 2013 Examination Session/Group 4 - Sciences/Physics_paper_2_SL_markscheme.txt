examiners in this examination session.

Subject Details: Physics SL Paper 2 Markscheme
Mark Allocation

Candidates are required to answer ALL questions in Section A [25 marks] and ONE question in
Section B [25 marks]. Maximum total=[50 marks].

1.   A markscheme often has more marking points than the total allows. This is intentional.

2.   Each marking point has a separate line and the end is shown by means of a semicolon (;).

3.   An alternative answer or wording is indicated in the markscheme by a slash (/). Either wording can
     be accepted.

4.   Words in brackets ( ) in the markscheme are not necessary to gain the mark.

5.   Words that are underlined are essential for the mark.

6.   The order of marking points does not have to be as in the markscheme, unless stated otherwise.

7.   If the candidate’s answer has the same “meaning” or can be clearly interpreted as being of
     equivalent significance, detail and validity as that in the markscheme then award the mark.
     Where this point is considered to be particularly relevant in a question it is emphasized by
     OWTTE (or words to that effect).

8.   Occasionally, a part of a question may require an answer that is required for subsequent
     marking points. If an error is made in the first marking point then it should be penalized. However, if
     the incorrect answer is used correctly in subsequent marking points then follow through marks
     should be awarded. When marking indicate this by adding ECF (error carried forward) on the script.

9.   Do not penalize candidates for errors in units or significant figures, unless it is specifically referred
     to in the markscheme.

           Do not allow thick or hairy or doubled lines, or lines where the curvature changes
           abruptly.

                  reference to going through all the error bars;

                  points / equal increments in l give rise to unequal increments in d;              [2]

           therefore hypothesis is not valid;                                                       [4]

Part 2 Change of phase

(i)   some of the energy (of the condensing steam) is lost to the surroundings;
      so less energy available to be absorbed by water / rise in temperature of the water
      would be greater if no energy lost;                                                   [2]

6.   Part 1 Newton’s laws and momentum

     (a)   the net (external) force acting on the system is zero / no force acting on system /
           system is isolated;                                                                               [1]

     (b)   (i)    no external force/system is isolated so change  (do not accept momentum
                                                                  
                  in momentum is zero;                             is conserved/constant)
                  force on ball must be equal and opposite to force on the person;
                  so ball and person/Earth/pond move in opposite directions;                                 [3]

           (ii)   Newton’s second law states that the rate of change of momentum is
                  equal/proportional/directly proportional to the force acting;
                  the horizontal force acting on the ball is zero therefore the momentum must
                  be constant/the rate of change of momentum is zero;                                        [2]
                  or
                  Newton’s second law can be expressed as the force acting is equal to the
                  product of mass and acceleration;
                  the horizontal force acting on the ball is zero therefore the acceleration is
                  zero so velocity is constant (and therefore momentum is constant);

Part 2 The greenhouse effect

(f)   (i)    methane/CH4, water vapour/ H 2 O , carbon dioxide/ CO 2 , nitrous oxide/ N 2 O ;       [1]
             Award [1] for any two of the above.

      (ii)   mechanism: [2]
             mention of resonance;
             natural frequency of (resonating) greenhouse gas molecules is same as that of
             infrared radiation from Earth;
             or
             mention of energy level differences;
             differences between energy levels of greenhouse gas molecules matches
             energy of infrared radiation from Earth;

             explanation: [2]
             less infrared trapped if absorption is reduced;
             so more infrared is transmitted through atmosphere;
             or
             more infrared is trapped if absorption is increased;
             so more infrared is re-radiated back to Earth;                                     [4 max]
             Allow only one variant for each alternative.

(g)   more greenhouse gas therefore more infrared radiated back to Earth;
      leading to an increase in temperature of glaciers/surface;
      less glacier area so less reflection from glacier surface / OWTTE;
                          amount of radiation reflected
      albedo defined as                                   therefore albedo reduced;             [3 max]
                          amount of radiation absorbed
