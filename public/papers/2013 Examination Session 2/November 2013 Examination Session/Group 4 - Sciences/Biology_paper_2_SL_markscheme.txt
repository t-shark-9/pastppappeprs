Subject Details: Biology SL Paper 2 Markscheme
Mark Allocation

Candidates are required to answer ALL questions in Section A [30 marks] and ONE question in
Section B [20 marks]. Maximum total = [50 marks].

1.    A markscheme often has more marking points than the total allows. This is intentional.

2.    Each marking point has a separate line and the end is shown by means of a semicolon (;).

3.    An alternative answer or wording is indicated in the markscheme by a slash (/). Either wording can
      be accepted.

4.    Words in brackets ( ) in the markscheme are not necessary to gain the mark.

5.    Words that are underlined are essential for the mark.

6.    The order of marking points does not have to be as in the markscheme, unless stated otherwise.

7.    If the candidate’s answer has the same “meaning” or can be clearly interpreted as being of
      equivalent significance, detail and validity as that in the markscheme then award the mark.
      Where this point is considered to be particularly relevant in a question it is emphasized by
      OWTTE (or words to that effect).

8.    Remember that many candidates are writing in a second language. Effective communication is
      more important than grammatical accuracy.

9.    Occasionally, a part of a question may require an answer that is required for subsequent
      marking points. If an error is made in the first marking point then it should be penalized. However, if
      the incorrect answer is used correctly in subsequent marking points then follow through marks
      should be awarded. When marking indicate this by adding ECF (error carried forward) on the script.

10.   Do not penalize candidates for errors in units or significant figures, unless it is specifically referred
      to in the markscheme.

                                             Section B

Extended response questions - quality of construction

     w   Extended response questions for SL P2 carry a mark total of [20]. Of these marks, [18] are
          awarded for content and [2] for the quality of construction of the answer.

     w Two aspects are considered:
         expression of relevant ideas with clarity
         structure of the answers.

     w [1] quality mark is to be awarded when the candidate satisfies EACH of the following criteria.
        Thus [2] quality marks are awarded when a candidate satisfies BOTH criteria.

     Clarity of expression:
        The candidate has made a serious and full attempt to answer all parts of the question and the
        answers are expressed clearly enough to be understood with little or no re-reading.

     Structure of answer:
        The candidate has linked relevant ideas to form a logical sequence within at least two parts
        of the same question (eg within part a and within part b, or within part a and within part c
        etc. but not between part a and part b or between part a and part c etc.).

                                              SECTION A

1.   (a)   type 1 caused by destruction of insulin secreting cells/beta cells (in pancreas) /
           insufficient insulin produced / genetic disorder resulting in failure to produce
           insulin;
           type II caused by decreased response of body cells/receptors to insulin (that is
           produced);
           type I early onset while type II adult onset;
           type I treated with insulin while type II with diet (lifestyle changes);                    [2]

     (b)   negative/inverse relationship/negative correlation / as one variable increases the
           other decreases / as plasma fatty acid increases, enzyme activity decreases / vice
           versa                                                                                       [1]

     (c)   (a decrease of) 45 (%) (accept answers in the range of 44 (%) to 47 (%))                    [1]

     (d)   yes, effect is reversible as activity returns to (approximately) original level (when
           lipids/fatty acids decrease);
           when lipid/fatty acids washed out enzyme is more active/activity increases;
           difference between starting and final levels of enzyme activity is insignificant
           because of error bars;
           three hours/experimental time may be insufficient to reverse the effect;                [2 max]

     (e)   300                                                                                         [1]

     (f)   increased insulin concentration causes more glucose absorption (up to
           103 µU ml–1);
           glucose absorption in muscle bathed in lipid always less than control;
           no further increase/slight decrease in glucose absorption beyond 103 (µU ml–1)
              insulin;                                                                             [2 max]

     (g)   Referring to first graph:
           plasma lipids lower activity of enzyme (needed for glucose absorption);

           Referring to second graph:
           more/higher glucose uptake with higher insulin levels in muscles without lipids
           (compared to muscles bathed in lipids);
           lipids reduce glucose absorption (even at raised insulin concentrations);
           isolated muscle used in experiments so results may differ in whole organisms;           [2 max]
