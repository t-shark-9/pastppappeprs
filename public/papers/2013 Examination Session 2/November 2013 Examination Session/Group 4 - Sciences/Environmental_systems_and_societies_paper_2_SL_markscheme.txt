Subject Details: Environmental Systems and Societies SLP2 Markscheme

Mark Allocation

Candidates are required to answer ALL questions in Section A [25 marks] and TWO questions in
Section B [40 marks]. Maximum total = [65 marks].

1.    A markscheme often has more marking points than the total allows. This is intentional.

2.    Each marking point has a separate line and the end is shown by means of a semicolon (;).

3.    An alternative answer or wording is indicated in the markscheme by a slash (/). Either wording can
      be accepted.

4.    Words in brackets ( ) in the markscheme are not necessary to gain the mark.

5.    Words that are underlined are essential for the mark.

6.    The order of marking points does not have to be as in the markscheme, unless stated otherwise.

7.    If the candidate’s answer has the same “meaning” or can be clearly interpreted as being of
      equivalent significance, detail and validity as that in the markscheme then award the mark.
      Where this point is considered to be particularly relevant in a question it is emphasized by
      WTTE (or words to that effect).

8.    Remember that many candidates are writing in a second language. Effective communication is more
      important than grammatical accuracy.

9.    Occasionally, a part of a question may require an answer that is required for subsequent
      marking points. If an error is made in the first marking point then it should be penalized. However,
      if the incorrect answer is used correctly in subsequent marking points then follow through marks
      should be awarded. When marking, indicate this by adding ECF (error carried forward) on the
      script.

10.   Do not penalize candidates for errors in units or significant figures, unless it is specifically referred
      to in the markscheme.

                                                SECTION A

1.   (a)   (i)    (papyrus) swamp / freshwater lake / tropical grassland / river / savanna /
                  flower farm / small farms / Crescent Island;                                  [1]
                  Award [1] for any two of the above.

           (ii)   tilapia / water hyacinth / crayfish / black bass;                             [1]
                  Award [1] for any two of the above.


     (b)   Award [1] for two inputs.
           (Malewa & Gilgil) rivers / groundwater flow / rainfall/storms / run-off from
           Abedares;
           N.B. “rainfall” OR “storms” is acceptable for 1 of the inputs, but not 2.
           Award [1] for two outputs.
           evaporation / transpiration / abstraction (for whatever purpose) / underground
           water flow;                                                                          [2]


     (c)   (i)    Award [1] for correctly labelling axes (“year” and “approximate number of
                  people”)
                  AND using a consistent scale (including full range in equal intervals) with
                  time on the x-axis. N.B. it would be acceptable to have intervals labelled
                  1969, 79 …etc. providing intervals are equal in value.
                  Award [1] for accuracy of line (accurate plotting of points and drawing of
                  line).




                                                                                                [2]

           (ii)   Award [1] for two ways
                  deforestation leading to soil erosion;
                  overgrazing leading to siltation/soil erosion;
                                              –5–              N13/4/ENVSO/SP2/ENG/TZ0/XX/M


             over-harvesting/over-irrigating so soil is depleted in minerals;
             application of agrochemicals/broken sewage system leads to toxification;
             Responses must link human activity to soil degradation eg just
             “deforestation” or “overgrazing” is not sufficient.
             Accept other reasonable responses of equivalent validity, significance &
             relevance.                                                                      [1 max]

(d)   (i)    68 (% hydro) + 9 (% geothermal) = 77 %                                              [1]
             Response must have a minimum of “68 + 9 = 77” ie Responses lacking the
             sum should not be credited. (“%” not essential here for a mark, as it is in
             stem of question)

      (ii)   Advantages/limitations [3 max]:
             cheaper costs for flower farms for heating greenhouses;
             cheaper electricity costs for local people / tourism;
             reduced reliance on fossil fuels / increased energy independence / increased
             % renewable energy;
             reduced greenhouse gas emissions;
             provides employment opportunities for local people;
             will decrease ecological footprint of country/Kenya;

             Disadvantages/weaknesses [3 max]:
             potential increase in conflict between tourism and energy generation / visual
             pollution from steam or ugly buildings;
             increased abstraction of water;
             loss of habitat/agricultural land due to more buildings;
             possible thermal pollution increasing;
             expensive set-up costs;
             Accept other reasonable responses of equivalent validity, significance &
             relevance.                                                                      [4 max]

(e)   (i)    to act as a control/pristine/untouched/untouched site/baseline study/as a
             comparison to the other sites;
             to measure impacts of pollution/fertilisers/tourism/eutrophication/hyacinth
             invasion on the lake/reserve;                                                   [1max]

      (ii)   because secchi disk method requires incoming light / secchi disk measures
             light penetration/ depth that light reaches / plants prevent light reaching
             secchi disk / make it dark so prevent measurement of transparency;              [1max]
             Just mentioning plant cover prevents light entering is not enough for the
             mark, response must relate problem to use of secchi disk/measurement of
             transparency.

      (iii) Some sites may be lower because:
            of sediment being washed in;
            shallower waters allow for more disturbance of bottom sediment;
            of more algae due to nutrients from town sewage;
            of suspended material from sewage input/domestic farms;
            of more algae due to run-off of fertilisers;
                                             –6–                N13/4/ENVSO/SP2/ENG/TZ0/XX/M


            Do not accept “greater cover by hyacinths”, since this only affects
            incidence of light, not transparency of water, and was avoided in the
            methodology anyway.                                                               [2 max]

(f)   global warming/climate change/local changes in microclimate;
      (seasonal) depth of water / shallower lake warms/cools more quickly;
      hot water being discharged into the lake from geothermal power plant;
      increased natural tectonic/geothermal activity;
      seasonal changes in cloud cover/precipitation/sunlight hours;
      change in level/temperature of river/incoming water/run-off;
      increase/decrease in shading from hyacinth cover;
      increasing turbidity/suspended particles/eutrophication may increase temperature;       [2 max]

(g)   YES – flower farm is biggest source of pollution because water hyacinths/algal
      growth are highest there;
      the hyacinth cover is 33.7 % higher than pristine / 18.7 % higher than town;
      algal growth is 195 mg m-3 more than pristine / 160 mg m-3 more than town;

      NO – because flower farm abiotic data/pH & transparency is closest to
      pristine/reserve data;
      ie only 0.1 difference in pH / only 28.8cm different in transparency;
      town is biggest source because transparency is lower / turbidity is higher;
      ie 8.2 cm less light penetration than flower farm;
      pH shows greater difference from “pristine”/reserve/baseline measurement;
      ie pH 7.93 compared to 8.70 whereas flower farm is 8.80;
      river is biggest source because transparency is the least of all sites;
      ie 22.6cm less than flower farm / 31.4cm less than pristine;

      But data is insufficient to be sure of causes / it all depends on which pollutant you
      are measuring;

      Credit may be given to responses that take the river (rather than the reserve) to be
      a reliable baseline/control with which to compare pollution levels eg
      YES – because flower farm has higher hyacinth cover/algal growth/pH than
      incoming water/river (as a baseline measurement);
      ie 15.9 % higher hyacinth cover, than river / 343 mg m-3 algae, more than river /
      pH8.8 compared with pH7.28 in river;

      Accept any conclusion that is consistent with data in the table.
      Do not credit “yes, correct” / “no, not correct.”                                       [2 max]

(h)   (i)    involves cooperation of different groups who are responsible for the
             problems;
             drip irrigation is less wasteful/reduces losses from evaporation/leaching of
             nutrients;
             metering will reduce/monitor abstraction/wastage of water resources;
             controls on pesticides/fertilizers will minimize pollution/eutrophication;
             conduct codes will educate for long term perspectives not short term
             exploitation;
             effective sewage treatment will minimize pollution from human waste;
             measures employ/emphasise small scale/local management of issues;              [3 max]

             Do not accept simple repetition of items on Fig. 8 list; responses must
             indicate how these measures lead toward sustainability.

      (ii)   Accept either self reliance soft ecologist or environmental manager.
             eg self reliance soft ecologist because:
             community involvement/participation is important;
             education of people / personal improvement through codes of conduct;
             opposed to use of commercial chemicals / excessive use of resources;

             Or…

             eg environmental manager because:
             economic growth and resource exploitation continues with management;
             metering is an example of economic adjustment/appraisal/small-scale
             technology;
             assumption that people have a right to expect minimum environmental
             standards/quality;
             consensus among interested groups;

             Allow [1 max] for a counterargument against other approaches:

             eg not Deep Ecologist because approach is:
             people-centred approach / no reference to rights/biorights of organisms;

             eg not Cornucopian because approach:
             restricts use of resources/available technology / utilises codes of
             conduct/political manipulation rather than scientific expertise;               [2 max]

                                                  SECTION B


     General Essay Markscheme
     Each essay is marked out of [20] of which [2] are for clarity of expression, structure and development
     of ideas.
             [0] Quality of expression, structure and development is poor.
             [1] Quality of expression, structure and development is limited.
             [2] Quality of expression is clear, structure is good and ideas are well developed.

     Do not penalize candidates for writing in bullet pointed lists – if this technique is used appropriately
     ie to summarize or outline a list of points within an essay at an appropriate point. However,
     a candidate who has not shown any evidence of being able to write a paragraph with a developed,
     logical line of reasoning would not be able to achieve maximum marks.




2.     (a)     For full credit, response must include a named ecosystem eg Alpine Pine Forest in
               Swiss Alps.

               Award [1 mark] for establishing control/baseline and repetition:
               make a baseline study before human activity begins and repeat at regular intervals
               over time after the human activity / or at different distances from human activity;

               Award marks as follows for methods to record changes due to human activities
               [3 max]
               use appropriate biotic sampling method eg randomised quadrats/water
               samples/kick samples/mark-release-recapture/Lincoln Index to establish
               abundance of species;
               …and to use Simpson’s diversity index to establish species present/diversity;
               use relevant/standardised/sampling method of measuring abiotic data eg light
               meter/ anemometer/thermometer/pH meter/Secchi disk;                                     [4 max]

               Award [3 max] if no specific ecosystem named.
                                              –9–               N13/4/ENVSO/SP2/ENG/TZ0/XX/M



(b)   Effect on nitrogen cycle (no credit to be given for simply describing N cycle):
      [3 max]
      production of nitrogen based fertilizers has converted large amounts of N into  2

      NO ;
         3

      agriculture/use of fertilisers/biomass burning has added large amounts of NO to     3

      ecosystems;
      fossil fuel based cars/power plants release large amounts of NO into atmosphere;
                                                                       x

      over-harvesting/irrigation has reduced mineral N in soils;
      release of sewage/livestock effluent has increased N content in waterways;

      Impact on ecosystem: [4 max]
      General:
      NO enters atmosphere and combines with H O to form acid rain;
         x                                          2

      NO is a powerful greenhouse gas which leads to global warming/climate change;
         x




      Specific:
      acid rain causes needle loss in pine forests;
      acidified soil can lead to leaching of cations/essential minerals/ Ca++ out of soil;
      excess NO in soil may change species composition in the ecosystem;
                 3

      loss of nitrates through harvesting/irrigation lowers productivity;
      NO leach into water and can lead to eutrophication of water bodies;
         3

      acid rain can lead to acidified water/death of pH sensitive species;
      and increase in heavy metals/aluminium ions in water, damaging fish;
      these abiotic changes may reduce biodiversity/stability of systems;
      climate change may lead to destruction/flooding of ecosystems / shifting biomes;        [6 max]

(c)   Description of EIA [2 max]:
      an evaluation of current ecosystem/environment and likely impacts from the
      development;
      often it is a legal requirement and ideally independent of (but funded by) the
      developer;
      involving a baseline study and subsequent monitoring of a variety of
      environmental aspects including eg ecological, social, economic, aesthetic during
      and after the development;

      Evaluations of the role and outcomes of EIA in two different societal structures [8 max]:
      Societal structures should be allowed a very broad interpretation ie candidates
      may compare or describe eg MEDCs and LEDCs; two countries; or two societal
      structures within one country eg western capitalist society and first generation
      Americans; two socioeconomic groups; two different societal institutions.

      N.B. The following marks should NOT be awarded for statements that simply
      describe an EIA; there must be some evaluative element (positive or negative;
      effective or ineffective etc) to gain the mark.

      time-consuming so may effectively prevent valuable development / or not be
      completed in time to prevent development;
      wide variety of skills needed to collect appropriate data which implies extensive
      recruitment/education/cooperation;
      conflicts of interest as developer pays for the EIA which may bias findings;
                                      – 10 –             N13/4/ENVSO/SP2/ENG/TZ0/XX/M


raises awareness of local viewpoints so promotes community ownership;
allows the local community an input into the development of their area /
empowers minorities;
monitoring post development is often not completed so usefulness is limited;
EIA have proved to be a very useful in MEDCs where environmental and
economic priorities are more equal WTTE;
cost of EIA may be too high to be carried out effectively in less wealthy societies;
in LEDCs economic development may be higher priority than environmental
concerns;
…recommendations in EIA may therefore not be followed;
some societies/LEDCs may not have the expertise to carry out effective EIAs;
in some countries corruption may influence decisions rather than EIA;
in some countries political/lobby groups have a bigger influence on development
than others;
countries that have incorporated environmental/sustainability ideas into their
constitution (eg Ecuador and Bhutan) may be more inclined to use and fully
implement EIA;
If no direct links to any named societal structures are made award [3 max].
If only one societal structure is named, award up to [4 max].

Allow credit for different approaches to this question eg a “case-study”
approach:
EIA manifesting the ecological significance of redwood (for temperate forests'
ecology) would allow American Indians to continue their traditional way of life;
EIA manifesting the ecological significance of redwood would cause an increased
concern for loggers losing their major source of income;
an EIA allowing timbering of redwood forest would offer economic benefit to
timber industry/ would promote economic development of region / would offer
jobs to loggers;
an EIA allowing timbering of redwood forest may cause relocation of local
Amerindians;                                                                             [8 max]

Accept other reasonable responses of equivalent significance, validity & relevance.


                                                                  Expression of ideas: [2 max]

                                                                                       Total: [20]
                                                – 11 –            N13/4/ENVSO/SP2/ENG/TZ0/XX/M


3.   (a)   Award [1] for two examples.
           flood control / regulating river flow;
           timber for firewood and building;
           food eg fruits and nuts from local trees;
           reduction in soil erosion;
           aesthetic value / tourism;
           recreational value eg hiking;
           Accept other equivalent valid responses that are relevant to named area.

           Award [1 max] if no named protected area eg Palani Hills Conservation Area,
           South India                                                                          [2 max]

     (b)   Award [1 max] for general definition/principle of sustainable management &
           natural income:
           sustainable management ensures use of the protected area at a rate that allows
           natural regeneration/minimizes damage to the environment/is available for future
           generations WTTE;
           in sustainable management, natural income is utilised without depleting natural

           Analysis: Award credit for responses that address forms of natural income (with
           specific examples) and address their role or influence upon sustainable
           management [8 max]:
           natural income is essentially what is being protected ie natural population growth
           and abiotic processes;
           natural income has important role in sustainable management because it may
           provide support for project;
           maintaining/improving natural income of ecosystem services improves
           sustainability;
           eg reafforestation/removing alien species improves natural income leading to
           greater biodiversity;
           planned local use of natural income/goods (eg firewood, regulated grazing, food);
           …generally increases the success/sustainability of a protected area by encouraging
           local support and cooperation;
           but conflicts may arise between local people using natural income and the area
           management;tourism/recreation is one form of natural income;
           …that generates funding for staffing/management costs/effective protection of the
           park;
           …and also provides local employment/education/awareness / raises profile of area
           in local community / increases sustainability of local community;
           but tourism/recreation also places pressure on the ecosystem through waste/path
           erosion/disturbance;
           and tourism/recreation can reduce aesthetic value of the area eg commercial
           infrastructure/hotels/noise;
           difficult to quantify the value of some natural income/ecosystem services in
           economic terms;
           natural income from a protected area may provide essential services for
           ecosystems far outside the area/or even globally;

      Award [5 max] if these points are not directly related to named protected area.
      (Full credit, however, can be awarded to responses that indicate reference to
      same area named in Q3a without actually repeating the name.)

      Accept other reasonable responses of equivalent significance, validity &
      relevance.                                                                             [8 max]

(c)   Award [1 max] for correctly identifying eg of both intergovernmental and
      non-governmental organisations (Full credit can be given to responses that refer
      to one or more examples of each):
      eg UNEP=IGO and WWF=NGO;

      Award [7 max] for discussing impact of named IGOs and NGOs, [5 max] for
      responses where no examples of actions/impacts are given (eg Biodiversity
      Convention; orang-utans; Palani Hills; as below).
      IGOs have an impact when directing/advising government policy / setting
      agreements/treaties;
      IGOs eg UNEP is actively involved in negotiations for eg Biodiversity
      Convention thus preserving important habitats;
      IGOs often have less impact than NGOs on a local level in protecting ecosystems;
      …because they have a more global perspective / because they have less influence
      over local communities;
      intergovernmental agreements eg CITES / Ramsar Convention have global
      influence but take a long time to make a difference;
      NGOs eg WWF are based world-wide and raise funds to support ecosystem
      conservation/protection eg orang-utans in Malaysia;
      …particularly active/effective in LEDCs that lack funding / less able to implement
      measures from IGOs;
      usually their impact comes through high media visibility/public profile amongst
      the general population;
      …but in large organizations a great deal of money goes to maintain the
      organization itself, rather than actually impacting environmental issues;
      smaller, local NGOs, can bring about more rapid and lasting change due to good
      community links;
      …but struggle to raise funds to buy equipment/pay staffing etc necessary for
      effective impact;
      greatest impact may be achieved when NGOs work in cooperation with IGOs;
      eg Palani Hills Conservation Council and Vatakanal Conservation Trust in South
      India are examples of NGOs that have worked closely with forestry service to
      improve watershed protection;
      …and provide education for local people to improve the success of their projects;
      If responses give incorrect eg of IGO or NGO (eg a GO) apply ECF (ie do not
      award mark for eg but credit any further points that are consistent with IGO or
      NGO) and award [5 max] for whole question.
      Accept other reasonable responses of equivalent significance, validity &
      relevance                                                                              [8 max]

4.   (a)   volcanic activity associated with plate movement can give rise to new oceanic
           islands;
           mountain building creates greater habitat diversity due to range of altitudes;
           plate activity gives rise to unique ecosystems eg deep oceanic trenches/submarine
           volcanic outlets;
           habitat diversity increases the niches available and so increases species diversity;
           mixing of gene pools from different regions (eg India and Eurasia)/ land bridges
           created an opportunity for new species to form;
           divergent plate activity/island formation/mountain ranges isolate populations
           creating opportunities for speciation;
           eg the dividing of Pangea creating new oceans and continents;
           divergent plate activity shifts ecosystems to new latitudes with new climatic
           conditions;                                                                             [4 max]

     (b)   Definition of carrying capacity [1 max]:
           Carrying capacity is the maximum number of a species/“load” that can be
           sustainably supported by a given environment/habitat/ecosystem;

           Comparisons/Contrasts [6 max]
           populations are generally limited by density dependent factors/limited resources
           as they approach carrying capacity;
           human populations may be less influenced by these factors;
           generally, fertility decreases/mortality increases/migration increases in response to
           exceeding the carrying capacity;
           famines/water-shortages/environmental degradation may suggest that humans
           have exceeded their carrying capacity / whereas other species rarely exceed the
           carrying capacity (for extended periods of time);
           human population growth is following a J-curve/not limited by carrying capacity /
           whereas most species follow an S-curve/fluctuate widely around carrying
           capacity;
           difficult to determine the carrying capacity of humans / whereas for most species
           it is less complex;
           this is because humans use a great variety of resources / whereas for most species
           one of a few possible resources is limiting;
           and humans have ability to switch resources when they are limiting / whereas
           most species have a limited range of available resources;
           carrying capacity of some regions can be exceeded through importation of
           resources / whereas other species depend solely on availability in their immediate
           environment;
           technological developments allow greater efficiency in resource use for human
           populations / whereas other spp depend on their adaptations/cannot develop
           “technological” solutions;
           other species rely solely upon slow evolutionary processes to improve efficiency
           of resource use / whereas human mental/social skills enable them to adapt to
           change far more rapidly;
           humans may take conscious action to control population growth through policies /
           whereas other species rely upon natural processes/environmental resistance;
           for other species, carrying capacity may fluctuate dramatically with changes in
           weather/food availability / whereas human populations can often adapt to
           significant changes with technology/imports/switching etc;
                                            – 14 –             N13/4/ENVSO/SP2/ENG/TZ0/XX/M


      other species (usually r-strategist) following J-curve crash eventually / perhaps
      human population will eventually suffer similar crash;
      in some LEDCs opportunities for switching/importing resources are limited so
      carrying capacity is more limiting as with other species;

      Award [3 max] if no explicit contrasts/comparisons are made with other species
      ie if candidate describes humans and/or other species without indicating the
      similarities or differences (as in the “whereas” statements above).
      Accept other reasonable responses of equivalent significance, validity and
      relevance.
      Award [5 max] for whole question if other species are just referred to generally
      with no named example.                                                               [6 max]

(c)   Award [1 max] for a clear developed statement of candidate’s environmental
      viewpoint in relation to depletion of a correctly identified non-renewable
      resource. Accept a personal stance that is a combination of conventional
      viewpoints.
      eg I am an environmental manager because I feel we should have legislation in
      place to encourage research into renewable energy sources as oil is running out;

      Award [7 max] for outline and evaluation of candidates own, and ONE other,
      contrasting viewpoint/approach. Do not credit discussion of more than two
      viewpoints.

      eg Ecocentric approach/ viewpoint:
      Outline [2 max]:
      ecocentrics may believe in biorights and that human interaction with the
      environment should always be sustainable;
      depletion of resource indicates the overexploitation of resources by humans;
      humans need to reduce their consumption and lead simpler lives;
      Evaluation [3 max]:
      reusing/recycling will lead to longer life span of resources containing the
      resource;
      limiting resource use will protect life of other species/biosphere;
      limiting resource use will provide for future generations;
      difficult to persuade people to change their lifestyles;
      limiting resource use for LEDCs may hold back their development alongside
      MEDCs;

      eg Environmental manager approach/viewpoint:
      Outline [2 max]:
      growth/development is possible with appropriate management;
      effective population control will limit resource use;
      taxes can be used to control the use of this resource;
      governments can legislate to manage the resource;
      Evaluation [3 max]:
      can effectively limit resource use (through population control and disincentives);
      allows for continued development/growth (especially important for LEDCs);
      does not tackle the problem of overconsumption/unsustainable lifestyles;
      puts human needs at the centre and may involve infringement of biorights;
                                    – 15 –            N13/4/ENVSO/SP2/ENG/TZ0/XX/M


eg Cornucopian approach/viewpoint:
Outline [2 max]:
humans have right to exploit environment as much as required for growth &
development;
only limitations are scientific and technological expertise;
humans will find another alternative resources / new supplies of the resource;
or new technology to increase efficiency / exploit new sources / replace need of
resource;
Evaluation [3 max]:
allows for continued development/growth (especially important for LEDCs);
scientific/technological developments have historically been used to extend
resource use;
scientific/technological developments often cause even greater environmental
problems;
does not tackle the problem of overconsumption/unsustainable lifestyles;
puts human needs at the centre and may involve infringement of biorights;

Award [4 max] if viewpoints are not clearly named or only one viewpoint is
addressed.
Award [2 max] for each evaluation if only strengths, or only weaknesses, are
addressed.
Accept other reasonable responses of equivalent significance, validity &
relevance.                                                                           [8 max]

5.   (a)   Credit may be given for flow diagrams that indicate cause and effect or
           conventional flows and storages.
           Award [1 mark] for EACH correctly identified cause & effect link (arrow joining
           two boxes) [3 max]
           Award [1 mark] for clarity/accuracy of diagram that includes impacts [1 max]

           For terrestrial ecosystem eg:

(b)   eg acid rain and carbon dioxide emissions (causing global warming/climate change):

      Comparisons/Contrasts [6 max]
      both can be reduced by a reduction in fossil fuel use;
      both can be reduced by reducing private transportation / switch to public
      transportation;
      both can be reduced by a switch to renewable energy/resource use;
      both can be reduced by legislation/taxation/fines to control use;
      both can be reduced by reducing consumerist lifestyles/luxury goods;
      NO /SO may be point source pollutants that can be controlled at point of emission
         x   x

      / whereas CO is invariably non-point;
                      2

      NO /SO can be removed by scrubbers fitted to industrial outlets / catalytic
         x   x

      converters fitted to vehicle exhausts / whereas no technology for removing CO at
                                                                                    2

      point of emission;
      remediation/restoration can be applied to acidified ecosystems eg liming water
      bodies / whereas impacts of CO are too widespread to restore affected
                                            2

      ecosystems;
      CO can be removed from atmosphere through carbon capture/re-afforestation etc
         2

      / whereas it’s not possible to retrieve NO /SO directly from atmosphere;
                                                     x   x

      because CO has a far wider range of impacts and causes, there are many more
                  2

      strategies for approaching it;
      eg mitigation of impacts through eg flood defence / eg reducing emission through
      reduced livestock farming / switching from heavy meat diets / reducing
      deforestation;

      eg acid rain and CFCs causing ozone depletion;

      Comparisons/Contrasts [6 max]
      both can be reduced by education to adopt environmentally informed
      lifestyles/consumer choices;
      eg acid rain can be reduced by opting for hybrid/fuel efficient cars / whereas
      CFCs       can    be    reduced    by     opting    for    more   efficient air-
      conditioning/refrigeration/CFC-free products;
      both can be reduced by reduction in rate of resource use;
      both can be reduced by switch to more renewable/sustainable resource;
      both can be reduced by legislation/taxation/fines to control use;
      ozone depletion is addressed by international treaties (Montreal Protocol) /
      whereas acid rain by national legislation (US Clean Air Act);
      catalytic converters/scrubbers can be fitted to reduce NO /SO emissions /
                                                                    x   x

      whereas no such technology to remove CFCs at point of emission;
      CFCs are manufactured chemicals so can be commercially modified/replaced by
      safer alternatives / whereas NO /SO are naturally occurring bi-products of

      combustion;
      remediation/restoration can be applied to acidified ecosystems eg liming water
      bodies / whereas CFCs are persistent in atmosphere/no effective method of
      restoring stratospheric ozone;
      impacts of acid rain localised so easier to address impacts / whereas ozone
      depletion more widespread/global phenomenon;
      acidity can be neutralised through natural/intervention procedures / whereas
      CFCs are constantly regenerated through cyclical reactions;

      Award [4 max] if no explicit contrasts/comparisons are made with other form of
      pollution ie if candidate addresses acid rain and another form of pollution without
      explicitly indicating the similarities or differences (as in the “whereas”
      statements above).
      Accept other reasonable responses of equivalent significance, validity &
      relevance.

(c)   Reasons for different perspectives:
      Religious/cultural imperatives:
      eg some societies have cultural beliefs that hold the natural environment in high
      regard;
      so will be opposed to human activity that leads to global warming;
      or may value national happiness over economic growth;
      may believe global warming stems from western capitalist greed;
      eg perspective of Buddhist cultures/first generation Americans;
      some are more pragmatic/consumer-oriented/pro-economic development
      eg Western capitalism;
      so may be less concerned with global warming issues / less willing to compromise
      lifestyles;

      Political ideology:
      more capitalist societies may rely heavily upon market forces to drive solutions to
      global warming;
      and will value marketable goods over non-marketable services affected by global
      warming;
      so may see global warming as a negative but necessary result of economic growth
      / be less concerned with addressing the issue;

      State of development:
      MEDCs can better afford to address global warming issues through more
      expensive alternative technologies/resources;
      MEDCs have more extensive media availability/education and so may have more
      informed perspectives on global warming;
      …or be more sceptical about causes/existence of the phenomenon of global
      warming;
      high profile of science/technology in MEDCs may lead them to seek
      scientific/technological solutions rather than changes in lifestyle;
      LEDCs may prioritise catching up in development with MEDCs rather than
      environmental/global warming issues;
      LEDCs may not have the funding/expertise to address issues of global warming;

      Imminence of impacts;
      societies already experiencing possible impacts of global warming
      (eg flooding/severe weather patterns/drought) may be more sensitive to global
      warming issues;

Geographical location:
Northern societies may welcome benefits of climate change and be less concerned
/ societies in more vulnerable locations (eg coastal locations/low altitude) may be
more concerned;
Award [1 mark] for a list of 3 or more general influences similar to those in the
headings above.
