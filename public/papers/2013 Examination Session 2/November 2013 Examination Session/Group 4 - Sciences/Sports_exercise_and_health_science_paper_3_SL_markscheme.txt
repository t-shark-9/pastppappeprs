Subject Details: Sports, Exercise and Health Science SL Paper 3 Markscheme

Mark Allocation

Candidates are required to answer questions from TWO of the Options [2 × 20 marks].
Maximum total = [40 marks].

1.    A markscheme often has more marking points than the total allows. This is intentional.

2.    Each marking point has a separate line and the end is shown by means of a semicolon (;).

3.    An alternative answer or wording is indicated in the markscheme by a slash (/). Either wording can
      be accepted.

4.    Words in brackets ( ) in the markscheme are not necessary to gain the mark.

5.    Words that are underlined are essential for the mark.

6.    The order of marking points does not have to be as in the markscheme, unless stated otherwise.

7.    If the candidate’s answer has the same “meaning” or can be clearly interpreted as being of
      equivalent significance, detail and validity as that in the markscheme then award the mark.
      Where this point is considered to be particularly relevant in a question it is emphasized by
      OWTTE (or words to that effect).

8.    Remember that many candidates are writing in a second language. Effective communication is
      more important than grammatical accuracy.

9.    Occasionally, a part of a question may require an answer that is required for subsequent
      marking points. If an error is made in the first marking point then it should be penalized. However,
      if the incorrect answer is used correctly in subsequent marking points then follow through marks
      should be awarded. When marking, indicate this by adding ECF (error carried forward) on the
      script.

10.   Do not penalize candidates for errors in units or significant figures, unless it is specifically referred
      to in the markscheme.

Option A — Optimizing physiological performance

1.   (a)   (group) 3                                                                                  [1]

     (b)   (14.5 −17.8 = )( − ) 3.3                                                                   [1]

     (c)   static/active stretching is when the performer (moves their own body into a
           position) works on one joint, pushing it beyond its normal range, lengthening the
           (antagonist) muscles and connective tissue surrounding it;
           passive stretching is when a stretch occurs with the help of an external force, such
           as a partner, gravity or equipment (eg hurdle/wall);
           dynamic stretching uses speed of movement, momentum and active muscular
           effort to bring about a stretch;
           unlike static stretching, the end position is not held;
           dynamic stretching is similar to ballistic stretching except that it avoids bouncing
           motions and tends to incorporate more sport-specific movements;
           ballistic stretching involves performing a stretch with swinging/bouncing/twisting
           from side-to-side movements to push a body beyond its normal range of
           movement;                                                                              [2 max]

2.   (a)   conduction – transfer of heat through direct contact;
           convection – moving heat by the motion of a gas/liquid/air passing over the skin;
           radiation – transfer of heat through electromagnetic waves;
           evaporation – heat loss through the conversion of water/sweat to vapour;
           primary avenue for heat loss during exercise;                                          [2 max]

     (b)   full adaptation takes 7–14 days for most individuals;
           training/exercise to elevate body core temperature for optimal heat acclimatization;
           training/exercise to stimulate sweating for optimal heat acclimatization;
           exercise bouts of (approximately) 100 minutes seem to be most effective;
           progressive increase in duration/intensity of heat exposure (towards 100 minutes);
           high-intensity intermittent training / sport-specific acclimatization;
           acclimatize in the environment;                                                        [2 max]

     (c)   improved skin blood flow;
           effective distribution of cardiac output;
           lowered threshold for the start of sweating;
           a more effective distribution of sweat over skin surface;
           increased sweat output;
           lowered salt concentration of sweat;
           lower skin/core temperatures/heart rate for a standard exercise;
           less reliance on carbohydrate catabolism during exercise;                              [3 max]

     (d)   decline in physical performance / loss in muscular strength/coordination /
           maximal working capacity;
           decreased appetite/body weight loss;
           muscle soreness;
           reduced immune function/frequent upper-respiratory tract infection (head
           colds/allergic reactions);
           nausea;
           sleep disturbances;
           elevated resting heart rate;
           elevated blood pressure;                                                               [3 max]

3.   (a)   placebo effect is a positive outcome / from the belief that a beneficial
           treatment/intervention has been received (physiological, behavioural, emotional
           and/or cognitive);
           placebo treatment/intervention in sports research often serves as a control for the
           experimental treatment under investigation/method of controlling for (internal)
           validity;
           use of blind/double blind design;
           a placebo can have negative/undesirable effects (physiological, behavioural,
           emotional and/or cognitive);
           a relevant sporting example, for example an endurance triathlete ingesting a sports
           drink containing carbohydrate/artificial sweetener;                                   [2 max]

     (b)   (i)    stimulates/elevates red blood cell production / increases hemoglobin
                  concentration and hematocrit;
                  increases oxygen capacity/VO2 max;
                  increases time to exhaustion/endurance capacity;                               [2 max]

           (ii)   reduces effects of stimulation of the sympathetic system (where
                  anxiety/tremor could impair performance);
                  can slow heart rate;
                  could possibly enhance physiological adaptations to endurance training;        [2 max]
                                                   –7–                 N13/4/SPEXS/SP3/ENG/TZ0/XX/M


Option B — Psychology of sport

4.   (a)   (group) 2                                                                                     [1]

     (b)   (group) 1                                                                                     [1]

     (c)   some researchers believe that personality is closely related to athletic
           performance / some researchers argue that personality is not related to athletic
           success;
           some relationship exists between personality and sport performance, but it is far
           from perfect;
           ambiguity in the definition of an athlete versus a non-athlete;
           no single personality profile has been found that distinguishes athletes from
           non-athletes;
           team sport athletes seem to be more dependent/extroverted/anxious/less
           imaginative than individual sport athletes;
           few personality differences are evident between male and female athletes
           (particularly at the elite level);
           successful elite athletes are often characterized by the iceberg profile (that reflects
           positive      mental        health/high    vigour/low       tension/depression/anger/
           fatigue/confusion);
           personality tests are useful tools that help us better understand, monitor and work
           with athletes and exercisers;
           personality tests are not instruments that allow us to make sweeping
           generalizations about individuals’ behaviours and their performance;                      [3 max]



5.   (a)   controlling aspects of extrinsic rewards/external control through extrinsic reward;
           information aspect about level of performance (telling athletes that they are good);
           extrinsic rewards can either decrease or increase the level of intrinsic motivation;
           people have higher levels of intrinsic motivation after competitive success/gaining
           an extrinsic reward / vice versa;                                                         [2 max]

     (b)   the coaches’ “self-serving bias”/a tendency to attribute failure to uncontrollable
           external causes for example luck/weather conditions (in simple terms – it wasn’t
           their fault);
           a stable factor for example the coaches’ lack of talent in coaching / an unstable
           factor for example the lack of talent in the coaches’ team;
           an internal cause for example the coaches’ bad luck / an external cause for
           example a poor playing surface;
           a factor the coaches could control for example chosen tactics/strategy of the
           coaches for the game / a factor out of the coaches’ control for example a superior
           playing opposition;
           learned helplessness / the coaches perceived that their actions had no effect on the
           competition outcome / doomed to failure / coaches feel incompetent;                       [3 max]
                                                  –8–               N13/4/SPEXS/SP3/ENG/TZ0/XX/M


6.   (a)   positive emotions such as excitement/relief/pride/provocativeness;
           negative emotions such as anger/guilt/shame/anxiety/boredom;
           creating the emotions that result in the individual zone of optimal functioning;
           there are a personal “group” of emotions that are consistently associated with
           optimal performance for that individual;
           there are some emotions that are traditionally considered negative but for that
           individual they have a positive effect on performance for example anger;           [3 max]

     (b)   stress can occur when there is a substantial imbalance between the
           physical/psychological (environmental) demands placed on an individual and that
           person’s capability;
           the individual’s perception of the physical/psychological demand;
           the individual’s physical and psychological response to their perception of the
           situation;
           the actual behaviour of the individual under stress;                               [3 max]



7.   (a)   internal imagery: [1 max]
           emphasizes the feel of the movement;
           refers to the execution of a skill from your own vantage point;
           you only see what you would see if you actually executed the particular skill;

           external imagery: [1 max]
           there is little emphasis on the kinaesthetic feel of the movement;
           you view/have a perspective of the whole context;
           refers to viewing yourself from the perspective of an outside observer;            [2 max]

     (b)   a physically-oriented technique specifically designed to teach people to control
           physiological/autonomic responses;
           usually involves an electronic monitoring device to detect and amplify internal
           responses / visual/auditory feedback of physiological responses such as muscle
           activity/skin temperature/brain waves/heart rate;
           visualizing/positive self-talk are used to accomplish relaxation;
           feedback and non-feedback sessions for transfer to real situations;
           is a useful mechanism for coping with pre-competition anxiety;                     [2 max]

     (c)   risk factors can be classified into two groups, those over which the person has no
           control and those that can be altered through basic changes in lifestyle;
           cigarette smoking/high blood pressure/elevated blood lipids/physical inactivity
           (modifiable primary risk factors);
           obesity/diabetes (modifiable secondary risk factors);
           family history/gender/age/ethnicity (non-modifiable secondary risk factors);         [3 max]

            of the various tissues remains relatively constant;
            trained individuals have a lower percentage of their body composition as adipose
            tissue/fat; Accept responses in the converse for untrained individuals.

            water content (around 76 %);
            a high body fat content is related to a lower body water content as a percentage of
            body mass; Accept responses in the converse.

            (for example proteins, polysaccharides and lipids) from foods into smaller
            molecules (for example monosaccharides and amino acids);
            enzymes speed up reactions/the process of digestion;
            digestive enzymes are produced by the salivary glands, tongue, stomach, pancreas
            and small intestine;
            most enzymes only catalyse one reaction / specificity of enzymes;
            most enzymes have an optimum pH at which their activity is highest / different
            parts of the digestive system have a different pH range (for example salivary
            glands 6.0–7.0/stomach wall 1.0–3.5/small intestine 7.0–8.3);                           [3 max]

14.   (a)   the minimum level of energy expenditure that is required to sustain the body’s
            vital functions / the rate of metabolism measured under standard/basal conditions
            (awake, at rest, fasting) / OWTTE                                                        [1]

      (b)   distinction between fat and fat-free mass;
            maximizing fat-free mass is desirable for athletes involved in activities that
            require strength/power/muscular endurance;
            increased fat-free mass is likely to be undesirable for the endurance athlete /
            a higher fat-free mass is an additional load that might impair the performance of
            some athletes (for example high jumper);
            adding more fat to the body is generally detrimental to performance where the
            body weight must be moved through space (for example jumping/sprinting) / the
            higher the percentage of body fat, the poorer the performance is generally / less
            fat generally leads to better performance;
            relative body fat is less important for more stationary activities
            (for example archery/shooting) / heavyweight weightlifters and some categories
            of swimming might be the exception to the general rule that less fat is better;      [3 max]

      (c)   carbohydrate loading is a dietary technique used to enhance prolonged
            performance;
            high-carbohydrate foods/drinks/both are ingested on the days before an event to
            increase the stores of muscle glycogen;
            traditional method involved depletion of muscle glycogen several days before the
            competition / (it is now known) that the depletion phase is unnecessary in trained
            athletes;
            trained athletes need only eat a high-carbohydrate diet (7 to 10 g kg–1 body mass
            per day) for three days combined with a reduction in training;
            the reason for the difference between trained and untrained people lies in the
            enzyme glycogen synthase (involved in the storage of muscle glycogen);
            glycogen synthase is activated in untrained individuals by the depletion phase of
            the carbohydrate loading regimen / in trained people this enzyme is already
            maximally activated as a result of daily training;
            recent research of highly trained athletes has shown that even three days of
            carbohydrate loading is longer than needed to maximize muscle glycogen stores;
            by ingesting 10 g kg–1 body mass per day of carbohydrate, maximal muscle
            glycogen concentrations can be attained within 24–36 hours in trained athletes
            (when combined with reduced training load);                                          [4 max]
