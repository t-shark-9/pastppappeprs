Subject Details:             Computer Science HL Paper 2 Markscheme

Mark Allocation

Candidates are required to answer ALL questions [20 marks] for question 1, [20 marks] for question 2,
[20 marks] for question 3 and [40 marks] for question 4. Maximum total = [100 marks].

General

A markscheme often has more specific points worthy of a mark than the total allows. This is intentional.
Do not award more than the maximum marks allowed for that part of a question.

When deciding upon alternative answers by candidates to those given in the markscheme, consider the
following points:

         Each statement worth one point has a separate line and the end is signified by means of a
           semi-colon (;).

         An alternative answer or wording is indicated in the markscheme by a “/”; either wording can
           be accepted.

         Words in ( … ) in the markscheme are not necessary to gain the mark.

         If the candidate’s answer has the same meaning or can be clearly interpreted as being the
           same as that in the markscheme then award the mark.

         Mark positively. Give candidates credit for what they have achieved, and for what they
           have got correct, rather than penalizing them for what they have not achieved or what they
           have got wrong.

         Remember that many candidates are writing in a second language; be forgiving of
           minor linguistic slips. In this subject effective communication is more important than
           grammatical accuracy.

         Occasionally, a part of a question may require a calculation whose answer is required for
           subsequent parts. If an error is made in the first part then it should be penalized. However, if
           the incorrect answer is used correctly in subsequent parts then follow through marks
           should be awarded. Indicate this with “FT”.

     (c)   (i)       Award up to [4 marks max].
                     searchName is compared to the root;
                     If smaller (alphabetically) it is then compared with the left child (if
                     bigger, the right child);
                     This continues until the node is found;

     (b)   (i)    Award up to [3 marks max].
                  The records in the file should be sorted;
                  Based on the value of the whale identifier (or key field);
                  The whale identifiers must be unique;
                  The whale identifiers cannot have any “gaps”, if there are N whales,
                  the whale identifiers should be 0 to N–1;                                    [3 marks]

           (ii)   The (fixed) size of a record;
                  Should be multiplied by the whale identifier;
                  The result gives the offset from the start of the file to the start of the
                  desired record;                                                              [3 marks]

           The number of dives should be increased by one;
           The distance between the last recorded location and the new position should
           be calculated and added to the total distance the whale has travelled;
           The last recorded location should be changed to the newly received position;
           The date/time of the last position should be replaced with the current
           date/time;                                                                          [5 marks]

     (d)   The archive file could be broken into smaller files;
           That are small enough to fit in the available memory;
           The individual files can would then be sorted;
           The sorted files can be merged into a single, sorted archive file;                  [4 marks]

     (e)   Award marks as follows, up to [4 marks max].
           Award [1 mark] for identifying a group with whom the information might be

           Award [2 marks] for identifying 2 issues or discussing one issue with its
           consequence related to a particular group.

           consequences and 2 corresponding groups of people related to these issues.          [4 marks]

           Award [1 mark] for identifying the precaution;
           Award [1 mark] for describing the precaution beyond simply stating it;
           For two precautions.

           For example:
           Assign a password to the device;
           So it cannot be accessed by an unauthorized user;

           Do not store sensitive data on the smartphone;
           So that it is not there to be found if the device is lost;

           Do not store username/password account logins (or “remember me”
           cookies) on the device;
           So somebody finding the device will not be able to access your accounts;         [4 marks]

     (b)   Award marks as follows up to [4 marks max].
           Award [1 mark] for identifying the reason;
           Award [1 mark] for an elaboration;
           For two reasons.

           For example:
           Uses a smaller battery;
           So weighs less;

           Can be marketed as green;
           Increases sales;

           Will charge up when outside;
           Less chance it will run out of power;                                            [4 marks]

     (c)   They change frequencies several times a second;
           Limited range;

     (d)   Award up to [3 marks max].
           Bluetooth is much slower than Ethernet;
           Ethernet requires a physical connection, Bluetooth does not;
           Ethernet is more secure than Bluetooth;
           An Ethernet network requires additional hardware (routers, hubs, etc).
           Bluetooth does not;                                                              [3 marks]

           Award [1 mark] for each disadvantage up to [2 marks max].
           Award [2 marks] for a discussion that does more than state them.

           Advantages:
           Emergency services can locate a distress call;
           Friends can see where you are and meet you;
           Advertisements could be tailored for things that are near you;

           Disadvantages:
           Illegal surveillance is possible;
           Advertisers could profile your physical habits as well as your online;
           Loss of location information (eg in a tunnel) could create erroneous data
           in systems;                                                                   [6 marks]

           (ii)   Cache memory is much faster than secondary memory (eg a
                  hard-drive);
                  Data that will not fit in RAM but will be needed soon is put into
                  cache;
                  And loaded back into memory when needed;                               [3 marks]

     (g)   (i)    Award marks as follows up to [4 marks max].
                  Award [1 mark] for identifying the idea;
                  Award [1 mark] for elaborating on how it helps;
                  For two cases.

                  For example:
                  By letting them access nutrition information when eating out;
                  So they can eat healthier food;

                  By supporting applications to monitor/track exercise;
                  So they will be inspired to do more of it;

                  By monitoring vital signs;
                  To detect unhealthy conditions;                                        [4 marks]

                  Award [1 mark] for identifying the reason;
                  Award [1 mark] for elaborating on why;

                  For example:
                  By being too engaging;
                  Causing the user to not pay attention to the real world;

                  By taking up too much of the users’ time;
                  Causing them to exercise or socialize less;                            [2 marks]

           Award [1 mark] for identifying the consequence;
           Award [1 mark] for elaborating on the result;
           For two consequences.

           For example:
           Seamless integration with internet service;
           Allows more effective communication;
