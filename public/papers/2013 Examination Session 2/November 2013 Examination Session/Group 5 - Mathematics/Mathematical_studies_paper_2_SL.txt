Please start each question on a new page. You are advised to show all working, where possible.
Where an answer is incorrect, some marks may be given for a correct method, provided this is shown by
written working. Solutions found from a graphic display calculator should be supported by suitable working,
for example, if graphs are used to find a solution, you should sketch these as part of your answer.

      terminus and the price, in $, of a return ticket from each regional station to the terminus.

      (a)     Draw a scatter diagram for the above data. Use a scale of 1 cm to represent 10 km on
              the x-axis and 1 cm to represent $10 on the y-axis.                                            [4]

      Give all answers in this question correct to two decimal places.

      Arthur lives in London. On 1st August 2008 Arthur paid 37 500 euros (EUR) for a new car
      from Germany. The price of the same car in London was 34 075 British pounds (GBP).

      The exchange rate on 1st August 2008 was 1 EUR = 0.7234 GBP .

      (a)   Calculate, in GBP, the price that Arthur paid for the car.                              [2]

      (b)   Write down, in GBP, the amount of money Arthur saved by buying the car in Germany.      [1]

      On 1st August 2008 Arthur invested the money he saved in a bank that paid 4.5 % annual
      simple interest.

      (c)   Calculate, in GBP, the value of Arthur’s investment on 1st August 2012.                 [3]

      Between 1st August 2008 and 1st August 2012 Arthur’s car depreciated at an annual rate
      of 9 % of its current value.

      (d)   Calculate the value, in GBP, of Arthur’s car on 1st August 2009.                        [3]

      (e)   Show that the value of Arthur’s car on 1st August 2012 was 18 600 GBP, correct to the
            nearest 100 GBP.                                                                        [3]

      On 1st August 2012 Arthur sold his car for 18 600 GBP and bought a new car from Germany
      for 30 500 EUR. He used the 18 600 GBP and the value of the investment he made on
      1st August 2008 to buy the new car.

      The exchange rate on 1st August 2012 was 1 EUR = 0.8694 GBP .

      (f)   Calculate the amount of money remaining, in EUR, after the car had been bought.         [4]
