Please start each question on a new page. Full marks are not necessarily awarded for a correct answer
with no working. Answers must be supported by working and/or explanations. In particular, solutions
found from a graphic display calculator should be supported by suitable working. For example, if graphs
are used to find a solution, you should sketch these as part of your answer. Where an answer is incorrect,
some marks may be given for a correct method, provided this is shown by written working. You are therefore
advised to show all working.

      (a)   (i)    Draw a graph G   that represents the plan of the museum where each exhibition
                   room is represented by a vertex labelled with the exhibition room number and each
                   door between exhibition rooms is represented by an edge.   Do not consider the
                   entrance foyer as a museum exhibition room.

            (ii)   Write down the degrees of the vertices that represent each exhibition room.

            (iii) Virginia enters the museum through the entrance foyer.   Use your answers to
                  (i) and (ii) to justify why it is possible for her to visit the thirteen exhibition rooms
                  going through each internal doorway exactly once.                                           [4]
