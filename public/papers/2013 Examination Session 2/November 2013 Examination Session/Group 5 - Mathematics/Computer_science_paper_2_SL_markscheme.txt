Subject Details:             Computer Science SL Paper 2 Markscheme

Mark Allocation

Candidates are required to answer ALL questions [20 marks] for question 1, [20 marks] for question 2
and [30 marks] for question 3. Maximum total = [70 marks].

General

A markscheme often has more specific points worthy of a mark than the total allows. This is intentional.
Do not award more than the maximum marks allowed for that part of a question.

When deciding upon alternative answers by candidates to those given in the markscheme, consider the
following points:

         Each statement worth one point has a separate line and the end is signified by means of a
           semi-colon (;).

         An alternative answer or wording is indicated in the markscheme by a “/”; either wording
           can be accepted.

         Words in ( … ) in the markscheme are not necessary to gain the mark.

         If the candidate’s answer has the same meaning or can be clearly interpreted as being the
           same as that in the markscheme then award the mark.

         Mark positively. Give candidates credit for what they have achieved, and for what they have
           got correct, rather than penalizing them for what they have not achieved or what they have got
           wrong.

         Remember that many candidates are writing in a second language; be forgiving of
           minor linguistic slips. In this subject effective communication is more important than
           grammatical accuracy.

         Occasionally, a part of a question may require a calculation whose answer is required for
           subsequent parts. If an error is made in the first part then it should be penalized. However, if
           the incorrect answer is used correctly in subsequent parts then follow through marks
           should be awarded. Indicate this with “FT”.

1.   (a)   Award [1 mark] for each correct row.

            outArray         [0]        [1]            [2]   [3]         [4]      [5]
            Original          0           0             0     0            0         0
            i=1               0          4/3            0     0            0         0
            i=2               0          4/3            3     0            0         0
            i=3               0          4/3            3    7/3           0         0
            i=4               0          4/3            3    7/3          2/3        0       [4 marks]

     (b)   Award up to [1 mark max].
           each element in the output array is the average of the corresponding element
           and its (immediate) neighbours in the input array;
           calculates a 3-point moving average;
           (Accept that the values in the original array data are left unchanged;)           [1 mark]

     (c)   The average for an element is computed using the element before it – this
           would cause an out-of-bounds condition if you tried to compute it for the first
           element;
           The same problem would occur if you tried to compute an average for the last
           element – you need the element after it to compute the average;                   [2 marks]

     (d)   Award marks as follows:
           Award [1 mark] for a correct modification to compute the first element;
           Award [1 mark] for a correct modification to compute the last element;

           For example:
           Insert (either before or after the loop):
                 outArray[0] = (inArray[0] + inArray[1]) / 2.0;
                 outArray[n-1] = (inArray[n-2] + inArray[n-1]) / 2.0;

           Note: can also be carried out within the loop using “if” statements.              [2 marks]

     (e)   Award marks as follows:
           Award [1 mark] for including the correct elements in the same row;
           Award [1 mark] for including the correct elements in the same column;

           For example:
           outData = (data2[1][4] + data2[1][3]                    +    data2[1][5]      +
           data2[0][4] + data2[2][4]) / 5.0;                                                 [2 marks]

           Noting that the edges have 3 neighbouring elements that could be averaged;

           Award [1 mark] for identifying an advantage;
           Award [1 mark] for identifying a disadvantage;
           Award [1 mark] each up to [2 marks max] for elaborating and describing;

           Advantages:
           There is space to insert additional FarmField objects;
           Avoids creating a new (smaller array) when deleting a FarmField object;

           Disadvantages:
           Cannot use the length() method to determine how many FarmField
           objects there are;
           Code for insert and delete is complex;
           Memory wasted;                                                                    [4 marks]

3.   (a)   Award marks as follows up to [4 marks max].
           Award [1 mark] for identifying the precaution;
           Award [1 mark] for describing the precaution beyond simply stating it;
           For two precautions.

           For example:
           Assign a password to the device;
           So it cannot be accessed by an unauthorized user;

           Do not store sensitive data on the smartphone;
           So that it is not there to be found if the device is lost;

           Do not store username/password account logins (or “remember me”
           cookies) on the device;
           So somebody finding the device will not be able to access your accounts;         [4 marks]

     (b)   Award marks as follows up to [4 marks max].
           Award [1 mark] for identifying the reason;
           Award [1 mark] for an elaboration;
           For two reasons.

           For example:
           Uses a smaller battery;
           So weighs less;

           Can be marketed as green;
           Increases sales;

           Will charge up when outside;
           Less chance it will run out of power;                                            [4 marks]

     (c)   They change frequencies several times a second;
           Limited range;
           Addressing (not pairing);                                                        [3 marks]

     (d)   Award up to [3 marks max].
           Bluetooth is much slower than Ethernet;
           Ethernet requires a physical connection, Bluetooth does not;
           Ethernet is more secure than Bluetooth;
           An Ethernet network requires additional hardware (routers, hubs, etc).
           Bluetooth does not;                                                              [3 marks]

Question 3 continued

     (e)   Award [1 mark] for each advantage up to [2 marks max].
           Award [1 mark] for each disadvantage up to [2 marks max].
           Award [2 marks] for a discussion that does more than state them.

           Advantages:
           Emergency services can locate a distress call;
           Friends can see where you are and meet you;
           Advertisements could be tailored for things that are near you;

           Disadvantages:
           Illegal surveillance is possible;
           Advertisers could profile your physical habits as well as your online ones;
           Loss of location information (eg in a tunnel) could create erroneous data
           in systems;                                                                   [6 marks]

     (f)   (i)    Flash memory, or EEPROM, or hard-drive;                                [1 mark]

           (ii)   Cache memory is much faster than secondary memory (eg a
                  hard-drive);
                  Data that will not fit in RAM but will be needed soon is put into
                  cache;
                  And loaded back into memory when needed;                               [3 marks]

            Marks      Details
              1–2      The candidate conveys some understanding of at least one effect
                       of widespread ownership but merely states it/them without
                       elaboration or example.
              3–4      The candidate clearly identifies two or more effects and
                       elaborates on one of them to explore at least one consequence of
                       this effect.
              5–6      The candidate clearly identifies and        elaborates   on   the
                       consequences of two or more effects.

           Answer to be focused on students. Examples include:
           Positive:
           •     Contact teachers with queries
           •     Research topics
           •     Replace expensive textbooks
           •     Make study schedules
           •     Store PowerPoint presentations

           Negative:
           •    Become a distraction in class
           •    Reliance on smartphones as knowledge source
           •    Plagiarism issues
           •    Cheating in exams                                                          [6 marks]
