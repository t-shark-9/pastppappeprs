                                            SECTION A

1.   (a)   Describe one advantage and one disadvantage of a private limited company.          [4 marks]

           The advantages of a private limited company may include the following:
            the owners have a limited liability
            control of the company cannot be lost to outsiders without the agreement of
             current shareholders
            there may be some tax advantages
            more capital can be raised compared with a sole trader, or a partnership.

           The disadvantages of a private limited company may include the following:
            the legal requirement takes time and costs money
            members of the public have access to financial information
            dividends should be given to shareholders which may reduce the retained
             profit.

           Accept any other relevant advantage/disadvantage with a description.


           N.B. Given that the question does not ask for application to SF, do not penalize
                candidates who do not refer to SF.

           Mark as 2 + 2.

           Award [1 mark] for each relevant and correct advantage/disadvantage of a
           private limited company identified and [1 mark] for an appropriate description
           up to a maximum of [2 marks].
                                            –6–              N13/3/BUSMT/HP2/ENG/TZ0/XX/M


(b)   Explain two appropriate sources of finance that SF could use to purchase the
      20 new scooters.                                                             [4 marks]

      Appropriate sources of finance that SF could use to purchase the new scooters
      may include the following:
       given the large amount of funds required ($80000) and the relatively medium-
        term life span of the fixed assets, SF’s Finance Manager may consider issuing
        more shares privately. A relatively large amount, or at least the required
        amount, of funds can be raised without interest payment, provided that the
        other shareholders agree.
       a bank loan can also be an option. The bank manager is likely to agree to the
        request as no information is given on any liquidity problem and it appears that
        SF is profitable and the current ownership will not be diluted and will stay
        within the family.
       hire purchase can be used which allows SF’s manager to not need to pay
        immediately for the scooters. This can be used to avoid depreciation.
       retained profit can also be used. It is said that the shareholders want more
        dividends so the assumption is that SF has been profitable. This option is an
        internal source of finance.
       through a leasing system SF will have the required fixed asset and will be able
        to use the scooters for a specific period of time without the responsibility of
        owning them. However, leasing, strictly speaking, is not purchasing. SF will
        have to make monthly leasing payments and at the end of the leasing period SF
        could decide to purchase the scooters. An initial deposit is not required.

      Accept any other relevant source of finance with an explanation.


      N.B. Although scooters are medium-term assets, do not penalise for a long-term
           source of finance. Do not accept short-term source of finance.

      Mark as 2 + 2.

      Award [1 mark] for each relevant and correct source of finance identified and
      [1 mark] for a relevant and correct explanation with application to SF or to its
      product (scooters) up to a maximum of [2 marks].

      N.B. Just mentioning the name of the organization cannot be considered
           as application.

      If there is no relevant application to the stimulus material award up to a maximum
      of [2 marks].

(c)   (i)   Using the straight line method of depreciation, calculate the
            depreciation for each year and the book value (value of scooters less
            depreciation) of the 20 new scooters at the end of each year of their
            expected useful life (four years) (show all your working).            [4 marks]

            Using the straight line depreciation method the same value of depreciation is

(iii) Explain one consequence of the Finance Manager’s decision regarding
      the percentage rate at which the assets should be depreciated.      [3 marks]

     The depreciation rate should really be as accurate and realistic as possible.

     A lower depreciation rate than the chosen 40% will result in a lower
     depreciation amount for each year, including 2014 and hence a lower
     depreciation amount under expenses in the profit and loss account; and
     hence creates a higher level of net profit before interest and tax. SF will
     have to pay a higher level of tax and will be left with less profit to be
     distributed as dividends.

     Also, a lower depreciation amount for 2014 and the other years will result in
     higher net fixed assets on the balance sheet. Higher net fixed assets can
     further affect some of the ratios such as ROCE. This efficiency ratio utilises
     capital employed (net assets) and operating profit, both of which are
     affected by depreciation. A lower depreciation figure increases CE as the
     book value of assets is higher. Lower depreciation will also increase EBIT
     due to lower expense deductions. These effects can raise ROCE, which is
     often seen as a key or Primary Ratio in comparing the performance of
     potential of investments.
     A higher depreciation rate chosen will create opposite consequences.

     Accept any other relevant consequence with an explanation.


     N.B. Candidates are not expected for [3 marks] to provide the exact
          detailed comments as above.

     Candidates are not expected to refer to both higher and lower depreciation
     rates for the marks available.

     Candidates are not expected to use figures to support their explanation of
     the effects of different depreciation rate.

     Award [1 mark] for some implied but very limited knowledge of
     one consequence.

     Award [2 marks] for one effect/consequence that is only described.

     Award [3 marks] for one clear explanation of one possible consequence.
     For example, one effect on the balance sheet, or one effect on the profit and
     loss account.

(d)   Examine the decision of SF’s Finance Manager to change the depreciation
      method from straight line to reducing balance.                          [6 marks]

      SF’s Finance Manager’s decision to change the depreciation method from straight
      line to reducing balance will result in the following:

      The manager will give up the advantages of the straight line method – it is simple
      and might be useful when the residual value is precisely known. The reducing
      balance method may also be more useful/realistic for SF as assets like scooters
      depreciate a lot/lose more value during the early years/months of usage.
      The value of the net fixed assets on the balance sheet will be more accurately
      reflected throughout.

      Moreover, the repair and the maintenance costs for aging scooters are likely to
      increase as time goes by. Hence, if SF’s Finance Manager uses the reducing
      balance method, the total expenses on the profit and loss account will be more
      equal and accurate over time. As the depreciation amount decreases from
      $32000 in 2014 to $6912 in 2017 the maintenance costs are highly likely to
      increase.

      However, the Finance Manager is not sure of the depreciation percentage.
      40% might be either too low or too high and hence the figures will be inaccurate.

      The Finance Manager is also considering various legal ways of reducing SF’s tax
      liabilities / expenses in the coming year (2014). A high depreciation amount
      using the reducing balance method during the early years of the scooters under
      this method will enable the manager to show low net profit and hence low tax
      liability. The movement to the reducing balance method will also support the
      wishes of the family members who might be given more dividends if there are less
      tax liabilities. The above are relevant for the first two years.

      Accept any other relevant examination.


      N.B. It is not expected that candidates will include all of the above points in their
           answer.

      A balanced response is one that covers at least two issues for and at least
      two issues against.

      For one relevant issue that is one-sided, with no examination, award up to a
      maximum of [3 marks].

      For one relevant issue that is balanced, with examination, award up to a maximum
      of [4 marks].

      For more than one relevant issue that is one-sided, with no examination award up

2.   (a)   (i)    Define the term outsourcing.                                                     [2 marks]

                  Outsourcing is the act of transferring internal business activities that are
                  largely deemed peripheral to an external provider and provide some benefits
                  to the organization like costs cutting.


                  Candidates are not expected to word their definition exactly as above.
                  Examples are not expected.

                  N.B. Do not credit a definition of outsourcing.

                  Award [1 mark] for a basic definition that conveys partial knowledge and
                  understanding.

                  Award [2 marks] for a full, clear definition that conveys knowledge and
                  understanding similar to the answer above.

           (ii)   Identify two features of a quality control system.                               [2 marks]

                  The features may include the following:
                   quality is “controlled” by one person or department
                   a percentage reject/wastage rate is accepted
                   quality checks are made after production – it is retrospective
                   if a fault is found then production is halted until the problem is resolved
                   quality checks are per job and not for the whole process
                   accept any other relevant feature.


                  N.B. Based on the assumption that quality control system is different to
                       quality assurance/culture, a description of a feature of quality
                       assurance is not relevant.

                  An identification of features is expected rather than a definition of what the
                  system is.

                  Award [1 mark] for each appropriate feature identified up to a maximum
                  of [2 marks].

(ii)   Calculate the total float and the free float for Task B and describe the
       impact of delaying Task B by 20 days.                                    [3 marks]

       For Task B the total float  LFT (task F)  Duration  EST (task B)
                                   85  60  0
                                   25days

       For Task B the free float  EST (task F)  Duration  EST (task B)
                                  70  60  0
                                  10days

       Therefore a delay of Task B by 20 days will delay Task F by 10 days but the

(d)   Examine the importance of communication for Mapa in its management of
      the crisis.                                                           [6 marks]

      On one hand it can be argues that a lack of communication was central to the
      creation of the problems / crisis and possibly also contributed to (mis)management
      of the crisis for the following reasons:

      The poor external communication between Mapa and the Icelandic company due to
      language problems and different cultures created the poor quality of the GPS. It
      also weakened the ability of Mapa to respond to the crisis. However, Mapa’s slow
      response (internal) to the negative news reports escalated the crisis and caused a
      drop in confidence (external). Rumours, a form of unofficial communication
      channel, further undermined the credibility of Mapa’s GPS devices. Moreover,
      Poor internal communication hindered Mapa’s ability to respond to the crisis.
      Crisis management is all about being seen to respond swiftly and competently to an
      issue. Mapa clearly failed to do this.

      On the other hand, the media picked up the news, which also acted as a catalyst
      for Mapa to respond and take action hence it can be argued that some forms of
      external communication channel and the message actually forced Mapa to handle
      the crisis.

      Moreover, communication is not the only problem here. It could be argued that
      the root cause of the problem was the poor quality testing / control in Portugal in
      the summer that failed to pick up the defect. One can also argue that the tall
      structure and more importantly the bureaucratic corporate culture intensified the
      quality problems and made the management of the crisis less effective.

            the management style of the organization, the organization structure as well as
             the decision-making process, a tall structure and possible autocratic style will
             result in a different culture than a small, flat organization
            people behaviour, attitudes, the nature of the tasks that employees face, shared
             history, the owners’ background, or personality
            the national culture may also influence an organizational structure
            accept any other influence.

     (b)   (i)   Explain the importance of earnings per share to a shareholder.                 [2 marks]

                 Earnings per share (EPS) is one of the shareholders ratios. It shows
                 theoretically, the amount of dividends that a company could have paid to its
                 shareholders if all of the net profit after interest and tax was paid in
                 dividends and none was kept as retained profit. The higher the (EPS) figure
                 the higher the dividends that could have been received per share.

                 Although it is unrealistic to expect such a management decision, it enables
                 the shareholders to compare the actual dividends per share given with a
                 potential sum. The ratio provides a useful indicator of the value of the
                 company’s shares.

                 Accept any other relevant explanation.

                 Award [1 mark] for identifying one issue of importance identified or for
                 describing what the ratio actually measures and [1 mark] for an appropriate

(ii)   Distinguish between two external methods of recruitment that an

       Some of the external methods of recruitment that an organization could use
       to recruit a new CEO include:
        word of mouth – the owners might have heard of a successful person or a
          current CEO in a different organization and approach this person
        headhunting – possibly through a specialized agency that has a list of
          potentially suitable candidates
        advertising in national or global newspapers / magazines, internet,
          websites and so on
        accept any other relevant external method of recruitment.


       Award [1 mark] for each relevant external method of recruitment identified
       and [2 marks] for an appropriate distinction between the two methods, up to
       a maximum of [4 marks].

       The suggested methods must be appropriate to the recruitment of a highly
       professional CEO. Do not credit candidates who just list some general
       methods that are not really appropriate such as job centres and
       local advertisements. Do not credit candidates that refer to internal
       recruitment.

(c)   Examine the usefulness to an organization of rapid change management
      imposed by a new “outsider” CEO.                                     [6 marks]
      Rapid change management imposed on an organization by a new “outsider” CEO
      can be necessary and hence useful for the following reasons:

      During crisis, financial or otherwise, rapid action and decision making is needed. It
      is often better for a CEO with (possibly) other senior managers to react quickly to
      make an imposed strategic or tactical decision. A slow, negotiated change
      management strategy will delay the process of change. Some dire consequences to
      an organization may occur in the meantime. The newly appointed CEO is likely to
      have the right industry knowledge, the confidence, shareholders’ support and
      experience to pursue the change.

      An imposed and rapid change may also be suitable when the employees are not
      ready yet in terms of skills and experiences and/or unwilling to get involved in
      strategic change. Some argue that change management in this situation is better
      left to the CEO with his/her experience/skills. A short process that leads to a rapid
      change is less costly.

      The structure, culture and nature of the organization (military, dangerous product,
      confidential information, nuclear reactor) also affect the nature of change
      management.

      However, a rapid and imposed change is likely to create resentment and resistance
      if the employees do not perceive the situation as some sort of crisis and/or if they
      believe that they have the skills, experience and willingness to be consulted and
      believe they should be allowed to participate in the change management process.

      As stated in the stimulus, the new “outsider” CEO may be over confident regarding
      the support he/she might have as well as inside knowledge and experience. Not
      being familiar with the culture of an organization especially if the employees are
      willing and able to participate in the required change management could lead to
      industrial unrest / dispute / de-motivation and even the loss of skilled employees.
      Moreover, rapid change will not allow time for training and development,
      communication and so on.
      A non negotiated/imposed change can create fear and seriously affect the motivation
      of the employees who may feel unappreciated or unimportant. A slow change and
      possibly a negotiated one is likely to be more accepted and more easily implemented.
      For these reasons it can be argued that negotiated and possibly incremental change
      management should be more useful.

      Accept any other relevant examination.

      It is not expected that candidates will include all of the above points in their answer.

      A balanced response is one that covers at least two issues for and at least
      two issues against.

      For one relevant issue that is one-sided, with no examination, award up to a
      maximum of [3 marks]. For one relevant issue that is balanced, with examination,
      award up to a maximum of [4 marks].

      Marks should be allocated according to the markbands on page 3.

(d)   Discuss whether organizations that promote CEOs internally are more likely
      to be successful.                                                          [9 marks]

      By promoting internally there is a cost cutting advantage and the potential to
      create competitiveness. This, however, is likely to be offset by the 65% higher
      financial rewards and the shorter length in service. Also, recruiting a new CEO is
      a very expensive and time consuming process. Having to recruit a new CEO
      relatively frequently may erode the cost cutting merit.

      The research presented in the table indeed found that those companies who
      routinely promoted CEOs from within (internally) significantly outperformed
      those that were recruited externally. However, there are some issues regarding the
      validity of the research:
       these findings are not the most up to date (ends 2007). Perhaps more up to date
         information should have been consulted.
       only certain types of organizations were researched – 36 large public limited
         companies. Perhaps different types of organizations require different types of
         CEOs, possibly “outsiders” with fresh ideas and those who are not possibly
         constricted by the current organizational culture.
       also, the research has been done on American companies. In different parts of
         the world with different national and organizational culture the results may
         have been different – in favour of “outsiders”.
       the sample size of 36 might not be fully representative.
       accept any other arguments in terms of possible limitations of the market
         research.

      Candidates may also refer to some motivational theory.

      Content motivation theories like Maslow and Herzberg, and process theories like
      Adams identify the benefits of promoting from within to such a desirable position
      of CEOs. The motivation of the promoted person as well as that of his/her peers
      can significantly improve the chance of promotion, the availability of a very
      challenging job can be seen as a “motivator” according to Herzberg as well as a
      chance for the employees to achieve self esteem / self actualization needs
      according to Maslow. A valued outcome and sense of fairness may also
      increase motivation. (It is not expected that a long discussion is presented about
      the motivation theories.)

      Nevertheless, given the fact that only one person is likely to be promoted within a
      period of time, this might somewhat reduce the significance of the above
      arguments.

      However, it can be argued that rapid and drastic change if needed in emergency
      situations may require a competent CEO who feels he/she got the mandate to
      impose the change. It states in the stimulus that “outsiders” feel more empowered
      to implement changes. Outsiders may also be better at crisis management with
      fresh ideas / strategy and the power/mandate to implement them.

      On the other hand, employees might be more willing to follow change if
      carried out / led by a person who knows and understands the organization.
      Less resistance to change is likely to occur.

However, those who were not promoted might feel resentment and become
demotivated (the opposite use of the different motivation theories as above) and
might actively resist changes.

The culture may be negatively affected and the organizations’ accumulated
knowledge / know-how could be lost especially if other senior managers leave.

The financial performance indicators are significantly higher in companies led by
“insiders”.

Overall, based on the information given in the stimulus, one may conclude
that the benefits of using “insiders” are greater than the arguments against.
The figures and the examples of successful companies (well known worldwide)
clearly support that notion. Nevertheless, one has to be aware of a possible bias
and the concentration of the research on 36 large public limited American
companies.


N.B Given question (c) the issue of change management is of less significance in
this response.

It is not expected that all the points/issues above are covered.

Accept any other relevant arguments for or against promoting internally.

Accept any other substantiated conclusion/judgment.

It is not expected that the answer includes specific motivation theories or theorists
for the candidates to reach the top markband.

A balanced response is one that covers at least two arguments in favour and at
least two arguments against.

For one relevant issue that is one-sided, award up to [3 marks]. If the response is
a one-sided relevant approach with no analysis/examination award a maximum of
[4 marks].

Award a maximum of [5 marks] if the answer is of a standard that shows balanced
analysis and understanding throughout the response with reference to the stimulus
material but there is no judgment/conclusion.

Candidates cannot reach the [5–7] markband if they give judgment/conclusions
that are not based on analysis/explanation already given in their answer.

Marks should be allocated according to the markbands on page 4.

4.   (a)   Describe one advantage and one disadvantage to an organization of using
           e-commerce.                                                             [4 marks]

           Some of the advantages may include the following:
            an organization can reach a wider customer base
            low set up cost – money can be saved on rent and sales assistants if only
             e-commerce is used
            alternatively, if e-commerce is to be added to an already functioning
             organization, the cost of buying the technology is usually not very high
            transaction costs are relatively low.

           Some of the arguments against:
            security issues – credit/debit card numbers may be stolen; personal information
             may be taken by hackers
            some people do not feel confident in using electronic devices when shopping
            some customers are put off by the intangibility of the process and hence reduce
             their demand.

           Accept any other relevant advantage or disadvantage with a description, provided
           it refers to the seller not to the customer.


           Mark as 2 + 2.

           Award [1 mark] for each relevant advantage/disadvantage identified and [1 mark]
           for an appropriate description up to a maximum of [2 marks].

     (b)   (i)   Explain one benefit of sales forecasting for an organization.                     [2 marks]

                 Sales forecasting uses past and current data which can be seen as a useful
                 planning tool to reduce future uncertainties. Researchers identify the
                 trend based on a method of moving average to forecast the sales figures in
                 the future. Sales forecasting enables various budgets to be prepared for
                 different functions in the organization and objectives and strategies to be set
                 at various levels.
                 Accept any other relevant explanation.


                 Award [1 mark] for a relevant benefit identified and [1 mark] for an
                 appropriate explanation up to a maximum of [2 marks].
                                             – 22 –            N13/3/BUSMT/HP2/ENG/TZ0/XX/M


      (ii)   Distinguish between seasonal and cyclical variations to predict sales
             trends.                                                               [4 marks]

             Seasonal variations are used to adjust the predicted sales from the trend
             within one year to make a more accurate prediction for a specific quarter
             (season). The forecaster adjusts the predicted seasonal trend by the average
             fluctuation in the previous season.

             Over time, cyclical fluctuations occur in the sales figures due to the
             variation in the business / economic cycles. The changes are the result of
             recessions and booms in the economic cycle. To make the forecasted
             figures from the trend more accurate, a forecaster adjusts the predicted sales
             figures by the average of the cyclical variations.


             [1 to 2 marks]
             Award [1 mark] for an answer that shows some basic knowledge of the
             concepts eg brief definitions of seasonal and cyclical variations. Award
             [2 marks] for a theoretical answer that shows some clear, basic knowledge
             of the difference between seasonal and cyclical variations.

             [3 to 4 marks]
             For [3 marks] the candidate links either seasonal or cyclical variations to
             sales trends. For [4 marks] there is distinction between seasonal and
             cyclical variations and how they are used to adjust the originally predicted/
             forecasted sales which was based on the trends.

(c)   Examine the usefulness of traditional secondary research to identify market
      trends and for forecasting.                                                 [6 marks]

      The traditional method of collecting past secondary data and to make forecasts
      can be seen as useful/relevant/reliable tool when the market is stable or slow
      changing and when the forecast is done for a very short period. Moreover, the
      traditional method of collecting secondary sources and forecasting could also be
      seen as reliable if the sources are known as reliable and unbiased. Collecting data
      that already exists can save time and effort for the researchers.

      However, the main assumption that what happened in the past will likely happen
      in the future is overly simplistic and often inaccurate, given the fast moving and
      often unstable both internal and external environment. The figures used may be
      outdated and to some extent also unreliable – it depends on who collected the
      figures; and how. Long-term forecasts from the trend are likely to be less reliable.


      Accept any other relevant points for and/or against.

      Accept any other relevant examination.

      N.B. Candidates may emphasize more the issue of forecasting, or the issue of
           secondary sources, give credit for both.

      If the response does not address the issue of forecasting award up to [4 marks].

      For a text book response that covers the advantages and/or disadvantages of
      secondary research as oppose to primary research, award [2 marks].

      It is not expected that candidates will include all of the above points in their
      answer.

      A balanced response is one that covers at least two issues for and at least
      two issues against.

      For one relevant issue that is one-sided, with no examination, award up to a
      maximum of [3 marks].

      For one relevant issue that is balanced, with examination, award up to a maximum
      of [4 marks].

      Marks should be allocated according to the mark-bands on page 3.

(d)   Evaluate the use of “social media to collect online messages in order to
      understand consumers’ moods” for making market predictions.              [9 marks]

      One may argue that the use of social media to discover consumers’ moods and to
      make market predictions is the most up to date advanced way to do so. It gives
      real-time information rather than relying on the use of old data.

      More people are now using the various types of social media, so the size of
      the market is big enough for meaningful results. The statistics clearly demonstrate
      a significant growth of users.

      Many customers are unfazed by researchers and moreover, are willing to
      constantly share information and opinions with anybody who might be interested.

      The technological advancement also makes the process more accurate and
      definitely cheaper and quicker.

      Increasingly, better known companies use social media to communicate with their
      current and potential customers. The use of social media for market research can
      be seen as a natural progression. Many customers are very willing to share their
      opinion, thoughts, habits, etc.

      Accept any other relevant issue.

      However, Mr Watts, an Internet researcher at Yahoo! said that “to be useful,
      a forecasting technique must add something new to what is already known.
      The use of social media will only add value to forecasting if other sources of
      information are limited”. Researchers might just get some obvious information
      that is open for all to see.

      Sophisticated methods based on natural language analysis of tweets, blogs or
      Facebook pages currently use / hold “disruptive potential”. Information might be
      gathered only from the people who are more technologically savvy, or are more
      open to share information at all times. Some possible misleading information or
                                      – 24 –            N13/3/BUSMT/HP2/ENG/TZ0/XX/M


at least unrepresentative information might be gathered. See the statistics of
the user of Twitter. The information gathered might enable various companies to
target Caucasians well who are young. Other age groups and other ethnic groups
might be ignored or not well served. While it might be useful for some
organizations, it might not be useful for others like those who want to research the
older segments of the population, or mainly non-Caucasian groups. Also, some
issue of censorship in some countries may still exist.

Accept any other relevant argument.

On balance / in conclusion:
Given the fact that more and more people and commercial companies use some
sort of social media, it looks as if such research can be very useful for some
organizations. For others, it is clearly not. Researchers need to be aware of the
targeted sample and the fact that others might also have the same information and
may possibly deliberately misinform. Provided that the market research is not
solely carried out through the use of social media, one might conclude that the use
of social media for market research and further predictions can be judged as useful
and efficient provided that the researchers are aware of the limitations and use
other methods as well. Moreover, the availability of technology that can
recognize sarcasm, cultural differences and so on is a major positive argument in
favour of the use or possibly the growing use of social media.

Accept any other substantiated judgment.


A balanced response is one that covers at least two arguments in favour and at
least two arguments against.

For one relevant issue that is one-sided, award up to [3 marks]. If the response is
a one-sided relevant approach with no analysis/examination award a maximum of
[4 marks].

Award a maximum of [5 marks] if the answer is of a standard that shows balanced
analysis and understanding throughout the response with reference to the stimulus
material but there is no judgment/conclusion.

Candidates cannot reach the [5–7] markband if they give judgment/conclusions
that are not based on analysis/explanation already given in their answer.

Marks should be allocated according to the markbands on page 4.

5.   (a)   Define the term patent.                                                           [2 marks]

           A patent is the exclusive right, granted by a government, to make use of an
           invention or process for a specific period of time. It gives the inventor the
           intellectual property rights to the invention.


           Candidates are not expected to word their definition exactly as above.

           Award [1 mark] for a basic definition that conveys partial knowledge and
           understanding.

           Award [2 marks] for a full, clear definition that conveys knowledge and
           understanding similar to the answer above.

           For only a relevant: example or application to the stimulus award [1 mark].

     (b)   Describe one problem faced by a new business start-up.                            [2 marks]

           The problems may include finding the following:
            the funds
            the lack of the product differentiation / USP
            difficulties in recruiting suitable and experienced employees
            the lack of an established relationship with suppliers
            the costly and time-consuming legal aspects
            a lack of experience in strategic decision making
            accept any other relevant problem.

           Accept any other relevant description.


           Award [1 mark] for a relevant problem identified and [1 mark] for a full, clear
           description that conveys knowledge and understanding, up to a maximum of
           [2 marks].

(c)   Explain the role and importance of research and development (R&D)
      for Kodak.                                                        [6 marks]

      The role of R&D is to conduct extensive research into features, designs, testing of
      prototypes and so on in order to develop a new / unique, innovative product. By
      doing so:
       More value being added over and above the cost of resources – R&D plays an
         important role in lowering the costs of resources or their processing
       Rapid and successful R&D provided a competitive advantage to Kodak in the
         film processing business. Kodak enjoyed, and could have enjoyed with
         subsequent products, a first mover advantage by product differentiation. Its
         R&D did result in new products, as stated in the stimulus, digital cameras,
         photo viewing and photo sharing products, R&D was very important for Kodak
         earlier on.
       R&D can improve brand perception (as an innovator) and acts as a barrier to
         entry for other competitors.
      The above can result in an improved new and large product range, greater appeal
      to a broader range of market segments and better performance in terms of lower
      costs, higher revenue.

      Kodak understood the role and the importance of R&D. The above should have
      led to a long- (as well as short-) term success. Kodak dominated the film
      processing industry for a long while.

      Accept any other relevant explanation.


      N.B. A clear distinction between the role and importance is not expected.

      Award [1 to 2 marks] if the response is limited and descriptive. There is no or
      limited reference to the stimulus material (name only) and the response is mainly
      theoretical.

      Award [3 to 4 marks] if the explanation lacks some depth and less than two issues
      are covered. The candidate has referred directly to the stimulus material.
      A response that is based on the issue of market research without covering the
      issue of development, award up to [3 marks].

      Award [5 to 6 marks] if the explanation is detailed and covers at least two
      issues. The candidate has referred directly to the stimulus material.
      For [6 marks] a clear distinction between research and development should have
      been made.

      The BCG matrix may look like the one above.
      On one hand, the film processing cameras were clearly different from the others.
      These products went through the full product life cycle, became cash cows and
      eventually, went into decline and became dogs. It is stated in the stimulus that
      Kodak had long dominated the market. Kodak quite likely used/milked the cash
      from these products to develop and promote the other products mentioned in the
      stimulus. It appeared that the film processing cameras had a long maturity and
      saturation stages eventually moved from being a cash cow to becoming
      a dog so one may argue that the issue of developing, introducing and managing
      new products was not a contributor to the bankruptcy.

      On the other hand, the photo viewer market was the wrong market for Kodak as
      the market had low growth and they were not the leader; clearly the Kodak photo
      viewers became dogs soon after being a question mark. Hence the management
      of this product can be seen as a contributor to the bankruptcy.

      Moreover, the digital and photo sharing cameras had potential that was realized
      to a small extent only / never realized. For the digital cameras, Kodak did not
      sufficiently develop the technology. Kodak also failed to patent some of its
      innovation (photo sharing). Better innovation by other firms pushed these
      products to the dog position very rapidly.

      While Kodak did attempt to develop various new products – a process that was
      very expensive given the technological and competitive nature of the market – and
      introduced these products into the market, it appears that Kodak managers did not
      manage to keep a balanced portfolio of products. Not enough revenue and profit
      was generated when the cash cow started to become a dog. Hence, despite
      innovation and product development, the type of the new products as well as the
      management of the profile can be seen as the reason for Kodak’s bankruptcy.


      N.B. The candidate may draw a different BCG matrix where the market share and
           the market growth axis are reversed. It is expected that the BCG matrix
           shows some movement of the products. It is not sufficient to only place all
           the products in the dog quadrant without an explanation of how they might
           have arrived there.

      N.B. If the candidate does not make use the BCG matrix either by drawing or
           describing then they can only achieve a maximum of [2 marks].

      Award [1 to 2 marks] if the response is limited and descriptive and covers less
      than three products and the answer does not look at the movement of the
      products. Award [0 marks] if the matrix only is presented. Award up to
      [2 marks] if the matrix only is accurately drawn and there is an
      attempt to place some of the product.

      Award [3 to 4 marks] if the examination is limited and lacks some balance but
      covers either less than the four products or the answer does not look at the
      movement of the products. For one relevant issue that is one-sided, with no
      examination, award up to a maximum of [3 marks]. For one relevant issue that is
      balanced, with examination, award up to a maximum of [4 marks]. For a
      balanced and accurate examination without drawing the BCG matrix, award up to
      [4 marks].

      Award [5 to 6 marks] if the examination is detailed and balanced by covering
      some positive comments on Kodak’s product portfolio. The answer covers all
      four products. The answer looks at the movement of the products. A balanced
      response is one that covers at least two issues for and at least two issues against.

(e)   With reference to Kodak and one other organization of your choice, evaluate
      the merits of small versus large organizations.                             [9 marks]

      It appears that Kodak as a relatively large organization has sufficient finance for
      R&D as Kodak introduced a number of new products throughout the years.
      Therefore, greater product range can be seen as an advantage of a large
      organization. The risk of relying on one or very few market segments is much
      reduced. Large organizations can benefit from global brand recognition as Kodak
      did and enjoy different types of economies of scale; purchasing, marketing,
      managerial and so on. However, it may be argued that Kodak was overly
      confident perhaps due to its size and its success with the film processing business
      and did not pay attention to other competitors’ new product and marketing
      strategies until it eventually went bankrupt.

      Perhaps being a large organization did not enable Kodak to operate in a
      niche market like small competitors might do. Small organizations can channel
      their more limited resources to satisfy the needs of a niche market or a small
      segment and become extremely customer focused. Customers’ needs are likely to
      be satisfied with perhaps more personalized service and close contact. Perhaps
      Kodak as a large organization was not aware of the changing needs of the
      customers.

      Kodak lacked the flexibility like a small organization to respond to the changing
      need of customers and to become innovative like some small startup companies
      did with their innovative products.

A small start-up company may be more reluctant to take risks with its product
as it has to create a USP and compete against large companies like Kodak. The
increasing number of start-ups especially in this highly technological industry is
evident.

Conclusions/judgment:
It is not expected that a definite verdict is given. It is evident that even larger
organization like Apple performed very well, however, there are some current
issues with innovation. Many start-up companies become successful after being
small but many aim to grow – Facebook, Twitter, Google.

There is no explicit evidence that Kodak failed due to its size. The conclusions in
the last part of the stimulus do not refer to size but to strategic vision, to the
failure due to new products that were taken off the market too quickly, a failure to
patent innovation and being afraid of cannibalism. Perhaps size does not matter
but management vision/ attitude to risk and so on does.

Accept any other relevant point for or against a large organization. These points
may be theoretical.

Accept any relevant evaluation incorporating any benefits such as those above.


N.B. Flexibility in marking is very important in this case given the different
     nature of the question. Expect more reference to Kodak rather than specific
     application to another organization.

Do not penalize if a specific name of a small organization is not given. Expect
some comparison between large and small organizations.

A balanced response is one that covers at least two arguments in favour and at
least two arguments against.

For one relevant issue that is one-sided, award up to [3 marks]. If the response is
a one-sided relevant approach with no analysis/evaluation award a maximum of
[4 marks].

Award a maximum of [5 marks] if the answer is of a standard that shows
balanced analysis and understanding throughout the response with reference to the
stimulus material but there is no judgment/conclusion.

Candidates cannot reach the [5–7] markband if they give judgment/conclusions
that are not based on analysis/explanation already given in their answer.

Marks should be allocated according to the markbands on page 4.
