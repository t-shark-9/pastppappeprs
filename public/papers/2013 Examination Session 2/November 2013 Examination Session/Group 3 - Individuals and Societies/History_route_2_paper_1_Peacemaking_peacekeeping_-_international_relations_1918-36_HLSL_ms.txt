1.    (a)   What, according to Source B, was decided by the Council of the
            League of Nations at its meetings in 1931?                                    [3 marks]

            • It decided to try to prevent an escalation of tensions after Mukden by finding a final
              solution to the crisis.
            • It appointed a commission of five members to investigate the Incident and report to
              the council.
            • The Council decided to foster better relations between China and Japan, so as to
              ensure peace.

     Award [1 mark] for each relevant point up to a maximum of [3 marks].

      (b)   What is the message conveyed by Source E?                                     [2 marks]

            • Japan is burning the Washington and Kellogg-Briand agreements, indicating
              abandonment of disarmament and international cooperation.
            • The League is being strangled by Japan’s arm, indicating both Japan’s strength
              and/or the weakness of the League.
            • The burning torch indicates that Japan is adopting an aggressive foreign policy
              setting Asia alight.

     Award [1 mark] for each relevant point up to a maximum of [2 marks].
                                             –4–            N13/3/HISTX/BP1/ENG/TZ0/S1/M


2.   Compare and contrast the views expressed in Sources A and C about events
     in Manchuria in September 1931.                                                  [6 marks]

     For “compare”
     • Both sources link the criticisms in the Lytton Report to the withdrawal of Japan from the
       League of Nations.
     • Both sources show international concern about the Incident.
     • Both sources indicate that the Japanese Army is acting secretly.

     For “contrast”
     • Source A maintains that Japan denies that it has any expansionist aims and will withdraw
       its forces, whereas Source C shows that Japan has extended its military campaign against
       the Young Marshal.
     • Source C states that the Japanese blamed the explosion on Chinese forces, whereas Source
       A leaves the question of responsibility open.
     • Source A focuses on events and on the reaction of the League of Nations to the Incident,
       whereas Source C mentions the different diplomatic approaches of individual countries.

     Do not demand all of the above. If only one source is discussed award a maximum of
     [2 marks]. If the two sources are discussed separately award [3 marks] or with excellent
     linkage [4–5 marks]. For maximum [6 marks] expect a detailed running comparison/contrast.
     Award up to [5 marks] if two sources are linked/integrated in either a running comparison
     or contrast.

3.   With reference to their origin and purpose, assess the value and
     limitations of Source D and Source E for historians studying events in
     Manchuria between 1931 and 1933.                                                     [6 marks]

     Source D
     Origin:        Extract from a statement made by Lord Lytton to the House of Lords,
                    2 November 1932.

     Purpose:       To explain the rationale behind and the value of the Commission’s formation
                    and report.

     Value:         Lytton was the leader of the Commission and therefore able to give a first-hand
                    account of its actions. It is an official report made before the House of Lords.
                    Since Lytton was not directly involved in the Sino–Japanese dispute, his
                    statement is less likely to be distorted by a partisan attitude.

     Limitations:   As a representative of the League of Nations, he may try to overstate the role of
                    the Commission. He will be unlikely to find fault with either the actions or
                    decisions of the Commission. In 1932 the crisis is still unresolved.

     Source E
     Origin:        Cartoon by Harold M Talburt published in the Washington Daily News,
                    27 January 1932.

     Purpose:       To indicate how observers in the US perceive the actions of the Japanese in
                    Manchuria. To criticise the Japanese for their rejection of disarmament.

     Value:         A contemporary source which shows the perception of the US on the Japanese
                    invasion of Manchuria. It is a very vivid source, showing the strength of US
                    sentiment.

     Limitations:   It is clearly a statement of propaganda. The US is isolationist and does not
                    want to become involved in an Asian conflict. The cartoonist is physically
                    based in the US and has no direct knowledge of events in Asia. Newspaper
                    cartoons may distort or exaggerate the situation, and may represent the view of
                    one person and/or newspaper.

     Do not expect all of the above. Ideally there will be a balance between the two sources,
     and each one can be marked out of [3 marks], but allow a [4/2 marks] split. If only one
     source is assessed, mark out of [4 marks]. For a maximum of [6 marks] candidates must refer
     to both origin and purpose, and value and limitations in their assessment.

4.   Using the sources and your own knowledge, analyse the significance of
     events in Manchuria for China, Japan and the League of Nations between
     1931 and 1933.                                                                       [8 marks]

     Source material:
     Source A:    Shows how China felt threatened by Japan and requested help from the League
                  of Nations. It also shows the League establishing a commission to investigate
                  the Incident. It also shows the difficulty in dealing with Japan – on the one
                  hand Japan claimed that it had no expansionist intentions, on the other hand
                  Japan subsequently created Manchukuo. It shows the ease with which an
                  aggressor state could flout international opinion simply by withdrawing from
                  the League of Nations.

     Source B:     Emphasizes the determination of the League to ensure peace and put an end to
                   the crisis by using international pressure. It acknowledges tensions between
                   Japan and China.

     Source C:     Shows the willingness of Britain and France to appease Japan and the US
                   attempting to contain Japan. It mentions fear of Chinese nationalism spreading
                   to Manchuria; dissatisfaction with authorities’ handling of the crisis; the Lytton
                   Report as a contributing factor to the withdrawal of Japan from the League.

     Source D:     Is a diplomatic statement which shows evidence of international anxiety over
                   Manchuria. The fact that the League received support from non-members such
                   as the US reveals how significant the Incident was. It shows that Japan and
                   China cooperated with the Commission. It also shows that, at that particular
                   stage, international cooperation under the League of Nations was perceived as
                   an effective diplomatic instrument.

     Source E:     Makes a clear statement about aggression from Japan and its ignoring of the
                   principles of the League of Nations-particularly disarmament. It portrays the
                   Incident as a significant threat to peace in the region.

     Own knowledge
     There had been a political shift to the right in Japan in the 1920s, and a shift towards a more
     pro-military government that had an aggressive foreign policy and which saw the need to
     obtain raw materials from Manchuria. The Incident demonstrated the weaknesses of the
     League of Nations’ structure and revealed the problems caused by the requirement of a
     unanimous vote and the lack of a standing army. Major powers such as the US were not
     members, which limited the power and effectiveness of the League. Manchuria was the first
     major failure of the League of Nations in its aim to regulate international relations. The time
     taken for the Lytton Commission to be formed, travel to China to investigate the Incident and
     report back to the League was extremely slow – over 15 months. The League was unable to
     force the Japanese to withdraw, and the immediate result was that Japan left the League in
     contravention of the League Covenant which stipulated a two year time period before
     withdrawal could occur. This encouraged Germany to do the same, and leave the League and
     the Geneva Disarmament Conference in 1933; consequently the USSR joined the League in
     1934. After establishing Manchukuo in 1932, Japan continued to expand into China, which
     had a direct influence on the struggle there between Jiang Jieshi and Mao Zedong. In Japan
     the inability of the League to take meaningful action in Manchuria encouraged an increase in
     militarism and a further shift to the right politically. After the Incident there was a global
     perception that the League was ineffective when taking action against major powers, leading
     to further aggression such as Mussolini’s action against Abyssinia.
