These sources and questions relate to the succession to the kingdom of Sicily in the 1180s and 1190s.

SOURCE A                 Extract from “A Portrait of Constance of Sicily”, by S H Steinberg, published
                         in the Journal of the Warburg Institute, 1938. S H Steinberg was an academic
                         art historian.

In 1186 she [Constance, daughter of Roger II of Sicily] was married to Henry VI, son and successor of
Frederick I (Barbarossa). When in 1189 her nephew, William II, died, the kingdom of Sicily came to
Constance, as the last surviving legitimate descendant of the Hauteville Dynasty. Though, in fact, Sicily
came under the direct rule of her German husband, Constance considered herself, and was considered
by the vast majority of Sicilians, the real sovereign. She was even suspected of encouraging rebellious
movements against her husband. In 1191 Constance spent several months at Salerno, while Henry VI
besieged Naples, which was in revolt. After his return to Germany, however, the mob of Salerno attacked
her palace, and the empress was eventually brought a prisoner to Sicily. Henry soon had her released and
in 1194 took a cruel vengeance on the citizens of Salerno. On 26 December 1194 Constance gave birth to
a boy who was to become Frederick II, the most splendid and powerful of medieval emperors.


SOURCE B                 Extract from The Normans in Sicily, by John Julius Norwich, published in
                         Britain, 1992. John Julius Norwich is a popular historian of the Mediterranean in
                         the Middle Ages.

Some time during the winter of 1183–1184 imperial ambassadors arrived in Palermo with a proposal
– the marriage of Henry [the son of Frederick I (Barbarossa)] with Princess Constance of Sicily.
It seems incredible that William II and his advisers should have contemplated the idea for a moment.
If she were to marry Henry and William II were to die childless Sicily would fall into the emperor’s lap,
its separate existence at an end … an act of almost criminal folly. Matthew of Ajello [an adviser to
William II] spoke out violently against the proposal; and few Sicilians relished the prospect of surrendering
their independence to a distant and, in their eyes, barbarous empire that had always been the traditional
enemy of their country. Walter of the Mill [an English-born adviser], however, took the opposite view
… and considered imperial domination a lesser evil than civil war which in his eyes may have been the
only alternative. But was it? Could not Constance have married another husband, reigned in her own right,
then passed the crown in fullness of time to a legitimate son?

SOURCE C                Extract from “A Letter Concerning the Sicilian Tragedy”. This letter was
                        written by an unknown author in the late twelfth century, and addressed to Peter,
                        Treasurer of Palermo Cathedral. The author claimed to have been born in the
                        kingdom of Sicily.

I cannot pass over in silence or talk with dry eyes of the desolation of Sicily … The vision of the tragedy to
come forces itself upon me, and makes me shed tears… For the madness of the Germans has no experience
of being ruled by the guidance of reason, or being deflected from its aims by human sympathy, or deterred
by religion. Its inborn fury urges it forward, greed goads it, lust drives it on. I wish that when Constance
enters the borders of Sicily with her German king she should not be given the opportunity to go further than
the limits of Mount Etna, where the savagery of the Germans could join up with the cruelty of the pirates …
and that hard and stony people could burn itself out in the blazing of angry rage among the scorched rocks
and fires of flaming Etna. … Constance, brought up from her first cradle for many years in the riches of
your delights, educated and moulded by your instruction and manners … and now returns with huge forces
to repay you with a disgraceful payment.


SOURCE D                Extract from The Chronicle of Richard of San Germano, written in the early
                        thirteenth century. Richard was a monk at Monte Cassino, an important abbey
                        in Northern Italy, between 1186 and 1232. He also served Emperor Frederick II,
                        the son of Henry VI and Constance of Sicily, in the early 1240s.

[In 1191] Emperor Henry VI came to Rome with his wife Constance, to whom the kingdom of Sicily
belonged by hereditary right. Pope Celestine crowned him as emperor and his wife as empress at
St Peter’s. … Then in the month of May the emperor entered the regno [Sicily], despite the pope’s
prohibition. … Next the city of Salerno surrendered to the emperor, and he sent his wife, the empress,
to stay there while he repeatedly attacked and harried the city of Naples. … The Salernitans detained the
empress and sent her to King Tancred in Sicily so that they might secure his favour. The King [Tancred]
received her honourably, loaded her with presents and sent her back to the emperor in Germany.

[In 1194] After preparing his fleet and land army the emperor Henry entered the kingdom [of Sicily].
On Christmas Day the emperor held a general court in Palermo. In the month of December, on the feast
of St Stephen [26th December], in the city of Jesi in the Marches the empress gave birth to a son called
Frederick.

[1198] In the course of time the empress died, leaving an only son, Frederick, and in her will appointing
Pope Innocent as regent of the kingdom.

SOURCE E               Henry VI of Germany and his wife, Constance of Sicily. The image is taken
                       from The Book to Honour the Emperor, by Peter of Eboli, a monk from Sicily.
                       Peter became court poet to Henry VI and the book is likely to have been written in
                       Palermo in the late twelfth century.
