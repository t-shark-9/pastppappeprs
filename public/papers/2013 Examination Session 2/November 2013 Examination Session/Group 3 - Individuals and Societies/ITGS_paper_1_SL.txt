1.     Mobile Wallet

       Customers are now using their mobile/cell phone to make purchases
       at the grocery store. Before this they used a credit card or cash.

       On the cell phone there is an application (“the wallet”) that                                     Go to photo source:
       stores the user’s credit or debit information used in transactions.                           http://www.carryology.com/
       This application uses a form of radio frequency identification                                 wallets/the-mobile-wallet/
       (RFID) technology that requires a chip to be installed in their
       cell phone.

       In order to purchase groceries, items are first scanned into the
       register and a total is calculated. The customer waves their cell phone
       over the RFID reader, enters their PIN and the total amount for their grocery order is deducted from
       the customer’s account. Secure encryption technology is used to pass the card information to the
       credit card company to complete the payment. Grocery stores have found that setting up this system
       is very expensive.

       Many grocery stores are using mobile wallets to gather information about customers’ spending habits
       and will be offering a lot of incentives to get people to use it, such as discount vouchers and store
       offers sent to their cell phone.

       (a)     (i)     Identify two pieces of information that are being collected by the grocery store’s
                       computer system when the bill is paid.                                                                         [2]

		(ii)                 Define the term RFID.                                                                                          [2]

		(iii) Define the term encryption.                                                                                                   [2]

       (b)     (i)     Explain one reason why encryption is used in this case.                                                        [2]

		(ii)                 Explain two disadvantages for the customer of using “the wallet”.                                              [4]

       (c)     To what extent are the security measures used by the store during purchases appropriate?                               [8]

                                            Ultra Violet – buy, store, play movies

      Ultra Violet is a cloud service that allows customers to buy the rights to watch movies. This can be
      done on up to 12 Internet-connected devices, such as TVs, computers, tablets and cell phones when
      they buy a title with Ultra Violet rights.

      Once a consumer sets up an account, a “digital locker” enables the content to be accessed from
      the cloud.

      (a)      (i)    Identify two features of digital rights management (DRM).                                                [2]

               (ii)   Apart from movies, identify two other media that use DRM.                                                [2]

               (iii) Define the term intellectual property.                                                                    [2]

      (b)      Ultra Violet has policies on its website describing the user agreement. Explain two
               policies that might be included and how they protect the rights of users.                                       [6]

      (c)      Customers may purchase UltraViolet movies and television shows through participating
               UltraViolet retailers with the options to download them to personal devices and stream
               them from their digital library. Evaluate these two options of download and stream.                             [8]

3.    Senior Care goes hi-tech with virtual doctor visits

      Donna Sergisson waits to see her doctor in
      her room in the Wayne County Nursing Home
      where she is a resident. She will not see him
      face to face, but will use a videoconferencing
      system.

      At the nursing home, Donna is seen by a nurse
      who can talk using the videoconferencing
      system to the doctor in a local hospital.
      Once the videoconference has taken place,
      Donna is treated by the nurse following the
      doctor’s instructions.

      The doctor also has access to the nursing home’s electronic record system to type in his assessment,
      progress and notes, as well as review other doctors’ and nurses’ comments, look at patient history and
      what medications patients are taking. The electronic records are held in a database created by the
      nursing home technical staff.

            [Source: adapted from http://www.waynepost.com/feature/x748725715/Senior-care-goes-hi-tech, 24 November 2011]


      (a)      (i)    Identify two input devices required for the videoconference to take place.                            [2]

               (ii)   There have been issues with the accuracy of the information held in the database.
                      Describe how validation and verification are used to ensure data is accurate.                         [4]

      (b)      Explain three technical issues that would need to be addressed in order to set up an
               effective videoconferencing system.                                                                          [6]

      (c)      The nursing home technical staff are considering replacing the existing database with a
               new one. The two options being considered are:
                purchasing a commercial package that has been developed for institutions such as
                 nursing homes
                developing the database themselves.

               Evaluate these two options.                                                                                  [8]

4.    Developing a website

      Milner’s Merchandising is a small website developing company based in Montreal. Helen Earle,
      the owner, has been asked by a local business, Jen Gems, to create a website to advertise their new
      range of jewellery.

      To help her organize the work of her employees Helen has used a spreadsheet to show the length and
      order of the different development tasks.

      Helen has always used the product development life cycle (PDLC) as a framework for managing
      projects. Helen is trying to decide whether to allocate the project to one person or to a team.


      (a)     (i)    State the formula in cell E2.                                                                      [1]

              (ii)   State the formula in cell F2 using an absolute cell reference.                                     [1]

              (iii) Outline why spreadsheet designers should use absolute cell references to calculate
                    costs such as those within column F.                                                                [2]

5.    Using GPS to monitor vehicle movements

      GPS systems help people to find their way around when driving their cars. Trucking companies also
      use GPS systems in their trucks to keep track of their shipments, routes taken and employees.

      A GPS chip is placed in the body work of the vehicle that allows its movements to be monitored
      from a device connected to the Internet. This idea has been considered by governments and authorities
      who see this as a way of enforcing the speed limit, monitoring the number of hours driven by a person
      and detecting unusual patterns of travel.




                                                                                                Secure servers

(Question 5 continued)

		Some GPS companies are providing the data to local governments and authorities.
  This is used to determine where to construct new roads and where to place speed cameras.
  This data is anonymous.

      (b)   (i)   Explain two reasons why using only the data collected from the GPS systems to
