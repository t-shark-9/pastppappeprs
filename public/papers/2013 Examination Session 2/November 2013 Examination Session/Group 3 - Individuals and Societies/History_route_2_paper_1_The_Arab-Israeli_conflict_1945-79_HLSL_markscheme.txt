1.   (a)   What, according to Source C, were the immediate consequences of the
           Suez Crisis?                                                                   [3 marks]

           • Nasser emerged as a hero.
           • Nasser suppressed the Muslim Brotherhood even more severely and cracked down on
             anyone else he considered a threat.
           • Nasser had successfully defied Britain, France and Israel.
           • Arafat and the Palestinians hoped to benefit from the changing circumstances, but
             their hopes were dashed.
           • Student activists were kept under surveillance.

     Award [1 mark] for each relevant point up to a maximum of [3 marks].

     (b)   What is the message conveyed by Source B?                                      [2 marks]

           • Egypt (symbolized by Nasser) has control over the transport of oil supplies as it has
             nationalized the Suez Canal. (Please note Egypt has no oil, therefore do not credit
             responses indicating that Nasser is rationing Egyptian oil.)
           • Foreign powers led by Britain, France and the US are queuing to get oil, which is
             controlled by Nasser.
           • The foreign powers are only allowed a very limited amount of oil, as indicated by the
             small oil cans.

     Award [1 mark] for each relevant point up to a maximum of [2 marks].

2.   Compare and contrast the views expressed in Sources A and E about the
     Suez Crisis of 1956.                                                               [6 marks]

     For “compare”
     • Both sources indicate that the US and the USSR became more influential in the region.
     • Both sources claim that Nasser’s status in the Arab world grew.
     • Both sources regard the outcome of Suez as being a setback for Britain and France.

     For “contrast”
     • Source A explicitly discusses the role of the United Nations, although Source E only refers
       to the role of individual countries.
     • Source A claims that Britain and France were militarily effective at Suez, whereas Source
       E claims that Suez exposed their weaknesses and/or E shows the Arab cause in a more
       positive light.
     • Source A gives no indication of the declining influence of Britain and France, whereas
       Source E clearly states they lost influence.
     • Only Source E regards the Suez episode as changing the image of Israel in the Arab World.
     • Source A mainly concentrates upon describing the sequence of events during the Suez
       Crisis, whereas Source E mainly focuses on the consequences of the Crisis.

     Do not demand all of the above. If only one source is discussed award a maximum of
     [2 marks]. If the two sources are discussed separately award [3 marks] or with excellent
     linkage [4–5 marks]. For maximum [6 marks] expect a detailed running comparison/contrast.
     Award up to [5 marks] if two sources are linked/ integrated in either a running comparison
     or contrast.

3.   With reference to their origin and purpose, assess the value and limitations
     of Source C and Source D for historians studying the Suez Crisis
     of 1956.                                                                                [6 marks]

     Source C
     Origin:        Extract from a book by Tony Walker and Andrew Gowers, Arafat –
                    The Biography, 2003.

     Purpose:       To describe and analyse the life of Arafat and his influence in Middle Eastern
                    affairs.

     Value:         Gowers has considerable experience in the Middle East. The book has the
                    advantage of hindsight on the Suez Crisis, having been written almost fifty
                    years after the event.

     Limitations:   The book is specifically about Arafat and is therefore not explicitly focused on
                    the Suez Crisis. The authors’ area of specialization is finance and they are not
                    experts in the historical significance of Suez. The authors are both journalists
                    and are from the Western world, which might have influenced their analysis of
                    events.

     Source D
     Origins:       Extract from The Arab–Israeli Wars by Chaim Herzog, former president of
                    Israel and a former high ranking Israeli army officer, 2004.

     Purpose:       To provide information about and analyse the Arab–Israeli wars, and to provide
                    an Israeli perspective.

     Value:         Herzog was president of Israel from 1983 to 1993 and was a former high ranking
                    officer in the Israeli army. He would therefore have access to classified military
                    information and would have had direct experience of the 1956 Suez Crisis. Also
                    since it was written 50 years later, Herzog could have had access to a wide range
                    of sources that were unavailable at the time.

     Limitations:   The book covers all four of the Arab–Israeli wars and is not specifically
                    focused on Suez. As a former member of the Israeli government and military,
                    he is unlikely to be critical of Israeli actions but would be highly critical of the
                    actions/policies of Arab nations. Since the book was published nearly 50 years
                    after the event, it could be that Herzog’s recollections are clouded.

     Do not expect all of the above. Ideally there will be a balance between the two sources, and
     each one can be marked out of [3 marks], but allow a [4/2 marks] split. If only one source is
     assessed, mark out of [4 marks]. For a maximum of [6 marks] candidates must refer to both
     origin and purpose, and value and limitations.

4.   Using the sources and your own knowledge, analyse the consequences of the
     Suez Crisis for the countries involved up to the end of 1959.                         [8 marks]

     Source material
     Source A:   The Suez conflict altered the regional balance of power. It was a military
                  defeat for Egypt, but Nasser’s status grew in the Arab world as the defender of
                  Arab nationalism. In broader terms, it marked a significant power shift away
                  from Britain/France towards the US/USSR.

     Source B:      Nasser became an important figure in the Arab world, and Egypt gained control
                    of the Suez Canal and oil supplies to the West. The presence of Uncle Sam in
                    the queue showed that the Suez Crisis made even the US vulnerable.

     Source C:      Nasser emerged a hero in the Arab world and strengthened his power in Egypt.
                    The Suez Crisis was also, perhaps surprisingly, a setback for the Palestinian
                    cause.

     Source D:      The United Nations assumed the role of peacekeeper in the Sinai, as it became
                    a buffer zone between Israel and Egypt. The enhanced position of Egypt and
                    the United Nations’ evident readiness to yield to Egyptian pressure created
                    problems for the future.

     Source E:      Suez established Nasser as the most important Arab leader and the Suez Crisis
                    stimulated Arab nationalism. Britain and France were forced to leave Egypt,
                    ending their dominance of the Arab world. Arab leaders turned to Cairo,
                    Washington and Moscow. Israel’s invasion, in collaboration with the old
                    imperial powers, gave Israel a poor image in the Arab world. This was a
                    worrying sign for the future.

     Own knowledge
     Israel withdrew from Egyptian territory gained in the fighting, but regained access to the
     Straits of Tiran and the Gulf of Aqaba. It claimed that any restriction of access to these waters
     would be considered an act of war in the future. The United Nations Emergency Force played
     a key role maintaining peace in the Sinai after the withdrawal of British and French troops
     from the Canal Zone, although there was still tension along the border between Egypt and
     Israel. Mollet and Eden received severe criticism at home. Eden resigned as prime minister
     and was replaced by MacMillan. Relations between the United States and Britain and France
     deteriorated following the crisis. The Middle East became an integral part of the Cold War,
     and the Eisenhower Doctrine was passed in 1957 which promised American economic aid
     and/or military support to countries in the Middle East who were under threat. Egypt made
     short-term economic agreements with the Soviet Union and China. By 1959, Fatah had been
     established, led by Yasser Arafat, and had become the voice of the Palestinian people.

     Do not expect all the above and accept other relevant material. If only source material or own
     knowledge is used the maximum mark that can be obtained is [5 marks]. For maximum
     [8 marks] expect argument, synthesis of source material and own knowledge, as well as
     references to the sources used.
