                                                            SECTION A

Answer two questions. Each question is worth [20 marks].

1.     Mobile Wallet

       Customers are now using their mobile/cell phone to make purchases
       at the grocery store. Before this they used a credit card or cash.

       On the cell phone there is an application (“the wallet”) that                                     Go to photo source:
       stores the user’s credit or debit information used in transactions.                           http://www.carryology.com/
       This application uses a form of radio frequency identification                                 wallets/the-mobile-wallet/
       (RFID) technology that requires a chip to be installed in their
       cell phone.

       In order to purchase groceries, items are first scanned into the
       register and a total is calculated. The customer waves their cell phone
       over the RFID reader, enters their PIN and the total amount for their grocery order is deducted from
       the customer’s account. Secure encryption technology is used to pass the card information to the
       credit card company to complete the payment. Grocery stores have found that setting up this system
       is very expensive.

       Many grocery stores are using mobile wallets to gather information about customers’ spending habits
       and will be offering a lot of incentives to get people to use it, such as discount vouchers and store
       offers sent to their cell phone.

                                          Ultra Violet – buy, store, play movies

      Ultra Violet is a cloud service that allows customers to buy the rights to watch movies. This can be
      done on up to 12 Internet-connected devices, such as TVs, computers, tablets and cell phones when
      they buy a title with Ultra Violet rights.

      Once a consumer sets up an account, a “digital locker” enables the content to be accessed from
      the cloud.

      (a)    (i)     Identify two features of digital rights management (DRM).                                                  [2]

             (ii)    Apart from movies, identify two other media that use DRM.                                                  [2]

             (iii) Define the term intellectual property.                                                                       [2]

      (b)    Ultra Violet has policies on its website describing the user agreement. Explain two
             policies that might be included and how they protect the rights of users.                                          [6]

      (c)    Customers may purchase UltraViolet movies and television shows through participating
             UltraViolet retailers with the options to download them to personal devices and stream
             them from their digital library. Evaluate these two options of download and stream.                                [8]

3.    Senior Care goes hi-tech with virtual doctor visits

      Donna Sergisson waits to see her doctor in
      her room in the Wayne County Nursing Home
      where she is a resident. She will not see him
      face to face, but will use a videoconferencing
      system.

      At the nursing home, Donna is seen by a nurse
      who can talk using the videoconferencing
      system to the doctor in a local hospital.
      Once the videoconference has taken place,
      Donna is treated by the nurse following the
      doctor’s instructions.

      The doctor also has access to the nursing home’s electronic record system to type in his assessment,
      progress and notes, as well as review other doctors’ and nurses’ comments, look at patient history and
      what medications patients are taking. The electronic records are held in a database created by the
      nursing home technical staff.

            [Source: adapted from http://www.waynepost.com/feature/x748725715/Senior-care-goes-hi-tech, 24 November 2011]


      (a)      (i)    Identify two input devices required for the videoconference to take place.                            [2]

               (ii)   There have been issues with the accuracy of the information held in the database.
                      Describe how validation and verification are used to ensure data is accurate.                         [4]

      (b)      Explain three technical issues that would need to be addressed in order to set up an
               effective videoconferencing system.                                                                          [6]

      (c)      The nursing home technical staff are considering replacing the existing database with a
               new one. The two options being considered are:
                purchasing a commercial package that has been developed for institutions such as
                 nursing homes
                developing the database themselves.

               Evaluate these two options.                                                                                  [8]

4.    Project Management

      The senior managers at Crystals Fitness Centre, a national business with 75 fitness centres,
      want to improve their advertising. The owner, Crystal Wild, has decided that she needs to produce
      a ten minute promotional video highlighting the main features of her business, which includes
      fitness, nutrition, personal training and conditioning. The video will contain photos, video clips and
      audio tracks.

      The systems analyst used by Crystal decides to use Gantt and PERT charts to manage this
      IT project. The figure below is an example of the use of a Gantt chart to show the stages of the system
      development life cycle (SDLC).

                                                                                    WEEKS

     9.     shoot the video
     10. edit the video
     11. test the video
     12. final editing


      (a)      (i)    Outline the type of project management development methodology that is used
                      in the figure above.                                                                       [2]

      During the analysis phase, the systems analyst will make decisions regarding the minimum hardware
      requirements for developing videos.

		(ii)                State two hardware requirements that a computer will need in order to develop
                      videos.                                                                                    [2]

		(iii) State two design requirements for developing the video.                                                  [2]


                                                                      (This question continues on the following page)

(Question 4 continued)

      Systems analysts use a variety of tools and techniques throughout the system development
      life cycle to gather information when developing the product.

      (b)   Explain why the use of a development methodology similar to the one in the Gantt chart
            on the opposite page may not be appropriate in the development of the advertising video.   [6]

      (c)   Discuss whether project management tools such as Gantt and PERT charts enable
            IT projects, such as the Crystals Fitness Centre video project, to be successfully
            completed.                                                                                 [8]

5.     Managing the IT support at OBI International

       OBI International is a company with 5000 employees worldwide that has an IT support team based
       in São Paulo. Their in-house IT support team is responsible for the resolution of all IT requests
       in the São Paulo office and in their other offices worldwide.

       The senior management of OBI International is considering outsourcing* all of the tasks performed
       by their IT support team in São Paulo.



* outsourcing: transferring portions of work to outside suppliers rather than completing it internally



       (a)     (i)     One of the responsibilities of the IT support team is the installation of software.
                       State two additional responsibilities of an IT support team.                                    [2]

		(ii)                 Identify four necessary requirements to ensure that all software installed on OBI
                       International systems meets legal requirements.                                                 [4]

       (b)     Explain three policies that should be introduced to ensure that the IT support team meets
               the needs of OBI International and its employees.                                                       [6]

       (c)     The Senior Managers at OBI International chose to have its IT support provided by
               outsourced companies rather than the in-house IT department.

               Evaluate this decision.                                                                                 [8]

6.    Driverless trains?

      High speed trains are being developed in many Asian countries. Most of them are designed to stay
      on the ground and run on rails. However, in some countries, Maglev trains are being prototyped.
      These high speed robotic trains use sensors which allow them to “ﬂy” a few centimetres off the
      ground and within side walls.




                              [Source: Text: © International Baccalaureate Organization 2014
                                    Photo: ©Kohama Yasuaki. Used with permission.]


      To make this system more efficient an expert system has been developed to aid the operation
      of trains, including establishing the safest and smoothest mode of operation, optimising fuel
      consumption and for training new operators.

      The expert system uses an on board computer installed in the train and obtains data from sensors
      installed in many locations on the train.

      The expert system sends advisory messages to the train operator according to the most appropriate
      rules for any situation. A train operator uses this information as well as his own experience to “drive”
      the train.

      When new decisions are made, this additional information is added to the expert system.



                                                                    (This question continues on the following page)

(Question 6 continued)

      (a)   (i)   Define the term sensor.                                                               [2]

		(ii)            Describe two characteristics that make this robotic train system an expert system.    [4]

      (b)   The developers of this system are creating a training simulator so that new operators can
            gain experience in “driving” the Maglev trains on the routes under varying conditions.

            Explain what considerations will need to be included in the development of the robotic
            train simulation to ensure the training can cover all possible situations that may
            be encountered.                                                                             [6]

      (c)   The managers of a new Maglev train system are considering whether to have a driver on
            the train or to have no driver and operate the train remotely.

            Evaluate these two options.                                                                 [8]
