Microeconomics

1.   (a)     Using a diagram, explain why demerit goods are considered to be an
             example of market failure.                                                       [10 marks]

              definitions of a demerit good, market failure and negative externality of
               consumption

             good, time

(b)   Examine the role of PED for firms making decisions regarding price
      changes and their effect on total revenue.                                         [15 marks]

      N.B. It should be noted that definitions, theory, and examples that have already
      been given in part (a), and then referred to in part (b) should be rewarded.

      Answers may include:
       definition of total revenue
       explanation of the law of demand and of the relationship between a change
        in price and the effect on total revenue and how the latter is dependent
        on PED. Explanation of why a good with price elastic demand would
        witness a decrease/increase in total revenue as a result of a price
        increase/decrease. Explanation of why a good with price inelastic demand
        would witness an increase/decrease in total revenue as a result of a price
        increase/decrease
       diagrams showing the effect of a price change on total revenue depending
        on the price elasticity of demand
       examples of firms making decisions to change price and the effect on their
        total revenue depending on the PED of good/service offered.
       synthesis or evaluation (examine).

      To examine may include: the effect on revenue of price changes,
      a consideration of other factors which may affect revenue other than price.
      PED is difficult to judge, it changes over time – once price changes the PED
      changes. Reference to factors other than price, which influence demand.

      Opinions or conclusions should be presented clearly and supported by
      appropriate examples.

             changes in the structure of industry
            diagrams to show demand-deficiency and structural unemployment. An

             diagram for the latter
            examples of cyclical and structural unemployment.

(b)   To what extent can supply-side policies help in fighting inflation?                [15 marks]

      N.B. It should be noted that definitions, theory, and examples that have already
      been given in part (a), and then referred to in part (b) should be rewarded.

      Answers may include:
       definitions of inflation, supply-side policies
       explanation of various supply-side policies including market-based and
        interventionist supply-side policies
       diagram to show the application of supply-side policies to fight inflation
       examples of the application of the policies
       evaluation or synthesis (to what extent).

      Discussion of the merit of the statement may include: other policies that could
      be used such as demand-side policies, perspectives of different economic
      schools of thought.

      Opinions or conclusions should be presented clearly and supported by
      appropriate examples.
