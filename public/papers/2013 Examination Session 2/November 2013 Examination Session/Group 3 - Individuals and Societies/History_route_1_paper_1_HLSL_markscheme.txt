Prescribed subject 2           The kingdom of Sicily 1130–1302

These questions relate to the succession to the kingdom of Sicily in the 1180s and 1190s.

1.   (a)     Why, according to Source A, did Constance become heir to the kingdom of
             Sicily?                                                                 [3 marks]

          Constance was the daughter of Roger II of Sicily;
          She became the only legitimate heir to Sicily when her nephew, William II, died;
          She considered herself to be the rightful heir to Sicily;
          The vast majority of the people of Sicily also considered her to be the rightful heir;
          She was the last legitimate descendant of the Hauteville Dynasty.

     Award [1 mark] for each relevant point up to a maximum of [3 marks].

     (b)     What is the message conveyed by Source E?                                              [2 marks]

          The image shows Henry VI and Constance seated together as king and queen;
          Both are shown wearing crowns, suggesting that they are both ruling;
          Henry VI is shown slightly higher than his wife, perhaps suggesting his precedence over her.

     Award [1 mark] for each valid point up to a maximum of [2 marks]
                                                –4–                N13/3/HISTI/BP1/ENG/TZ0/XX/M


2.   Compare and contrast the views expressed in Sources A and B about Constance’s
     succession to the kingdom of Sicily.                                          [6 marks]

     For “compare”
      Both sources refer to Constance as the heir to the kingdom of Sicily;
      Both sources mention her nephew, William II of Sicily;
      Both sources mention that Constance’s husband was heir to the German Empire;
      Both sources show how Sicily came under the rule of the German Empire due to the marriage of
        Constance to Henry VI.

     For “contrast”
       Source A notes that Constance regarded herself, and was regarded by her subjects, as ruler of
        Sicily, whereas Source B claims that her marriage to Henry VI brought the kingdom under
        German rule;
       Source A mentions that there was opposition to German rule of Sicily after William II’s death,
        whereas Source B mentions opposition to the marriage of Constance to Henry VI during
        William II’s lifetime;
       Source A mentions that the Sicilians opposed Henry VI, but does not mention any individuals,
        whereas Source B names advisors of William II involved in the debate over the marriage of
        Henry VI to Constance;
       Source B claims that there were alternatives to Henry VI as a husband to Constance, whereas
        Source A makes no mention of an alternative;
       Source A mentions the birth of Frederick II as Constance’s son and heir, whereas Source B only
        mentions that Constance could have had a son had she married someone else;
       Source A mentions that she may have encouraged rebellion against Henry VI, while Source B
        makes no mention of it.

     End-on description of both sources would be worth up to [3 marks] if the comparative element is
     only implicit, and [4 marks] with excellent explicit linkage. If both sources are used with a good
     running linkage of both comparison and contrast award a maximum of [4–5 marks]. For the
     maximum of [6 marks] expect a detailed, comprehensive, running, comparison and contrast.
     If there is only either comparison or contrast award a maximum of [4 marks].

3.   With reference to their origin and purpose, discuss the value and limitations of
     Source C and Source D for historians studying Constance’s claim to the kingdom
     of Sicily.                                                                       [6 marks]

     Source C
     Origin:        An anonymous letter, most likely written by a Sicilian, addressed to Peter, Treasurer
                    of Palermo Cathedral, written in the late twelfth century.

     Purpose:       To protest against the imperial conquest of Sicily, and German behaviour, and to
                    accuse Queen Constance of betraying her own people.

     Value:         This was a letter likely to have been written during the late 1190s and was therefore
                    contemporary to the events it describes. The author is likely to have been an
                    educated Sicilian who was knowledgeable about events in the kingdom.

     Limitations:   The letter is strongly opposed to German rule, labelling Germans as cruel and
                    irrational. This suggests that the author may have been strongly biased against
                    Henry VI and Constance.

     Source D
     Origin:        An Italian chronicle written at the Abbey of Monte Cassino, by Richard of San
                    Germano, in the early thirteenth century.

     Purpose:       To record and summarise events from the perspective of a north Italian monastery.

     Value:         Richard of San Germano is likely to have been a well-informed chronicler, as Monte
                    Cassino was an important abbey. Richard may have gained valuable information of
                    Frederick II, whom he served.

     Limitations:   Richard of San Germano expressed his support for Constance of Sicily, and was a
                    servant of her son, Frederick II. Therefore, Richard may well have been biased in
                    favour of the German succession to Sicily.

     Do not expect all of the above. Ideally there will be a balance between the two sources, and each
     one can be marked out of [3 marks], but allow a [4/2 marks] split. If only one source is assessed,
     mark out of [4 marks]. For a maximum of [6 marks] candidates must refer to both origin and
     purpose, and value and limitations.

4.   Using the sources and your own knowledge, analyse the statement in Source A that
     Constance was the “real sovereign” ruler of Sicily.                              [8 marks]

     Source material
     Source A:    This source claims that Constance was the legitimate heir to Sicily, as she was the
                  daughter of Roger II and the aunt of William II. However, it also claims that, in
                  reality, Constance’s husband, the Emperor Henry VI, was the direct ruler of Sicily.

     Source B:     This source claims that Constance’s marriage to Henry VI resulted in the transfer of
                   Sicily to German rule. This source is strongly critical of William II’s decision to
                   allow the marriage to proceed, and notes that there was debate during his rule about
                   the marriage. It also claims that Constance could have married someone else,
                   therefore protecting the independence of her kingdom.

     Source C:     This source blames Constance’s marriage to Henry VI for the German conquest of
                   Sicily. The source regards Henry VI and the German Empire as a threat to Sicily,
                   and regards Constance as a traitor to her own people.

     Source D:     This source regards Constance as the rightful successor to the kingdom of Sicily.
                   However, it also notes that the kingdom was conquered by her husband, Henry VI.
                   The source also mentions that her son, Emperor Frederick II, succeeded as King of
                   Sicily.

     Source E:     This source shows both Constance and Henry VI crowned and enthroned, suggesting
                   they ruled Sicily as partners. However, Henry VI being shown on a slightly higher
                   level than his wife may indicate that he had more authority in the rule of Sicily.

     Own knowledge
     As the only surviving legitimate heir of Roger II, King of Sicily 1130–1154, and the aunt of
     William II, King 1166–1189, Constance had a very strong claim to be ruler.

     Constance also produced a legitimate son and heir, Frederick II, from her marriage to Henry VI, and
     therefore she ensured the continuity of her family’s rule in Sicily. Frederick II’s title as King of
     Sicily was strengthened by his descent from his grandfather Roger II, via Constance.

     Constance also had significant supporters to her succession, Archbishop Walter of Palermo and
     Count Roger of Andria. As Master Justiciars, they had been key government officials during the
     reign of William II.

     However, in order to enforce her title to rule against her illegitimate cousin, Tancred, Constance
     relied upon the military power of her husband, Emperor Henry VI of Germany. His first invasion
     of Sicily, in 1191, failed, and it was only following a second invasion, in 1194, that Constance was
     installed as queen. Following his conquest of Sicily, Henry VI used extreme brutality against
     Sicilian noblemen who had supported the rival claim of Tancred.

     In the year between her husband’s death in 1197 and her own death, Constance ruled Sicily in her
     own right. She avoided the violent coercion that had characterised her husband’s rule. Her priority
     was to ensure that her son Frederick was accepted as her heir as King of Sicily and, according to the
     historian David Abulafia, she cared more about this than his potential succession as German
     Emperor. She also had close relations with the Papacy, and entrusted the guardianship of Frederick
     II to Pope Innocent III.

Do not expect all the above and accept other relevant material. If only source material or own
knowledge is used the maximum mark that can be obtained is [5 marks]. For maximum [8 marks]
expect argument, synthesis of source material and own knowledge, as well as references to the
sources used.
