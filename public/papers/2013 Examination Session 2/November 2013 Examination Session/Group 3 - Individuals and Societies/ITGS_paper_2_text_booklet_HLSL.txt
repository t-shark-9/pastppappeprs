      IT system: social networking websites used by university admissions ofﬁcers to access student
      information

      According to a recent survey by Kaplan Test Prep, 24 % of university admissions officers have said
      they use Facebook and other social networking websites to investigate a student who is applying for
 5    admission, called an “applicant”. Twenty percent of the university admissions officers have used
      Google Search to conduct additional searches about applicants.

      Increasingly, universities are becoming interested in an applicant’s “digital footprint”. A “digital
      footprint” refers to the online evidence that the student leaves behind whenever they are involved in
      any online activities.

10    Students can also use social networking websites, such as Facebook, to highlight their achievements.
      This has worked for applicants to Wake Forest University who have increased their chances for
      admission by posting their projects and work on Facebook for universities to view.

      Many universities have not developed policies for using an applicant’s “digital footprint” when
      selecting future students. However, Martha Allman, who is the Dean of Admissions at Wake Forest
15    University, uses Facebook profiles to get to know applicants prior to an admissions interview,
      so that she can get a sense of “who the student is”. This includes reviewing grades, essays and
      whatever information she can find. The interview is, in most cases, the last stage that determines
      whether a student is admitted to the university or not.

      The University of Iowa’s Tippie School of Management received lots of attention because of a
20    practice that they used with applicants. They decided to award a full scholarship to the best
      140-character message (Twitter tweet) explaining why an applicant wanted to attend the university.
      Tippie School encouraged applicants to include links to blogs, Facebook pages, and other social
      networking websites in the message (tweet). What they did not tell applicants was that by applying
      for the scholarship, they would also reveal their Twitter user name and links to other personal social
25    networking websites to the university admissions officer.

      Twelve percent of university admissions officers told Kaplan Test Prep that the information that
      they found on social networking websites hurt an applicant’s chance for admission, especially
      when it involved the use of bad language in postings, evidence of inappropriate activity in photos,
      plagiarism in essays, or evidence of illegal activity. Students applying to university need to consider
30    carefully how the information that they have posted on social networking websites, and information
      that others have posted about them, may impact their chances for admission.
