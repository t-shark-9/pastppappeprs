1.   (a)   Using examples, explain how financial flows transfer wealth between places.               [10]

           Financial flows (based on geography subject guide) include loans, debt
           relief/repayment, international aid, FDI, profit leakage and remittances (do not credit
           “goods”). The spatial focus could be the global core and periphery (although these
           terms are dynamic and contested and a variety of interpretations are acceptable, so
           long as named examples are also included). Some answers may additionally explain
           that there are legal and illegal (criminal, informal) mechanisms of money transfer;
           or can explain how “transfer pricing” and offshore tax havens are used by TNCs to
           transfer money between places.

           Better answers may provide superior evidence/case study details of the wealth flows
           (quoting dollar values or percentage contributions to GDP, etc). They may also
           consider the varied directions of the flows (whether towards core/MEDCs or towards
           periphery/LDCs). They may even consider flows at the local scale too (eg may
           consider how international aid or FDI flows transfer wealth towards an LDC, yet do
           not necessarily reach the poorest people/parts of that state).

           For band C, at least two financial flows must be described with some exemplification
           of one flow (either of places or the size/scale of the flows).

           To access band D, expect:
            either more detailed knowledge of the major financial flows (may look at how a
             wider range operate; may provide much more detailed evidence for a smaller
             range)
            or some explanation of how some major financial flows can operate in different
             directions (may even consider different scales).

           At band E, expect both of these elements.

           Marks should be allocated according to the markbands.

(b)   “Glocalization is the most important reason why some transnational
      corporations (TNCs) have grown in size and influence over time.” Discuss
      this statement.                                                                           [15]

      Credit all content in line with the markbands.        Credit unexpected approaches
      wherever relevant.

      Responses would be expected to define glocalization, providing examples of its
      effectiveness as a strategy for bridging/building new markets [Guide 5].

      A fully synthetic and evaluative answer should debate the statement with reference
      to other, possibly more important factors. These could include growth in technology
      associated with globalization, for example, containers or ICT [Guide 2] or the
      growth of MGOs allowing easier access to markets, possibly triggering mergers and
      acquisitions (for example, Cemex and domestic cement companies within NAFTA
      trade bloc) [Guide 6]. The economic factors that triggered global shift (such as
      cheap labour) are important and the role of outsourcing could be discussed [Guide 3].
      Other strategies employed by global brands may also be addressed that explain
      diffusion over time and space, such as the promotion of consumerism through brand
      advertising [Guide 5].

      Some candidates may conceptualize TNCs as a broad category that includes energy
      companies and agribusinesses, which would not be expected to adopt glocalization to
      the same extent as branded commodity providers and the service industry
      (global banking).

      For band C, at least one glocalization strategy must be described and its effectiveness
      commented on.

      To access band D, expect:
       either other more detailed reasons for TNC growth (thereby allowing the truth of
        the statement to be discussed, using at least one other theme synthesized from the
        subject guide, probably the role of technology/transport)
       or some more explicit discussion of how glocalization helps some TNCs (perhaps
        not all) to develop their size and influence (eg cultural acceptance is gained in
        varied geographical contexts / new markets) over time.

      At band E, expect both of these elements.
                                                  –6–               N13/3/GEOGR/HP3/ENG/TZ0/XX/M


2.   (a)   Explain the causes and consequences of the international relocation of polluting
           industries and/or waste disposal.                                                          [10]

           Polluting industries include manufacturing or mining operations with a large
           footprint and a polluting or dangerous character in the absence of regulation
           (examples might include Apple’s contractors in China). There are also international
           movements of waste (for recycling or disposal), for example, UK wastes to China
           (recycling) and European waste taken by contractors to Ivory Coast (dumping).
           The oil industry has brought polluting operations to many territories. While this is
           not strictly a “relocation”, the benefit of the doubt should be given to accounts of the
           expansion/diffusion of polluting industries (ie consequences of oil pollution in new
           deep water sites, for example, Gulf of Mexico, new sites in Niger delta, should
           be credited). Also credit eutrophication linked to agro-industry/agribusiness, etc.

           The causes might include a quest for cheap sites (thus higher profits) and expect
           explanations to include details of labour costs, lack of red tape, etc. Weaker answers
           are likely to neglect causes, or provide simple assertions only (eg “there’s too much
           waste nowadays”).

           Consequences for both physical environments (landscape, ecosystems) and people
           should be addressed. Some may be positive (eg recycling waste as a resource;
           FDI and its multiplier effects). Long-term litigation and quest for justice could even
           be a theme that is explored.

           For band C, at least one cause and one consequence must be described (or a wider
           range of ideas listed) with some exemplification (of either one relocation or waste
           disposal example).

           To access band D, expect:
            either more detailed knowledge of the causes and consequences (do not expect
             balance; case study consequences are likely to be more detailed and may use more
             than one example/industry, though this is not required)
            or some explanation of how a single incidence of relocation/disposal can have
             more varied consequences for different places/people (eg origin and destination),
             though less supporting detail is given.

           At band E, expect both of these elements.

           Marks should be allocated according to the markbands.

(b)   “All societies, wherever they are, enjoy the benefits of a shrinking world.”
      Discuss this statement.                                                                  [15]

      Credit all content in line with the markbands.       Credit unexpected approaches
      wherever relevant.

      “Shrinking world” (time-space compression) should be explained and related to
      different ICT and transport technologies [Guide 2]. Increased migration can be
      credited as a symptom of a shrinking world (because migrants make use of transport).
      Trade blocs/MGOs, eg EU, can play a supporting role (because the removal of
      border controls removes intervening obstacles to migration/transport).

      Possible economic benefits derived from connectivity include: more profitable TNCs,
      with work opportunities for outsourcing locations and locations in receipt of FDI
      [Guide 3] especially when long view is taken (eg signs of factory reform in
      Bangladesh). A range of sociocultural benefits can be explored that relate to the
      sharing of global media, the growth of social networks, etc [Guide 5]. The ease with
      which migrant remittances can be wired home (or money transferred via mobiles)
      might be explored [Guide 5]. There are many other benefits that can be mentioned,
      for example, access to branded commodities [Guide 5].

      There are, of course, cases where the statement may not be true and societies remain
      non-globalized/disconnected. Expect examples of indigenous people, isolated tribes,
      or variation within societies, for example, subsistence farmers [Guide 7].

      Another counterargument would be the “one-sided” benefits of connectivity, wherein
      poorer connected places are exploited as low-wage production sites, possibly
      suffering environmental problems [Guide 4]; the sociocultural reaction against
      globalization, and movements aiming to limit shrinking world effects in some way,
      for example, increased food localism or the resurgence of nationalism [Guide 6, 7].
      Indigenous people may be victims, not beneficiaries, of global interactions [Guide 5].
      A current affairs focus might be on internet privacy/rights.

      For band C, the shrinking world/globalization (may not distinguish) must be
      described and its benefits commented on.

      To access band D, expect:
       either both sides of the argument are addressed (some societies/places benefit,
        some do not not), displaying some synthesis of a range of ideas, mostly (but not
        always) linked to the idea of a shrinking world/technology and transport
       or some more explicit discussion of how “benefits” are not enjoyed by all people
        within the same society/not everyone agrees what is beneficial (eg some
        perspectives see globalization as a sovereignty threat).

      At band E, expect both of these elements.

3.   (a)   Analyse the strengths and weaknesses of one named globalization index.                  [10]

           Expect either the KOF or Kearney index to be selected. There are other possibilities,
           for example, Maastricht globalization index; CSGR (Warwick); Ernst & Young.

           Strengths include the multi-strand approach taken, recognizing that globalization
           comprises a range of processes that need to be measured, for example, KOF
           distinguishes between political, social and economic measures of globalization while
           Kearney uses four categories (economic, personal, technological or political
           integration).

           Weaknesses can be conceptual (what is not included) or empirical (difficulties in
           collecting data and accuracy issues), for example, KOF’s measures of social
           globalization are easily critiqued, such as the “proximity” of data.

           For band C, one recognizable index of globalization should be described in a way
           that implies it has merit (has different strands) and may state one or two basic
           weaknesses.

           To access band D, expect:
            either more detailed knowledge of the chosen multi-strand index (with some
             attempt made to describe some weakness)
            or greater understanding of the weaknesses of economic and social data
             collection/comparisons in general (eg appreciates different perspectives on what is
             viewed as important; knows about flaws in survey methodology).

           At band E, expect both of these elements.

           Other approaches may be equally valid. Marks should be allocated according to the
           markbands.

(b)   “Individuals, national governments and international organizations are
      increasingly resistant to global interactions.” Discuss this statement.                   [15]

      Credit all content in line with the markbands.        Credit unexpected approaches
      wherever relevant.

      Global interactions should be defined as a broad set of economic and sociocultural
      exchanges.

      At the individual scale, a range of civil society initiatives can be discussed, such as
      Occupy/anti-globalization and, at the other end of the political spectrum,
      anti-immigration/nationalists [Guide 7]. However, some individuals continue to
      embrace the shrinking world [Guide 2] for a range of economic/cultural reasons
      [Guide 5].

      Evidence of resistance at the national level might include individual government
      attitudes towards the arrival of global media corporations [Guide 5] or towards
      immigration and diaspora growth [Guide 5] or towards MGO membership [Guide 6].
      However, governments also recognize the advantages of globalization, free trade and
      financial flows [Guide 5].

      The concept of “international organizations” embraces MGOs [Guide 6] and
      international aid and development agencies responsible for financial flows, such as
      the politically-guided work of the IMF [Guide 2]. It is likely that candidates will
      choose to argue against the statement at this final scale.

      Because the question specifies three scales of resistance, there are several routes to
      discussing the statement. One might be to offer some counterarguments (eg shows
      that some national governments embrace global interactions). Another might be to
      discuss the extent to which resistance is exhibited by individuals compared with
      governments and international organizations. Another might be to consider whether
      different kinds of interaction meet with varying strength or resistance (eg China
      embracing trade but resists information exchange). Each approach must be assessed
      on its own merits. However, a response that merely agrees with the statement cannot
      progress beyond the band C/D border.

      For band C, resistance to global interactions must be identified at all three scales,
      with description provided of at least two.

      To access band D, expect:
       either broader knowledge of a range of reactions, at some different scales (thereby
        allowing the truth of the statement to be discussed, eg by comparing negative
        reactions at different scales; or by comparing positive and negative reactions at
        some of the specified scales ie individuals, governments and organizations)
       or some explicit discussion of the way that different types of global interaction
        may prompt different kinds of reaction at one/some of the specified scales.

      At band E, expect both of these elements.
