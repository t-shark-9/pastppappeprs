Subject Details: Environmental Systems and Societies SLP2 Markscheme
Mark Allocation

Candidates are required to answer ALL questions in Section A [25 marks] and TWO questions in
Section B [40 marks]. Maximum total = [65 marks].


1.    A markscheme often has more marking points than the total allows. This is intentional.

2.    Each marking point has a separate line and the end is shown by means of a semicolon (;).

3.    An alternative answer or wording is indicated in the markscheme by a slash (/). Either wording can
      be accepted.

4.    Words in brackets ( ) in the markscheme are not necessary to gain the mark.

5.    Words that are underlined are essential for the mark.

6.    The order of marking points does not have to be as in the markscheme, unless stated otherwise.

7.    If the candidate’s answer has the same “meaning” or can be clearly interpreted as being of
      equivalent significance, detail and validity as that in the markscheme then award the mark.
      Where this point is considered to be particularly relevant in a question it is emphasized by
      OWTTE (or words to that effect).

8.    Remember that many candidates are writing in a second language. Effective communication is
      more important than grammatical accuracy.

9.    Occasionally, a part of a question may require an answer that is required for subsequent
      marking points. If an error is made in the first marking point then it should be penalized. However,
      if the incorrect answer is used correctly in subsequent marking points then follow through marks
      should be awarded. When marking, indicate this by adding ECF (error carried forward) on the
      script.

10.   Do not penalize candidates for errors in units or significant figures, unless it is specifically referred
      to in the markscheme.

                                               SECTION A

1.   (a)   (i)    the Sun/solar energy/insolation;
                  wind;
                  Do not accept Coriolis Force or rotation of the Earth/heat or the
                  moon/gravitation.                                                                        [1]

                  garbage tipped/thrown into sea along beach/coastlines/urban runoff;
                  lost/thrown away fishing gear/drifting fishing net;
                  natural disaster eg tsunamis/storm surge/flood;                                      [1 max]
                  Award [1] for two of the above.

           (iii) sample a number of/many/several places/quadrats/times within the GPGP;
                 collect garbage using a net/scoop/consistent known volume measure;
                 sample at a range of depths/in water column at the GPGP;
                 sample ocean floor for sunken plastic pieces;
                 weigh/measure volume of the plastic collected;
                 take the average/mean of the samples/quadrats;
                 calculate from the average/mean/sample the extrapolation/estimate for the
                 whole area;
                 an estimate of the area of coverage/extent can be done from a plane/satellite
                 (along with depth information);
                 Do not accept indirect methods for monitoring plastic in the oceans
                 eg plastic on the beach or the contents of bird’s stomachs. These give no
                 indication of quantity.                                                               [3 max]
                 Accept other reasonable responses.
                 Award [1] each for three of the above.

           (iv) recycle/reuse/reduce use of plastic would immediately create less pollution;
                but it is difficult to find other alternatives/lifestyles are suited to plastics;

                  use other materials (eg paper) which may break down more easily;
                  but paper may not be as effective in a range of uses/it can have other
                  environmental/pollution effects;

                  stop plastic reaching the ocean by using filters on waste water;
                  but this is difficult to achieve due to non-point source pollution of plastic/hard
                  to police;

                  removal of plastic from the oceans which reduces the long term impact;
                  but this may be too late/the damage has already been done/ it is
                  difficult/expensive in the middle of the ocean;

                  economic incentives to use alternatives to plastic/fine polluters/plastic
                  tax/energy tax;
                  but requires legislation/enforcement;
                                              –7–               M13/4/ENVSO/SP2/ENG/TZ0/XX/M



             Describe/identify the strategy [1 mark] and then make a positive or
             negative evaluation [1 mark]. Two strategies needed so 2 + 2 marks.               [4 max]
             Accept other reasonable responses.

(b)   (i)    plastic pieces fill up stomach/digestive system reducing hunger/creating a
             feeling of satiation;
             plastic pieces fill up stomach/digestive system so the gut can get
             blocked/damaged;
             plastic pieces when eaten give no nutrients to the chick;
             Do NOT accept: bird poisoned by plastic pieces inside it as this is not
             linked to starvation.                                                      [1 max]

      (ii)   because POPs are not biodegradable/are persistent/long lasting in the
             environment they are stored/accumulate in bodies / bioaccumulation;
             animals at the top of food chain/web rely on eating animals that have
             each accumulated POPs themselves/eg one albatross eats many fish
             which may have eaten many plankton containing small amounts of
             POPs/small plastic pieces act as “chemical sponges” and absorb
             POPs, animals eating these also take in toxins/POPs;
             because other biomass is metabolized/respired as it passes along the
             food chain the concentration of POPs increases;
             so the concentration in the top organism is multiplied many times
             from the food it eats/biomagnification occurs;                                    [2 max]


      (iii) to identify species requiring some level of conservation/with concern
            about their conservation status/to catalogue (and highlight) those
            plants and animals that are facing a higher risk of global
            extinction/raise awareness;
            Do not accept protect or conserve wildlife.                                            [1]


      (iv) eating plastic/poisoned/pollution from oil spills;
           caught in the fishing nets/long line hooks;
           habitat destruction/lack of nesting sites;
           food limited/fish stocks reduced/overfishing;
           change is distribution of food/fish as climate change occurs;
           small populations interbreeding;
           unable to find mates;
           hunting/accidental killing of albatross by humans;
           predation may be increasing due to human interference/natural disaster;
           increase in species that compete for food with the albatross;                       [1 max]
           Award [1 max] for any two of the above. Pollution by itself is too vague/also
           air pollution is not likely over the open ocean so do not accept.

(c)   (i)    9 in 20 or 21 years / one every 2.2 or 2.3 years (except 2 years)/ one every 24
             months / 0.45/0.5 event per year / OWTTE;

      (ii)   populations are larger/denser/more urbanised;
             increased frequency over the last 30 years;
             increasing intensity/duration and so impact more people;
             initial environmental conditions are worse today, so the impact today
             is larger / eg, in an already eroded area, drought/rainfall will have an
             even greater effect;                                                            [2 max]
             Accept any other reasonable response.

(d)   (i)    carbon dioxide and water/ CO2 and H2O ;
             Do not accept sun/solar or nutrients.
             Mark the first two items only.                                                      [1]

      (ii)   La Niña events;
             global warming/climate change;
             deforestation of the Amazon/fewer trees/less forest cover;
             changes in local climate/microclimate;
             fewer trees means less evapotranspiration/evaporation/transpiration to create
             the local water/rain cycles;
             both had exceptionally high temperatures which increased
             evaporation/evapotranspiration rates;                                           [2 max]
             Accept any other reasonable response.

(iii) Do not accept vague statements like “pollution” “overpopulation” or
      activities that are not related to the carbon cycle, like “toxics released by
      industry” or related activities (garbage dumping) without appropriate
      connection to the carbon cycle.
      Award [1] for identifying human activity:
      Eg Deforestation/slash & burn;

     Award [1] for identifying change/deviation it causes in system:
     Eg Decomposition/burning/reduction of C sink/absorption lead to increase of
     atmospheric CO2;

     Award [1] for identifying feedback link accelerating initial change/deviation:
     Eg Increase CO2 leads to climate change/warming so more forest fires/
     decomposition of trees …so yet more CO2;

     OR eg:

     Burning fossil fuels releasing CO2;

     Increase CO2 leading to higher temps/more droughts in Amazon and so death
     of trees;

     Decomposition/loss of C sink/absorption …so yet more CO2;

     Award [2 max] for diagrams that are unclear/incomplete/missing.
     Award [1 max] when no human activity has been mentioned.

     eg
     trees under stress/die/forest fires


           climate warmer


        more CO2 in atmosphere



     less carbon fixed by trees/smaller carbon sink /
     CO2 released by decomposition/burning



     trees felled/burned/slash and burn agriculture                                   [3]

(e)   (i)    trend up/upwards / increasing global mean temperatures since 1950 /
             fluctuating up to about 1910 then slowly increasing / levels off in early 1950s;   [1]

      (ii)   may have used different techniques;
             may have measured in different places;
             may have interpreted the data in different ways/take averages differently;
             Met office have used error bars or range and the others have not;
             the early data may have come from limited equipment/technology eg pre 1900; [1 max]

     General Essay Markscheme
     Each essay is marked out of [20] of which [2] are for clarity of expression, structure and development
     of ideas.
               [0]      Quality of expression, structure and development is poor.
               [1]      Quality of expression, structure and development is limited.
               [2]      Quality of expression is clear, structure is good and ideas are well developed.

     Candidates can use bullet-pointed lists in responses where these are appropriate eg for questions
     using command terms such as state and identify. However, for command terms such as discuss,
     compare and contrast, explain and evaluate, bullet points alone, without any evidence of a
     developed, logical line of reasoning, could gain no credit for EoI.



2.     (a)   growth in human population;
             increase in affluence/wealth (resulting in more energy intensive lifestyles);
             technological developments (eg increased use of electrically/ fossil fuel powered
             appliances/ machines);
             increased travel (eg more air travel);
             increased industrialization (especially in LEDCs);
             increased international trade/globalization;                                                 [3 max]

       (b)   (i)     For explanations why some countries are trying to reduce their carbon
                     dioxide emissions levels:
                     Students could mention: political pressure, reduce pollution/global warming,
                     green credentials, econ benefit of carbon credit, energy security/self-
                     sufficiency.

                     increasing awareness/concern about the problems of global
                     warming/climate change caused by greenhouse gas/carbon dioxide
                     emissions;
                     honouring international commitments to reduce CO2;
                     so the country avoids penalties/inability to meet obligation;
                     gain economic benefit from carbon credits/carbon trading;
                     pressure from the population to be more carbon neutral/responding to
                     ecocentric values nationally/globally;
                     to avoid rising costs of fossil fuels;
                     to maintain energy security/self-sufficiency;
                     Do not accept to reduce pollution on its own.                                        [2 max]

             (ii)    Achieved through use of:
                     Award [2 max] for each way with a developed example.
                     national policies/legislation / international policy/treaties (way);
                     eg Kyoto Protocol/EU directives; (should be at country or local level and
                     may demonstrate implementation of international policy/legislation)
                     eg change in building/building construction regulations to reduce energy use
                     for heating or cooling;
                                           – 12 –            M13/4/ENVSO/SP2/ENG/TZ0/XX/M


           eg developing a low carbon economy is one way of achieving sustainable
           development/aim for sustainable development;
           economic instruments which reward carbon reductions/penalize carbon
           emissions(way);
           eg tax carbon emissions;
           eg reduced use of fossil fuels by increasing taxes/duty on fuel;
           eg reduce individual car use in favour of lower emission forms of transport by
           increasing difficulty of using cars (eg increased cost of fuel and parking) and
           improving public transport (increased services, wider geographical coverage,
           park and ride facilities);
           eg reduce air travel by increasing cost of travel (increase airport duties,
           increase fuel cost, removal of fuel subsidies);
           Do not accept using catalytic converters as they do not decrease CO2.

           run education campaigns/programmes to encourage changes in
           behaviour(way);
           eg change a light campaign in the USA, replace incandescent bulbs with
           fluorescent bulbs;
           eg recycle/charge/ban plastic bag use;
           take public transport campaign;

           energy conservation/efficiency (way);
           eg modifying building to retain heat / home insulation in cold countries;
           eg modify buildings to reduce heat absorption in warm countries;
           eg use of more energy efficient appliances;

           use of renewable sources of energy/reduced use of fossil fuels(way);

           eg use of solar panels to heat buildings and water;
           eg construction of nuclear power plants in France;
           Do not accept just tidal/solar etc this is not enough for a mark.
           Do not accept deforestation, this is not a carbon emission reduction.             [6 max]


(c)   Award [1 max] for two named countries with at least one valid energy choice each
      (reasons not necessary for this mark).
      Reasons may include:
      Availability:
      eg location (eg coastal for tidal/offshore wind / thin crust for geothermal);
      eg topography (mountains/rivers for HEP);
      eg geology (reserves of coal/oil/gas);
      Economic:
      High standard of living/technological development requires high capacity variety of
      sources;
      National wealth may limit choice of affordable technology/resources;
      Cultural:
      countries may have strong historical traditions/value systems/international
      reputations to maintain;
      historical events may influence decisions (eg countries experiencing nuclear
      disasters / oil embargoes;

Political:
countries may need to respond to changing values in their own population eg (rising
ecocentrism);
countries may need to meet international agreements / maintain energy security;
technological:
tech development may make new choices available;
countries may or may not have tech expertise for certain choices;
Award [6 max] for reasons valid for the countries identified. Award [4 max] if
there is no clear links (of comparison or contrast between the countries).          [7 max]

           problems solved via a wider consensus/ community participation;

           Technocentrism: [2 max]
           trust in science/technology to provide solutions to environmental
           problems;
           seeks for scientific analyses/understanding of issues (rather than
           more political/socio-economic);
           technological evaluations/solutions need to be limited to experts (so
           exclude the wider community);                                                         [4 max]

     (b)   Award [1 max] for any suitable definition of sustainable development.
           eg sustainable development is development that meets current needs without
           compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs;

           Candidates may approach this in a number of ways eg using case studies or
           specific value systems like deep ecologist/environmental manager to structure
           their answer.

           eg Anthropocentric: [3 max]
           agreement/cooperation/mutual consensus about resource use;
           giving legal rights to local people would raise their ecological awareness and urge
           them to actively protect the environment / eg,
           local people gain income by adjacent National Parks or peasants owning the land
           they cultivate;
           strong regulation of development/Governments impose appropriate economic
           incentives or counter-incentives towards sustainable goals;
           eg the various permit trading schemes like Australia’s carbon pricing scheme or
           Acid Rain Program of USA / or the various green/carbon taxes/fees;
           Offer compensation offered (by governments or NGOs) to people afflicted by pro-
           sustainability regulation / eg, compensate shepherds for sheep being eaten by
           wolves that were re-introduced in the vicinity;

           eg Technocentric: [3 max]
           technological solution to environmental degradation/resource shortage through
           substitution/pollution clean-up/non-polluting solutions;
           understanding the environment can enable humans to manipulate it and still
           provide for future generation;
           transnational corporations will be able to provide sustainable development with
           technology changes as market forces drive economic growth;

eg Ecocentric: [3 max]
minimal disturbance of natural processes/resource use so minimal impact of
development;
takes a holistic approach towards sustainable development / integrates spiritual,
environmental and social aspects which should minimise resource use;
believes overconsumption of resources/materialism is wrong and unsustainable;
limits over-exploitation and environmental degradation;
but the problem is that self imposed restraint on resource use restricts
development/economic growth;

      already have reached consensus (or else they wouldn’t have joined in the first
      place) (d);
      Intergovernmental organization directed by governments, so sometimes may be
      against public opinion (d);
      Intergovernmental organization can be bureaucratic and take time to act (d);

      Eg diplomatic constraints/ political influence:
      Intergovernmental organization decisions can be politically driven rather than by
      best conservation strategy (d);
      NGOs can be idealistic/driven by best conservation strategy / often hold the high
      moral ground over other organizations/may be extreme in actions or views (d);

(c)   Ecological footprint:
      the area of land and water required to support a defined human population at a
      given standard of living;
      the measure takes account of the area required to provide all the resources needed
      by the population, and the assimilation of all wastes / OWTTE;
      Award [1 max] for an understanding of the concept of EF.
      Responses should demonstrate understanding of the concept of sustainability
      when applied to freshwater water use. A case study can be used but the link to the
      ecological footprint should be clear.

      Sustainability in a freshwater resource requires use of water at a rate below the
      rate of replenishment/input/rainfall/supply;
      The EF model uses a given population’s rate of water use to predict the (local)
      area required to sustainably supply water;

      If the ecological footprint is greater than the area currently available to the
      population, this shows the resource use (freshwater water) is un/not sustainable (s);
      The model therefore shows sustainability or unsustainability (s);
      The model is useful as it measures the current rate of water use and the local rate
      of replenishment (s);
      The EF model is not ideal for assessing sustainability of water resources (w);
      because the model is based on an area and water supply is not closely related to
      area/the water area may be large but the quantity/renewal rate may be low (w);
      water     availability/replenishment    can     vary     seasonally/with    climate
      change/pollution levels, the model cannot easily accommodate this (w);
      models (generally) simplify complex systems/involve assumptions/inaccuracies
      (w);                                                                                     [6 max]
