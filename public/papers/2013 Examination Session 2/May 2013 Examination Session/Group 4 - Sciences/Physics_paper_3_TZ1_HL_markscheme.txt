This markscheme is confidential and for the exclusive use of
examiners in this examination session.

It is the property of the International Baccalaureate and must not

Subject Details: Physics HL Paper 3 Markscheme
Mark Allocation

Candidates are required to answer questions from TWO of the Options [2  30 marks].
Maximum total = [60 marks].

1.    A markscheme often has more marking points than the total allows. This is intentional.

2.    Each marking point has a separate line and the end is shown by means of a semicolon (;).

3.    An alternative answer or wording is indicated in the markscheme by a slash (/). Either wording can
      be accepted.

4.    Words in brackets ( ) in the markscheme are not necessary to gain the mark.

5.    Words that are underlined are essential for the mark.

6.    The order of marking points does not have to be as in the markscheme, unless stated otherwise.

7.    If the candidate’s answer has the same “meaning” or can be clearly interpreted as being of
      equivalent significance, detail and validity as that in the markscheme then award the mark.
      Where this point is considered to be particularly relevant in a question it is emphasized by
      OWTTE (or words to that effect).

8.    Remember that many candidates are writing in a second language. Effective communication is
      more important than grammatical accuracy.

9.    Occasionally, a part of a question may require an answer that is required for subsequent
      marking points. If an error is made in the first marking point then it should be penalized. However, if
      the incorrect answer is used correctly in subsequent marking points then follow through marks
      should be awarded. When marking indicate this by adding ECF (error carried forward) on the script.

10.   Do not penalize candidates for errors in units or significant figures, unless it is specifically referred
      to in the markscheme.

            wider bandwidth needed / fewer channels possible; (not “higher bandwidth”)       [2 max]

      (c)   different path lengths so different times of travel;
            ray 1 light will arrive first;
            if successive pulses from different routes overlap then interference / OWTTE;
            limit to the transmission rate/bandwidth of fibre;                                 [3 max]

            (iii) an op-amp amplifies the difference between the inputs (P and Q) (with a
                  large gain);
                  if A less than V then Q is also less than V (and P);
                  so output will be driven strongly negative;
                  R will be at –15 V and pd across buzzer is 30V (so it sounds);               [3 max]

     (c)   light travels at same speed for both observers;
           during transit time Officer Sylvester moves towards point of emission at
           front/away from point of emission at back;
           light from front arrives first as distance is less / light from back arrives later as
           distance is more;
           Officer Sylvester observes the front lamp flashes first;                                [4]

           or

           time between lights arriving at Speedy is zero (according to Speedy) – (this is a
           proper time) so Sylvester (indeed all inertial observers) sees lights reaching
           Speedy simultaneously;
           front lamp moving away from Speedy (according to Sylvester);
           speed of light constant for all observers;
           light from front lamp has to travel further to reach Speedy so must have flashed
           first (according to Sylvester);
