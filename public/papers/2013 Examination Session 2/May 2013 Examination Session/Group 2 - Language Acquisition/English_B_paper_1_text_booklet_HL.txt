TEXT A

      Moving to New Zealand
       The option to choose where you and your family will live is an
       exciting reality for many worldwide. The decision as to which
       country will provide the lifestyle you desire, and where
       best to apply your skills, will be life changing.

   5 New Zealand is considered “the country of choice” for
     thousands each year due to the enviable lifestyle, stable political and social environments,
     educational facilities and safety standards offered. We are confident it will be your
     choice also. Below are a couple of emigration experiences.

                          Educator dreams of curbing bullies
            “I don’t think kids can learn in fear,” says Susan Bosak

            Educator and author Susan Bosak remembers her own fearful school days and hopes to
            make life better for today’s children.

            In biting weather, a young Susan Bosak would walk around and around her north
 5          Winnipeg school, hoping to find a door she could enter without being taunted by the
            students who hung around outside.

            Inside, she learned to avoid the washrooms. They were
            the girl gang hangouts. If she made it through to a stall,
            other girls would leer over the wall, taunting Bosak with
10          obscenities or pelting her with wads of wet paper towels.

            “I remember living in constant fear from Grade 5
            onward,” Bosak said in an interview. “I was bullied in
            school and I was bullied to and from school. I remember
            trying to find the most strategic path home.”

15          A target because she was smart but not assertive,
            Bosak says teachers must have been aware of her
            plight but accepted it then as part of growing up.
            That’s an attitude Bosak, who brings her latest book to
            the Canadian Safe School Network annual conference,
20          wants eliminated.

            The book, Dream: A Tale of Wonder, Wisdom and Wishes, is not an anti-bullying tome but a
            gorgeously illustrated collection of poetic reflections on achieving one’s dreams at every
            stage of life, from infancy to old age. Proceeds from 5000 copies will go toward establishing
            anti-bullying programs in Toronto elementary schools.

25          “The whole idea is to make bullying as socially unacceptable as drinking and driving so
            everyone stands up and says this isn’t okay. I couldn’t learn in fear then and I don’t think
            kids can learn in fear now,” she said.

            Bosak says it’s time to recognize the severe psychological damage inflicted by bullying,
            which usually starts with verbal assault but frequently escalates to physical violence.

30          Despite anti-bullying programs in schools across Canada, Bosak said she still hears children
            talking about behaviour that impinges on their self-esteem: everything from gestures
            made with fingers behind a Grade 2 student’s head to the “usual kicking and punching”.

TEXT C


                  The dying art of letter writing
       “A novel, like a letter, should be loose, cover much ground, run swiftly,
       take risk of mortality and decay,” Saul Bellow once wrote. Like many
       novelists, in his spare time the author of The Adventures of Augie
       March and Henderson the Rain King was also an avid letter writer.

 5     A selection of Bellow’s huge correspondence, reproduced in a recent issue
       of the New Yorker, provides a fascinating insight into the writer’s character.
       Witty, often brief and almost always entertaining, Bellow’s letters are a reminder of why writers’
       letters often prove so popular with readers.

       At their best, literary letters have something for everyone: general readers get a glimpse of how
10     authors write when freed from the expectation to produce a work of conventional literary merit,
       and scholars get enough scholarly writings.

       All this is well and good – except for one small problem: nobody writes letters anymore,
       at least not the kind of intellectual, humorous letters that distinguish great correspondence.
       As we are so often told, we live in the digital age. Like the rest of us, authors now largely
15     correspond with their agents, friends, contemporaries and, occasionally, fans through email,
       not “snail mail”.

       As literary vehicles, emails are severely lacking. Digital messages tend to alternate between the
       deathly dull and formal and the casually daring – complete with BTW, FYI, LOLs and garbled
       text-speak – with precious little middle ground. Letters can be revealing, friendly, humorous;
20     emails, even at their best, tend to exhibit only one of these characteristics of good writing.

       Future literary archivists* will need to be digital experts,
       hacking through hard drives and email accounts,
       mobile phones and MP3 players, in their attempts to
       fully document the lives, and thoughts, of their subjects.
25     But who among us has all their email correspondence
       from the past five years, never mind a lifetime?
       Hardware is disposed of and forgotten about,
       mobile phones are replaced every couple of years.
       The idea that we can construct a complete record of a writer has always been unrealistic,
30     but technological advances have rendered it physically impossible, too. With so much material
       digitalised, and often wiped, writers will no longer leave behind stacks of boxes stuffed with
       missives, ripe for investigation and possible publication.

         Way back in 1898, the New York Times dubbed the long-dead
         Lord Byron the greatest letter writer in the English language,
35       celebrating his letters’ “natural eloquence, their humor,
         the force and spirit of their substance, the grace and purity of
         their style”. Saul Bellow’s letters might not be remembered
         quite so fondly 70 years from now, but chances are that,
         by then, the entire genre of collected writers’ letters will have
40       disappeared completely – leaving readers markedly poorer for
         their loss.

                                                                               Copyright Guardian News & Media Ltd 2010

                                       Alone Together
       Try as she could in later years, Tanisha couldn’t quite remember the first time she’d taken notice
       of Jon Chladek.

       There had been a lot of new faces, both black and white, in the
       dorms and around the classrooms of Georgia Tech when she was
 5     a freshman. Jon had been one of them, and she’d only gradually
       come to notice him. He wasn’t real tall for a guy, only a couple
       inches taller than her own five-foot four, and like her, a bit on the
       overweight side. Since they were engineering students on pretty
       much the same track, they shared a lot of classes together, worked
10     on some classroom exercises in groups, and a couple times as
       a pair, friendly but not really friends. For most of their freshman
       year and their first semester as sophomores, the sum total of her
       impression of Jon was that he was friendly and actually pretty nice for a white guy. Besides that,
       he was just about as smart as she was; they both were near the top of their class rankings. Jon was
15     absolutely nothing special to her, although they did respect each other for their intelligence.

       But Tanisha remembered well the afternoon when they’d first become friends.

       Unlike a lot of schools, Tech left the dorms open over Christmas break because students came from
       all over the world and many were not able to leave for break. Still, most students were gone and
       the place was pretty empty. Tanisha figured she’d get some studying in, but even that got dull.
20     It was duller than normal on New Year’s Day, and for once even studying didn’t seem interesting.
       With the dismal memories of her last days at home in St. Louis still hanging over her, some human
       contact would be nice, even for a loner like her. She didn’t feel like going anyplace, but maybe
       there might be someone to have a cup of coffee with or something down in the cafeteria.

       The sounds of a televised football game were coming from a nearby lounge as she walked into the
25     cafeteria in the middle of the afternoon. It was pretty empty, but she noticed Jon sitting over in the
       corner with a textbook open in front of him. He was staring off into space, probably thinking about
       something, or maybe he was just as morose and distracted as she was. She didn’t consciously think
       about that, but took a pass through the food line, just looking. A piece of pie maybe, she thought,
       but decided against it – she’d tightened her clothes with a few pounds from eating out of sheer
30     boredom, and she’d already been heavier than she ought to be – it’d be best just to stick with coffee.
       At least it was a break from the dreary four walls of her dorm room.

       After the last two weeks, there didn’t seem much chance that her New Year could be very happy.
35     At least she wasn’t home; that would have been a lot more unhappy. “I’m surprised to see you back
       so soon,” she added after a moment.

       “Things were [ – 44 – ] uncomfortable around home,” he commented [ – 45 – ] as he stuck
       his coffee cup under the tap and filled it. “I figured it was better to be here. What brings you

       The Nigerian Family
       Family relationships are guided by hierarchy and seniority. Social standing and recognition
       is achieved through extended families. Similarly, a family’s honour is influenced by the
15     actions of its members. Individuals turn to members of the extended family for financial
       aid and guidance, and the family is expected to provide for the welfare of every member.
       Although the role of the extended family is diminishing in urban areas, there remains a
       strong tradition of mutual caring and responsibility among the members.

       Nigeria is a hierarchical society. Age and position earn, even demand, respect. Age is
20     believed to confer wisdom so older people are granted respect. The oldest person in a
       group is revered. In a social situation, they are greeted and served first.

       The Nigerian Communication Style
       Due to the ethnic make-up of the country, communication styles vary. In the southwest,
       where the Yoruba tribe resides, people use proverbs, sayings and even songs to enrich
25     the meaning of what they say. This is especially true when speaking their native language
       although many of the same characteristics have been carried into their English language
       usage. The Yoruba often use humour to prevent boredom during long meetings or serious
       discussions. They believe that embedding humour in their message guarantees that what
       they say is not readily forgotten.

30     Nigerians living in the south of the country tend to speak more directly. You may also find
       their tone slightly louder than elsewhere. They may raise their voices even more and
       become emotionally excited when they feel passionately about a topic. At the same time,
       a harsh tone is considered unwelcoming and even hostile.

       Generally speaking, Nigerians are outgoing and friendly. Communication
35     commences with polite inquiries into the welfare of the person and
       his family. Therefore, foreigners who take the time to get to know the
       Nigerian as a person are considered friends and welcomed into a
       Nigerian’s inner circle of family and close friends.
