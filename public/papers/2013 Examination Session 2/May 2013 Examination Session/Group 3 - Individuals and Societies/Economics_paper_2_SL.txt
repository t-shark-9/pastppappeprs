                                                          Boom or bust

           The freely floating Australian dollar has been appreciating, creating winners and losers.   
            Australian tourists overseas are getting bargain hotel rooms while some local exporters are
            suffering huge falls in demand.  The appreciation of the Australian dollar gives a good reason
            to foreign students not to study in Australia.   But as the Australian dollar continues to gain
            strength it seems that the economy is coping with the appreciating currency better than many
            economists expected.  

           Australia’s exports are dominated by minerals, energy and agricultural products, and all are
            enjoying record prices.  Continued strong demand means that the exporters of these products
            have not needed to look for other markets.  For example, coal and iron ore prices have more
            than doubled in the last two years, these commodity prices rising even more quickly than the
            appreciating currency.  

           The Australian dollar is only one factor affecting exporters, and at the moment the
            strong economic growth of the Asian economies is adding to the increasing demand for
            Australian commodities.  

           However, not everyone in Australia is happy.  Service industries have not enjoyed an increase
            in the price of their output, nor have they enjoyed booming foreign demand.  The problems
            with the appreciating Australian dollar are most evident in the fact that fewer students
            and tourists are coming to Australia.  Manufacturers have a similar problem and are suffering
            from the results of the rising Australian dollar and increased domestic interest rates.  

           The higher Australian dollar has provided many indirect benefits.   By making imported
            resources cheaper, it has reduced the inflationary pressures which were caused by the economic
            boom that gave consumers greater spending power.   As a result, it allowed the Australian
            government to slow down the interest rate increases which it was imposing in order to
            tackle inflation.

                                       Price of Chinese exports set to soar

           In December 2009, a Chinese trade official declared that China will continue to increase its
            share of world exports.   While China’s share of world trade fell in 2009 due to the world
            economic downturn, the share of other major exporters fell by even more.  As a result China
            overtook Germany to become the world’s largest exporter.   Over the last 10 years China’s
            exports grew by an average of 23 %, more than twice as quickly as world trade.  If this growth
            continues China could claim 25 % of world trade by 2020.

           Chinese producers have become used to producing cheap goods and Chinese and overseas
            consumers have become used to buying these goods.  The production of electronic toys and
            textiles in China is now suffering from increased production costs.  Wages, raw materials and
            other manufacturing costs in China are rising, forcing up prices for producers and consumers.

           Inflation in China is also being affected by a huge increase in Chinese domestic demand as
            Chinese incomes increase.  Chinese toy factories are being forced to give large wage increases to
            their workers who prefer to work in Japanese-owned electronics factories.  Working conditions
            in a toy factory can be unpleasant and many workers leave resulting in labour shortages.  
            It now takes longer to produce and deliver toys.  

           These changes in the Chinese economy are beginning to have effects on other economies.   
            Importers are warning of sharp price increases and stock shortages as Chinese factories struggle
            to meet demand.  Prices have risen by 10 % in the last eight months.  Having built its reputation
            on low price manufactured goods, China now faces the problem of inflation and its effect on the
            export of these goods.  

           China has also been criticized for maintaining a low and managed exchange rate to gain a
            competitive advantage and protect its domestic industry and employment and maintain a
            current account surplus.   China’s trading partners are becoming concerned and some are
            suggesting a need for protectionist measures in order to counteract the Chinese exchange
            rate policy.

                                              Urban farms to feed Cuban cities

           The Cuban government has launched a project to surround its cities and towns with thousands
            of organic farms to make the growing of fruit, vegetables and the raising of livestock low cost
            and environmentally friendly.  

           The government hopes this new approach to urban farming will make food cheaper and
            more abundant.   It is also hoped that transport and fuel costs will be reduced and that
            urban dwellers will be encouraged to leave their city jobs and work in the farming sector.  
            The farms are mostly privately-owned with some cooperatives, and more land has been leased
            to them.   These private farmers and cooperatives own about 40 % of Cuba’s farmland and
            produce about 70 % of food grown.  

           In the past farmers had to purchase their subsidized resources from the government.  
            However, they can now purchase their own seed, equipment and other materials directly
            from suppliers.  They can choose what they want to grow.  Farmers are also allowed to sell some
            of their produce to licensed government sellers or sell directly to consumers at roadside stands.   
            Farmers can also vary the price of the products they sell.   These changes allow for greater
            reliance on the price mechanism and for a more efficient allocation of resources.  

           However, the Cuban government still plays a major role in production and support of
            the rest of the agricultural economy.   It continues to hold a monopoly over essential foods
            such as rice, beans, pork and bananas by controlling the production, distribution and land
            use for these foods.   Prices for these commodities are set by the government, which also
            provides infrastructure, schooling and overall direction to the economy.   Nevertheless,
            poor planning and corruption continue to be obstacles to economic development.

           Not all urban farmers can see the long term benefits of this and are concerned about greater
            competition between producers and the possibility of rising input prices which may result
            if subsidies end.   However, they are encouraged that the reforms allow them to make more
            decisions about what to produce and how to sell.  They believe that more food will be available
            for sale and consumption.  Foreign and local experts welcome the project and expect that as the
            market mechanism becomes more important, economic growth and economic development will
            be stimulated.

                        Cambodia encouraged to review international partnerships

           The United States (US) Secretary of State has urged Cambodians to pursue a variety of
            economic partnerships throughout Asia-Pacific and not become over-reliant on China.  
            She said that Cambodia should look for partnerships that cut across regional geographic lines.

           Both China and the US are working to extend their influence in Cambodia.  Nearly 400 Chinese
            companies have invested billions of dollars in Cambodia, including key infrastructure
            projects such as hydropower dams and coal-power plants.   While acknowledging the
            attraction of Chinese investment, the Secretary of State said: “One of the challenges for
            Cambodia is the construction of dams on the Upper Mekong river”.  China has been criticised
            by environmental groups over the building of a series of hydropower projects on the
            Mekong river.  Concerns over the project include a possible loss of water quality and a loss
            of biodiversity.

           The Secretary of State also indicated that the US was willing to cooperate with Cambodia to
            resolve an outstanding debt of about US$445 million that the country owes to the US.

           The Cambodian Foreign Minister had asked the Secretary of State at a meeting to help
            his country convert the debt into development aid.   She said she was ready to explore
            creative ways Cambodia could be relieved of the debt, possibly by agreeing to preserve key
            environmental areas or investing in education.  In this way, the debt repayment would be treated
            as development aid.
