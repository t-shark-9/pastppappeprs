Answer one question.

Wherever possible, answers should include case studies and examples, and, where relevant, large, well drawn
maps, sketches and diagrams.

1.    (a)   Using examples, distinguish between cultural imperialism and cultural diffusion.          [10]

      (b)   Examine the range of responses to the loss of national sovereignty that
            globalization can bring.                                                                  [15]


2.    (a)   Explain the role of ICT in the growth of international outsourcing.                       [10]

      (b)   “Environmental degradation is the inevitable outcome of global economic
            interactions.” Discuss this statement.                                                    [15]


3.    (a)   Explain why the landscapes of major world cities are becoming increasingly
            similar.                                                                                  [10]

      (b)   “Global interactions are putting all the world’s wealth into the hands of a small
            number of people and countries.” Discuss this statement.                                  [15]
