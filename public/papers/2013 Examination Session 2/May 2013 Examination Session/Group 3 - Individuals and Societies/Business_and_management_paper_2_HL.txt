                                                  SECTION A

Answer one question from this section.

1.    Las Rosas (LR)

      Las Rosas (LR) is a large commercial dairy farm owned and managed by the D’Aremberg family
      since 1986. It has 3800 cows. LR sells milk, cheese and yoghurts. In 1996, LR started to export some
      of its dairy products. Profits and cash flow have been improving year on year. LR has no outstanding
      loans and therefore its current gearing ratio is zero.

      LR’s unique selling proposition (USP) comes from the organic quality of its products as they are
      made without chemical additives. The cows’ diet does not include hormones and other supplements.
      The farm’s products also meet national and international quality standards.

      LR’s corporate culture encourages innovation and the use of cell production. To stay ahead of the
      competition LR has increased its spending on research and development (R&D) and workers are
      given the opportunity to create new products, or to add value to existing ones. LR’s financial manager,
      however, believes that the R&D budget is too high and needs to be cut. He also argues that there are
      too many legal constraints limiting the development of new products.

      LR’s management is considering buying El Remanzo, a large sheep farm located nearby. This
      acquisition will cost $24 million and LR will need to cut its R&D budget to zero and organize a
      new loan to finance the takeover. A significant restructuring would need to occur at both LR and
      El Remanzo to allow both companies to combine resources and knowledge. However, the potential
      economies of scale experienced by LR could be substantial.

      Total capital employed at LR is $45 million.

2.    Icarus

      Icarus is an adventure tourism company. It has developed a family brand of innovative tourism
      products, such as the World’s first underwater theme park. Its next objective is to build the
      first hotel in outer space by 2016. Icarus conducted market research using stratified samples of
      businessmen/businesswomen and families with incomes over $10 000 000. Most said that they
      would pay the proposed price of $140 000 per room per night. Although the hotel should create
      significant profits, Icarus’ Board of Directors is concerned about both safety and financial risks.




                          [Source: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Aurora-SpaceShuttle-EO.jpg]


      Icarus has invested significant funds to develop safety procedures and to train the employees of the
      future hotel. Icarus wants to protect its brand image as the most trusted adventure tourism company
      in the world.

      The hotel will have a capacity of 500 rooms. Originally (in 2012) Icarus forecasted the following
      (in $):
       price per room per night (room rate): 140 000
       fixed costs: 10 000 000
       variable cost per room per night: 100 000.

      Now (in 2013) the costs of construction, fuel and insurance have increased and affected the forecast.
      To ensure a 2016 opening, Icarus has identified a potential investor. The problem is that he expects
      a $2 000 000 guaranteed (target) profit in the first year, but Icarus has promised not to increase its
      room prices. The following shows the revised forecasted figures (in $):
       price per room per night (room rate): 140 000
       target profit required by investor: 2 000 000
       fixed costs: 12 000 000
       variable cost per room per night: 108 000.

      The Board of Directors are concerned that:
       keeping room prices the same will reduce profits
       other adventure tourism companies are considering entering the outer space tourism market
       withdrawing from the project would damage Icarus’ brand image and would cost millions of
        dollars.


      (a)   Describe two advantages to Icarus of having a family brand.                         [4 marks]

      (b)   Explain one advantage and one disadvantage to Icarus of using stratified
            samples in its market research.                                                     [4 marks]

      (c)   (i)   Using the original forecasted figures (in 2012), calculate Icarus’
                  break-even point (show all your working).                                     [2 marks]

		(ii)            Using the revised forecasted figures (in 2013), calculate Icarus’
                  break-even point (show all your working).                                     [2 marks]

      (d)   (i)   Using the revised forecasted figures, construct a fully labelled break-even
                  chart for 2013.                                                               [4 marks]

		(ii)            Explain the limitations of the 2013 break-even chart from part (i) as a
                  decision-making tool for Icarus.                                              [3 marks]

      (e)   Analyse Icarus’ decision to open the first hotel in outer space.                    [6 marks]

                                               SECTION B

Answer two questions from this section.

3.    Construir

      Construir is a large construction company that uses empowerment, job enrichment and teamwork to
      motivate its workers. Commitment to quality is strong, and productivity is high.

      The company makes substantial investment in the training and professional development of its
      workers, who may receive both external and internal training:
       External training takes place at a local university. However, university training fees are rising.
       Internal training is led by managers within each department. However, some managers do not feel
        comfortable in this role.

      Managers also conduct worker appraisals in order to monitor performance and reward success.
      However, some managers feel that it takes too long to appraise workers appropriately; they also say
      that for some workers the appraisal process can be very stressful.

      The government is considering the construction of a bridge, which would take three years to complete.
      This would be through a public-private partnership with Construir. The government would pay half
      of the cost of construction and would give Construir the right to charge a fee to drivers who use the
      bridge. Building the bridge, however, would represent financial and operational risks for Construir.

      The company will not be able to accept other construction projects in order to build the bridge.
      Moreover, a general election is due next year and the current government is unpopular and not
      expected to win. If a new government is elected, Construir believes that the project may be cancelled.
      Some local environmental pressure groups are currently campaigning against the bridge project,
      arguing that government funds should be spent on health and education.


      (a)   Define the following terms:

		(i)             productivity                                                                   [2 marks]

		(ii)            pressure groups.                                                               [2 marks]

      (b)   Explain two non-financial rewards used at Construir to motivate workers.             [6 marks]

      (c)   Analyse two benefits for Construir of a public-private partnership with the
            government.                                                                          [6 marks]

      (d)   Evaluate Construir’s training and appraisal methods.                                 [9 marks]

4.    Oktopus Air (OA)

      Oktopus Air (OA) is an airline targeting both business and economy class passengers. Customers
      have praised OA for its ethical objectives, its commitment to below market prices for both market
      segments and its mission statement: “In the air, we care for everyone!”.

      Employees have praised OA’s Chief Executive Officer (CEO), Eythor Karlsson, for his situational
      leadership style. OA’s flights are usually full and customer feedback is excellent.

      Two social changes are affecting OA:
       Obesity is increasing. Very obese passengers are finding difficulty fitting into seats. On full
        flights, some passengers sitting next to a very obese passenger have complained about a lack of
        space. OA has decided to charge very obese passengers for two seats. A refund of one seat will
        be given if the flight is not full. Pressure groups representing very obese people have argued that
        OA is acting unethically. Eythor defended the decision, arguing that competitors were already
        carrying out the same practices. He added that very obese passengers can create safety problems
        during an emergency evacuation of the airplane.
       The second change is the increasing number of families with young children travelling in business
        class. Business passengers are complaining that young children are too noisy and are threatening
        to fly with competitor airlines. Eythor has suggested to OA’s Board of Directors that a market gap
        could be filled if OA offered a family-only service, once a day, with additional play areas for young
        children and hence fewer passenger seats. Eythor has indicated that OA will need to raise prices
        for this service, change its promotional method for this service and create a new marketing mix.
        Some consumer groups recognize the good intentions of a family-only service; however they fear
        it could actually increase the hostility towards families with young children on other flights that
        OA offers.


      (a)   Describe one possible above the line and one possible below the line
            promotional method for OA.                                                            [4 marks]

      (b)   Explain three stakeholder conflicts at OA.                                            [6 marks]

      (c)   Analyse how the two social changes could affect OA’s ability to fulfil its
            mission statement: “In the air, we care for everyone!”.                               [6 marks]

      (d)   Discuss an appropriate marketing mix for OA’s proposed new “family-only
            service”.                                                                             [9 marks]

5.    Metro Town (MT)

      Metro Town (MT ) is a football (soccer) club that has exceeded all expectations by winning a national
      football cup competition. MT is managed by Dave Mater and the football team is captained by his
      son Wayne. MT had faced closure in 2012 due to cash-flow problems. However, the cup win has
      provided much needed revenue to pay players’ wages and also profit to finance working capital.
      MT’s stadium is old and needs repair. The club had faced bankruptcy because Dave had not followed
      budgets. For example, as part of its commitment to corporate social responsibility, MT spent too
      much on social marketing to encourage healthy eating and youth sport participation in the local area.

      Dave had created an open informal organizational culture at MT. He had introduced a matrix
      structure with Wayne conducting most of the training sessions. Player turnover at the club was very
      low. However, a few high profile players, disliking Dave’s management approach, have threatened
      to leave MT. However, the cup success and the possibility of a joint venture with another club has
      encouraged them to stay.

      MT’s cup success has attracted the interest of a larger club Dynamo. Last year Dynamo lost many
      games and as a result ticket sales fell. Dynamo’s Chief Executive Officer (CEO), Gary Driver, has
      proposed to Dave a joint venture. Dynamo and MT would share a new stadium financed by Dynamo.
      It would provide both clubs with modern training facilities, which would help all players to become
      more skilled. Dave was interested and at a team meeting at his home he proposed the idea. However,
      he argued that the Dynamo culture, which is more centralized and autocratic, could lead to cultural
      clashes. Then unexpectedly, without consulting Dave, his son Wayne decided to sign a two-year
      contract to play (work) for Dynamo’s football team.


      (a)   (i)   Define the term social marketing.                                              [2 marks]

		(ii)            Identify two characteristics of a matrix structure.                            [2 marks]

      (b)   Explain the role that budgets could play in solving the cash-flow problems at MT.    [6 marks]

      (c)   Using two appropriate motivation theories, analyse player motivation at MT.          [6 marks]

      (d)   Advise Dave on the proposal for a joint venture with Dynamo.                         [9 marks]
