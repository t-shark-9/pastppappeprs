Examiners should be aware that in some cases, candidates may take a different approach, which if
appropriate should be rewarded. If in doubt, check with your Team Leader.

In the case of an “identify” question read all answers and mark positively up to the maximum marks.
Disregard incorrect answers. In all other cases where a question asks for a certain number of facts
eg “describe two kinds”, mark the first two correct answers. This could include two descriptions,
one description and one identification, or two identifications.

It should be recognized that, given time constraints, answers for part (c) questions are likely to include a
much narrower range of issues and concepts than identified in the markband. There is no “correct”
answer. Examiners must be prepared to award full marks to answers which synthesize and evaluate even
if they do not examine all the stimulus material.

                  Award [1 mark] for any of the points stated above up to a maximum of
                  [4 marks].
                                                 –5–                    M13/3/ITGSX/SP1/ENG/TZ0/XX/M


(b)   To enable EFT to take place the customer must log in to a secure
      environment using a username and password. However, many banks
      now use additional security measures. Analyse two possible additional
      security measures.                                                    [6 marks]

      This question can be interpreted in two ways:
      1. Analyze the security relating to the measure.
      2. Analyze any aspect of the specific “security measure” (eg cost of
         implementation, ease of use).

      The following list identifies the security measure. The candidate must analyze the
      security measures.

      Additional security measures may include:
       asking personal security questions to recover forgotten password
       movable on-screen keypad
       variable password characters (not full password)
       “2nd Factor Authentication” (eg additional pin number / national identification
        number such as CPR in Denmark / code card reader / DNI card reader)
       biometric recognition (eg fingerprint, retinal/iris scan, face scan, voice
        recognition, palm scan)
       virtual keypad
       password generators
       captcha
       SMS security – codes sent by SMS to confirm payment details are correct and
        the transaction is verified
       data encryption / Secure Socket Layer (SSL)
       limit set on the amount of money that can be transferred using EFT
       firewall
       security token (USB token, key fob) used by the customer.

                  [2 marks].

           (ii)   Identify the steps taken by an IT monitoring system to detect
                  when a sign or condition is abnormal and the patient requires
                  special attention.                                            [4 marks]

                  Answers may include:
                   enter limits
                   enter acceptable limits for the condition in the IT monitoring system
                   sensor measures the required condition
                   measurement is sent to IT monitoring system software
                   analogue measurements are converted to a digital format
                   the patient’s current condition is compared with acceptable limits stored
                    in the IT system
                   if outside limit, an alert message appears.

                  N.B. The focus is on the IT monitoring system. Do not consider attaching
                  the sensors.

                  Award [1 mark] for any of the points identified above up to a maximum of
                  [4 marks].

(b)   Analyse the implications for doctors when the hospital implements new
      patient monitoring equipment for health care.                         [6 marks]

      Answers may include:
       doctors can choose to directly receive patient data/alerts when conditions
        change
       continuous medical information of patients will be available to the doctor
       the warning signs of the IT monitoring system may alert doctors to conditions
        that they were not aware of
       doctors may need to carry an alert device
       doctors may have access to better results (ie additional analysis, more reports)
       doctors will need to be trained to use the new equipment
       new patient monitoring system may save the doctor time allow them to see
        more patients
       doctor may be assigned more patients under the assumption that they need to
        physically visit and check each patient less often with a IT monitoring system
       issues of liability for the doctor if something goes wrong (eg if a doctor fails to
        receive an alert and a patient dies ...)
       doctor can experience technical difficulties when the new patient monitoring
        equipment is implemented that hinders their work
       doctor can better determine which patients require immediate medical care.

      N.B. Only award marks for the implications for doctors.

      Do not accept personal considerations for doctors such as stress, distrust of
      equipment.

(c)   Training will be provided by the hospital for staff to use the new IT patient
      monitoring system. It was decided to use a combination of online training
      and practical hands-on training. Justify this decision.                       [8 marks]

      Use the follow tables to award marks using the generic markband. The response
      must justify a combination of both online training and practical hands-on training.
      These two must be used in combination with one another and not just compared.

      N.B. If a response addresses online training and hands-on training independently,
      award a maximum of [6 marks]. For [7–8 marks], a combination of both online
      training and hands-on training must be justified.

(b)   (i)    Some e-book readers use a proprietary file format, others use generic
             file formats. Explain one advantage for the company who produces and
             sells the e-books of using a proprietary format.                      [2 marks]

             Answers may include:
              proprietary formats provides a format that allows improvements/special
               functionality for the e-book
              the company’s e-books may only be used on their specific e-book reader
               (ie may not be downloaded into other readers, will increase sales of their
               own readers)
              some proprietary formats do not allow sharing, for example copying,
               printing or side-load (move between reader devices).

             N.B. The advantage must be for the company.

             Award [1 mark] for identifying an advantage.

             Answers may include:
              relational database avoids data redundancy, duplication of data – data
               will be saved once in a record and information tables is linked
              avoiding errors in data entry – information will only be entered and saved
               once
              less storage space needed – duplication of data would mean additional
               storage space would be required.

(c)   A school library has introduced the loan of e-books. Discuss the impact on
      the students.                                                              [8 marks]

      Answers may include:
      Positive impacts on the students
       students may be able to “carry” many books in one electronic device without
        worrying about the weight
       students can make “annotations” electronically without scribbling on a book
        owned by the library
       students can combine the use of a book and a dictionary in case some
        clarification of terms is needed
       some electronic readers may have an application that will “read” the book
        (audio format)
       font size and background shades/colours can be changed to help readers with
        vision problems
       if there is a technical problem, it may be possible for the student to borrow the
        e-book again
       students may be able to collaborate using e-book note-taking features
       students can access the library 24/7 / students do not have to go physically go
        to library
       students may access to a wider range of e-books because e-books do not take
        up physical space
       student will not have to worry about missing the due date for returning the
        book which is automatically managed by the system
       student will not need to spend time in the library searching for a book –
        searching can now be done by a query on the e-reader.

      Negative impacts on the students
       students may need training to use the electronic reader
       students may not have access to e-books (eg no e-book reader, no Internet
        access, malfunctioning reader)
       students may be concerned with the e-book reader being stolen, damaged or
        lost
       students will spend additional hours viewing a computer screen
       the e-book reader could lead students to be distracted.

      N.B. Do not accept answers about how the student feels about using an e-book.

        professional purposes
       from the application’s postings the employer gets the impression that the
        applicant is well-suited to their company.

      Risks
       social networking sites are open to allow other people to add content or
        comment on an applicants post (ie the information may not be true, information
        is placed there to harm others) which influence employers
       applicant may have posted private information without realizing the
        implications of it being publically available
       information may be stored permanently; embarrassing information relating to
        the applicant (ie text, photos, videos) can have unfortunate consequences over
        a long period.
