                                                  SECTION A

Answer one question from this section.

1.    Office Cleaners (OC)

      Sayaka Toguchi operates an office cleaning service, which is in the tertiary sector. When office
      workers are going home, she arrives at their offices to clean them. At present, she has four clients,
      with commercial offices all located in the same building. She operates as a sole trader and has no
      employees. Her business name is Office Cleaners (OC ).

      Sayaka has always liked the small size of her business. However, when a large bank on the ground
      floor of the same building where her current clients are located offered her a contract to clean its offices,
      she decided to reconsider the size of her business. The bank would loan her $2500 to purchase new
      cleaning equipment. The bank would also offer her a two-year contract paying her $6000 every
      second month. Sayaka would need to employ one new worker to clean the bank.

      For the bank contract, Sayaka forecasted the following monthly cash outflows:
       salary for one new employee: $2000
       cleaning products (soap, detergent): $200
       payment on equipment loan: $150 payable from the second month
       business taxes and overheads: $300.

      Before the bank loan she currently has personal savings of $1600 in the bank.

      Employee absence also worries Sayaka. How will she get all the offices clean if her new employee
      is absent from work due to illness? Agencies can provide temporary employees but they cost
      $300 a day per worker.


      (a)   Define the term tertiary sector.                                                            [2 marks]

      (b)   Identify two features of a sole trader.                                                     [2 marks]

      (c)   (i)    Prepare a monthly cash-flow forecast for the bank contract for the first six
                   months assuming Sayaka employs one new worker.                                       [5 marks]

		          (ii)   Calculate the impact on the monthly closing balance of the six month
                   cash-flow forecast if the new employee is absent from work due to illness
                   for two days per month. Assume Sayaka still pays the ill employee a
                   monthly salary of $2000.                                                             [2 marks]

      (d)   Comment on the impact that the bank contract will have on the cash flow of OC.              [4 marks]

      (e)   Analyse the impact on Sayaka’s role if she expands the size of her business.                [5 marks]

2.    Khalil Damascus Supplies (KDS)

      Khalil Damascus Supplies (KDS) sells construction materials, such as cement and bricks, to the
      business-to-business (B2B) market. It is located in an industrial area in Damascus. Its manager is
      Ahmed Khalil.

      Large construction companies have their own cranes. However, small construction companies often
      do not. Many small construction companies have asked KDS if it could offer a crane rental (hire)
      service.




                       [Source: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Truck-mounted_crane_building_a_bridge.jpg]


      Ahmed calculated that purchasing two cranes, costing $100 000 each, would be a worthwhile
      investment. Rental income from the cranes would enable KDS to break-even on the equipment.
      Ahmed believed that future profits would come from an increase in the sales of construction material
      to new customers attracted to KDS because of its crane rental service.

      Selected financial information before KDS purchases the cranes, as at 31 May 2012 (all figures in $):

       Cash                                               55 000
       Cost of goods sold                              3 000 000
       Creditors                                          45 000
       Debtors                                                 X
       Expenses                                        2 300 000
       Fixed assets (building and equipment)             350 000
       Loan capital                                       40 000
       Retained profit                                   215 000
       Sales revenue                                   5 600 000
       Share capital                                     200 000
       Short-term borrowing                               10 000
       Stock                                              50 000



                                                                    (This question continues on the following page)

(Question 2 continued)

      Ahmed must decide who will operate the cranes. There are three options:
       First, train some current employees at KDS. Several have said that they are interested.
       Second, increase the number of employees by hiring two experienced and licensed crane operators.
       Third, rent only to customers who themselves employ licensed crane operators. However, many
        small construction companies do not employ licensed crane operators.

      Ahmed likes the idea of training his own employees, as it would give them additional job skills,
      job enrichment and more experience with construction sites. However, he is concerned about the
      costs of training and additional insurance.


      (a)   Describe one appropriate source of finance other than a bank loan that KDS
            could use for the purchase of the cranes.                                           [2 marks]

      (b)   Define the term retained profit.                                                    [2 marks]

      (c)   (i)    Using relevant information from the table, construct a balance sheet for
                   KDS as at 31 May 2012 (before the purchase of the cranes) and calculate
                   debtors (figure X).                                                          [5 marks]

		          (ii)   Using relevant information from the table, calculate the gearing ratio and
                   the gross profit for KDS before the purchase of the cranes (show all your
                   working).                                                                    [4 marks]

      (d)   Comment on the financial impact on KDS if Ahmed uses a bank loan to fund the
            purchase of the cranes.                                                             [2 marks]

      (e)   Contrast the three options of who will operate the cranes.                          [5 marks]

                                               SECTION B

Answer two questions from this section.

3.    Brandon Canoes (BC)

      Brandon Canoes (BC ) manufactures and sells canoes in the Pacific Northwest of North America,
      where canoeing and fishing are popular hobbies. Founded in 1951 by Brandon Tyler, BC is
      a private limited company owned and operated by members of the Tyler family. There is strong
      brand awareness of BC in the regional canoeing and fishing community.

      Primary market research conducted by BC showed that some people wanted smaller canoes that could
      be easily transported. BC’s factory has sufficient space to expand its product range to include smaller
      canoes. BC can easily manufacture 1000 smaller canoes per year in addition to current production.
      BC’s current Chief Executive Officer (CEO), Ashton Tyler, calculated that the costs associated with
      these smaller canoes would be:
       fixed costs: $300 000
       variable costs per unit: $1900
       sales price: $2400.

      Ashton thought that the smaller canoes would appeal to two new market segments:
       young people (in their 20s) who wish to exercise in an environmentally friendly way
       older people (in their 50s and 60s) who want forms of exercise less physically demanding than
        running or team sports like football (soccer).

      The Marketing Director, however, warned that the target markets for the smaller canoes are probably
      not aware of the BC brand. He added that marketing costs would be higher than Ashton anticipated.
      It would also take time to generate sales of the new smaller canoes. Also, because of the economic
      recession, some customers were taking longer to pay. Because of the potential marketing issues
      and the slower payments, BC needs to plan for additional working capital. BC’s shareholders are,
      however, not convinced. They view the smaller canoes as a largely new product for a new market.
      They would rather pursue extension strategies to the existing product range.


      (a)   Identify two ways in which the market for canoes may be segmented.                    [2 marks]

      (b)   Calculate the break-even quantity for the smaller canoes (show all your working).     [2 marks]

      (c)   Explain how the “marketing issues and the slower payments” would create a
            need for additional working capital.                                                  [4 marks]

      (d)   Apply the Ansoff matrix growth strategies to BC.                                      [5 marks]

      (e)   Discuss Ashton’s proposal to start manufacturing and selling smaller canoes.          [7 marks]

4.    Kabaret

      Matt Fidler and Shailah Hitta met at university, where they both studied drama. They have now just
      graduated. As they work very well together as artists, they want to turn their talent into their source
      of income. They have decided to set up their own theatre company called Kabaret. It will be a
      partnership, with Matt and Shailah as equal partners. They arranged an appointment with Mr Lloyd,
      an independent consultant, for financial advice.

      They first discussed the main problems that Kabaret, as a business start-up, may face. Because Matt
      and Shailah know many people who have set up theatre companies, they feel ready to deal with
      possible problems such as developing a customer base and branding. Matt and Shailah have many
      ideas about the plays they want to stage and the theatres where they want to perform. However, they
      do not know how much tickets should cost. Mr Lloyd explained the two types of pricing strategy
      that they could use: cost-based pricing or competition-based pricing. Matt and Shailah realise that
      they have to do more research about their own costs and about their local competitors.

      Mr Lloyd has now asked them to prepare a business plan that includes a decision about their
      pricing strategy as well as a cash-flow forecast. Matt and Shailah will meet him again in three weeks
      in order to further discuss the creation and launch of Kabaret.


      (a)   Define the term branding.                                                             [2 marks]

      (b)   Explain the importance of the information in Kabaret’s business plan for
            one internal stakeholder and for one external stakeholder.                            [6 marks]

      (c)   Analyse the main problems that Kabaret, as a business start-up, may face.             [5 marks]

      (d)   Analyse the appropriateness of the two pricing strategies Mr Lloyd suggests and
            recommend to Matt and Shailah which one to use for the tickets to Kabaret’s
            shows.                                                                                [7 marks]

5.    Volunteering (le bénévolat, voluntariado)

      Volunteering is the practice of working without payment. In many countries, volunteering is becoming
      more common. Many volunteers work in non-profit and non-governmental organizations (NGOs),
      such as charities and pressure groups. They may want to support a particular cause, for example
      human rights, international aid, or emergency rescue operations after a natural disaster. Some
      volunteers work in profit-based organizations, for example in the arts: theatres, cinemas and museums
      have always employed volunteers. Volunteering in schools is also frequent, such as with parents
      or community members giving some of their time to help the school fulfill its educational mission.
      The CAS requirement of the IB Diploma can be seen as a form of volunteering, as a service may
      include community and social service activities without payment in return.

      People who wish to work as volunteers come from all backgrounds: young people who need practical
      experience to strengthen their CV (résumé); unemployed people who use it to keep motivated and
      active whilst looking for a job; part-time employees who want to help the community; even retired
      people who use it as an opportunity to socialize. Some volunteers do it for just a few hours a week,
      while for others it becomes a full-time activity.

      “Employing volunteers requires workforce planning” explains Sylvia Warnecke from the
      International Union of Volunteers. “Most organizations take the professional development of their
      volunteers seriously, for example by offering training to learn new skills. They do not pay salaries,
      but they can offer a range of non-financial rewards. For organizations, training volunteers is a form
      of investment.”


      (a)   Define the term pressure group.                                                      [2 marks]

      (b)   Explain the meaning of Sylvia’s statement that “for organizations, training
            volunteers is a form of investment”.                                                 [2 marks]

      (c)   Distinguish between two forms of non-financial rewards that may be used by
            organizations to motivate volunteers.                                                [4 marks]

      (d)   Apply Maslow’s hierarchy of needs to the situation of an unemployed person
            who volunteers at a local non-profit organization.                                   [5 marks]

      (e)   Discuss the advantages and disadvantages of employing volunteers in
            profit-based organizations.                                                          [7 marks]
