                                              SECTION A

Microeconomics

1.   (a)     Explain why a government might impose a price ceiling on the market
             for rented accommodation and a price floor on the market for
             agricultural products.                                                          [10 marks]

             Answers may include:
             • definitions of price ceiling and price floor
             • explanation of price ceilings in relation to rented accommodation: use of a
               maximum price below the equilibrium to protect consumers; explanation of
               price floors in relation to agricultural products: minimum price above the
               equilibrium to protect producers
             • diagrams to show a price ceiling and a price floor
             • examples of markets where price controls were used or might be used.

  1 There is little understanding of the specific demands of the question.
    Relevant economic terms are not defined.
    There is very little knowledge of relevant economic theory.
    There are significant errors.                                                  1–3

  2 There is some understanding of the specific demands of the question.
    Some relevant economic terms are defined.
    There is some knowledge of relevant economic theory.
    There are some errors.                                                         4–6

  3 There is understanding of the specific demands of the question.
    Relevant economic terms are defined.
    Relevant economic theory is explained and applied.
    Where appropriate, diagrams are included and applied.
    Where appropriate, examples are used.
    There are few errors.                                                          7–8

  4 There is clear understanding of the specific demands of the question.

(b)   “Market-oriented supply-side policies will always be more effective in
      promoting economic growth than demand-side policies.” To what extent
      do you agree with this statement?                                                  [15 marks]

      N.B. It should be noted that definitions, theory and examples that have already
      been given in part (a), and then referred to in part (b), should be rewarded.

      Answers may include:
      • definitions of market-oriented policies (as against interventionist policies),
        demand-side policies and economic growth
      • theory of Aggregate Demand and Aggregate Supply and how either may be
        used to increase real GDP
      • diagrams to show increased real GDP resulting from changes to AD and AS
      • examples of market-oriented supply-side policies and demand-side policies
      • synthesis and evaluation (to what extent).

      Consideration of the merits of the statement may include: discussion of the
      term effectiveness in the context of economics. Candidates may distinguish the
      effectiveness of each policy in the short run and the long run.

      Examiners should be aware that candidates may take a different approach
      which, if appropriate, should be rewarded.

      Opinions or conclusions should be presented clearly and should be supported
      by appropriate examples.
