Microeconomics

1.    (a)   Explain why the price elasticity of demand for primary commodities tends to be
            relatively low while the price elasticity of demand for manufactured products
            tends to be relatively high.                                                     [10 marks]

      (b)   “The income elasticity of demand for primary products tends to be lower than
            that for manufactured products and services.” Examine the implications of this
            for producers and for the economy as a whole.                                    [15 marks]


2.    (a)   Analyse the consumption externalities which might arise from the provision of
            education and health care for the citizens of a country.                         [10 marks]

      (b)   Evaluate the use of government policies to increase the consumption of
            health care.                                                                     [15 marks]

Answer one question from this section.

Macroeconomics

3.    (a)   Explain the difficulties involved in measuring the rate of inflation.              [10 marks]

      (b)   Discuss the view that deflation is a more serious problem than inflation for the
            economy of a country.                                                              [15 marks]


4.    (a)   Explain how labour market reforms may be used to promote economic growth.          [10 marks]

      (b)   “Market-oriented supply-side policies will always be more effective in promoting
            economic growth than demand-side policies.” To what extent do you agree with
            this statement?                                                                    [15 marks]
