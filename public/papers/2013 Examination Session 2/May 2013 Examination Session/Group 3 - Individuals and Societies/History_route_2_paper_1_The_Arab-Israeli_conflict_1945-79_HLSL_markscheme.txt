1.    (a)   What does Source A reveal about the situation of Palestinian refugees
            immediately after the 1948/49 conflict and the Arab response?                 [3 marks]

             The refugee problem was immense.
             They were in makeshift camps, where their lives were miserable.
             They were in various locations: Jordan, Syria, Lebanon and the Gaza Strip.
             They had no alternative but to remain in the camps, though the assumption was that
              this would only be on a temporary basis.
             Their property had been given to new immigrants to Israel.

     Award [1 mark] for each relevant point up to a maximum of [3 marks].

     (b)    What is the message conveyed by Source B?                                     [2 marks]

             Facilities were very poor, the tents would not provide much shelter, there were no
              roads or pavements.
             The camps were very crowded with tents very close to each other, revealing the size
              of the refugee problem.
             The use of tents indicated that the situation of the refugees was expected to be
              temporary.

     Award [1 mark] for each relevant point up to a maximum of [2 marks].

2.   Compare and contrast the views expressed in Sources D and E about the
     peacemaking process after the first Arab–Israeli conflict.                            [6 marks]

     For “compare”
      They both agree that the refugees were a major issue in the peacemaking process.
      They both agree that the issue of borders was negotiable, and negotiations began.
      They both agree that negotiations were begun before the armistice with Egypt in February
       1949.
      Both sources indicate UN involvement.

     For “contrast”
      Source D suggests a more conciliatory attitude by both parties than Source E – Source D
       states that the Israelis signed a protocol agreeing that a key principle of peace should be the
       return of refugees and restoration of their property, whereas Source E states that Israel did
       not accept the UN resolutions that gave “a right of return” as they argued that they had not
       started the war.
      The two sources differ on matters of factual detail: Source E says negotiations started in
       September 1948 and Source D mentions January 1949; Source D does not discuss the
       activities of the UNRWA or of the UN, whereas Source E gives such details.
      Whereas the main emphasis in Source D is upon the refugee problem, Source E gives equal
       emphasis both to the refugee question and to the question of borders.
      Source D talks of the Arab states insisting on the Palestinian refugees returning home, but
       Source E suggests a more flexible Arab stance – that refugees could choose either to return,
       or to accept compensation for their property.

     End-on description of both sources would be worth up to [3 marks] if the comparative
     element is only implicit, and [4 marks] with excellent explicit linkage. If both sources
     are used with a good running linkage of both comparison and contrast award a maximum
     of [4–5 marks]. For the maximum of [6 marks] expect a detailed, comprehensive, running,
     comparison and contrast. If there is only either comparison or contrast award a maximum of
     [4 marks].

3.   With reference to their origin and purpose, assess the value and limitations
     of Source B and Source C for historians studying the Arab–Israeli conflict.          [6 marks]

     Source B
     Origin:        A photograph of a refugee camp in 1949, published in a textbook on the
                    conflict.

     Purpose:       To give a visual image of the conditions in refugee camps, and to present the
                    topic to school students.

     Value:         The visual image gives a very clear understanding of the living conditions in
                    refugee camps. Immediacy of the source.

     Limitations:   As with all photographs it is a partial record of a wider context. It is also of
                    limited value in understanding the complexities of the situation. We need to
                    know more about the background & intentions of the photographer.

     Source C
     Origins:       An official UN response to the report of the UNRWA in December 1949.

     Purpose:       To outline the future plans of the UNRWA in relation to the Palestinian refugee
                    problem.

     Value:         As it is an official document from an international organization it is objective
                    about the problems. It also outlines the future policies of the UN agency.
                    Immediacy of the source.

     Limitations:   It is narrowly focused on the issue of providing for the refugees with no
                    information regarding the wider conflict. It is a statement of future intentions.
                    There is no indication that the plans were carried out.

     Do not expect all of the above. Ideally there will be a balance between the two sources, and
     each one can be marked out of [3 marks], but allow a [4/2 marks] split. If only one source is
     assessed, mark out of [4 marks]. For a maximum of [6 marks] candidates must refer to both
     origin and purpose, and value and limitations.

4.   Using the sources and your own knowledge, analyse the importance of
     the Palestinian refugee question in the peacemaking process after the
     1948/49 war up until the 1967 conflict.                                             [8 marks]

     Source material
     Source A:    States that the Israeli government had made repatriation impossible which
                  would have an impact on peace negotiations. It also mentions the immense
                  scale of the refugee problem.

     Source B:     Gives an indication of the scale of the problem and of the temporary nature of
                   the camps indicates the hope that a solution will be found.

     Source C:     Shows how much the UN expected to spend on relief and for how long,
                   indicating that a solution would not be reached rapidly. The dates in the source
                   indicate that the UN thought the refugee problem would take several years to
                   solve.

     Source D:     Shows that armistice agreements were reached fairly quickly on the issue of
                   borders but not on the issue of refugees. Once again indicating that the issue of
                   refugees was a barrier to a full peace agreement. The source also suggests
                   likely flexibility by Israel on the question of Jerusalem’ status.

     Source E:     States that border issues were negotiable but that the issue of refugees was
                   much more difficult because of completely opposing views. Israel accepted no
                   responsibility for the problem, whereas the Arab states felt that Israel had
                   caused the problem and had some responsibility to help solve it.

     Own knowledge
     Jordan formally annexed the West Bank, clarifying borders between Jordan and Israel and
     showing that border issues were resolvable. Israel passed the Law of Return 1950, which only
     applied to Jews, indicating its refusal to consider the rights of Palestinians. No Arab state
     would sign a separate peace with Israel which did not envisage the return of the Palestinians
     to their homes. Thus the armistice remained in place and there was a technical state of war.
     The Gaza/Israeli border and the West Bank was a frequent source of Fedayeen raids into
     Israel, often for socio-economic reasons but also to attack Israeli settlers. The harsh Israeli
     response kept tensions high between Israel and her neighbours. Fatah, headed by Arafat, was
     formed in 1957 with the aim of liberating Palestine. In 1964 the PLO was set up with its
     stated aim of uniting Palestinian refugees and regaining land lost in 1948. The growth of
     Arab nationalism as a result of the Suez Crisis 1956 made the prospects for peace more
     difficult. Also the Cold War and the involvement of the super powers was a hindrance to
     peace making.

     Do not expect all the above and accept other relevant material. If only source material or own
     knowledge is used the maximum mark that can be obtained is [5 marks]. For maximum
     [8 marks] expect argument, synthesis of source material and own knowledge, as well as
     references to the sources used.
