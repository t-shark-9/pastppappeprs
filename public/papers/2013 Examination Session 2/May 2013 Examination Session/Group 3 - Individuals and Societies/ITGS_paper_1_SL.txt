Answer three questions. Each question is worth [20 marks].

1.    Bank offers online services to customers

      The traditional bank MyFastMoney is offering new online services that customers may use
      to manage their accounts. In order to be able to use these new services customers need to
      register with the bank. After registering the bank will provide customers with a username and a
      password and will give the user the URL (http://www.myfastmoney.com/index.html) for the
      bank website.

      One of the new services on offer for customers is EFT (electronic funds transfer). EFT is a
      payment method which can be used to release a payment from one account to make a deposit in
      another account.


      (a)   (i)    In the URL http://www.myfastmoney.com/index.html identify the following:
                    protocol
                    domain name.                                                                       [2]

            (ii)   The bank has added a link at the bottom of the bank web page that says
                   “Privacy policy”. Identify four statements that could be included in this policy.    [4]

      (b)   To enable EFT to take place the customer must log in to a secure environment using a
            username and password. However, many banks now use additional security measures.
            Analyse two possible additional security measures.                                          [6]

      (c)   Discuss the implications for the bank of the implementation of these new online services.   [8]

2.    Patient monitoring

      A hospital is implementing a medical IT system to monitor the vital signs of patients. Monitoring of
      vital signs, such as body temperature, can provide health care professionals with up to date information
      about a patient’s medical condition, inform of unusual situations and possibly help avoid serious
      health consequences.




                        [Source: http://sreemonitoring.com/IntellivueMP40andMP50.html, 12 September 2011]


      (a)   (i)    State two vital signs, other than body temperature, that can be monitored using
                   IT systems to inform doctors of the condition of a patient undergoing surgery.                 [2]

            (ii)   Identify the steps taken by an IT monitoring system to detect when a sign or
                   condition is abnormal and the patient requires special attention.                              [4]

      (b)   Analyse the implications for doctors when the hospital implements new patient
            monitoring equipment for health care.                                                                 [6]

      (c)   Training will be provided by the hospital for staff to use the new IT patient
            monitoring system. It was decided to use a combination of online training and practical
            hands-on training. Justify this decision.                                                             [8]

3.    Libraries and e-book loans

      Many libraries around the world are offering electronic books for loan. In some cases you need to
      check via the e-book reader web page and in others you will need to be a registered member at the
      library and sign in with a current account into the library website.




            [Source: Text: http://www.pocket-lint.com/news/26619/how-to-loan-an-ebook, 27 August 2009, by Stuart Miles.

      The loan systems are able to set the length of the loan period depending on the type of book and
      how popular it is. The e-book is downloaded to the borrower’s e-book reader. At the end of the loan
      period some libraries will allow users to check out the books again just like a regular book. When the
      loan period has expired the book will no longer be available on the user’s reading device.

      Libraries may have a limited number of licences for some e-books. Users can make a reservation for
      an e-book that is not currently available and when it is “returned” they will receive a notification and
      will be able to borrow it for the assigned period of time.

      The library lending system is based on a relational database.


      (a)    (i)    Identify the steps a new library user must follow to log in to the library and “borrow”
                    an e-book.                                                                                            [4]

             (ii)   When e-books are purchased by the library it needs to record information about
                    them in the relational database. All books require ISBN, publisher information,
                    author and title. State two pieces of additional information that a library would
                    need to record about an e-book.                                                                       [2]




                                                                        (This question continues on the following page)

(Question 3 continued)

      (b)   (i)   Some e-book readers use a proprietary file format, others use generic file formats.
                  Explain one advantage for the company who produces and sells the e-books of
                  using a proprietary format.                                                           [2]

		(ii)            Explain why a relational database has been chosen as the basis of the
                  lending system.                                                                       [4]

      (c)   A school library has introduced the loan of e-books. Discuss the impact on the students.    [8]

4.    E-waste – recycling and carbon footprint

      Abaco Publishing & Design wants to reduce its carbon footprint in two ways:
       by replacing its existing electronic equipment with more energy efficient devices
       by recycling its e-waste.

      The environmental manager at the company has requested information on the equipment they have
      at the office and is using information that Apple Inc. has published on its website.

      The following table and graph were created using spreadsheet software.
      The table lists the equipment found in the office area being evaluated (human resources).
       Cell A3 has the name of the equipment (“60 watt light bulb”).
       Cell B3 has the CO2 emission for each light bulb (“48.4”).
       Cell C3 shows the number of light bulbs in the area (“8”).
       Cell D3 calculates the total CO2 emission of the 8 light bulbs.

                            A                 B                           C                      D

5.    Blogs and social networking tools

      Using social networking tools has become extremely popular and allows people to communicate and
      share experiences.

      In the movie “Julie and Julia”, Julie decides to cook a different recipe each day and writes a blog to
      document her progress and share her experience.

                            [Source: http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1135503/synopsis, 12 September 2011]



      (a)   (i)    Define the term blog.                                                                   [2]

		          (ii)   In addition to blogs, identify two other types of social networking tools.              [2]

		(iii) Describe one way in which a social networking site can be used by family members
        living in different countries and wanting to share their daily experiences.                        [2]

      (b)   Many employers now check job applicants by viewing the information the applicants
            have posted on social networking sites. Analyse the benefits and risks of posting
            information on social networking sites.                                                        [6]

      (c)   Governments around the world have tried for years to control the internet and social
            networking sites claiming that this helps control illegal online activity. To what extent is
            this claim acceptable?                                                                         [8]
