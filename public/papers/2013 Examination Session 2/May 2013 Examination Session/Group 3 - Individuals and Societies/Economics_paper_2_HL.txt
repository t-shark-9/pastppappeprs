                                       Rising peso hits Filipinos abroad

           The Philippine peso has risen sharply against the United States (US) dollar recently, which is
            bad news for Filipinos working overseas who regularly send home a portion of their earnings
            (known as remittances) to support their families. For those working in the US and in countries
            which peg their currencies to the US dollar, the effect on their remittances is becoming
            more severe. One example is Hong Kong, where around 140 000 Filipinos work.

           Apart from a weaker US dollar, the Philippine peso has also been boosted by increased
            remittances – which hit a record US$17 billion last year – and an increase in foreign investment
            in the Philippine stock market. Its main index has risen 40 % this year, supported by global
            capital flows into Asia’s emerging markets and optimism over the new government in
            the country. The Philippine president has voiced concern over the impact of the Philippine
            peso’s sharp appreciation on overseas workers and the country’s export sector.

           Recently, the US dollar fell below 43 Philippine pesos, while 41 Philippine pesos is predicted
            by the end of 2010. A business leader said: “There is now a lot of worry over the rising peso
            among overseas Filipino workers. The Philippine peso may soon rise to a point at which it is
            no longer worthwhile for Filipinos in low-wage jobs to continue working abroad”.

           In previous times of currency instability, Filipinos tended not to reduce their remittances to
            their families, who depend on them, but absorbed the losses themselves. For that reason,
            the strong exchange rate is not expected to cause a fall in remittances, which are vital for
            the Philippine economy as they finance, among other things, spending on consumer goods
            and construction. In all, remittances account for over a tenth of the country’s gross
            national income. Officials expect remittance growth of 8 % this year, a reflection partly of
            more Filipinos working in higher-paid skilled and professional jobs abroad.

           The Philippine central bank, meanwhile, is trying to slow the currency’s advance by purchasing
            US dollars on the currency market, but this is a costly exercise for a less-developed country.
            Despite this, the Philippine peso is set to rise further.

                                India-Malaysia trade agreement to double trade by 2015

            An India-Malaysia trade agreement is expected to almost double trade between the
             two countries by 2015, allowing the two nations to reduce dependence on traditional trade
             partners such as China and the United States. The preferential trade agreement will be signed
             by 31 January 2011 and come into force six months later. The agreement is predicted to increase
             the level of trade to US$15 billion by 2015.

            The deal will further strengthen trade ties between India and Malaysia. Malaysia is India’s
             19th largest trading partner, with bilateral trade totaling US$6.5 billion between January and
             August 2010 after growing at an average of 14.9 % between 2004 and 2009. The deal will
             support a trade pact that came into effect in January 2010 between India and the 10-member
             Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN)*, which became a free trade area in 2003.
             However, this agreement between India and Malaysia will be more extensive, covering services,
             investments, trade protection and other areas.

            Malaysia exports electrical and electronic products, crude petroleum, palm oil and chemical
             goods to India, its main export destination in South Asia. However, some tariffs have been
             imposed by India on these products. India, meanwhile, has invested US$1.11 billion in
             nearly 100 manufacturing projects in Malaysia. Malaysia and India will also bolster defence
             cooperation through frequent talks between their defence ministers, senior officials and chiefs
             of the armed services, according to a joint statement.

                                   China: Money to invest for a better future

           In 2005, Madam Xiao Jinqiu was barely making enough to feed her two sons. Now she earns a
            living by weaving traditional fabrics, bags and scarves for sale and rearing livestock – all with
            the help of an annual micro-loan given out by a local non-profit group.

           By borrowing between 1000 yuan and 3000 yuan (US$152 and US$456 respectively) a year,
            she has been able to earn enough to invest in a better life for her family. She is among a growing
            number of poor villagers in China who have found a lifeline in micro-credit, which allows
            families the opportunity to escape from the poverty trap. Such schemes have existed in China
            for some years, but the number of borrowers remains low.

           China’s state banks are now trying to offer its 720 million rural residents more access to
            micro-credit, but two key barriers still stand in the way. Many remote areas remain inaccessible
            to banks and farmers often do not have belongings or assets that can be used as security for
            the loans. Almost 3000 rural townships in China – around 9 % of the country’s total – do not
            have a bank. This is where private banks and non-profit groups can make a difference.

           Almost half of the 170 000 population of Yunnan Province lives under China’s poverty line
            of 1196 yuan per capita annually. Almost 36 million of China’s rural residents, or 3.6 %
            of the population in the countryside, were living below the poverty line at the end of 2009,
            according to official data.

           Micro-credit is still rare in China, but it is a very effective way to reduce poverty. The key is to
            find a way to establish trust between lender and farmer. China’s farmers do not own the land
            they cultivate. They have only land-use rights, which means that they cannot use the land they
            farm as security for a loan.

           One solution to this problem is to group several farming families together and make them
            co-guarantors of one another’s loans, spreading the risk. An official from one lending
            organization, which lends only to married women, said: “Women are less likely to default.
            They take charge of household finances. They have self-respect”.

                        Cambodia encouraged to review international partnerships

           The United States (US) Secretary of State has urged Cambodians to pursue a variety of
            economic partnerships throughout Asia-Pacific and not become over-reliant on China.
            She said that Cambodia should look for partnerships that cut across regional geographic lines.

           Both China and the US are working to extend their influence in Cambodia. Nearly 400 Chinese
            companies have invested billions of dollars in Cambodia, including key infrastructure
            projects such as hydropower dams and coal-power plants. While acknowledging the
            attraction of Chinese investment, the Secretary of State said: “One of the challenges for
            Cambodia is the construction of dams on the Upper Mekong river”. China has been criticised
            by environmental groups over the building of a series of hydropower projects on the
            Mekong river. Concerns over the project include a possible loss of water quality and a loss
            of biodiversity.

           The Secretary of State also indicated that the US was willing to cooperate with Cambodia to
            resolve an outstanding debt of about US$445 million that the country owes to the US.

           The Cambodian Foreign Minister had asked the Secretary of State at a meeting to help
            his country convert the debt into development aid. She said she was ready to explore
            creative ways Cambodia could be relieved of the debt, possibly by agreeing to preserve key
            environmental areas or investing in education. In this way, the debt repayment would be treated
            as development aid.
