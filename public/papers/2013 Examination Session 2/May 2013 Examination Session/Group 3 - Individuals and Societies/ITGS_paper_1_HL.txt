                                                          SECTION A

Answer two questions. Each question is worth [20 marks].

1.      Libraries and e-book loans

        Many libraries around the world are offering electronic books for loan. In some cases you need to
        check via the e-book reader web page and in others you will need to be a registered member at the
        library and sign in with a current account into the library website.

        The loan systems are able to set the length of the loan period depending on the type of book and
        how popular it is. The e-book is downloaded to the borrower’s e-book reader. At the end of the loan
        period some libraries will allow users to check out the books again just like a regular book. When the
        loan period has expired the book will no longer be available on the user’s reading device.

        Libraries may have a limited number of licences for some e-books. Users can make a reservation for
        an e-book that is not currently available and when it is “returned” they will receive a notification and
        will be able to borrow it for the assigned period of time.

        The library lending system is based on a relational database.


        (a)    (i)    Identify the steps a new library user must follow to log in to the library and “borrow”
                      an e-book.                                                                                                    [4]

               (ii)   When e-books are purchased by the library it needs to record information about
                      them in the relational database. All books require ISBN, publisher information,
                      author and title. State two pieces of additional information that a library would
                      need to record about an e-book.                                                                               [2]

                                                                         (This question continues on the following page)

(Question 1 continued)

      (b)   (i)   Some e-book readers use a proprietary file format, others use generic file formats.
                  Explain one advantage for the company who produces and sells the e-books of
                  using a proprietary format.                                                           [2]

		(ii)            Explain why a relational database has been chosen as the basis of the
                  lending system.                                                                       [4]

      (c)   A school library has introduced the loan of e-books. Discuss the impact on the students.    [8]

2.    E-waste – recycling and carbon footprint

      Abaco Publishing & Design wants to reduce its carbon footprint in two ways:
       by replacing its existing electronic equipment with more energy efficient devices
       by recycling its e-waste.

      The environmental manager at the company has requested information on the equipment they have
      at the office and is using information that Apple Inc. has published on its website.

      The following table and graph were created using spreadsheet software.
      The table lists the equipment found in the office area being evaluated (human resources).
       Cell A3 has the name of the equipment (“60 watt light bulb”).
       Cell B3 has the CO2 emission for each light bulb (“48.4”).
       Cell C3 shows the number of light bulbs in the area (“8”).
       Cell D3 calculates the total CO2 emission of the 8 light bulbs.

                            A                 B                           C                      D

3.    Patient monitoring

      A hospital is implementing a medical IT system to monitor the vital signs of patients. Monitoring of
      vital signs, such as body temperature, can provide health care professionals with up to date information
      about a patient’s medical condition, inform of unusual situations and possibly help avoid serious
      health consequences.




                        [Source: http://sreemonitoring.com/IntellivueMP40andMP50.html, 12 September 2011]


      (a)   (i)    State two vital signs, other than body temperature, that can be monitored using
                   IT systems to inform doctors of the condition of a patient undergoing surgery.           [2]

            (ii)   Identify the steps taken by an IT monitoring system to detect when a sign or
                   condition is abnormal and the patient requires special attention.                        [4]

      (b)   Analyse the implications for doctors when the hospital implements new patient
            monitoring equipment for health care.                                                           [6]

      (c)   Training will be provided by the hospital for staff to use the new IT patient
            monitoring system. It was decided to use a combination of online training and practical
            hands-on training. Justify this decision.                                                       [8]

4.     Information systems management

       Queen Bee Global Enterprises Inc. has grown rapidly over the last 5 years.

       Currently each department has complete independence in the way that they manage their respective
       IT requirements. Some departments have bought commercial packages and adapted them to suit their
       needs, while others developed applications using widely available office software. This has led to a
       range of problems.

       The information systems manager has recently recommended that new centralized IT systems should
       be implemented in order to reduce costs, improve efficiency and facilitate maintenance.

       At the moment, the information systems manager is not part of the senior management team that
       makes the decisions about implementing IT systems. His department is expected to grow significantly
       over the next two years.

       The senior management team is considering the possibility of making the information systems
       manager a member of the team.




                                                                         Chairman

(Question 4 continued)

      (a)   (i)   Identify three responsibilities of a typical information systems manager.           [3]

		(ii)            State the job titles of three of the specialist staff who typically report to an
                  information systems manager.                                                        [3]

      (b)   In the past, Queen Bee Enterprises Inc. valued staff who showed initiative.
            However, this led to the development of independent IT systems by different departments
            in the company.

            Explain the problems that may arise when departments are given freedom to develop
            independent IT systems.                                                                   [6]

      (c)   The senior management team of Queen Bee Enterprises Inc. has decided to include the
            information systems manager in the team.

            To what extent is it an advantage to have an information systems manager as part of the
            senior management team?                                                                   [8]

5.    IT system development

      A company has ordered a new IT system from a software development company. During the initial
      investigations and consultations, the developers produce prototypes of the proposed system which
      demonstrate the user interfaces that will be produced for the system.

      Once agreement has been reached, a project plan is developed.


      (a)   (i)       With reference to systems development, define the term prototype.                               [2]

            (ii)      Describe two essential components of any project plan.                                          [4]

      (b)   The design of user-friendly interfaces is a major part of any new system development
            project. Below are examples of two different types of interface.

            Contrast the usability of the two interfaces shown here.                                                  [6]

      (c)   With reference to examples you have studied, to what extent does the successful
            implementation of a new IT system depend on regular consultation between

6.    Speech to text software

      Many television programmes are supplied with subtitles to help viewers who have hearing problems.
      If the programme is being broadcast live, such as in a news interview, speech recognition software
      is often used to produce the subtitles as quickly as possible. This usually involves a process called
      re-speaking, in which an operator repeats the words said by those being interviewed and speech to
      text software generates the subtitles.

      The software and the speaker both have to be trained in order to get the most accurate results.
      Even so, mistakes often occur. “Recognize speech” can easily be represented as “wreck a nice peach”.

      (a)     Identify six steps that speech recognition systems must go through in converting speech
              into text.                                                                                                 [6]

      (b)     Explain why subtitling software works better when re-speaking is used rather than using
              the original voices of the people being interviewed.                                                       [6]

      (c)     To what extent will the use of speech to text software be a feature of future
              IT systems?                                                                                                [8]

7.    Robotic vacuum cleaners

      A robotic vacuum cleaner is advertised as having:
       Visionary Mapping technology
       38 intelligent sensors
       auto recharge and resume cleaning
       6 cleaning modes – auto, max, manual, spot, edge, delay, daily schedule
       90 minutes running time, 120 minutes charging time.

      (a)   (i)   Identify three sensors that would be useful on a robotic vacuum cleaner.              [3]

		(ii)            Identify three output devices that would be useful on a robotic vacuum cleaner.       [3]

      (b)   Explain how expert systems can be used to help the manufacturer develop the next
            generation of robotic vacuum cleaners.                                                      [6]

      (c)   Considerable research is taking place into the development of humanoid/android robots
            to carry out a range of tasks that are currently carried out by humans.

            To what extent is the future of robotics likely to be more about single purpose devices
            such as a vacuum cleaner rather than humanoid/android robots?                               [8]
