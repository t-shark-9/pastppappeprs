Please start each question on a new page. Full marks are not necessarily awarded for a correct answer
with no working. Answers must be supported by working and/or explanations. In particular, solutions
found from a graphic display calculator should be supported by suitable working. For example, if graphs
are used to find a solution, you should sketch these as part of your answer. Where an answer is incorrect,
some marks may be given for a correct method, provided this is shown by written working. You are therefore
advised to show all working.

      variance σ 2 . A random sample of 20 observations on X gave the following results.

      A hockey team played 60 matches last season. The manager believes that the number
      of goals scored by the team in a match could be modelled by a Poisson distribution and
      he produces the following table based on the season’s results.

      (a)   State suitable hypotheses to test the manager’s belief.                                [1 mark]

      (b)   The manager decides to carry out an appropriate χ 2 goodness of fit test.

            (i)    Construct a table of appropriate expected frequencies correct to four
                   decimal places.

            (ii)   Determine the value of χ 2 calc and the corresponding p -value.

            (iii) State whether or not your analysis supports the manager’s belief.               [11 marks]

      The number of machine breakdowns occurring in a day in a certain factory may be
      assumed to follow a Poisson distribution with mean µ . The value of µ is known, from
      past experience, to be 1.2. In an attempt to reduce the value of µ , all the machines are
      fitted with new control units.  To investigate whether or not this reduces the value of
       µ , the total number of breakdowns, x , occurring during a 30-day period following the
      installation of these new units is recorded.

      (a)   State suitable hypotheses for this investigation.                                      [1 mark]

      (b)   It is decided to define the critical region by x ≤ 25.

            (i)    Calculate the significance level.

            (ii)   Assuming that the value of µ was actually reduced to 0.75, determine the
                   probability of a Type II error.                                                [8 marks]
