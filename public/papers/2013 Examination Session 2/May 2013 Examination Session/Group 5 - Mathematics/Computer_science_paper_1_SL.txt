Answer all the questions.

12.   A LAN in a health centre allows two receptionists and four doctors to share three
      PCs and a printer which are connected to a server.   The LAN has a star topology,
      and uses cables.

      (a)   (i)    Define the term server.                                                       [1 mark]

      (b)   Outline the role of a hub in a star topology.                                        [2 marks]

      The doctors can access only the medical records of the patients; the receptionists
      cannot access the medical records of the patients and deal only with registering new
      patients and booking appointments.

      (c)   (i)    Describe how the access of the doctors and the receptionists can be
                   restricted to the appropriate parts of the file system.                       [2 marks]

            It is proposed to allow patients partial access to the health centre’s system over
            the internet.

            (ii)   Explain the type and level of access that should be granted to the patients
                   and how this would be achieved.                                               [4 marks]

13.   Consider the following method.

      public boolean property(String s)
      {
        int len=s.length();
        int m;
        if (len%2 != 0)
        {m=len/2 + 1 ;}
        else {m=len/2;}
        int i=0;
        int j=m;
        while (i<m && j<len)
        {
          if (s.charAt(i) != s.charAt(j))
          {return false;}
          i=i+1;
          j=j+1;
        }
        return true;
      }

      (a)   State the value of m when the string s is “abcdefg”.                            [1 mark]

      (b)   By copying and completing the following table, trace the method for the call
            property (“xyzdxyx”).                                                          [4 marks]

              i      j      i<m && j<len        s.charAt(i)!= s.charAt(j)         return
              0      …             …                                                 …

      (d)   Identify the termination conditions for the loop.                              [2 marks]

      (e)   Explain how the use of the return statement affects the efficiency of the
            method property().                                                             [2 marks]
