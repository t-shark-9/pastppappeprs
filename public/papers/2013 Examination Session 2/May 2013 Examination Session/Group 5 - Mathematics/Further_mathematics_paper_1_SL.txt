Full marks are not necessarily awarded for a correct answer with no working. Answers must be supported
by working and/or explanations. In particular, solutions found from a graphic display calculator should be
supported by suitable working, for example, if graphs are used to find a solution, you should sketch these
as part of your answer. Where an answer is incorrect, some marks may be given for a correct method,
provided this is shown by written working. You are therefore advised to show all working.
