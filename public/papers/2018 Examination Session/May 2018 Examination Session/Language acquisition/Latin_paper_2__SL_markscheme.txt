            (concessitque ei paterna bona) [1] because he was not motivated by money (satis firmus …
            adversum pecuniam) [1] and he didn’t uphold the demand for ignominia (M. Pisonem
            ignominiae exemit) [1] because the acquittal of Plancina had shamed him/made him lenient

            Claudii (ie who these families are and why it’s significant that they are both included) [1].

     (d)    Germanicus’s body was cremated abroad (corpus … externis terris crematum) [1]; the funeral
            rites should have been more elaborate (plura decora … par fuisse) [1] because they were not

     (b)    Literally, it means “burned,” “toasted,” “toasty,” “torrid” or “hot regions” [1]; poetically, it

            love [1].

            entered Syria (at the same time); award [1] up to [2] for literary explanations such as: the
            places represent far flung regions of the world; using the dangers of distant travel this is a
            common trope of love poetry; the plurals are used to exemplify the characteristics of named
            places (eg wealth) rather than identify specific locations; the desire to have otium instead of
            military honours (Britanniasque) or wealth (Syrias).

     (d)    Award [1] each up to [2] for figures of speech supported by a quote such as:

            • Chiasmus: unam Septimius misellus Acmen
            • Metonymy: Veneris for love
            Do not accept: direct speech; descriptions of imagery.

     (e)    Award [1] each up to [2] for any relevant point of discussion and [1] up to [2] for a credible
            effect, such as:
            • hyperbole accentuates the male lover’s desire (lines 3–7)
            • convivial situation/Greek name emphasizes the uncertain social status of the woman
               (lines 1–2)
            • divine auspices emphasise that love is (ambiguously) propitious (lines 17–19)
            • focus on the physical effect of love shows its severity (lines 15–16).

            Line numbers are given for examiner reference only.
