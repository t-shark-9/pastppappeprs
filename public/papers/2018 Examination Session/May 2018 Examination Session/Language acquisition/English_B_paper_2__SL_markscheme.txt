Criterion A: Language

• How effectively and accurately does the student use language?

  Marks    Level descriptor
    0      The work does not reach a standard described by the descriptors below.
           Command of the language is generally inadequate.
   1–2     A very limited range of vocabulary is used, with many basic errors.
           Simple sentence structures are rarely clear.
           Command of the language is limited and generally ineffective.
   3–4     A limited range of vocabulary is used, with many basic errors.
           Simple sentence structures are sometimes clear.
           Command of the language is generally adequate, despite many inaccuracies.
   5–6     A fairly limited range of vocabulary is used, with many errors.
           Simple sentence structures are usually clear.
           Command of the language is effective, despite some inaccuracies.
   7–8     A range of vocabulary is used accurately, with some errors.
           Simple sentence structures are clear.
           Command of the language is good and effective.
   9–10    A wide range of vocabulary is used accurately, with few significant errors.
           Some complex sentence structures are clear and effective.


Clarification

Word count
At SL, students are required to write a minimum of 250 words. Failure to write the minimum
number of words will result in a [1 mark] penalty under criterion A. The whole text should be taken
into consideration in the award of marks.

Language
Not all errors have the same importance, and examiners should bear this in mind. Some errors
affect the communication of meaning significantly, and others do not. Also, some errors indicate a
fundamental lack of command of the language, while others may simply indicate a moment of
forgetfulness.

SLIPS – mistakes at all levels of difficulty, but erratic and occasional – eg the candidate normally
forms past tenses well, but occasionally forgets “-ed”.

FLAWS – errors occur more regularly, particularly in certain structures – eg past tenses are formed
correctly quite often, but are not really reliable, and there may be basic confusions (eg past simple
versus present perfect).

GAPS – some structures are rarely correct, or simply don’t appear – eg the past tenses are
needed, but do not appear.

A good answer will have few language gaps, and slips or flaws rarely affect meaning.

Criterion B: Message

• How clearly can the student develop and organize relevant ideas?

  Marks   Level descriptor
    0     The work does not reach a standard described by the descriptors below.
          The message has not been communicated.
          The ideas are irrelevant and/or repetitive.
   1–2
          The development of ideas is unclear; supporting details are very limited and/or not
          appropriate.
          The message has barely been communicated.
          The ideas are sometimes irrelevant and/or repetitive.
   3–4
          The development of ideas is confusing; supporting details are limited and/or not
          appropriate.
          The message has been partially communicated.
          The ideas are relevant to some extent.
   5–6
          The development of ideas is evident at times; supporting details are sometimes
          appropriate.
          The message has been communicated fairly well.
   7–8    The ideas are mostly relevant.
          The development of ideas is coherent; supporting details are mostly appropriate.
          The message has been communicated well.
   9–10   The ideas are relevant.
          The development of ideas is coherent and effective; supporting details are appropriate.


 NOTE:
 1. When marking candidate responses, keep in mind that neither the accuracy of the
    information presented, nor the validity of the candidates’ personal opinions, are being
    assessed. Therefore, scripts that are factually inaccurate should not be marked down,
    provided they meet the requirements of the task, and the ideas are sufficiently developed.

 2. The term “cover” in the following notes (in “covers only on part…”, “covers both parts…’ etc.)
    should be interpreted as “in more than two sentences”.

Criterion C: Format

• How correctly does the student produce the required text type?
• To what extent are the conventions of text types appropriate?

  Marks    Level descriptor
    0      The work does not reach a standard described by the descriptors below.
           The text type is not recognizable.
     1
           Conventions appropriate to the text type are not used.
           The text type is hardly recognizable or is not appropriate.
     2
           Conventions appropriate to the text type are very limited.
     3     The text type is sometimes recognizable and appropriate.
           Conventions appropriate to the text type are limited.
           The text type is generally recognizable and appropriate.
     4
           Conventions appropriate to the text type are evident.
           The text type is clearly recognizable and appropriate.
     5
           Conventions appropriate to the text type are effective and evident.

To gain maximum marks [5], all of the bulleted conventions must be applied.
To gain [3], more than half of the conventions must be applied.

Note: Examiners are reminded that Criterion C bullet points are marking notes, not mark schemes.
Therefore, where one or more bullet points are only partially fulfilled (eg appropriate register
generally used but not consistently, there is an opening salutation but no closing salutation etc),
some credit/recognition may still be given. In such cases, examiners should consider the work
holistically and use their professional judgements, with reference to the criteria, to arrive at the
final marks.

Expected conventions of the text type are as follows:

Question 1: Diary entry
• will adopt a generally informal register in a consistent manner
• will have a date and/or day
• will use first person narration
• will have a closing statement to round off the entry
• will not use self-evident explanatory phrases or sentences, eg will use “I saw Alicia”, not “I saw
  Alicia, my best friend”.

N.B.: The diary may begin “Dear Diary”, but this is not expected. Multiple entries may be produced.

Question 2: Blog entry
• will adopt a semi-formal register with some flashes of informality
• will have an engaging title for the entry itself – ie not just a general name for the blog overall
• will include first person statement and/or narration
• will show awareness of the reader, eg through direct address, a lively and interesting style, etc
• will have a closing statement, eg invitation to comment, a conclusion drawn, etc.

Question 3: Article
• will adopt a consistently semi-formal register
• will have a suitably serious tone
• will show awareness of the target teenage audience, eg through language that indicates a
  direct address (you)
• will have a relevant headline/title
• will have an engaging and distinct introduction, development and conclusion.

Question 4: Essay
• will adopt a semi-formal to formal register
• will adopt a suitably serious tone
• will use techniques that enable the reader to follow the arguments easily, eg methodical
  approach
• will have a relevant title
• will have a distinct introduction and conclusion.

Question 5: Report
• will adopt a semi-formal to formal register
• will have a relevant title
• will use a neutral/objective style, eg presents ideas and facts without embellishment
• will have a clearly structured layout through sub-headings, short brief paragraphs/sections, etc
• will have a conclusion or recommendation.

N.B.: It is acceptable for the report to be presented within the framework of a letter/ email, provided
the features above are present. The handling of such a ‘framework’ should not affect the mark.
