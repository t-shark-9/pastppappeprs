                    Ski accident at Mount Ruapehu
                           Mountaineers help skier cri�cally injured on Mount Ruapehu

         A skier from Wellington, New Zealand, was seriously injured a�er an accident on Mount Ruapehu.
         Mountaineer Peter Hillary, who was on a chairli� with two colleagues, Paul McAlister and
         Linsey Churton, saw the accident. They rushed to help the injured skier.

 5       Peter Hillary and his colleagues were on the chairli� at
         Mount Ruapehu on Tuesday when Thomas Dobrisek crashed into
         a rock. They had just enjoyed several runs on nice snow in sunny
         condi�ons when the accident happened. They watched from the
         chairli� as Dobrisek hit a rock, fell out of control for 20 metres and
10       landed in snow.

         Paul McAlister saw Dobrisek coming down a trail for advanced skiers.

         McAlister told us: “He was coming at a reasonable speed and he hit a rock. He probably travelled
         15 to 20 metres over rocks and then he didn’t get up. We kept watching to see if this man would
         stand up. He didn’t, so we made a plan. Peter Hillary and I decided to ski down to help the man
15       and Linsey went to inform the ski patrol.”

         “We skied down as fast as we could. When I reached the man, his head was down in the snow.
         He was unconscious and not breathing. We put him in the recovery posi�on and he started
         breathing. When the ski patroller arrived, we all helped to get him into a sled.”

         The injured man was given oxygen, taken down to
20       the medical centre at the base of the mountain and
         then airli�ed to hospital at about midday on Tuesday.
         He remained in intensive care last night. The police
         have no�ﬁed his rela�ves.                                         Mount Ruapehu

         Peter Hillary said: “We did what we could and we hope
25       he will recover. It was very alarming to be there and
         ﬁnd him in the condi�on he was in. Fortunately, he
         was wearing a helmet.”

         He also said that the accident showed the dangers
         of skiing in the spring when the snow starts to melt,
30       par�cularly around rocks. There have been several
         fatal injuries in ski areas in the last couple of years
         in this season.
                                                                                       New Zealand

                      Could you help someone to get online?
             [–X–]

         Incredibly, one in ﬁve adults in Wales are not online. In some places, that number is as high
         as one in three. People are being held back in life because no-one has shown them how to
         use the internet.
 5       That’s why we need helpful people like you. If you know how to
         use email and the internet, you could start an exciting new role as
         a digital volunteer, working with people who don’t have your skills.

             [–8–]

         If you know the basics of information technology and get a little support from
10       Digital Communities Wales about volunteering, you are ready.

             [–9–]

         19 % of adults in Wales cannot use the internet. That’s nearly one in ﬁve adults who
         can’t look for jobs, shop online, send emails, use social media, or Skype with friends.
         As a digital volunteer you’ll help people communicate with friends and family, shop,
15       send emails and apply for jobs. With your help we can change people’s lives.

             [ – 10 – ]

         You’ll have the opportunity to…
           • get useful transferable skills that can help you ﬁnd work
           • get free training in oﬀering support
20         • give something back to the community.

             [ – 11 – ]
             Give as much or as little time as you want.
             Volunteer when it suits you.
             We’ll make it easy for you: we will match you with a library, housing association or
25            community centre where your help is needed.

             Change people’s lives
         To take the ﬁrst step towards changing the lives of people in your community, email
         digitalvolunteering@wales.coop. Alternatively, sign up online.

             What one volunteer says
30       “I signed up to the Digital Communities Wales volunteering programme because I wanted to
         make a real diﬀerence to the people most at risk in my local community. Internet shopping
         or using social media or applying for a new job online are second nature to me, but I know
         that for many people it can be a frightening experience.”

               An interview with Miss Environment Kenya
         It is 5.15 pm and, as journalist for the Kenyadventure blog, I am sitting in a café waiting for
         19-year-old Moraa Ondieki, a second-year student of energy and environmental technology
         at Mount Kenya University. She was chosen as Miss Environment Kenya in a contest held
         on 5 June, World Environment Day. The contestants modelled recycled clothes that they
 5       had created themselves and answered five questions on environmental issues.

         Kenyadventure (KA):      Moraa, what was the first question you were asked and
                                  how did you respond?

         Moraa Ondieki (MO): I was asked “What do you do personally in order not to waste
                             things?” I answered that I normally recycle, especially used
10                           clothes and jewellery. I described what I had created from
                             these materials.

         KA:     What do you think is special about the Miss Environment Kenya contest?

         MO: Obviously, the environment is really important to us. For example, we are
             recommending a stove* that uses 50 % less firewood. This helps to reduce firewood
15           consumption and greenhouse gas emissions in rural areas. We are also organising
             anti-poaching campaigns to protect the animals. Probably our best established
             project is the one that encourages students to plant trees and take responsibility
             for them.

         KA:     Do you have any other suggestions about how Kenya could face
20               its environmental challenges?

         MO: It is important to inform people about them. For example, businesses are telling
             us to throw away plastic bags and use new ones, just so they can produce more
             and make more profits. So, we must inform people and change their behaviour.

         KA:     How has your life changed since you became Miss Environment Kenya?

25       MO: It has changed so much! [ – X – ] I have learned to interact with people in the
             environmental field, in the government and in other institutions. Before the contest,
             talking to them would have been a really big challenge [ – 28 – ] I did not feel
             confident enough. I have improved my public speaking skills. I was able to
             travel and bring back home some of the things that I learned outside the country.
30           I [ – 29 – ] made a lot of new friends. [ – 30 – ], on the personal side, I have
             really had to learn how to manage my time well.

         KA:     Thank you for the interview!

    Meet the young chefs responsible for these
     healthy, globally inspired lunch recipes
     Part 1        The Healthy Lunchtime Challenge
  Do you need some creative cooking inspiration or a few new healthy lunch recipes? Some talented
  young chefs have an answer for you.

  They took part in a recipe challenge for US students whose goal was to encourage cooking and
  healthy eating. The Healthy Lunchtime Challenge selected winners for original, globally inspired
  recipes that include fruits, vegetables, whole grains, lean protein and low-fat dairy. 56 young chefs
  were chosen to represent all 50 US states, ﬁve US territories and Washington, DC.

  The recipes will eventually be published together as a free e-book. We have a preview of two of
  the recipes that are globally inspired.

  Two young chefs whose recipes reﬂect their international heritage tell us about their dishes.



                                  Part 2       Tropical Vacation

     Removed               “I was inspired to make this dish because my parents are from the
   for copyright           southern Indian state of Kerala and one of my favourite beaches is there,”
      reasons       says Chef Abhijith. “I wanted to keep the recipe healthy and simple, so I chose
                    quinoa, something my mom likes, especially as she has a weak heart. I used
                    mangoes, pineapple and home-grown papaya to make it tropical. Lastly, I used
                    ﬁsh, because you don’t always have to be at the beach to feel like you’re there!”



     Part 3        Peace in the Middle East Soup and Salad
  “I think war causes too much suﬀering in the world. One problem I see is
  that people often focus on their diﬀerences, rather than similarities,” says
  Chef Pablo. “In the Middle East there have been wars for a long time because            Removed
  people often concentrate on diﬀerences. I wanted to create a dish that takes          for copyright
  parts of diﬀerent cultures in the Middle East and shows how they can come                reasons
  together to make a delicious and healthy lunch. My dish highlights things that
  diﬀerent regions in the Middle East have in common, and shows that, in the end,
  everyone is more alike than diﬀerent.”
