Apply the markbands that provide the “best fit” to the responses given and award credit wherever it is
possible to do so. If an answer indicates that the demands of the question are understood and
addressed but that not all implications are considered (for example, compare or contrast; reasons
or significance; methods or success), then examiners should not be afraid of using the full range of
marks allowed for by the markscheme. Responses that offer good coverage of some of the criteria
should be rewarded accordingly. If you are uncertain about the content/accuracy of a candidate’s
work please contact your team leader.

 Marks     Level descriptor
 13–15     • Responses are clearly focused, showing a high degree of awareness of the demands
              and implications of the question. Answers are well structured, balanced and effectively
              organized.
           • Knowledge is detailed, accurate and relevant. Events are placed in their historical
              context, and there is a clear understanding of historical concepts.
           • Examples used are appropriate and relevant, and are used effectively to support the
              analysis/evaluation.
           • Arguments are clear and coherent. There is evaluation of different perspectives, and this
              evaluation is integrated effectively into the answer.
           • The answer contains well-developed critical analysis. All, or nearly all, of the main points
              are substantiated, and the response argues to a reasoned conclusion.
 10–12     • The demands of the question are understood and addressed. Answers are generally well
              structured and organized, although there may be some repetition or lack of clarity in
              places.
           • Knowledge is accurate and relevant. Events are placed in their historical context, and
              there is a clear understanding of historical concepts. Examples used are appropriate and
              relevant, and are used to support the analysis/evaluation.
           • Arguments are mainly clear and coherent. There is some awareness and evaluation of
              different perspectives.
           • The response contains critical analysis. Most of the main points are substantiated, and
              the response argues to a consistent conclusion.
  7–9      • The response indicates an understanding of the demands of the question, but these
              demands are only partially addressed. There is an attempt to follow a structured
              approach.
           • Knowledge is mostly accurate and relevant. Events are generally placed in their historical
              context. Examples used are appropriate and relevant.
           • The response moves beyond description to include some analysis or critical
              commentary, but this is not sustained.
  4–6      • The response indicates some understanding of the demands of the question. While there
              may be an attempt to follow a structured approach, the response lacks clarity and
              coherence.
           • Knowledge is demonstrated but lacks accuracy and relevance. There is a superficial
              understanding of historical context. The answer makes use of specific examples,
              although these may be vague or lack relevance.
           • There is some limited analysis, but the response is primarily narrative/descriptive in
              nature, rather than analytical.
                                            –6–                 M18/3/HISTX/HP3/ENG/TZ0/OC/M


1–3   • There is little understanding of the demands of the question. The response is poorly
        structured or, where there is a recognizable essay structure, there is minimal focus on
        the task.
      • Little knowledge is present. Where specific examples are referred to, they are factually
        incorrect, irrelevant or vague.
      • The response contains little or no critical analysis. It may consist mostly of
        generalizations and poorly substantiated assertions.
0     • Response does not reach a standard described by the descriptors above.

Section 1: Trade and exchange: the Silk Road in the medieval world (750–1500)

1.   Evaluate the influence of the Tang dynasty on the operation of the Silk Road.

     Candidates will make an appraisal of the influence of the Tang dynasty on the operation of the Silk
     Road by weighing up the strengths and limitations of Tang policies with regard to the route. They
     may adopt a chronological approach, outlining the operation of the Silk Road at the beginning,
     during and at the end of the Tang dynasty and address the ways in which the extent of its influence
     could be linked to fluctuations in its power. Alternately, candidates may choose a thematic
     approach and evaluate the Tang dynasty’s influence on areas such as trade, travel and cultural
     exchange. Both the strengths and limitations must be clearly indicated but there does not need to
     be an equal focus on each. While candidates may also refer to other (non-Tang) influences that
     affected the operation of the Silk Road, the bulk of the response must be on the role of the Tang
     dynasty.


2.   “The city of Samarkand was economically and culturally significant, but had little political
     importance.” Discuss.

     Candidates will offer a considered and balanced review of the statement that “the city of
     Samarkand was economically and culturally significant, but had little political importance”.
     Candidates may offer equal coverage of economic and cultural factors, or they may prioritize their
     discussion of one, but both will be a feature in relation to Samarkand’s political importance. They
     may refer to the role of Tamerlane, the influence of the Silk Road, trade, religious diversity,
     intellectual exchanges, architecture, arts and crafts and tribal rivalries. These need not all be
     covered or covered equally. While other, relevant, factors may be referred to, the bulk of the
     response will remain on the issue raised in the question. Candidates may agree, partly agree or
     disagree with the statement.
                                                 –8–                 M18/3/HISTX/HP3/ENG/TZ0/OC/M


Section 2: Japan in the age of the samurai (1180–1333)

3.   “The struggles between samurai clans were mainly motivated by economic factors.” Discuss.

     Candidates will offer a considered and balanced review of the statement that “the struggles
     between samurai clans were primarily motivated by economic factors”. They may adopt a
     chronological approach that outlines the significant events of the Kamakura period and which
     discusses the importance of economic factors relative to the other causes of conflict between
     samurai clans in this timeframe. Alternatively, candidates may choose a thematic approach and
     may refer to aspects such as the ascendency of different clans, the relationship between emperor
     and shogun, the changing nature of political elites, the geography of Japan, the ownership of land
     and the feudal system. These need not all be covered or covered equally. While other, relevant,
     factors such as political and cultural aspects may be referred to, the bulk of the response will
     remain on the issue raised in the question. Candidates may agree, partly agree or disagree with
     the statement.


4.   Evaluate the influence of Buddhism on samurai culture.

     Candidates will make an appraisal of the influence of Buddhism on samurai culture by weighing up
     its importance or otherwise. Reasons may predate the timeframe and candidates may refer to
     events that contextualize the development of samurai culture during the Kamakura Shogunate, but
     they must be clearly linked to the importance and limitations of Buddhism’s influence. Alternately,
     candidates may choose a thematic approach and evaluate Buddhism’s influence on aspects of
     samurai culture such as discipline and control, characteristics of a warrior class, literature,
     ceremonies, mediation and atoning for one’s sins. Both the importance and limitations must be
     clearly indicated but there does not need to be an equal focus on each. While other, relevant,
     factors such as political developments, the conflict between samurai clans and external threats
     may be referred to, the bulk of the response will remain on the issue raised in the question.
                                                 –9–                M18/3/HISTX/HP3/ENG/TZ0/OC/M


Section 3: Exploration, trade and interaction in East Asia and South-East Asia (1405–1700)

5.   With reference to the period up to 1700, discuss the reasons why Japan decided to establish trade
     links with the West and the consequences of that decision for Japan.

     Candidates will offer a considered and balanced review of the reasons why Japan decided to
     establish trade links with the West and the consequences of that decision for Japan. They may
     adopt a chronological approach that identifies that the reasons why Japan opened up to the West
     largely occurred in the 16th century, but the consequences of this extended into the 17th until
     foreign contact was virtually banned. Alternatively, candidates may choose a thematic approach
     and may refer to aspects such as Japan’s desire to acquire Western knowledge, trade and wealth,
     political rivalries, missionaries and national security. These need not all be covered or covered
     equally. There may be some imbalance between reasons and consequences, but candidates will
     consider both aspects. While other, relevant, factors such as European trade rivalries may be
     referred to, the bulk of the response will remain on the issue raised in the question.


6.   “Chinese isolationism in the 16th century damaged its economic and political development.”
     Discuss.

     Candidates will offer a considered and balanced review of the statement that “Chinese isolationism
     in the 16th century damaged its economic and political development”. They may offer equal
     coverage of economic development and political development, or they may prioritize their
     discussion of one, but both will be a feature in relation to Chinese isolationism. Candidates may
     adopt a chronological approach that identifies that the events and reasons for Chinese isolationism
     and its impact on Chinese economic and political development. Alternatively, candidates may
     choose a thematic approach and may refer to aspects such as China’s xenophobia, Confucian
     philosophy, the stagnation in the development of new ideas and technology, military weakness,
     threats of invasion overland, the Qing dynasty, and internal wealth and trade. These need not all
     be covered or covered equally. While other, relevant, factors such as external pressures may be
     referred to, the bulk of the response will remain on the issue raised in the question. Candidates
     may agree, partly agree or disagree with the statement.

Section 4: The rise and fall of the Mughal Empire (1526–1712)

7.   Evaluate the religious and cultural developments that took place in the Mughal Empire during the
     reign of Akbar.

     Candidates will make an appraisal of the religious and cultural developments that took place during
     the reign of Akbar by weighing up the strengths and limitations of each. They may refer to the
     Mughal Empire prior to Akbar’s rule in 1556 to contextualise the changes during his reign.
     Candidates may choose to focus on religious developments and cultural developments separately,
     but these need not be covered equally. Alternatively, they may address the question thematically
     and refer to aspects such as religious tolerance, taxation practices, appointments to civil and
     military positions, the abolition of some religious practices, the encouragement of the arts,
     literature, architecture, and technological change. Both strengths and limitations must be clearly
     indicated but there does not need to be an equal focus on each. While other, relevant, factors such
     as political developments, wars and external Persian or Portuguese influences may be referred to,
     the bulk of the response will remain on the issue raised in the question.


8.   Discuss the role of internal and external forces in the decline of the Mughal Empire up to 1712.

     Candidates will offer a considered and balanced review of the role of internal and external forces in
     the decline of the Mughal Empire up to 1712. Candidates may choose to focus on internal forces
     and external forces separately or they may adopt a chronological approach. Candidates may offer
     equal coverage of internal and external forces, or they may prioritize their discussion of one, but
     both will be a feature in relation to the decline of the Mughal Empire. Candidates may refer to the
     Mughal Empire under Aurangzeb, administrative weaknesses, lavish spending, religious
     intolerance and the subsequent unrest, internal rebellions, wars of succession, the Maratha Wars,
     and threats from the French and British traders. These need not all be covered or covered equally.
     While other, relevant, factors may be referred to, the bulk of the response will remain on the issue
     raised in the question.
                                                  – 11 –               M18/3/HISTX/HP3/ENG/TZ0/OC/M


Section 5: Colonialism and the development of nationalism in South-East Asia (c1750–1914)

9.    With reference to the period from 1898 to 1914, evaluate the impact on the Philippines of US
      colonial rule.

      Candidates will make an appraisal impact of US colonial rule on the Philippines by weighing up the
      strengths and limitations of US policies and actions. They may respond to the question
      chronologically or thematically. Alternatively, candidates may appraise US policies and
      achievements against the needs and interests of Filipinos. They may refer to Aguinaldo and the
      circumstances leading to US colonial rule, the effectiveness of political institutions set up by the
      US, the disestablishment of the Catholic Church and the redistribution of church lands, educational
      reforms, healthcare, the economy and trade with the US, racism, social control, and violence
      against the Filipinos. These need not all be covered or covered equally. Both strengths and
      limitations must be clearly indicated but there does not need to be an equal focus on each. While
      other, relevant, factors may be referred to, the bulk of the response will remain on the issue raised
      in the question.


10.   Evaluate the internal and external factors that enabled the Siamese monarchy to maintain
      independence during the reign of Rama V (Chulalongkorn).

      Candidates will make an appraisal of the internal and external factors that enabled the Siamese
      monarchy to maintain independence during the reign of Rama V (Chulalongkorn’s) by weighing up
      the importance or otherwise of each. They may choose to focus on internal forces and external
      forces separately or they may adopt a chronological approach. Candidates may offer equal
      coverage of the internal and the external forces, or they may prioritize their evaluation of one, but
      both will be a feature in relation to Siamese independence. Candidates may refer to the
      modernization and reform initiated by his father, Rama IV (Mongkut), the centralization of the
      bureaucracy and the judiciary, financial changes, the role of the military, the control of social
      unrest, westernization in dress, architecture and technology, the concept of national borders and
      identity, trade, and the territorial rivalries between the European powers. These need not all be
      covered or covered equally. While other, relevant, factors may be referred to, the bulk of the
      response will remain on the issue raised in the question.
                                                  – 12 –               M18/3/HISTX/HP3/ENG/TZ0/OC/M


Section 6: India, Afghanistan and Burma (1750–1919)

11.   To what extent did the partition of Bengal in 1905 and the Morley-Minto reforms of 1909 affect
      political developments in India up to 1919?

      Candidates will consider the merits or otherwise of the suggestion that the partition of Bengal in
      1905 and the Morley-Minto reforms of 1909 affected political developments in India up to 1919.
      They may adopt a chronological approach and consider a range of long and short-term
      consequences arising from these two events, but treatment need not be equal. However, both
      aspects will be a feature of the response. A comparative approach may or may not be used.
      Candidates may refer to the role of Indian political organisations, Hindu and Muslim fears, the
      Muslim desire for separate electorates, the British divide and rule policies, the growth of Indian
      nationalism and demands for self-government, and the 1919 Government of India Act. These need
      not all be covered or covered equally. While other, relevant, factors such as the impact of the First
      World War may be referred to, the bulk of the response will remain on the issue raised in the
      question.


12.   “The loss of Burmese independence was the result of King Thibaw’s failure to continue the policies
      of King Mindon.” To what extent do you agree with this statement?

      Candidates will offer a considered and balanced review of the statement that “the loss of Burmese
      independence was the result of King Thibaw’s failure to continue the policies of King Mindon”.
      Candidates may offer equal coverage of Mindon and Thibaw, or they may prioritize their discussion
      of one. However, both aspects will be a feature of the response. A comparative approach may or
      may not be used. Candidates may refer to modernization and reform, the military, administration
      and the bureaucracy, the economy and taxation, relations with the British and the French, the
      Anglo-Burmese Wars. These need not all be covered or covered equally. While other, relevant,
      factors such as the British and French rivalry may be referred to, the bulk of the response will
      remain on the issue raised in the question. Candidates may agree, partly agree or disagree with
      the statement.

Section 7: Challenges to traditional East Asian societies (1700–1868)

13.   Evaluate the causes and effects of the White Lotus Rebellion.

      Candidates will make an appraisal of the causes and effects of White Lotus Rebellion by weighing
      up their importance or otherwise. Candidates may focus exclusively on the Rebellion of 1796 to
      1806, but they may also include the Wang Lun Rebellion of 1774. They may choose to focus on
      causes and effects separately or they may adopt a chronological or a thematic approach.
      Candidates may offer equal coverage of the causes and the effects or they may prioritize their
      evaluation of one, but both will be a covered. They may refer to anti-Qing secret societies,
      corruption in the court and administration, economic problems, population increase and famine,
      high taxation, social unrest, the influence on further rebellions in the 19th century, the weakening of
      Qing power, and the vulnerability of China to Western demands for trade. These need not all be
      covered or covered equally. While other, relevant, factors may be referred to, the bulk of the
      response will remain on the issue raised in the question.


14.   To what extent did social and economic change contribute to the fall of the Tokugawa Shogunate?

      Candidates will consider the merits or otherwise of the suggestion that social and economic
      change contributed to the fall of the Tokugawa Shogunate. They may adopt a chronological
      approach that contextualises social and economic factors in Tokugawa society prior to 1853 and
      then considers the subsequent impact of the treaties and events between 1854 and 1868.
      Candidates may offer equal coverage of the social and the economic changes, or they may
      prioritize their assessment of one. However, both aspects will be a feature of the response.
      Alternatively, candidates may choose a thematic approach and refer to aspects such as economic
      problems, the decline of the feudal system, the tozama clans, and foreign demands for trade.
      These need not all be covered or covered equally. While other, relevant, factors such as the
      political challenges to the Shogunate may be referred to, the bulk of the response will remain on
      the issue raised in the question. Candidates may agree, partly agree or disagree with the
      suggestion.

Section 8: British colonialism and emerging national identities in Oceania (1788–1919)

15.   Discuss the impact of the emergence of the labour movement in either Australia or New Zealand
      from the mid-19th century to 1919.

      Candidates will offer a considered balanced review of the impact of the emergence of the labour
      movement in their chosen country in the given timeframe. Candidates may adopt a chronological
      approach that outlines the circumstances leading to the emergence of the labour movement, but
      they will be clearly linked to the issue raised in the question. Candidates may choose a thematic
      approach and refer to social, economic and political factors, which will be determined by the
      country selected. These may include the changing nature of unionism, depressions and the
      country’s economy, the demands for wage regulation and better working conditions, the rise of
      labour political parties and legislative reforms, and the changes in social conditions. These need
      not all be covered or covered equally. While other, relevant, factors such as conservative political
      influences and the impact of the First World War may be referred to, the bulk of the response will
      remain on the issue raised in the question.


16.   Evaluate the nature and impact of British administration in the Pacific Islands up to 1919
      (excluding Australia and New Zealand).

      Candidates will make an appraisal of the nature and impact of the British administration in the
      Pacific Islands by weighing up the strengths and limitations of the British presence and policies.
      The British Western Pacific Territories was a colonial entity, which included Fiji and the Union
      Islands, Gilbert and Ellice Islands, Solomon Islands and Cook Islands, Pitcairn Islands, Tonga and
      Savage Islands, New Hebrides and Nauru. Candidates may consider the nature and impact of the
      British administration in the islands separately and present end-on accounts whilst others may
      choose a thematic one across a range of islands. A comparative approach may or may not be
      used and not all islands need to be considered in detail. Candidates may refer to political,
      economic, social, religious and cultural factors, but these need not all be covered or covered
      equally. Both strengths and limitations must be clearly indicated but there does not need to be an
      equal focus on each. While other, relevant, factors may be referred to, the bulk of the response will
      remain on the issue raised in the question.

Section 9: Early modernization and imperial decline in East Asia (1860–1912)

17.   Evaluate the impact on China of its defeat in the Sino-Japanese War (1894–1895).

      Candidates will make an appraisal of the impact on China of its defeat in the Sino-Japanese War
      by weighing up its importance or otherwise regarding political, economic, social or cultural aspects
      in Chinese society, but these need not all be covered or covered equally. They may adopt a
      chronological approach that contextualises the war and then outline the impact of the defeat on
      subsequent events. Alternatively, candidates may choose a thematic approach and evaluate areas
      such as intellectual debate, the rise of revolutionary groups, further attempts at reform, internal and
      external conflict. Some candidates may focus on the immediate aftermath whilst others will extend
      their appraisal to 1912 and beyond. Both the importance or otherwise must be clearly indicated but
      there does not need to be an equal focus on each. While other, relevant, factors such as weak
      government and Western exploitation may be referred to, the bulk of the response will remain on
      the issue raised in the question.


18.   With reference to the period between 1860 and 1894, discuss the causes and effects of the
      opening of Korea in 1876.

      Candidates will offer a considered and balanced review of the causes and effects of the opening of
      Korea in 1876. They may adopt a chronological approach that identifies the events in the given
      timeframe and which links them to the causes and effects of the opening of Korea. Alternatively,
      candidates may choose a thematic approach and may refer to aspects such as Korea’s seclusion,
      internal conflict between conservative and progressive factions, external pressure from Western
      commercial interests, the Treaty of Kanghwa, Japanese control of the economy, further unequal
      treaties, and the Tonghak Rebellion. These need not all be covered or covered equally. There may
      be some imbalance between causes and effects, but candidates will consider both aspects. While
      other, relevant, factors such as Chinese influence may be referred to, the bulk of the response will
      remain on the issue raised in the question.

Section 10: Nationalism and independence in India (1919–1964)

19.   Evaluate the reasons why the 1935 Government of India Act was a disappointment to Indian
      nationalists.

      Candidates will make an appraisal of the reasons why the 1935 Government of India Act was a
      disappointment to Indian nationalists by weighing up its importance or otherwise within the context
      of the political situation in India. They may adopt a chronological approach that contextualises the
      1935 Government of India Act in the struggle for independence from Britain within the timeframe
      for this section. Alternatively, candidates may choose a thematic approach and refer to aspects
      such as resentment about the 1919 Government of India Act, the Simon Commission, the Round
      Table Conferences, the demands of the Indian National Congress and the All India Muslim
      League, the roles of Gandhi, Nehru, Bose and Jinnah, the actual provisions of the 1935 Act, and
      the reactions of different Indian nationalist groups. These need not all be covered or covered
      equally. Both the importance or otherwise must be clearly indicated but there does not need to be
      an equal focus on each. While other, relevant, factors such as international pressures may be
      referred to, the bulk of the response will remain on the issue raised in the question.


20.   Evaluate the importance of Subhas Chandra Bose to the weakening of British power in India.

      Candidates will make an appraisal of the importance of Subhas Chandra Bose in weakening British
      power in India by weighing up the strengths and limitations of his actions. They may adopt a
      chronological approach that refers to Bose’s activism during the 1920s and 1930s, his split with the
      Indian National Congress during the Second World War when he advocated seeking support from
      the fascist governments, his propaganda broadcasts, his creation of the Indian Provisional
      Government in exile, and the Indian National Army. Alternatively, candidates may choose a
      thematic approach and balance Bose’s role against other aspects of the struggle for independence
      and the contributions of nationalist leaders such as Nehru, Gandhi and Jinnah. These need not all
      be covered or covered equally. Both strengths and limitations must be clearly indicated but there
      does not need to be an equal focus on each. While other, relevant, factors such as and the impact
      of the Second World War on Britain may be referred to, the bulk of the response will remain on the
      issue raised in the question.
                                                 – 17 –              M18/3/HISTX/HP3/ENG/TZ0/OC/M


Section 11: Japan (1912–1990)

21.   Evaluate the impact of the invasions of Manchuria (1931) and China (1937) on Japan’s relations
      with the West.

      Candidates will make and appraisal of the impact of the invasions of Manchuria (1931) and China
      (1937) on Japan’s relations with the West (US, Britain and non-Soviet Europe) by weighing up their
      importance or otherwise. They may adopt a chronological approach and consider a range of long
      and short-term consequences arising from these two events, but treatment need not be equal.
      However, both aspects will be a feature of the response. A comparative approach may or may not
      be used. Candidates may refer to tensions prior to the invasions, the Washington Naval Treaty, the
      League of Nations, the Lytton Report, Manchukuo, the cancellation of trade agreements, the
      Tripartite Pact, and US military aid for China. These need not all be covered or covered equally.
      Both the importance or otherwise must be clearly indicated but there does not need to be an equal
      focus on each. While other, relevant, factors such as Japanese domestic politics may be referred
      to, the bulk of the response will remain on the issue raised in the question.


22.   Discuss the reasons for, and the consequences of, the adoption of the reverse course in Japan to
      1952.

      Candidates will offer a considered and balanced review of the reasons for, and the consequences
      of, the adoption of the reverse course in Japan to 1952. They may adopt a chronological approach
      that discusses the events of the US occupation after the Second World War. Consequences may
      extend beyond the timeframe but they must be clearly linked to the issue raised in the question.
      Alternatively, candidates may choose a thematic approach and may refer to aspects such as the
      initial reforms under the US occupation, resistance to the economic changes, internal dissent, the
      US desire to create stability, and external Cold War pressures. These need not all be covered or
      covered equally. There may be some imbalance between reasons and consequences, but
      candidates will consider both aspects. A balanced review is likely to identify differing views of
      American actions. While other, relevant, factors may be referred to, the bulk of the response will
      remain on the issue raised in the question.
                                                  – 18 –               M18/3/HISTX/HP3/ENG/TZ0/OC/M


Section 12: China and Korea (1910–1950)

23.   “Jiang Jieshi’s domestic policies during the Nanjing decade (1927–1937) were largely successful.”
      To what extent do you agree with this statement?

      Candidates will consider the merits or otherwise of the statement that “Jiang Jieshi’s domestic
      policies during the Nanjing decade (1927–1937) were largely successful”. They may adopt a
      chronological approach that contextualises Jiang’s domestic policies by referring to the state of
      China prior to the given timeframe, but this must be clearly linked to the issue raised in the
      question. Alternatively, candidates may choose a thematic approach and refer to aspects such as
      internal divisions, military control, national debt, railways, banking, agriculture, education, public
      health and welfare, corruption and nepotism, and the threat of the Japanese. These need not all be
      covered or covered equally. While other, relevant, factors such as foreign recognition and US
      philanthropy may be referred to, the bulk of the response will remain on the issue raised in the
      question. Candidates may agree, partly agree or disagree with the statement.


24.   With reference to the period up to 1950, evaluate the impact of the Sino-Japanese War
      (1937–1945) on Korea.

      Candidates will make an appraisal of the impact of the Sino-Japanese War (1937-1945) on Korea
      in the period up to 1950 by weighing up its importance or otherwise with regard to political,
      economic, social or cultural aspects in Korean society, but these need not all be covered or
      covered equally. They may adopt a chronological approach that contextualises the situation in
      Korea or a thematic approach. Candidates may refer to the Japanese occupation, industrialisation,
      the destruction of Korean culture, forced labour schemes, social unrest, the Soviet and US
      occupation zones, the role of the United Nations, and the Cold War politics that led to the outbreak
      of the Korean War in 1950. Both the importance or otherwise of the impact of the Sino-Japanese
      War must be clearly indicated but there does not need to be an equal focus on each. While other,
      relevant, factors may be referred to, the bulk of the response will remain on the issue raised in the
      question.

Section 13: Impact of the world wars on South-East Asia

25.   Examine the reasons for, and the effects of, the initial Japanese victories in South-East Asia
      (1940–1942).

      Candidates will consider the interrelationship between reasons for, and the impact of, the initial
      Japanese victories in South-East Asia. This does not include China or the Pacific islands. Reasons
      may predate the timeframe but they must be clearly linked to the question. Candidates may adopt
      a chronological approach that identifies the events leading up to the victories and beyond.
      Alternatively, candidates may choose a thematic approach and refer to aspects such as Japanese
      military superiority, the weakness of the colonial powers, the nature of the Japanese occupation,
      and the growth of independence movements in the occupied countries. The balance between the
      two parts of the question need not be equal but both will be addressed in an effective manner.
      While other, relevant, interrelationships such as Japanese domestic politics, international alliances,
      the war in Europe and the relationship with the US may be considered, the bulk of the response
      will remain on those raised in the question.


26.   Evaluate the reasons for Indonesian independence (1949).

      Candidates will make an appraisal of the reasons for Indonesian independence (1949) by weighing
      up their importance or otherwise in the context of the political situation in Indonesia. They may
      adopt a chronological approach that contextualises the creation of the Republic of Indonesia in
      1949 within the struggle for independence from the Netherlands. Alternatively, candidates may
      choose a thematic approach and consider aspects such as the growth of the nationalist movement
      prior to the Second World War, the impact of the Japanese occupation, the roles of Sukarno and
      other leaders, the declaration of independence in 1945, and the Dutch attempts to re-establish
      colonial rule. These need not all be covered or covered equally. Both the importance or otherwise
      must be clearly indicated but there does not need to be an equal focus on each. While other,
      relevant, factors such as international pressures may be referred to, the bulk of the response will
      remain on the issue raised in the question.

Section 14: The People’s Republic of China (1949–2005)

27.   Evaluate the role of the Gang of Four in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution between 1966
      and 1976.

      Candidates will make an appraisal of the role of the Gang of Four in the Great Proletarian Cultural
      Revolution between 1966 and 1976 by weighing up its importance or otherwise. They may adopt a
      chronological approach that contextualises the Cultural Revolution in the aftermath of the Great
      Leap Forward and the side lining of Mao. Candidates may consider Mao’s launch of the Cultural
      Revolution and the Gang of Four who promoted Mao’s ideas of continuous revolution. They may
      refer to the Gang of Four collectively or identify the actions of members such as Jiang Qing.
      Alternatively, candidates may choose a thematic approach and balance the Gang of Four’s role
      against other aspects such as the Red Guard Movement, the significance of other leaders, and the
      role of the People’s Liberation Army (PLA). These need not all be covered or covered equally. Both
      the importance or otherwise must be clearly indicated but there does not need to be an equal focus
      on each. While other, relevant, factors may be referred to, the bulk of the response will remain on
      the issue raised in the question.


28.   Discuss the successes and failures of Deng Xiaoping’s implementation of the Four
      Modernizations.

      Candidates will offer a considered and balanced review of the successes and failures of Deng
      Xiaoping’s implementation of the Four Modernizations. This is a question about a range of issues
      so the 1989 Tiananmen Square massacre should not be the focus of the response. They may
      consider the successes and failures separately or they may adopt a chronological approach.
      Candidates may offer equal coverage of the successes and failures, or they may prioritize their
      discussion of one, but both will be a feature in relation to the implementation of the Four
      Modernizations. They may refer to Deng’s role as paramount leader, the aims of the Four
      Modernizations, the changes in education and technology, the introduction of individual
      enterprises, the Special Economic Zones (SEZs), the resistance to reform, the demands for the
      Fifth Modernization of democracy, and internal unrest. These need not all be covered or covered
      equally. While other, relevant, factors such as external pressures may be referred to, the bulk of
      the response will remain on the issue raised in the question.

Section 15: Cold War conflicts in Asia

29.   Evaluate the impact on Malaya of the British/Commonwealth response to the Malayan Emergency
      (1948–1960).

      Candidates will make an appraisal of the impact of the response to the Malayan Emergency
      (1948–1960) on Malaya by weighing up its importance or otherwise with regard to political,
      economic, social or cultural aspects in Malayan society, but these need not all be covered or
      covered equally. They may adopt a chronological approach that contextualises the situation in
      Malaya or a thematic approach. Candidates may refer to British colonial rule, the Communist
      insurgency, the Briggs Plan and the forced resettlement of Chinese Malays, the role of the British
      High Commissioner, security measures, the military response, and the establishment of an
      independent Malayan state. Both the importance or otherwise of the impact of the response to the
      Malayan Emergency must be clearly indicated but there does not need to be an equal focus on
      each. While other, relevant, factors such as international pressure and support may be referred to,
      the bulk of the response will remain on the issue raised in the question.


30.   “The Viet Minh won the French Indo-China War (1946–1954) because the French were weak.”
      To what extent do you agree with this statement?

      Candidates will consider the merits or otherwise of the statement that “the Viet Minh won the
      French-Indo-China War (1946–1954) because the French were weak”. They may adopt a
      chronological approach that contextualises the war by identifying events and policies prior to the
      given timeframe, but this must be clearly linked to the issue raised in the question. Candidates may
      offer equal coverage of the Viet Minh and the French, or they may prioritize their assessment of
      one. However, both aspects will be a feature of the response. A comparative approach may or may
      not be used. Candidates may refer to the impact of the Second World War, French colonial policy,
      Vietnamese nationalism and Ho Chi Minh, military leaders, and the campaigns. These need not all
      be covered or covered equally. While other, relevant, factors such as foreign influences may be
      referred to, the bulk of the response will remain on the issue raised in the question. Candidates
      may agree, partly agree or disagree with the statement.

Section 16: Developments and challenges in South Asia after 1947

31.   To what extent were Nehru’s economic policies successful?

      Candidates will consider the merits or otherwise of the suggestion that Nehru’s economic policies
      were successful. They may adopt a chronological approach that contextualises Nehru’s economic
      policies by referring to the state of India at the time of partition and after his rule, but this must be
      clearly linked to the issue raised in the question. Alternatively, candidates may choose a thematic
      approach and refer to aspects such as the Five Year Plans, agricultural improvements,
      industrialization, government sponsored projects, government regulation, taxation, and the
      limitations on foreign investment and imports. These need not all be covered or covered equally.
      While other, relevant, factors such as political and cultural issues or foreign policies may be
      referred to, the bulk of the response will remain on the issue raised in the question. Candidates
      may agree, partly agree or disagree with the suggestion.


32.   “Political factors were the main cause of friction between East and West Pakistan.” Discuss.

      Candidates will offer a considered and balanced review of the statement that “political factors were
      the main cause of friction between East and West Pakistan”. This is a question about a range of
      issues so a description of the 1971 war should not be the focus of the response. Candidates may
      refer to demographic issues, political representation, internal political rivalries and upheavals,
      military leaders, and discrimination against East Pakistanis in the bureaucracy and the military.
      These need not all be covered or covered equally. While other, relevant, factors such as economic
      policies, cultural friction, Indian influence and US aid may be referred to, the bulk of the response
      will remain on the issue raised in the question. Candidates may agree, partly agree or disagree
      with the statement.

33.   Compare and contrast attitudes towards indigenous peoples in Australia and New Zealand
      between 1945 and 2005.

      Candidates will give an account of the similarities and differences between attitudes towards
      indigenous peoples in Australia and New Zealand in the given timeframe by referring to both
      throughout the response. They may contextualise the situation in each country and note that there
      were different circumstances such as the legacy of the Treaty of Waitangi in New Zealand, and the
      absence of formal recognition and the variations between the states in Australia. Candidates may
      adopt a chronological approach and they may identify the similarities and the differences
      separately. Alternatively, candidates may consider a thematic approach and refer to both in areas
      such as assimilation and integration policies, citizenship, demands for land rights, education,
      employment opportunities, the problems posed by migration from rural areas to the cities, racism
      and discrimination, the effectiveness of indigenous advisory councils, and political representation.
      These may not all be covered or covered equally. Both similarities and differences must be clearly
      indicated but there does not need to be an equal number of each.


34.   Evaluate the policies and achievements of the Muldoon government.

      Candidates will make an appraisal of the policies and achievements of the Muldoon government by
      weighing up their strengths and limitations. They may adopt a chronological approach that outlines
      the sequence of the policies implemented and which notes the achievements. Alternatively,
      candidates may choose a thematic approach and refer to the domestic policies and achievements
      in areas such as unemployment, inflation, the welfare state, agriculture, industrial projects,
      indigenous affairs and immigration. Foreign policies and achievements such the 1981 Springbok
      tour and trade agreements may also be considered. Both strengths and limitations must be clearly
      indicated but there does not need to be an equal focus on each. While relevant external factors
      such as the decline in wool prices, Britain joining the EU and the oil crisis may be referred to, the
      bulk of the response will remain on the issue raised in the question.

Section 18: Social, cultural and economic developments in Asia (excluding China, Japan and
            India) (1980–2005)

35.   With reference to two Asian countries (excluding China, Japan and India), compare and contrast
      the role of religion in society.

      Candidates will give an account of the similarities and differences between two countries in the
      region (excluding China, Japan and India) in terms of the role of religion in society by referring to
      both throughout the response. They may contextualise the situation in each country and may refer
      to different religions and religious practices or to the same religion in both countries. Candidates
      may adopt a chronological approach within the timeframe for this section and/or they may identify
      the similarities and the differences separately. Alternatively, candidates may choose a thematic
      approach and consider both in areas such as the existence of cultural and geographic divisions
      created by religion; the role of religion in education, health care and social welfare; the influence
      that religious groups have on government policies and legislation; and the impact of religion on
      cultural activities and public celebrations. Both similarities and differences must be clearly indicated
      but there does not need to be an equal number of each.


36.   To what extent did globalization have a positive impact on two Asian countries (excluding China,
      Japan and India) to 2005?

      Candidates will consider the merits or otherwise of the suggestion that globalisation did have a
      positive influence on two Asian countries (excluding China, Japan and India). Candidates may offer
      equal coverage of the two countries, or they may prioritize their discussion of one. However, both
      will be a feature of the response. A comparative approach may or may not be used. Candidates
      may refer to a wide range of factors, which will be determined to some extent by the countries
      selected. These may include economic growth and trade, industrialisation, technological
      advancement, employment opportunities, demographic change, health and welfare provisions,
      social unrest, the increased presence of expatriate communities, and the foreign cultural impact.
      These may not all be covered or covered equally. While other, relevant, factors may be referred to,
      the bulk of the response will remain on the issue raised in the question. Candidates may agree,
      partly agree or disagree with the suggestion.
