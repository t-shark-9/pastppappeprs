                                               Section A
1.   (a)   With reference to Table 2, describe two advantages for Su of using a cash-flow
           forecast.                                                                               [4]
           Possible advantages include:
           • it shows when there is expected to be cash shortfall (especially late 2018,
             early 2019)
           • it is suitable for “what if”. For example, if a bigger loan was sought there might
             not be a cash shortfall.
           • for use as a planning tool
           • to inform stakeholders (e.g. banks when finance is needed)

           Do not reward ideas such as:
           • predicting future costs
           • calculating/assessing profits

           NB Cash flow, profit, liquidity, working capital are all different concepts so do not
           reward profit or liquidity or working capital unless the candidate demonstrates that
           cash flows indicate areas for improvement and that improving management of cash
           flow could lead to improved profits or improved liquidity.
           Context will usually be achieved by using information from the table.
           Any other relevant advantage.
           Mark as 2 + 2.
           Award [1] for each advantage identified, and [1] for the development of each of this
           advantage in the context of AS. Award up to a maximum of [2] per advantage.

     (b)   With reference to Su and her managers at HH and AS, explain the differences
           between leadership and management.                                                      [6]
           Su shows distinct leadership qualities. She:
           • inspires
           • sets missions
           • takes responsibility for strategic decisions
           • takes on the role of spokesperson
           • delegates, advises, guides
           • shows features of McGregor Theory Y.

           Her managerial roles are somewhat limited but include organizing at a corporate
           level. Most of the management functions are delegated.
           Managers, for example David and Salima, fulfil management functions including:
           • making day-to-day decisions
           • making tactical decisions
           • organizing resources, directing, coordinating staff.

           Accept any other relevant difference.
           Marks should be allocated according to the markbands on page 5.
           Award a maximum of [3] for a theoretical answer
           Award a maximum of [4] if no reference to David/Salima (managers)
           Award a maximum of [5] if the explanation of differences is mainly descriptive,
           but in context.
           To achieve 5 or 6 marks there has to be a comparison.

2.   (a)   With reference to AK Bank, describe two features of for-profit microfinance
           providers.                                                                             [4]

           Features include:
           • they provide small amounts of capital
           • they provide finance to people who might otherwise not get finance (eg, poorer
             people, specific groups such as women)
           • they often help business start-ups
           • they lend to people without collateral
           • they often operate in developing economies.

           Candidates may interpret AK Bank as being a social enterprise and this is a
           reasonable assumption. Although it is unusual to assume it is not a social
           enterprise this will also be allowed.
           Comments such as ‘low’ or ‘high’ interest rates are too vague unless developed.
           Context will come from the information given about AK Bank. Two different
           contexts are needed. Context includes the activities in Bangladesh, the fact that it
           will work with a social enterprise such as AS, support for other social causes.

           Do not reward answers that say “it’s for profit” and/or “it provides finance” unless
           these are developed.

           Mark as 2 + 2.

           Accept any other relevant feature.

           Award [1] for each correct feature identified and [1] for a description of how that
           feature relates to AK. Award a maximum of [2] per feature.

(b)   Su is considering two possible locations for the production facility (lines 51–52).
      Explain the factors (reasons) that Su may consider when deciding between the two
      locations.                                                                            [6]

      This is not an AO3 question so there does not have to be a recommendation.

      Factors/reasons include:

      For country B:
      • This is a social enterprise, so a developing economy may be important.
      • Distribution could be a problem, so simple transport links are favourable.

      But:
      • One party state may be high risk and seen as unethical.
      • Quality is an issue, so skills are important.

      For Country A:
      • Free market economy, high skills.
      • Trading easier.
      • Stable currency, stable government.

      But:
      • Does it need the work?
      • Costs likely to be higher.
      • Finance not so important so how relevant are grants, low rents?

      NB A decision is not required. However, an answer that works towards a decision
      may discuss factors and can be rewarded.

      Accept any other relevant analysis.

      Marks should be allocated according to the markbands on page 5.

      Award a maximum of [3] for a theoretical answer.

      Award a maximum of [4] if explanation does not effectively bring out the
      factors/reasons or only considers one country

      Award a maximum of [5] if the explanation of more than one factors/reasons is
      mainly descriptive, but in context.

      For full marks, the explanation needs to be developed and in context and both
      countries considered.

3.   (a)   Describe two advantages for AS of using cellular production in the production of
           its solar power systems.                                                              [4]

           • Cellular production relies on team work, which helps motivation. Tasks are
             completed by the team.
           • This could help AS achieve its desired high quality, efficient use of resources,
             reduction of waste.
           • Complexity of assembling solar panels which may require teams.

           Context includes: AS is based on teamwork (volunteers), good way to empower
           employees which is what Su wants to do, quality is important to AS.

           Accept any other relevant advantage

           Mark as 2 + 2.

           Award [1] for each advantage identified, and [1] for the development of each of
           these advantages in the context of AS, up to a maximum of [2].

     (b)   Explain the advantages for Su of forming AS as a private limited company.             [6]

           Advantages:
           • Limited liability – the business is fairly high risk so Su may need protection of
             her personal finances.
           • Limited number of shareholders – may be important to retain the high ethical
             values.
           • Difficult to takeover – Su will want to keep this project hers.
           • Separate legal entity.
           • Able to raise additional finance without losing control.
           • Continuity assured.

           Context includes:
           • Protects Su’s other assets.
           • Afghanistan is high risk, incorporation reduces the risks to Su.
           • AK Bank may not want to work with an unincorporated business.
           • May be easier to arrange finance as shown in cash flow.


           Accept any other relevant advantage.

           Marks should be allocated according to the markbands on page 5.

           Award a maximum [3] for a theoretical answer.

           Award a maximum [4] if only one advantage, in context, is considered.

           Award a maximum [5] if the explanation is mainly descriptive, but in context.

                                           Section B
4.   (a)   Define two characteristics of a charity.                                                   [2]

           • A charity usually performs useful social/environmental functions.
           • Charities usually have a tax advantage.
           • Charities usually do not seek to make a profit.

           Candidates are not expected to word their answer exactly as above.

           Award [1] for each characteristic identified.

     (b)   (i)    Using the information in Table 3, calculate the break-even output for
                  portable biomass sources of electricity (PBS) (show all your working).              [2]

                                     FC                    $200 000        $200 000
                  B/E =                                =               =
                          price − unit variable cost       $90 − $70         $20
                      = 10 000 PBS

                  Award [2] for 10 000 units per year.

                  Award [1] if either no units or no working.

           (ii)   Comment on the usefulness to AS of break-even analysis                              [6]

                  • It gives a minimum target for sales. Is 10 000 PBS per year (OFR)
                    achievable?
                  • It is useful for “what if”.
                  • It could help in setting prices.
                  • It could help in production planning.
                  • However, is the data realistic?
                  • Will all units be sold?

(c)   Recommend whether AS should enter into a joint venture with DF.                    [10]

      Factors in favour:
      • Fits in with Su’s need to make the world a better place – it offers a real
        opportunity to save lives.
      • A nice fit with DF’s project.
      • Increased world profile for AS.
      • Opportunities for changes in jobs for employees/managers.
      • Opportunity to expand and restructure.
      • A form of diversification.
      • Further benefits to more communities in Afghanistan.

      However:
      • Managers would not like the changes – smaller span of control, less
        empowerment.
      • Possible production problems – diseconomies of scale?
      • Dangers of growing too quickly.
      • Afghan project comes second?
      • AS would have to change the way it operates.

      Marks should be allocated according to the markbands on page 6.
