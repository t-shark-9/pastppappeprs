Apply the markbands that provide the “best fit” to the responses given and award credit wherever it is
possible to do so. If an answer indicates that the demands of the question are understood and
addressed but that not all implications are considered (for example, compare or contrast; reasons
or significance; methods or success), then examiners should not be afraid of using the full range of
marks allowed for by the markscheme. Responses that offer good coverage of some of the criteria
should be rewarded accordingly. If you are uncertain about the content/accuracy of a candidate’s
work please contact your team leader.

              are substantiated, and the response argues to a reasoned conclusion.
 10–12     • The demands of the question are understood and addressed. Answers are generally
              well structured and organized, although there may be some repetition or lack of clarity in
              places.
           • Knowledge is accurate and relevant. Events are placed in their historical context, and
              there is a clear understanding of historical concepts. Examples used are appropriate
              and relevant, and are used to support the analysis/evaluation.
           • Arguments are mainly clear and coherent. There is some awareness and evaluation of
              different perspectives.
           • The response contains critical analysis. Most of the main points are substantiated, and
              the response argues to a consistent conclusion.
  7–9      • The response indicates an understanding of the demands of the question, but these
              demands are only partially addressed. There is an attempt to follow a structured
              approach.
           • Knowledge is mostly accurate and relevant. Events are generally placed in their
              historical context. Examples used are appropriate and relevant.

Section 1: Indigenous societies and cultures in the Americas (c750–1500)

1.   Discuss the importance of landholding and agricultural production in two indigenous societies.

     Candidates will offer a considered and balanced review of the importance of landholding and
     agricultural production in two indigenous societies in pre-Columbian America during, although not
     necessarily spanning, the period from c750 to 1500. In doing so, they may discuss the ways in
     which landholding and agricultural production influenced the social, political and economic
     structures of two societies. Different patterns of landholding may be discussed including
     communal landholding, landholding awarded to important members of society (such as religious
     leaders, nobility and warriors) and state landholding. Candidates may also discuss developments
     in agricultural production that enabled the support of growing populations, such as the “slash and
     burn” method to increase the availability of land in the Amazonian rainforest.


2.   Discuss the role of polytheistic beliefs in two pre-Columbian societies.

     Candidates will offer a considered and balanced review that includes a range of arguments that
     address the role of religious beliefs of two polytheistic pre-Columbian societies. The discussion will
     focus on, but not necessarily span, the period from c750 to 1500. Polytheistic beliefs in pre-
     Columbian America were often based on the adoration of natural phenomena and the perspective
     that these possessed supernatural powers. These beliefs explained the creation of the world,
     established codes of behaviour and included systems of reward and punishment. Political leaders
     were generally considered to be gods or were believed to have been appointed by the gods.
     Some societies practiced toleration toward the religious beliefs of the groups they conquered, while
     others required submission. Among some polytheistic religions, human sacrifice and cannibalism
     were practiced to either please the gods or to enforce submission of conquered populations.
                                                 –8–                 M18/3/HISTX/HP3/ENG/TZ0/AM/M


Section 2: European explorations and conquests in the Americas (c1492–c1600)

3.   Discuss the effects of the Treaty of Tordesillas (1494) on the Americas.

     Candidates will offer a considered and balanced review of the effects of the Treaty of Tordesillas
     (1494) on the Americas. Issues that may be addressed include the economic advantage received
     by Spain, given their vastly greater award of territory, and the substantial wealth they extracted
     from the Aztec and Incan Empires (by contrast, the Portuguese obtained little gold and silver from
     their territory), the dominance of Spanish language and culture in the Americas due to the breadth
     of their colonization, the refusal of Britain, France or Russia to acknowledge the legitimacy of
     Pope Alexander VI’s proclamation or of the treaty; the long-term avoidance of conflict between
     Spain and Portugal in the Americas due to the treaty, and the often disastrous effects of Spanish
     and Portuguese colonization upon the approximately fifty million indigenous inhabitants of the
     Americas.


4.   Evaluate the impact of the use of indigenous labour by the colonial powers on societies in
     the Americas.

     Candidates will make an appraisal of the benefits and detriments of indigenous labour during the
     time of European exploration and conquest by weighing up the strengths and limitations of its
     impact on societies in the Americas. In doing so, they must refer to the impact of indigenous
     labour on the colonies but may also focus on the impact to the indigenous populations themselves.
     Issues that may be addressed regarding impact on the colonies include the effect of low-cost
     manual labour on the development of plantations and mines, the rise of a new social class among
     European settlers who profited from securing additional indigenous labourers, and legislation
     produced to regulate indigenous labour. Impact on the indigenous populations may include forced
     relocation and its impact on food production, separation of families, dangerous and unhealthy work
     environments, resistance movements against forced labour and the use of indigenous labour to
     counter rebel or aggressive populations.
                                                  –9–                 M18/3/HISTX/HP3/ENG/TZ0/AM/M


Section 3: Colonial government in the New World (1500–1800)

5.   To what extent was Habsburg and early Bourbon rule successful in addressing the problems of
     Spanish America up to 1759?

     Candidates will consider the merits or otherwise of the argument that Habsburg and early Bourbon
     rule was successful in addressing the problems of Spanish America up to 1759. They may, for
     example, choose to address each of the challenges individually and gauge the extent to which
     each was overcome, or they may choose to focus on the challenges that were overcome and those
     that were not in discrete groups. Challenges that might be addressed include, but are not limited
     to, the need to provide an efficient administrative system to rule a vast territory, the potential for
     religious orders to both assist their administration and challenge their authority, the impact of
     declining trade as well as opposition to Spanish trade monopolies and the threat of both foreign
     intervention and internal revolts.


6.   Evaluate the role of gold, silver and sugar in the economic development of colonial America.

     Candidates will make an appraisal of the strengths and limitations of the role played by gold, silver
     and sugar in the economic development of colonial America. In evaluating the beneficial and
     detrimental effects on the economy, they may choose to address either specific colonies or colonial
     regions more broadly, but must apply clear and detailed examples of the roles played by gold,
     silver and sugar in the colonial mercantile economies. Issues that might be evaluated include,
     but are not limited to, the expense and risk involved in both private and state investment, the
     labour-intensive nature of production that required an extensive infrastructure for support, the
     export of most wealth rather than the development of the colonial economy, the displacement of
     the indigenous population, the development of the slave trade and slavery to meet labour needs,
     the impact of monoculture economies and the effects of their eventual decline.
                                                   – 10 –               M18/3/HISTX/HP3/ENG/TZ0/AM/M


Section 4: Religion in the New World (1500–1800)

7.   “Religious orders in Spanish and Portuguese America were a challenge to government authority”.
     Discuss.

     Candidates will offer a considered and balanced review of how far religious orders challenged
     governments in Spanish and Portuguese America. In doing so, candidates may refer to the nature
     of relationships between members of the religious orders and the indigenous populations as well
     as government representatives. Challenges presented by religious orders include the extent of
     autonomy enjoyed by the orders due to their economic success, and the extent to which some
     orders opposed the exploitation of the indigenous population thus challenging colonial authority. It
     may be argued that religious orders were more often instruments of colonial policy through
     assisting their efforts to force indigenous populations to abandon their language, culture and
     religion. It may also be asserted that the orders did not do enough to improve the living and
     working conditions of the indigenous people.


8.   To what extent was there religious tolerance in British North America during this period?

     Candidates will consider the merits or otherwise of the suggestion that religious tolerance was
     present within the given timeframe. There is no set number of groups that candidates need to
     address and candidates could elect to follow a comparative approach should they choose. Issues
     that may be addressed include the general intolerance, mistreatment and exclusion practiced by
     Puritans toward Catholics, Quakers, Jews and others who dissented from Puritan theology, the
     conflict, including occasional armed conflict, between Catholic and Anglican colonies, the Society
     of Friends’ (Quakers’) practice of religious toleration, and the Maryland Act of Toleration. The
     Quebec Act of 1774, which granted toleration to the French Canadians’ practice of Catholicism,
     may also be mentioned. Candidates may argue that the extent of religious toleration was quite
     variable in the early colonial period and that the US Bill of Rights illustrates the growth of religious
     tolerance that emerged out of the British colonial period.
                                                    – 11 –               M18/3/HISTX/HP3/ENG/TZ0/AM/M


Section 5: Slavery and the New World (1500–1800)

9.    “Slavery was introduced for economic rather than political reasons.” Discuss.

      Candidates will offer a considered and balanced review of the statement. Both political and
      economic factors must be assessed, although some imbalance in their treatment is allowed.
      Issues that may be addressed include the role of cash-crop agriculture and natural resource
      extraction that led to the enslavement of the indigenous population in some parts of the Americas,
      the decline of the indigenous population due to disease and unhealthy working conditions that led
      to the introduction of African slavery, the profitability of the slave trade as a motive unto itself, the
      European argument of alleged “superiority” to provide both legal and moral grounds for slavery, the
      viewpoint that African slaves were less likely to rebel than indigenous people and the perspective
      that religious conversion justified enslavement of both indigenous and African people.


10.   Compare and contrast the role of two colonial powers in the expansion of slavery in the Americas.

      Candidates will provide an account of the similarities and differences between the roles of two
      colonial powers in the expansion of slavery in the Americas, referring to both throughout the
      response. Arguments must be focused on any two specific colonial powers. Issues that may be
      addressed for comparison and contrast include the establishment of state-sanctioned monopolies
      to expand slavery, the utilization of religious and philosophical justifications, and economic motives
      such as national shipping dominance, mineral resource acquisition and cash-crop production.
      Similarities and differences may also be addressed in terms of the living/working conditions
      affecting mortality rates, the motives and timeframe for the termination of slavery, the extent to
      which indigenous people were enslaved and the impact of laws codifying slavery as well as the
      extent of their enforcement.
                                                    – 12 –                M18/3/HISTX/HP3/ENG/TZ0/AM/M


Section 6: Independence movements (1763–1830)

11.   “Foreign intervention was the main reason for the success of independence movements in the
      Americas.” With reference to one independence movement, to what extent do you agree with this
      statement?

      Candidates will consider the merits or otherwise of the argument that foreign intervention was the
      main reason for the success of independence movements in the Americas. They may also
      address other factors that contributed to the success of independence movements. In respect to
      foreign assistance, candidates may consider the use of sea power both in terms of naval warfare
      as well as the application of blockades for economic effect, the intervention of foreign troops and
      their impact in specific military campaigns, and the role of economic assistance through
      armaments, provisions and loans. With regard to other factors, arguments might focus on issues
      of public morale, internal class division, qualities of political and military leadership, and the extent
      to which the foreign power could concentrate its resources against the independence movement.


12.   Discuss the reasons for, and nature of, the Monroe Doctrine.

      Candidates will offer a considered and balanced review that includes a range of arguments and
      factors as to the motives for and nature of the Monroe Doctrine. As to reasons, candidate may
      discuss Britain’s concern for maintenance of her trade relationships with the newly-emerged Latin
      American republics (which prompted British discussions with the US), the desire of the US to
      prevent foreign intervention in the Americas and to secure its own trade interests, the desire of the
      US to establish a sphere of influence and discourage additional foreign colonization or annexation,
      and altruistic sentiments in the US to support emerging democracies that had patterned their
      institutions on the US. In respect to the nature of the doctrine, candidates may emphasize the US
      pledge to not intervene in European affairs along with the non-intervention and non-colonization
      clauses directed toward Europe. The non-binding nature of the document may also be mentioned.
                                                  – 13 –                  M18/3/HISTX/HP3/ENG/TZ0/AM/M


Section 7: Nation-building and challenges (c1780–c1870)

13.   Evaluate the changes in the US political system that were brought about by the 1787 Constitution.

      Candidates will make an appraisal of the impact on the US political system that occurred following
      the replacement of the Articles of Confederation by the 1787 Constitution. Issues to be addressed
      may include the transition from a government dominated by the legislative branch to a system of
      three relatively coequal branches that included the separation of powers with checks and balances,
      the reduction of state power and replacement with a system that emphasized the pre-eminence of
      the national government (though with specific powers reserved to the states), and the addition of a
      national Bill of Rights. It may be argued that the change was limited in that the principles of the
      consent of the governed, majority rule and a government of limited powers were preserved.
      Candidates may point out that women and minorities saw little benefit from the adoption of the new
      constitution.


14.   Evaluate the policies and impact of caudillo rule in one country.

      Candidates will make an appraisal of both the policies and the impact of caudillo rule in any one
      country. They may evaluate the policies and impact in a running comparison or they may choose
      to treat each caudillo independently. As to impact, candidates may address the role of caudillos in
      the independence movements of their country, the establishment of power based on either military
      prowess or land ownership, and their taking on of foreign debt and the resulting consequences. In
      respect to policies, issues that may be discussed include caudillos’ tendency to use force, even
      terror, to consolidate power and respond to rebellions, the establishment of trade agreements and
      loans with Europe, sometimes in support of their military actions in the Americas, and the tendency
      to achieve legitimacy and popular support through charisma and the granting of favours, rather
      than the establishment of strong national institutions.
                                                  – 14 –               M18/3/HISTX/HP3/ENG/TZ0/AM/M


Section 8: United States’ Civil War: Causes, course and effects (1840–1877)

15.   To what extent did the Nullification Crisis contribute to the outbreak of the US Civil War?

      Candidates will consider the merits or otherwise of the argument that the Nullification Crisis of
      1832 was a major cause of the US Civil War. While counter arguments may be offered,
      candidates must directly address the role of nullification as a cause of the Civil War. Background
      as to South Carolina’s threat to nullify the tariff of 1828 and the federal government’s response
      threatening military intervention is relevant if effectively linked to the more immediate causes for
      the outbreak of the war. Issues that may be addressed include nullification theory as a means to
      defend states’ rights, nullification issues prior to 1832 that were resolved peacefully, and secession
      as the ultimate expression of states’ rights applied by Southern states in response to Lincoln’s
      election in 1860.


16.   Evaluate the effectiveness of methods of Southern resistance to Reconstruction.

      Candidates will make an appraisal of the effectiveness of Southern methods of resistance to
      Reconstruction. This may be evaluated by several criteria, including the response to the Lincoln-
      Johnson plan as well as the response to the plan of the Radical Republicans. Methods considered
      may include those that applied political, economic and social resistance as well as the use of
      terror. Issues that may be developed include, but are not limited to, the use of intimidation and
      force by terrorist organizations, such as the Ku Klux Klan, opposition to the Freedman’s Bureau
      and the plan to grant freedmen portions of confiscated and abandoned land, the use of “black
      codes” to restrict the civil rights of freedmen, the use of sharecropping, debt peonage and convict
      labour systems to control freedmen, and the use of grandfather clauses, poll taxes and literacy test
      to deny voting rights to freedmen.

Section 9: The development of modern nations (1865–1929)

17.   Evaluate the impact of international and inter-American trade on the development of two countries
      of the Americas.

      In the development of any two countries, candidates will make an appraisal of the beneficial and
      detrimental effects of trade within the Americas and with other regions of the world. In doing so,
      they must provide specific examples of the ways in which trade helped and hindered progress in
      the selected countries. Issues that may be evaluated include patterns of export-led development
      and their contribution toward overspecialization and monoculture, the contribution of foreign
      investment to the development of infrastructure and the extraction of natural resources but with
      potential for consequent dependency and debt, fluctuations in demand for particular resources that
      often created “boom and bust” economic results, the tendency of US and British companies to
      dominate the trade relationship with other countries of the Americas and the impact of resource
      development on population movement and urban development.


18.   “Liberalism and positivism were the most important influences on the modernization of the
      Americas.” Discuss.

      Candidates will offer a considered and balanced review that includes a range of arguments
      assessing the extent to which liberalism and positivism promoted modernization. In doing so, they
      may also discuss the influence of other trends, such as nationalism. While both liberalism and
      positivism must be discussed, allow some imbalance in their treatment. Points that may be
      addressed include the philosophy of positivism with its emphasis on promoting order and national
      progress, the important role for “technocrats” who valued rationalism and science over religion and
      conservative values, a contrast of the divergent effects experienced in different countries (such as
      a disregard for democracy under Diaz in Mexico and yet a contribution to the end of slavery in
      Brazil). Some candidates may argue that although political liberalism promoted values of
      republicanism and constitutionalism and the protection of individual liberties, it did not develop in
      Latin America as significantly as in the US and Canada.

Section 10: Emergence of the Americas in global affairs (1880–1929)

19.   Evaluate the causes of the Spanish-American War (1898).

      Candidates will make an appraisal of the causes of the Spanish-American War of 1898. Both
      short-term and long-term causes are relevant but the focus should be on causes within Cuba and
      the US, rather than internal factors in Spain. Cuban internal factors that may be addressed include
      the causes leading to the Second Cuban War for Independence and the military leadership and
      “reconcentration” decree of Spanish General Weyler, which led to thousands of deaths and ended
      the possibility of compromise between Spain and the rebels. The role of the US press in
      condemning Spanish rule in Cuba, in publication of the de Lome letter criticizing McKinley, and in
      blaming the Spanish for the explosion of the Maine are likely points of emphasis. Candidates may
      also choose to evaluate the contribution of Manifest Destiny and the writings of Mahan in
      promoting an expansionist foreign policy that would further US economic interests.


20.   “Wilson’s policy of moral diplomacy was a failure.” To what extent do you agree with this
      statement?

      Candidates will consider the merits or otherwise of the argument that Wilson’s policy of moral
      diplomacy was a failure. Moral diplomacy, both within and outside the Americas, is relevant to the
      question. Topics may include the initial focus of moral diplomacy on Latin America, particularly on
      the Mexican government under Huerta. Huerta’s removal could be argued a success though it
      ultimately led to continued civil war and Pershing’s invasion of Mexico in pursuit of Villa, which
      failed. Interventions in the Dominican Republic and Haiti may also be applied as examples of
      failed efforts. The Jones Act extending more autonomy to the Philippines may be termed a
      success. Wilson’s efforts to apply moral diplomacy through the Fourteen Points in the negotiations
      to end the First World War may be deemed a failure since the US did not join the League of
      Nations or sign the Versailles Treaty.

Section 11: The Mexican Revolution (1884–1940)

21.   “Social factors were more significant than political factors in the outbreak of the Mexican
      Revolution.” Discuss.

      Candidates will offer a considered and balanced review of the social and political causes of the
      Mexican Revolution. Though the weight may vary, there should be at least some discussion of
      both social and political causes and the focus should remain on factors that contributed to the
      outbreak of the revolution, rather than its continuance. Social factors that may be addressed
      include the issue of landlessness, poor living and working conditions in both rural and urban areas
      and the extreme social stratification of Mexico. Some candidates might argue that the social
      problems were in part due to rapid economic growth under Diaz, leading to inflation and the
      problems of rapid urbanization. Political factors that may be discussed include the lengthy tenure
      of Diaz and his failure to allow free elections, dissatisfaction with Diaz’s relationship to US and
      British business interests and the appeal of Madero’s Plan of San Luis Potosi.


22.   Discuss the achievements and failures of Carranza.

      Candidates will offer a considered and balanced review of the achievements and failures of
      Venustiano Carranza, who ruled Mexico between 1914 and 1920. Although candidates may vary
      in the amount of weight given to achievements and failures in their responses, there should be at
      least some discussion of each. Achievements that may be applied include Carranza’s military
      defeat of Huerta, Villa and Zapata, his gaining the support of the trade unions, and the passage of
      the Mexican Constitution of 1917 with its land redistribution, labour reform, and restrictions on the
      Catholic Church. It may also be argued that avoidance of war with the US, despite the Pershing
      invasion, was an achievement. For failures, candidates may argue that Carranza failed in the
      attempt to impose his successor, Bonillas, and that he “betrayed” the revolution by turning against
      Villa and Zapata after Huerta’s overthrow.

Section 12: The Great Depression and the Americas (mid 1920s–1939)

23.   Discuss the nature and efficacy [effectiveness] of the New Deal.

      Candidates will offer a considered and balanced review of the nature and efficacy of the New Deal,
      but allow for some imbalance between the two. While their discussion may separate the First and
      Second New Deal, this division is not required. Discussion of “nature” may emphasize the
      emergency conditions prompting the First New Deal and its attempt to preserve the system of
      capitalism (as illustrated by the emergency banking measures). Candidates might argue that the
      Second New Deal was more radical in that capitalism was substantially changed (as evidenced by
      the Social Security Act). As for efficacy, some could argue that the First New Deal failed with over
      11 million Americans still unemployed in 1935 and that the second New Deal addressed this
      through job creation. Others could argue that it was only with the Second World War that the
      American economy recovered, so perhaps both New Deals had limited efficacy.


24.   With reference to one Latin American country, evaluate the extent of popular mobilization and
      repression between 1929 and 1939.

      Candidates will make an appraisal of the extent of popular mobilization and repression in any one
      Latin American country between 1929 and 1939. Although candidates may vary in the amount of
      weight given to popular mobilization and repression in their responses, there should be at least
      some discussion of each. Examples to be evaluated may include the extent of repression in
      Argentina under the military governments of Uriburu and Justo and the degree of popular
      mobilization by the labour movement. The fall of the repressive military government in Chile under
      Ibanez might be applied though it may be argued that Alessandri continued the repression.
      Popular mobilization in Chile during this period was largely centred in the trade unions. Brazil,
      under Vargas, might be applied as an example of repression during the Estado Novo with its ban
      of national trade unions in response to the popular mobilization led by the Integralists.

Section 13: The Second World War and the Americas (1933–1945)

25.   With reference to the period up to 1945, discuss the social impact of the Second World War on
      women and minorities.

      Candidates will offer a considered and balanced review that includes a range of arguments to
      explain the effects of the Second World War on both women and minorities. Although candidates
      may vary in the emphasis they place on women and minorities, there should be at least some
      discussion of each. With respect to women, candidates may discuss the increase in employment
      opportunities, development of new skills and entrance into the armed forces that became available
      due to the war and which contributed to demands for equality. It may also be argued that
      discrimination in the workplace sometimes followed and that there was pressure to return to
      domestic roles at the end of the war. For minorities, candidates may discuss the discrimination
      faced by people of Japanese descent, but also the increased opportunities available to African–
      Americans and Latinos that helped fuel the post-war movement toward equality.


26.   Evaluate the diplomatic effects of the Second World War in two countries of the Americas up
      to 1945.

      Candidates will make an appraisal of the diplomatic effects of the Second World War in any two
      countries of the Americas up to 1945. It is important to note that the question requires focus on
      effects in the Americas. Diplomatic effects may be interpreted widely and the nature of material
      presented will vary per the countries selected. Argentina’s relationship with the Axis powers is a
      likely topic and may include evaluation of Argentina’s effort to maintain official neutrality despite US
      pressure to end any relationship with the Axis countries. Candidates might also choose to
      evaluate how US diplomatic pressures affected Latin American countries’ war efforts as well as
      their business relationship with Axis nationals. The efforts of the US to establish better relations
      with Latin America and to negotiate security and trade agreements are another likely topic.

Section 14: Political developments in Latin America (1945–1980)

27.   To what extent did the Cuban Revolution and the rule of Fidel Castro bring about political and
      economic change in Cuba?

      Candidates will consider the merits or otherwise of the idea that the Cuban Revolution brought
      about transformation to Cuban politics and the economy. In doing so, they must consider the
      political and economic situation of Cuba before and after the Revolution. Some candidates may
      argue that Castro’s initial efforts were to end dictatorship and remove Cuba’s dependency on the
      US, while others may assert that a Marxist–Leninist state that eliminated elections, prohibited
      political opposition and established a state-controlled economy was his intent from the beginning.
      Candidates may argue that although radical economic changes were implemented, such as the
      Agrarian Reform and the nationalization of foreign estates and companies, Cuba remained
      dependent on foreign economies. Some candidates may discuss whether the shift from US to
      Soviet dependency constituted economic continuity or change for Cuba. While the country
      changed from a capitalist to a socialist economy, it remained economically dependent on foreign
      powers.


28.   Discuss the reasons for the rise to power of a military dictatorship in one country.

      Candidates will offer a considered and balanced review of the reasons for the rise to power of a
      military dictatorship in any one country. This question allows candidates to write about their own
      national history where appropriate. Prominent choices are likely to be Argentina in 1966 and 1976,
      Brazil in 1964, Uruguay in 1973 or Venezuela in 1948. While factors contributing to the rise of
      dictatorships will vary, candidates may discuss the role of external factors such as the Cuban
      Revolution, the willingness of the US to accept right-wing dictatorships as preferable to socialist
      regimes and domestic factors such as labour unrest and high inflation. Candidates could also
      argue that in some cases there had been a longer-term failure to establish the legitimacy of
      political institutions. Civilian politicians were perceived as weak and/or corrupt.
      In these circumstances, the military could portray itself as the nation’s saviour.

Section 15: Political developments in the United States (1945–1980) and Canada (1945–1982)

29.   Discuss the impact of Watergate on Nixon’s domestic policy programme.

      Candidates will offer a considered and balanced review as to the impact of the Watergate scandal
      on the domestic policy programme of President Nixon. Nixon’s first term was successful in
      expanding many social programmes such as Medicaid and Social Security as well as passing
      many environmental initiatives. Watergate became a dominant event in Nixon’s second term until,
      facing the likelihood of impeachment, he resigned in 1974. Issues, such as the firing of the
      Watergate Special Prosecutor, Archibald Cox, questions over the release of the Watergate tapes,
      testimony as to Nixon’s participation in the cover-up and his use of illegal practices against political
      opponents dominated the second term. It may be argued that foreign policy, particularly public
      unrest over the war in Vietnam and escalation of the war into Cambodia and Laos were the key
      reasons for a limited domestic agenda after the first term.


30.   To what extent were the domestic policies of St Laurent successful?

      Candidates will consider the merits or otherwise of the argument that the domestic policies of
      Canadian Prime Minister Louis St Laurent (1948–1957) were successful. Consideration of his
      programmes in respect to the growth of the Canadian economy, relationship with the provinces,
      efficiency of administration, and extension of needed services to Canadian citizens are issues that
      may be gauged to determine the “extent of success”. St Laurent was relatively successful in
      equalizing national revenues to poorer provinces, extending old-age pensions and assistance to
      the indigent, enacting hospital insurance and increasing funding for the arts. He also initiated the
      Trans-Canadian Highway and the St Lawrence Seaway (with the US). However, late in his term
      he was increasingly criticized for running an arrogant and authoritarian regime, particularly in the
      use of cloture to stop debate and advance the Trans-Canadian pipeline.

Section 16: The Cold War and the Americas (1945–1981)

31.   “Fear of communist expansion was the main reason for US involvement in Vietnam.” To what
      extent do you agree with this statement?

      Candidates will consider the merits or otherwise of the argument that US involvement in Vietnam
      was caused by the fear of communism and its expansion. They may apply relevant background for
      US involvement through treatment of issues as early as the end of the Second World War.
      However, the focus must be on supporting, opposing or modifying the given motive for US
      involvement in Vietnam. Factors that may be addressed include post-war acceptance of the
      containment and “domino” theories, interpretation of events in Eastern Europe and Korea as
      reflecting a communist intent toward global domination, failure to recognize conditions in Vietnam
      as reflecting competing interests for Vietnamese nationalism, and President Johnson’s fear that the
      failure to deter North Vietnamese advancement would jeopardize his re-election efforts and
      threaten the achievement of his domestic agenda.


32.   “President Carter was successful in his attempt to advance human rights in the Americas.”
      To what extent do you agree with this statement?

      Candidates will consider the merits or otherwise of the argument that President Carter’s human
      rights policy in the region was successful. Opinions are likely to differ and candidates may
      consider both the stated intentions of the Carter administration as well as the actual policies
      applied. Issues that candidates may address include Carter’s support for an annual Congressional
      human rights report to help focus public attention on the issue, reduction or elimination of arms
      sales to countries involved in human rights abuses, initiation and passage of the Panama Canal
      Treaty, ending of US backing for Somoza in Nicaragua and support for African American and
      gender equality civil rights issues in the US. Critics have also argued that Carter did little to deter
      the CIA from circumventing the arms sale ban and that he failed to stop sales approved by
      previous administrations.

33.   Evaluate the success of civil rights organizations in advancing the interests of African Americans
      during the period from 1945 to 1980.

      Candidates will make an appraisal, by weighing up the strengths and weaknesses, of specific
      organizations in terms of their contributions in advancing civil rights for African Americans. Events
      and issues from the end of the Second World War to 1980 may be considered, but do not expect
      all organizations from that era to be included. While some mention of presidential administrations,
      individual leaders and events will have relevance, these should be placed in context of their role
      within organizations advancing civil rights. The evaluation may encompass the litigation sponsored
      by the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP), boycotts and
      demonstrations engaged in by the Southern Christian Leadership Conference (SCLC), sit-ins and
      other activities of the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee (SNCC), the philosophy and
      actions of Malcolm X and the Black Muslims, and the support of the Black Panthers for Black
      Nationalism.


34.   Discuss the impact and significance of feminist movements in the Americas.

      Candidates will offer a considered and balanced review that includes a range of factors
      contributing to the impact and significance of feminist movements in the Americas after 1945.
      While causal factors that had roots in the Second World War may have relevance, the focus should
      be on post-1945 effects of feminism. Topics that may be addressed include the influence of the
      feminist movement on other groups seeking full civil rights, such as the indigenous population,
      the impact of Betty Friedan, author of The Feminine Mystique, and others who challenged the
      status quo, access to abortion and contraceptives advancing the independence of women (though
      muted by religious barriers and male-dominated cultures in some countries), the appeal of political
      parties seeking support from women and greater acceptance by labour unions, which led to their
      advocacy for issues such as day care and equal pay.

Section 18: The Americas (1980–2005)

35.   Evaluate the reasons for the collapse of the Progressive Conservative Party in Canada.

      Candidates will make an appraisal of the reasons for the collapse of the Progressive Conservative
      Party (PCP). Candidates could argue that the party continued in a different form after it merged
      with the Canadian Alliance Party in 2003 to form the Conservative Party of Canada. Nevertheless,
      candidates should provide some explanation of the party’s sharp decline in support from 1993
      onwards. Issues that may be addressed include the heterogeneous nature of its support in that it
      included Quebec nationalists from the East and conservatives from the West, the inability of
      Mulroney to satisfy Quebec nationalists illustrated by the failure of the Meech Lake Accord and the
      referendum defeat of the Charlottetown Accord, and the recession of the late 1980s with its
      increase in unemployment and debt. It might be argued that the collapse was not complete since
      the PCP won provincial elections in Ontario in 1995.


36.   Discuss the factors that led to the rise of violent and/or non-violent movements in two countries of
      Latin America.

      Candidates will offer a considered and balanced review of the causes of violent and non-violent
      movements in any two countries of Latin America. Choices candidates present will vary widely per
      the countries and movements selected. Candidates may cite the Landless Workers Movement
      (Movimento dos Trabalhadores Rurais Sem Terra, MST), in Brazil with unequal land distribution as
      its initial cause though it later sought solutions for housing, credit, health care and education.
      Another case could be the Madres de la Plaza de Mayo in Argentina, an association of mothers
      and grandmothers who initially sought explanation for relatives who had “disappeared” during the
      military dictatorship but later campaigned for prosecution of those responsible for the human rights
      abuses. For Mexico, candidates could choose the Zapatista National Liberation Army (Ejército
      Zapatista de Liberación Nacional, EZLN), which was motivated by opposition to the North
      American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) and the privatization of the ejidos.
