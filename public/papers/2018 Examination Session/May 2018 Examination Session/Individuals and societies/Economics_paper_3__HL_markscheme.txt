Notes for examiners:

1. Whenever relevant, carry over marks must be awarded. If a candidate makes an error in
   calculation, but then uses the incorrect figure appropriately and accurately in later question
   parts, then the candidate may be fully rewarded. This is the “own-figure rule” and you should
   put OFR on the script where you are rewarding this.

2. Alternative approaches may be taken in responses to the [4] questions that use A02 command
   terms. If this is the case and the alternative approaches are valid, then full credit should be
   given.


1.   (a)   Calculate the equilibrium price and quantity per month.                               [2]

           249  4P  150  14P
           99  18P                                                                              [1]

           Any valid working is sufficient for [1].

           P  $5.50, Q  227                                                                    [1]

           An answer of 5.50, 227 (without working) is sufficient for [1].

     (b)   Calculate the excess demand/excess supply (state which of these) at a price
           of $8.50.                                                                             [2]

           Qd  249  4 x 8.50  215
           Qs  150  14 x 8.50  269                                                            [1]

           Any valid working is sufficient for [1].

           There will be excess supply or a surplus of 54.                                       [1]

           An answer of 54 (without working) is sufficient for [1].

     (c)   Calculate the price at which excess demand of 18 widgets would result.                [2]

           249  4P  150  14P  18
           81  18P                                                                              [1]

           Any valid working is sufficient for [1].

           P  $4.50                                                                             [1]

           An answer of 4.50 (without working) is sufficient for [1].

(d) Using an example, outline why the assumption of ceteris paribus is necessary when
      analysing the effect of a change in price on the quantity demanded of a product.       [2]

       Level                                                                        Marks

       1       Vague response.                                                      1
               The idea that some things might change or to understand
               the impact of change in one independent variable (price) at
               a time.
       2       Accurate response.                                                   2
               An outline that a change in any of the non-price determinants,
               such as income and tastes and preferences, may distort the
               effect of the change in price, meaning that the impact of the
               change in price alone cannot be determined.

(e)   Widgets and Pidgets have negative cross price elasticity of demand (XED).
      Explain how the demand function for Widgets, Qd  249  4P, is likely to change as a
      result of an increase in the price of Pidgets.                                         [2]

       Level                                                                        Marks

       1       The written response is limited.                                     1
               The idea that demand for widgets will decrease or demand shifts
               to the left.
       2       The written response is accurate.                                    2
               For explaining that demand for widgets will decrease and hence
               the “a term” intercept or horizontal intercept or Q-intercept will
               decrease.

(f)   Outline the meaning of the term unit elastic demand.                                   [2]

       Level                                                                        Marks

               The idea that the change in demand is equal to the change in
               price or there is no change in revenue when the price changes
               or that it shows when revenue is at its maximum.
       2       Clear understanding.                                                 2
               A change in the price of a product results in a proportionate
               (equal percentage) change in the quantity demanded.

(g)   Explain two determinants of the price elasticity of demand (PED).                    [4]

       Level                                                                      Marks
       0       The work does not meet a standard described by the descriptors     0
               below.
       1       The written response is limited.                                   1–2
               For providing one determinant without explanation, award a
               maximum of [1].
               For providing two determinants without explanation or for
               providing one condition with explanation, award a maximum
               of [2].
       2       The written response is accurate.                                  3–4
               For providing one determinant without explanation and one
               determinant with explanation, award a maximum of [3].
               For providing two determinants with explanation, award a
               maximum of [4].

               Accurate explanations may include:
                degree of necessity – if a good is a necessity, then
                  demand will be price inelastic as consumers will attempt to
                  avoid reducing consumption, while any reduction is likely
                  to be proportionately smaller than the change in price
                availability of close substitutes – if close substitutes are
                  available, demand will be price elastic as an increase in
                  the price of the product is likely to lead to consumers
                  switching to alternatives, causing the quantity demanded
                  (of the good) to decrease significantly
                proportion of income spent on the good – if the price
                  represents a small proportion of income, demand will be
                  price inelastic as a change in price will have little impact
                  on the ability of the consumer to purchase the product
                time – consumers are more able to react to changes in
                  price if they have more time, so demand is likely to be
                  more price elastic in a longer time period
                any other reasonable response (provided it does not
                  repeat the idea i.e. if luxuries and necessities are both
                  explained, treat this as one point. Same rule applies for
                  number of substitutes and availability of close substitutes).

(h)   Two products are in competitive supply. Using an example, outline how the supply
      for one of them is likely to be affected by an increase in the price of the other.   [2]

               The idea that an increase in the price of one will lead to a
               decrease in supply of the other.
       2       Accurate response.                                                 2
               An increase in the price of one good, eg wheat, will cause a
               decrease in supply of the other eg barley as the two products
               “compete” for resources needed to grow them.

               and that MC  0 in this case OR for explaining that since there
               are no variable costs (or only fixed costs), maximum profit will

                             The tax cut increases AD, which causes the inflation rate to rise
                             and the unemployment rate to fall or that there will be a
                             movement along the SRPC to the left as unemployment falls
                             and inflation rises or suggest figures that are still on the SRPC.

                             For explaining that the tax cut will raise disposable incomes,
                             which leads to more consumption and an increase in AD, so
                             unemployment will fall and the inflation rate will increase and
                             that there will be a movement along the SRPC to the left or
                             suggest figures that are still on the SRPC.

(c)   The natural rate of unemployment in Country Alpha is 5 %.

      On the diagram on page 10 draw and label the long-run Phillips curve (LRPC).         [1]

                        For a response that an increase in energy costs will raise the
                        rate of inflation (or expected rate of inflation), which shifts the
                        SRPC curve right/upwards or that SRAS shifts left (a supply
                        shock).
              2         The response is accurate.                                             2
                        For a response that an increase in energy costs will raise the
                        rate of inflation.
                        At each level of unemployment, the rate of inflation will be higher
                        because of the rise in production costs (or SRAS has shifted
                        left). Thus the SRPC curve will shift to the right/upwards.

(iii)   The increase in investment results in both short-run and long-run effects on

        If candidates show a left shift (or vertical upward shift) of SRAS instead of the right shift
        in LRAS (focusing on theory of high wages and input costs after AD shifts right and
        price level rises), they may be awarded full marks.

        N.B.: The new short-run equilibrium could be to the left or right or on the
        intersection of the new LRAS and AD curve.

        N.B.: A shift to the right of SRAS may also be shown, but to earn two marks, both
        AD and LRAS must shift.

        N.B.: The new curves should be appropriately labelled.

                For an explanation that the multiplier will be smaller in Delta
                since there are more leakages than in Beta due to imports and
                income taxes. The reference to the formula to calculate
                Multiplier could be




                OR



                Therefore, an increase in investment will increase real GDP by
                smaller successive amounts as a greater proportion is
                withdrawn before additional spending takes place. As a result,
                the effect on real GDP in Delta will be smaller than in Beta.

                    for another.

                    lead to over-specialisation, which would make the economy
                    vulnerable to changes in the market for exported products
                • specialisation may result in the economy relying on the
                    export of (primary) commodities, which may be income
                    inelastic, and therefore unlikely to lead to sustained growth
                • specialisation may result in the economy relying on the
                    export of (primary) commodities which earn little value-added
                    for the exporting economy
                • it may not be possible for the ELDC to gain access to
                    international markets as a result of Trade protection.
                • primary products are often subject to supply shocks resulting
                in volatile prices and difficulty or unwillingness in planning ahead
                • demand for primary products may be price inelastic, which
                leads to revenue falling when output increases


                Any other reasonable response.

                 The idea that direct investment is to do with investment in
                 physical capital (FDI) while portfolio investment refers to financial
                 investment, such as in shares and bonds or that direct investment
                 confers some (significant) degree of ownership/control of the
                 investment while portfolio investment does not.

(i)   Outline how Urbania’s relatively high rate of inflation might affect its current account
      balance.                                                                                   [2]

                become relatively cheaper than domestic goods.

                The idea that exports will become less competitive/imports will
                become relatively cheaper than domestic goods and that as a
                result export (revenue) is likely to decrease/import (expenditure)
                is likely to increase, worsening (OR increasing the deficit in) the
                current account balance.

(j)   Outline one method, other than attempting to reduce the value of its currency,
      which may be used by the government of Urbania to reduce its current account
      deficit.                                                                                   [2]

                Possible responses include:
                 contractionary demand management policy(ies) – to reduce
                  disposable income and so the demand for imports
                 supply-side policies – to make the goods and services
                  produced by the economy more competitive internationally
                 protectionism – to reduce the demand for imports (and/or
                  stimulate exports).
