                         Core theme: patterns and change

                                          Section A
1.   Populations in transition

     (a)   Outline how a country’s dependency ratio is calculated.                                   [2]

           Young dependent + old dependent / independent population or economically
           active or working population [1]

           Young dependent (0–14,15,16) + old dependent (64,65,66+) / independent
           population or economically active or working population (15–64) [2]


     (b)   Describe two predicted regional trends shown on the graph.                                [2]

           Must have regional context that only reflects the continental grouping of the
           countries to be awarded marks.

           African nations are predicted to have fewer dependents [1].
           European nations are predicted to have more dependents [1].

           Must have quantification exemplifying this for award of full marks. If no data then
           award a maximum of [1].

     (c)   Suggest one reason for the predicted change in Nigeria’s dependency ratio.                [2]

           Award [1] for a valid, distinct reason for decline of dependency ratio and [1] for
           additional explanation and/or detail that explains decline in dependency ratio.

           For example: Fertility rates/birth rates in Nigeria are predicted to fall [1], reducing
           the proportion of young dependents in relation to the working age population [1].

           Other possibilities include:
            population momentum / large youthful population moving into economically active age
             group
            in-migration of working-age people.
                                            –4–                M18/3/GEOGR/BP1/ENG/TZ0/XX/M


(d)   Suggest one positive and two negative socio-economic impacts of an ageing
      population for one named country.                                                   [2+2+2]

      In each case, award [1] for each valid positive/negative socio-economic impact
      related to the named country, and [1] for further development by means of
      explanation or detail.
      Award a maximum of [3] if no named country is given and linked to the impacts.

      An aging population is one with high/increasing proportion aged over 65. Impacts
      may be current or long term.

      For example (positive): Grandparent(s) can take care of children [1] so that
      parents do not have to pay for childcare [1].

      For example (negative): Costs of providing elderly care [1] may be a large burden
      for taxpayers [1].

      Other possibilities include:

      Positive
       Economy has access to more experienced employees.
       Less money spent on schooling and natal medical care.
       Lower crime rates and less money needed to be spent on policing.
       Grey economy.

      Negative
       Smaller work force.
       Reduced taxation income.
       Elderly tend to get sick more frequently.
       Reduced spending on education, policing, transport network, etc.
       Cost of paying for pensions.
       Service decline (schools, sports centres, etc not used by older residents).
       4:2:1 ratio of dependency.
       Reduced productivity.
       Increased age dependency ratio.
       Lack of a young workforce that has more innovative minds and a better grasp of modern
        technology.

2.   Disparities in wealth and development

     (a)   Briefly outline what is meant by:

           (i)    gross national income (GNI);                                                      [1]

                  The total value of goods/services produced within a country together with
                  the balance of income/remittances and payments from or to other
                  countries. [1]

           (ii)   foreign debt.                                                                     [1]

                  Money/debt owed by a country to another country/organization/bank. [1]

     (b)   Identify which country on the map is most in need of debt relief and briefly justify
           your choice.                                                                           [1+2]

            Jamaica [1]
            Evidence from the resource (eg over 100%/124%) [1]
            Development of why it is need of debt relief or comment relative to the other
             countries [1]

           Possibilities include:
            It owes over 100 % of its annual GNI [1]. No surplus money available for
             development projects [1].
            All money generated in nation is needed to service its debt [1]; it needs this
             debt burden reduced to enable investments in development projects [1].

           If the wrong country is named, up to [2] can still be awarded for correct
           justification of why it is the most in need of debt relief.

(c)   Explain, using examples, two ways in which increased trade may help reduce
      economic disparities between countries.                                                [2+2]

      Award [1] for a valid, distinct way and [1] for additional explanation and/or detail
      to explain how increased trade can reduce economic disparities between
      countries.

      There are a number of ways in which increased trade can help reduce disparities
      between countries such as:
       Increasing incomes in trading nations [1] eg in Vietnam free trade agreement
         with USA gave workers improved wages and increase in national income [1].
       Increased income stimulates growth in other sectors [1] which increases the
         national income [1].
       Workers in industries associated with increased trade improve skills [1] which
         increases opportunities to generate more income and reduces disparities [1].
       Increased trade allows countries to develop a manufacturing base [1] this
         generates more income than agriculture or other primary activities [1].
       Increased trade leads to international recognition [1] – attracts investment with enhanced
         reputation which improves economy [1].
       Removal of tariffs/free trade/reduced protectionism increases trade and
         revenue as there are no barriers to imports and exports [1] – this increases
         the national income [1].
       China joining the WTO and opening up its economy [1] has allowed it to
         become “the workshop of the world in the 21st century” and increase its
         prosperity [1].
       Free Trade Zones in Uruguay attract large amounts of foreign investment [1]. These have
         become one of the main drivers of the Uruguayan economy [1].
       In Costa Rica increasing use of Fair Trade is supporting farmers growing products such
         as coffee and bananas to become more income-secure [1] and less vulnerable to poverty
         [1].
       Within trade blocs countries have free access to each other’s markets [1] this can protect
         from competition from outside the bloc and maintain the economic viability of a
         country/industry [1].

3.   Patterns in environmental quality and sustainability

     (a)   Describe how the estimated impact of climate change on agricultural production
           varies with latitude.                                                                  [3]

           Award [1] for each valid point, must have some quantification for [3]. Three valid
           comments are required before quantification can be applied.

           Possibilities include:
            very adverse impacts at latitudes between 10° and 35° (-30 to -40%) [1]
            least impact, or a positive impact, at latitudes of 40° plus (-5 to +10%) [1]
            mixed range at very low latitudes, near equator, 00 to 100 (-5 to approx. -20%)
             [1]
            anomalies at certain latitudes (one country with higher increase than expected
             at latitude 27° and two countries with unusually adverse impacts at 17°) [1]
            overall impact decreases away from the Equator [1]
            impact worsens 0o to 20o [1]
            from 200 to 600 the impact gets less [1].

     (b)   Suggest two reasons why global climate change may lead to an increase in
           agricultural production in some places.                                              [2+2]

           In each case, award [1] for a valid reason and [1] for further
           development/exemplification.

           For example: Global climate change may lead to warmer temperatures,
           lengthening the growing season [1], which may enable farmers to produce two
           crops each year where it was previously only possible to produce a single
           crop [1].

           Other possibilities include:
            more rain than previously, so higher yields
            warmer climate may extend growing season/cultivation into areas previously
             too marginal for farming.
            milder winters may decrease cold stress on livestock
            more land available through glacial retreat or melting of permafrost – can be
             used for farming.

(c)   Distinguish between physical water scarcity and economic water scarcity.                     [4]

      Award [2] for physical water scarcity and [2] for economic water scarcity.

      In each case award [1] for a basic description and [1] for development/exemplification.

      The definition in the subject guide is as follows:
       Physical water scarcity, where water resource development is approaching or has
        exceeded unsustainable levels; it relates water availability to water demand and implies
        that arid areas are not necessarily water scarce.
       Economic water scarcity, where water is available locally but not accessible for human,
        institutional or financial capital reasons.

      For example:
       Physical water scarcity relates water availability/supply to water demand [1]. It
        means that water resource development is approaching (or has exceeded) a
        level that is unsustainable [1]. (Drought needs to be put into the context of
        supply/demand for development credit.)
       economic water scarcity means that water is available locally, but cannot be
        accessed [1] owing to issues of “human, institutional or financial capital” / cost
        / technology / incomes / etc [1].

      Distinction can be implied and does not have to be explicit.

4.   Patterns in resource consumption

     (a)   Describe the pattern of recycling rates shown on the map.                          [3]

           Award [1] for each valid descriptive point, up to a maximum of [3]. Must have
           some quantification for [3].

           Award up to a maximum of [1] for repeat of data for regions.

           Possibilities include:
            highest rates in Central and/or Northern Europe/Scandinavia (Germany,
             Austria, Switzerland, Denmark, etc)
            lowest rates in Eastern/South Eastern Europe (Greece, Turkey, Bulgaria,
             Romania, etc) and Portugal and Iceland
            Portugal as an anomaly
            most of Western Europe have mid-rates.

     (b)   Suggest two reasons why recycling rates differ greatly between countries.        [2+2]

           In each case, award [1] for a valid reason and [1] for further
           development/exemplification.

           For example: Countries such as Germany, where recycling was introduced
           decades ago [1], now have much higher recycling rates than countries such as
           Turkey, where recycling has only just begun [1].

           Possible reasons include:
            differences in government policy/prioritization of SDGs/alternative green
             initiatives eg reusing
            private sector incentives (eg money for returning electronics, soft drinks
             containers, etc)
            levels of education / environmental awareness
            publicity/advertising
            infrastructure available for recycling
            differences in economic development/costs of recycling – some poorer
             countries focus on development rather than environment.
                                             – 10 –              M18/3/GEOGR/BP1/ENG/TZ0/XX/M


(c)   Explain two strengths and one weakness of one local or national strategy aimed
      at reducing the consumption of one named resource.                                    [2+2+2]

      In each case, award [1] for the strength/weakness of one valid existing strategy
      and [1] for further development.

      Award up to a maximum of [4] if there is no named resource or located/named
      strategy.

      The question does not refer specifically to natural resources and so enables a
      broad definition of resource, eg plastics.

      Likely strategies include, but are not limited to: conservation, waste reduction,
      recycling or substitution.

      For example (resource substitution): The Canadian province of Alberta has
      introduced a strategy to phase out the use of coal.
      Strength: the province introduced this strategy in order to reduce harmful
      greenhouse gas emissions [1] with a target of zero [1].
      Weakness: it is expensive to develop other sources of energy [1] as the
      scale/technology for renewable sources is still in early stages of development [1].

5.   To what extent do the most successful poverty reduction strategies focus on wealth
     creation and gender equality?                                                             [15]

     Candidates can agree or disagree with the statement but need to be able to support
     their position. It is also possible that responses may agree with one part of the
     statement and not another. Either of these approaches is acceptable. Poverty
     reduction is open to interpretation and responses could distinguish between absolute
     and relative poverty. There are varied ways of tackling this question.

     Responses should make use of examples but responses that focus on describing
     gender equality and wealth creation initiatives and not focusing on their effectiveness
     as a tool to reduce poverty will be self-limiting.

     Wealth creation could explore the success or lack of success of remittances, financial
     aid, micro credit schemes, trade and market access and debt relief in helping to reduce
     poverty. This can be addressed on any scale and it is not necessary that all are
     addressed. This list is also not exclusive, as the guide allows for any strategy to be
     explored that reduces poverty. These could all be addressed with a gender twist.

     Gender equality could explore the success or lack of success of the MDGs, which
     focused on equity, education and maternal health. Credit responses that explore the
     extent to which affirmative action policies, such as improving women’s access to
     markets (including labour, land and credit) and decision-making (from domestic to
     national) , are successful in the reduction of poverty.

     The most successful strategies tend to be multifaceted, focusing on more than one
     aspect of poverty reduction and recognizing that the effects on gender equality may be
     indirect.

     For band D expect some description of how wealth creation and gender equality can
     help/not help to successfully reduce poverty. This need not be balanced.

     For band E expect either some explanation of how wealth creation and gender equality
     can help/not help to successfully reduce poverty or some evaluation of the extent of
     their success using examples.

     For band F expect both.

6.   “Population growth is the greatest threat to our planet’s soil quality and biodiversity.”
     Discuss this statement.                                                                      [15]

     Candidates can agree or disagree with the statement but need to be able to support
     their position. It is also possible that responses may agree partially with the statement.
     Either of these approaches is acceptable.

     Population growth should be addressed in terms of the regional variations with some
     regions predicted to grow quite rapidly (Sub Saharan Africa) and others being predicted
     to experience negative growth (Japan, Europe).

     Causes of soil degradation and loss of biodiversity of tropical rainforest (allow other
     biomes/ecosystems) should be addressed to assess the extent to which population
     growth is a contributing factor.

     Candidates may also look at alternative threats to our planet’s soil quality and
     biodiversity, such as climate change, how an increasing standard of living results in
     increased consumption irrespective of population growth, the concentration of
     population in urban areas and the expansion of cities, changing agricultural practices,
     pollution, invasive species, poaching etc.

     Responses should make use of examples but responses that focus on describing soil
     quality and biodiversity and not focusing on the role of population growth will be
     self-limiting.

     It is not necessary for the discussion of soil quality and biodiversity to be of
     equal depth for the award of full marks.

     At band D, expect some description of the issues of population growth, soil quality
     and biodiversity.

     At band E, expect either some explanation of a range of threats that population growth
     poses to soil quality and biodiversity or a discussion of why other factors besides
     population growth may be equally or more important in terms of their impacts on soil
     quality and biodiversity.

     At band F, expect both.

7.   “The ecological footprint is the best measure of the relationship between population
     and resources for different countries.” Discuss this statement.                            [15]

     Responses should show an understanding of the ecological footprint and how it is
     calculated and its utility value in measuring the relationship between population and
     resource use in different national contexts.

     Ecological footprint (EF) – The theoretical measurement of the amount of land and
     water a population requires to produce the resources it consumes and to absorb its
     waste under prevailing technology. It is usually measured in global hectares per capita
     – allow other valid ways in which “measurement” can be shown.

     The focus of the essay should be on assessing the reliability of the EF as a measure of
     per capita resource use for different countries. Candidates can agree or disagree with
     the statement but need to be able to support their position. It is also possible that
     responses may take a balanced view and look at the strengths and the weaknesses of
     this as a measure. Responses may give some up-to-date examples/data. They may
     equally suggest alternative methods more suited to measuring the relationship between
     populations and resource consumption. It is also equally acceptable that responses
     refer to the Neo- and anti-Malthusian debate as it is relevant in this context.

     Some possible strengths of the EF as a measure of population–resource relationships
     include:
      easy comparison with other countries
      temporal comparison possible
      as per capita takes into account an individual’s average consumption level
      biocapacity (global hectares)
      feel-good factor/national pride
      helps achieve targets (eg, Paris 2015)
      perceived to be easy to calculate
      increases awareness.

     Some possible weaknesses of the EF as a measure include:
      is only an average per person / extremely wealthy have much larger footprints
      only informative and not a solution
      assumes all of Earth’s biocapacity is for human needs only
      data can be unreliable.

     For band D expect some description of how the EF can help/not help measure a
     country’s population/resource relationship. This need not be balanced.

     For band E expect either some explanation of how the EF can help/not help measure a
     country’s population/resource relationship or some discussion of its effectiveness using
     examples.

     For band F expect both.
