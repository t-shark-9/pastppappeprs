                                                  Section A
1.   (a)   Define the term current assets.                                                         [2]

           Current assets are items either owned by a business or owed to that business
           with a life of less than twelve months.

           Candidates are not expected to word the definition exactly as above.

           N.B. no application required. Do not credit examples on their own, though
           correct examples can provide reinforcement to answers

           Award [1] for a basic definition that conveys partial knowledge and
           understanding.

           Award [2] for a full definition.

     (b)   Using Table 1, calculate Fishers’s net profit before interest and tax for 2017
           (show all your working).                                                                [2]

           Sales revenue  variable costs  fixed costs  net profit before interest and tax
           900 000  (6  75 000)  55 000  $395 000

           To receive [2], candidates must show workings.

     (c)   Using Table 2, calculate the following forecasted figures for 2018:

           (i)     sales revenue;                                                                  [1]

                   $990 000

           (ii)    total variable costs;                                                           [1]

                   $577 500

           (iii)   income tax;                                                                     [1]

                   $65,500

           (iv)    net profit after interest and tax.                                              [1]

                   $262,000

           If a candidate calculates tax before deducting interest expense in question (c)(iii),
           award [0]. The answer is incorrect. However, if the candidate then produces the
           answer $256 000 for (c)(iv), award [1] for that question based upon the OFR.

           Accept responses if candidates do not include 000s: $990, $577.5, $65.5, and
           $262.

           Apply OFR where applicable. Award [1] for each correct answer up to [4].
           Candidates are not required to show workings.

(d)   Explain why Fishers experiences a significant increase in current assets and
      current liabilities from March to October.                                              [2]

      In anticipation of increased sales during the period April through September,
      Fishers must increase production starting in March. Thus, it buys more stock,
      which increases both current assets (stock, which later become debtors) and
      current liabilities (short-term borrowings and creditors). Fishers maintains this
      higher volume of trading (and levels of current assets and current liabilities) until
      sales start to contract in October. In anticipation of lower sales from October
      through March, the reverse of the process above occurs.

      If candidates simply say that the increase is “due to peak sales” (or something
      very similar), do not award credit.

      N.B. Application may be limited or nominal, which is acceptable, provided that the
      response is relevant.

      Award [1] for a basic explanation that conveys partial understanding.

      Award [2] for a full explanation that conveys knowledge and understanding
      similar to the above.

2.   (a)   Define the term unique selling point/proposition (USP).                             [2]
           A unique selling point is any aspect of the organization, brand or product that
           enables differentiation in consumers’ minds from the competitors.

           N.B. no application required. Do not credit examples.

           Award [1] for a basic definition that conveys partial knowledge and
           understanding.

           Award [2] for a full definition that conveys knowledge and understanding similar
           to the answer above.

     (b)   (i)   Construct a fully labelled balance sheet for VT for the end of 2017.          [5]

       Accurate presentation refers to the correct heading, sub-heading and to the
       inclusion of all and only the relevant figures.

       Allow OFR.

       [0]
       The B/S does not reach a standard described below.

       [1–2]
       The B/S is not accurately constructed, and/or the calculations within and
       between the various components are not presented or largely incorrect.
       However, there is limited evidence of a general understanding of the format

       [3–4]
       The principal elements of the B/S are constructed, but may not be entirely
       accurate. The calculations under each heading/component/part are largely
       correct.

       Allow up to two mistakes in calculations and/or presentation for [3].
       Allow for either one error in calculation or one error in presentation [4].
       For an accurately constructed B/S with incorrect calculations, award up to a
       maximum of [3].

       Allow OFR.

       For example, if one irrelevant figure that belongs to the P/L account is
       added, obviously the rest will not match.

       [5]
       The B/S is accurately constructed in the expected IBO format. All the
       relevant headings of each component/ parts are used and correctly
       classified. Do not penalise for internal order of classification. All and only
       the relevant figures are presented. No extra irrelevant figures that belong
       to the P/L are included.

       Deduct [1] for one omission including the overall heading provided the B/S
       is accurately balanced.

(c)   Explain one way VT could improve its liquidity.                                      [2]

      Ways VT could improve liquidity include:
      • attempt to operate with a lower re-order level of stock
      • sell fixed assets and lease long-term assets
      • pay less in dividends
      • raise capital, either more share capital or long-term debt.

      Accept any other acceptable and relevant means to improve liquidity.

      If a candidate proposes negotiating longer trade terms with VT’s creditors, award
      [1]. This response is theoretically correct if all of the funds generated by the
      longer payment terms are used for no other purpose than building cash. Thus,
      while theoretically correct (the ATR would go up), it is not a particularly useful
      approach to the problem.

      N.B. The question provides no real opportunity for application and thus
      application is not expected. However, a response must be relevant to receive full
      marks.

     (b)   Apply the Boston Consult Group (BCG) matrix to JVS’s current product portfolio.              [4]

           Award [1] for a basic answer that shows some understanding of the Boston
           Consulting Group matrix.

           Award [2] for an answer that shows a good understanding of the Boston
           Consulting Group matrix. This may be descriptive or in the form of a drawn
           diagram.

           Award [3] for an answer that shows a good understanding of the Boston
           Consulting Group matrix and places both of JVS’s products (Izzys and IzzDen) in
           their correct segments in a BCG matrix or explains their positions. Izzys is a
           cash cow, IzzDen is a dog.

           If a candidate correctly links the products to the BCG matrix but provides no explanation. Award
           [1] for each correctly linked product up to a maximum of [2].
           Example:
           Izzy – cash cow
           IzzDen – dog
           Award [2].
           For Izzy – star
           IzzDen – dog
           Award [1].

           If a candidate draws the matrix but does not label the axes but otherwise draws it correctly and
           correctly links and explains both products to the matrix, award [3]. If a candidate draws the
           matrix but does not label the axes but otherwise draws it correctly and correctly links one
           product, award [2].

           N.B. Candidates are asked to apply the matrix to JVS’s current product range –
           do not penalize if a candidate also includes their proposed product (IzzLess) and
           places this as a question mark (problem child).

           Award [4] for an answer that shows a good understanding of the Boston
           Consulting Group matrix and places both of JVS’s products (Izzys and IzzDen) in
           their correct segments in a BCG matrix (or explains their positions) AND explains
           clearly why they are in these segments.

(c)   Explain one advantage and one disadvantage for JVS of using focus groups for
      its market research.                                                                  [4]

      Advantages of focus groups include:
      • They can provide detailed information about customer feelings, perceptions
        and opinions. The introduction of Izzless would represent a risky move by
        JVS, as the mass-market product could undermine Izzy’s established
        reputation as “high end”.
      • They are cheaper than performing individual interviews. Already, JVS spends
        more on market research than its competitors. By relying on focus groups
        rather than individual interviews, JVS can get detailed information at a lower
        cost than individual interviews.
      • They provide opportunities to clarify any issues or problems. The target
        market of Izzless is 15 to 19-year-olds, many of whom have low incomes.
        JVS has limited to no experience with this group. Focus groups, which allow
        for dialogue and back-and-forth, can allow JVS to get a clearer idea of issues
        and potential obstacles.

      Disadvantages of focus groups include:
      • They can be hard to control and manage. JVS will probably have two different
         types of focus groups: its traditional customers and the new 15 to 19-year-old
         group who would buy Izzless. Especially with the latter group, controlling and
         managing them could prove challenging.
      • the results are difficult to analyse. Focus group feedback can be inconsistent
         and contradictory, a problem made worse because of the young age of
         participants.
      • Members may not reveal their own feelings but are swayed by the majority
         view. This potential problem is true of any focus group but is especially
         heightened for the product Izzless. Teenagers tend to be more swayed by
         peer pressure than other groups.
      • They may not be representative of the target market as a whole. Unless JVS
         is willing to go to considerable expense to have focus group participants flown
         in from across its market area (all of Europe), participants are likely to come
         from a handful of cities, or as few as one or two cities. These participants may
         not be representative of the whole market.

      Accept any other relevant advantage/disadvantage. However, advantages and
      disadvantages that could apply to any form of market research should not be
      credited.

      Accept any other relevant explanation.

      N.B. Just using the name JVS does not constitute application to the stimulus.

      Mark as 2  2.

      Award [1] for each correct advantage/disadvantage identified or described and
      [1] for a relevant explanation with application to JVS. Award up to a maximum
      of [2].

      Candidates should not be awarded [2] per advantage/disadvantage if the
      response lacks either explanation or application.

(d)   Recommend whether JVS should launch the new product, Izzless.                        [10]

      JVS currently only has two products in its portfolio and will cease production of
      one of them, IzzDen, later this year. A business with just one product puts itself
      in a dangerous position, as if demand for that product falls the business could
      faces losses and possibly failure.

      The launch of the new product would take the business into a new market
      targeting low-income young consumers want to purchase fashion shorts. It would
      also broaden JVS's distribution channels as it would now use mass market retail
      discount stores and online delivery – at present the business only sells through
      high end independent retailers. Low-income consumers may relish the chance to
      buy shorts that have a brand name that is associated with high quality and
      designer fashion at affordable prices – this may give JVS a competitive edge in
      this highly competitive market.

      However, the move is not without risk. The market is very competitive and JVS’s
      products may not be able to establish a foothold in the market. There is also the
      danger that this new product may impact of the sales of their cash cow, Izzys.
      This down-market product may damage its brand image, which, according to a
      marketing expert, is one of the business’s major strengths. It would end up with
      two products aimed at very different markets using premium prices for one
      product and competitive pricing for the other – this clash of images may not work.
      Perhaps JVS should consider launching a range of shorts at their current target
      market and work to its strengths.

      Marks should be allocated according to the markbands on page 3 with further
      guidance below.

      A balanced response is one that provides at least two arguments for and two
      arguments against the option of launching the new range of shorts, Izzless.

      For one relevant issue that is one-sided, award up to [3]. For more than one
      relevant issue that is one-sided, award up to a maximum of [4].

      Award a maximum of [6] if the answer is of a standard that shows balanced
      analysis and understanding throughout the response with reference to the
      stimulus material but there is no judgment/conclusion.

      Candidates cannot reach the [7–8] markband if they give judgment/conclusions
      that are not based on analysis/explanation already given in their answer.

4.   (a)   Describe one role of a vision statement for HS.                                              [2]

           A vision statement for HS is likely to help the organization set its short-term and
           long-term objectives. It is likely to act as an important driver for recruitment,
           selection and motivation of its young unskilled workforce made up of school
           leavers.

           Award [1] for describing one role of a vision statement. Award an additional [1]
           when candidates apply their response to the stimulus.

           N.B. Do not reward responses suggesting that one of the roles of a vision
           statement is to promote the business.

     (b)   Explain how the following can benefit HS:

           (i)    job enlargement;                                                                      [2]

                  Job enlargement will increase the range of skills and tasks able to be
                  performed by the school leavers who may lack direct experience of working
                  in a national chain and/or batch production. As recruits will hopefully
                  become future managers, it will be important for effective future leadership
                  in the stores to have experience in all jobs offered by HS.

                  Award [1] for identification of an appropriate benefit and an additional [1] for an
                  explanation of the benefit and application to the stimulus. Application may not be merely
                  nominal. Be sure that the candidate is explaining the benefit to HS.


           (ii)   intrapreneurship.                                                                     [2]

                  Intrapreneurship allows for risk taking, creativity and innovation within HS.
                  Given the intense competition from the global fast food restaurants, the
                  opportunity to develop new healthy snacks will be vital to maintain market
                  share.

                  Award [1] for identification of an appropriate benefit and an additional [1] for an
                  explanation of the benefit and application to the stimulus. Candidates do not have to
                  define what a vision statement is. Rather, they should describe a role. For [2],
                  candidates must also link that role to goals or aims.
                  Application may not be merely nominal. Be sure that the candidate is explaining the
                  benefit to HS.

(c)   Explain two possible economies of scale available to global fast food restaurants
      but not HS.                                                                            [4]

      Possible economies of scale available to the global fast food restaurants include:

      Marketing economies of scale: the global fast food companies are likely through
      their global reach to experience significant economies of scale in
      marketing/selling across a whole range of markets. HS is a national chain and
      will not be able to spread advertising costs, for example, across a whole range of
      markets. Unit costs of marketing will be much lower for the global restaurants.

      Bulk-buying economies of scale: to develop and meet global demand and to fill
      supply chains, global fast food manufacturers are likely to achieve significant
      economies through the bulk-purchase of raw ingredients (a number of fast food
      manufacturers have vertically integrated with suppliers to ensure that logistics are
      in place). Again, unit costs of operations are likely to be lower than HS’s.

      Financial economies of scale: being present in global markets allows global fast
      food manufacturers to borrow funds for expansion at much lower rates than a
      national chain. It is indicated in the stimulus that HS finances its training and
      professional development through retained profits.

      Accept any other relevant economy of scale.

      N.B. Economies of scale may be without the exact name. For example, “bulk
      buying discounts” is rewardable. Candidates do not have to say purchasing
      economies of scale.

      Mark as a 2  2.

      Award [1] for identification of an appropriate economy of scale and an additional
      [1] for an explanation and application to the stimulus. Application may not be
      merely nominal.

      Maximum award per economy of scale: [2]
                                             – 18 –              M18/3/BUSMT/SP2/ENG/TZ0/XX/M


(d)   Discuss the two options that Tom is considering for HS in response to the intense
      competition.                                                                          [10]

      The first option, which is to implement flow production, is likely to lead to an
      increase in production and productivity because of the new technology and
      specialized roles. Currently, HS uses batch production. With improved
      productivity, HS can increase its portion size without raising prices. As a result,
      HS may be able to compete more effectively with the global fast food
      manufacturers.

      However, the introduction of flow production may result in a reduction in the
      opportunities for job enrichment and intrapreneurship. If the new production
      process is going to lead to specific jobs on the production, then apart from job
      enlargement or rotation, the current employees may become demotivated
      through a restriction on personal growth and development opportunities. Staff
      turnover may increase as employees seek more innovative or challenging work.
      It is likely to be expensive to implement flow production both in terms of the
      financing and inevitable changes in organizational culture at HS.

      The second option may be quicker to organize and much cheaper. The online
      reality TV show will have established HS firmly in the minds of existing and
      potential customers. A social media campaign will amplify the brand value of HS
      and should increase market share.

      However, measuring the success of social media on market share will be difficult
      even though the target market should be familiar with this method of promotion.
      The biggest factor against this campaign, however, is that as a competitive tool
      against the global manufacturers there will still be this perceived difference in
      portion size. A social media campaign will not address this aspect. In fact, there
      is a danger that negative response to the campaign make reduce market share
      even further.

      Both of the responses have some merit, but it would appear that the first option is
      the most appropriate to tackle the issue of competition with the global fast food
      manufacturers. The changes in the production process will take some time to
      bed in and a few staff may leave to work for other snack food manufacturers who
      have more dynamic or challenging roles. However, the social media campaign
      will not close the perceived gap between the products offered by HS and those
      offered by their competitors and, thus, could backfire.

      While the candidates are not expected to recommend an option (the question
      does not ask them to), they should come to conclusions and judgments (for top
      marks). Candidates may conclude that either option is better or they may
      conclude that HS should do both, given that Option 2 would not be very
      expensive.

5.   (a)   Define the term public sector.                                                       [2]

           The public sector involves those areas of the economy that are provided by the
           government and typically include what is deemed government itself (local,
           regional, state, national) and the various services provided by government,
           including education, health care, public transportation, police, fire brigades and
           other functions.

           Award [1] for a basic definition that conveys partial knowledge and understanding
           or if the candidate merely writes the formula for calculating contribution.

           Award [2] for a full, clear definition that conveys knowledge and understanding.

     (b)   Explain one advantage and one disadvantage for CSS of introducing an
           employee share ownership scheme.                                                     [4]

           Advantages of introducing an employee share ownership scheme include:
           • employees have a greater economic stake in the business and, thus, may be
             more motivated
           • CSS has a means to offer additional compensation to employees that does
             not increase salary/bonus expenses
           • employee share ownership plans usually decrease labour turnover and make
             it easier to recruit people.

           Disadvantages of introducing an employee share ownership scheme include:
           • management of CSS, Ebru, will have to answer to shareholders other than
              herself
           • once the plan is in place, it will have administrative and legal costs
           • if the business is not publicly traded, valuation of shares may prove difficult.

           Accept any other relevant advantage or disadvantage.

           Mark as a 2  2.

           Award [1] for identification of an appropriate advantage/disadvantage and an
           additional [1] for an explanation and application to the stimulus. Application may
           not be merely nominal.

           Maximum award per advantage/disadvantage: [2]

(c)   Explain one advantage and one disadvantage for CSS of implementing a
      project-based organizational structure (Change 1).                                   [4]

      Advantages for CSS of implementing a project-based organizational structure
      include:
      • improved communication between people with different areas of expertise
      • sense of teamwork, which can increase motivation.

      Disadvantages for CSS of implementing a project-based organizational structure
      include:
      • blurred lines of authority, which may create confusing circumstances for
         employees
      • often, project-based structures are more expensive than traditional structures,
         as there may be dual levels of management, one on the team and one over
         groups of teams
      • potential for internal conflict within a team.

      (Change 3).                                                                            [10]

      Adams’s equity theory asserts that employee motivation emerges out of
      employees’ perceived sense of fairness, both between the employee and the firm
      and among the employees. With respect to the firm, employees must believe
      that an equitable relationship exists between their inputs (hours work, effort, etc)
      and outputs (compensation, benefits, etc). With respect to other employees, an
      employee must believe that fairness exists: that there is an equitable relationship
      between the inputs of other employees and their outputs.

      Daniel Pink’s theory of motivation rests on the notion of autonomy, mastery, and
      purpose. Money is not the chief motivator of professional level employees, but
      rather their desire for autonomy (or near autonomy) in the workplace, their ability
      to master their profession or skill set, and their sense of doing something with
      purpose beyond themselves.

      The elimination of PRP could affect some employees’ sense of equity. If, before
      the elimination, employees had considered that an equitable relationship existed
      between inputs and outputs, they now might think that the relationship is no
      longer equitable, especially if they continued to work on CSS-assigned projects
      during their 20 % dream project time. Though elimination of PRP would save
      CSS money, it may negatively affect the motivation of some employees.

      On the other hand, Daniel Pink’s theory helps to explain why some employees
      like the changes, especially the introduction of the 20 % dream project time. To
      these employees, money was not the most important consideration, but having
      the freedom and flexibility to pursue their own ideas. They would have, at least
      during the 20 % time, autonomy. The time would allow them to strengthen their
      skill set in areas where they were weak or to work on issues that played to the
      skills they had already mastered. And, by working on a dream project, they had a
      greater sense of purpose. Giving employees 20 % of their time to work on
      whatever they wanted has the potential to be costly in terms of CSS’s core
      activities. The question is whether it will sufficiently improve employee motivation
      to make up for the time lost or if it will lead to some valuable new products and
      services.

      Accept any other relevant evaluation.

      Marks should be allocated according to the markbands on page 5 with further
      guidance below.

      For one of the two motivation theories that is one-sided, award up to [3]. For
      more than one relevant motivation theories that is one-sided, award up to a
      maximum of [4].

      If a candidate evaluates / addresses only one motivation theory, award a
      maximum of [5].

      Award a maximum of [6] if the answer is of a standard that shows balanced
      analysis and understanding throughout the response with reference to the
      stimulus material but there is no judgment/conclusion.

  Candidates cannot reach the [7–8] markband if they give judgment/conclusions that
   are not based on analysis/explanation already given in their answer.Section C

Questions 6–8. Please mark the candidate response using the assessment criteria on
pages 6–7.

6.    With reference to an organization of your choice, examine the impact of globalization
      on human resources strategy.                                                             [20]

7.    With reference to an organization of your choice, examine the impact of ethics on
      organizational change.                                                                   [20]

8.    With reference to an organization of your choice, examine the impact of innovation
      and culture on an organization.                                                          [20]

N.B. When the question asks for the application of one concept on another, it is still
expected that Business Management content will be aligned with the concepts especially the
second concept (the one being acted on).

Please note that candidates can conclude that there was a minimal impact, however it has to
be based on balanced arguments and evaluation.

Additional guidance in relation to the assessment criteria
For each criterion, the aim is to find the descriptor that conveys most accurately the level
attained by the candidate, using the best-fit model. It is not necessary for every single
aspect of a level descriptor to be met for that mark to be awarded.

• The highest-level descriptors do not imply faultless performance and should be achievable
  by a candidate.
• A candidate who attains a high level of achievement for one criterion will not necessarily
  reach high levels of achievement for the other criteria and vice versa.

If only one concept is addressed:
• Criteria A, B, C and E: award up to a maximum [3].
• Criterion D: full marks can be awarded.

Where the question asks for impacts of two concepts on content, examiners must allow for
unbalanced treatment of the two concepts throughout a candidate’s response. One concept
may be more significant than the other.

Criterion B
For [1]: “…connection is inappropriate” – ignore superficial.
For [2]: “…connection is not developed” should be treated the same as superficial.

Criterion C
1  1 arguments are expected per concepts.
• Questions 6 and 7 require consideration of the impact of one concept on a second
   concept – therefore accept 2  2 arguments for a balanced response.
• Justification is through logic or data.
• For [2] there is no balance as there are no counter arguments at all, or the arguments are
   all one-sided then this would be unjustified.
• For [3] there are some balanced arguments – some of which are justified.

Criterion D
• Introductions need to be concise and related to the question.
• The candidate’s response does not to have explicit headings for each structural element.
• A body is the area in which the substance of arguments occurs. It is usually located
   between the introduction and the conclusion.
• Fit-for-purpose paragraph means that ideas are presented in a clear academic way. For
   example, one idea per paragraph.

Criterion E
• One example of an “individual” could be an individual consumer or an individual manager.
   However, this cannot be considered with a “group” of consumers or a management team.
• For [4], a balanced response: look at the perspectives of both individual and group(s).
• The chosen individual, group needs to be applicable and relevant to the question with
   specific explanation.
• Candidates need to go beyond stating the stakeholder.

Candidates need not explicitly say “stakeholder”.

If a candidate chooses an organization from another part of the exam (for example, an organization in
the stimulus of section B), their response should be marked as follows:

Criterion A – Award a maximum of [1], as the candidate might understand the essence of the two
concepts but the content selected is irrelevant as the organisation is fictitious but the candidate may
display some understanding of the concepts.

Criterion B – Award [0], as there is no connection to a real organization.

Criterion C – Award a maximum of [1]. The arguments cannot be relevant and justified as the
organisation is fictitious.

Criterion D – Mark as normal.

Criterion E –Award [0]. The individual and/or group perspective(s) cannot be relevant if the organisation
is fictitious.
