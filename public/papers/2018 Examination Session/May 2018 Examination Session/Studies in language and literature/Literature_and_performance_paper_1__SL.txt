Answer one question. Refer closely to the novel you have selected to study, a copy of which may be
brought into the examination.

1.   Select a passage from a novel you have chosen to study where a significant symbol or symbolic
     action is foregrounded or developed. Discuss how you would stage a scene that in some way
     makes clear the importance and power of that symbolic material.


2.   Select a passage from a novel you have chosen to study that shows a turning point in the plot and
     consequently affects the fate of one or more characters. Outline a dramatic proposal that would
     aim to make clear both the nature of the turning point and the response of some characters to the
     shift.


3.   Select a passage from a novel you have chosen to study that offers some prediction or
     foreshadowing either of later events or of the development of a character. Show how you would
     stage a scene that offers these elements of anticipation or foreshadowing.
