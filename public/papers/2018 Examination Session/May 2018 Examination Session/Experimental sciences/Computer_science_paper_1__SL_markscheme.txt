                                              Section A
1.   (a)   Award [2] for one method that is suitable for the given scenario.

           Answers may include:
           Interviews could be held (with the librarian/stakeholders);
           To establish the functions required by the system;

           Direct observation could be made of the users/students using the present
           system;
           To gain an insight on how the library is being used;                         [2 max]

     (b)   Allows stakeholders to gain an idea of how the system would be/work/look;
           so they can provide feedback / suggest improvements;                             [2]


2.   Holds (a copy of) the contents of the memory;
     Which are to be transferred from/to memory to/from other CPU components;
     Allowing the processor and memory to act independently/processor not affected by
     differences in the speed of operation;                                             [2 max]


3.   2 hex = 4 + 4 = 8 bits;
     hence 2^8/16^2/256 colours;
     Note: Allow [2] for 16^2 = 256 colours with no workings and also ONLY 256              [2]


4.   Award [3] as follows:
     The function of the memory management [1].
     An example if its use [1].
     Reason for the importance [1].

     Example:
     Allocates and de-allocates memory/ assignes blocks of memory to programs;
     Ensures a program has sufficient memory to run/manages virtual memory if needed;
     To avoid overwriting /clashing of programs/optimise system performance/maximise
     memory usage                                                                           [3]

5.   Award [3] as follows:
     Clearly a logic diagram with 2 inputs, 1 output and 3 logic gates [1];
     OR gate has two inputs one of which is NOT A [1] and the other is A AND B [1]




                                                                                                    [3]
6.   It contains a set amount of data;
     It contains a fixed structure (or identify elements of the structure other than data);
     It contains data that is to be sent via a communications channel;
     It contains specific details for transmission e.g. address of sender and receiver, error
     codes etc.;                                                                                [2 max]

     Award 2 marks if two of the contents of a packet are given and expanded

7.   Protocols are a set of rules;
     (That are used) so that both sender and receiver are using/expecting the same
     formats/methods;
     To allow data to be transmitted successfully / without errors;                                 [3]

8.   47, 23, 11
     Award [1] per output.
     Note: Allow FT if either of the first two outputs are wrong.                                   [3]


9.   For example, [2 max] if no application given;
     Searching through a database of names;
     That contains a large amount of data;
     That is already sorted;
     And needs to be searched in the least amount of time;
     Is faster because binary search divides and searches smaller blocks of data/does not
     have to compare each element in the list;                                                  [3 max]

                                                  Section B
10.   (a)   Award marks for a response which indicates the logical steps that have to be followed.

            Award [5 max] as follows:
            Iterate through the appointments file;
            Check for correct day;
            Repeat for each appointment on that day;
            Using the patient ID for that appointment;
            Iterate through the patients file until record for that ID found;
            Retrieve phone number and send out SMS;

            Example:
            loop for every appointment in the appointments file
               if the appointment is for the correct day
                   Store patient ID
                      loop until found in the patients file
                         if patient ID (patients file) = patient ID (appointments file)
                             get phone number from patient’s file to send SMS
                         end if
                      end loop
               end if
            end loop

            Note: Candidates are not requested to construct the (algorithm in) pseudocode.       [5 max]

      (b)   Award [1] for method and [1] for description – only accept TWO methods.
            Mark as [2] and [2].

            Printouts can be kept of transactions;

            Transaction Log file;
            Written for each transaction can be used to restore;

            Accept any reasonable methods described including second server and cloud
            use.                                                                                 [4 max]

(c)   There are 2 possible issues here: who has what level of access to the data in the
      hospital and whether storing in the cloud is safer than storing locally.

      For each of these 2 issues award [3 max] as follows:
      Award [1] for identifying the issue.
      Award [1] for some valid development of the issue.
      Award [1] for a suitable discussion.

      Example answers could include reference to the following but this is not an
      exclusive list. Award marks for any two reasonable issues discussed – one of
      which is access and the other security.

      Official access to the data [3 max]:
      Access to this sensitive data must be restricted.
      Only those directly concerned can be able to access it.
      Even less people should be able to edit it.
      Therefore access levels should be set up, with strong levels of authentication.
      Physical access to servers should be controlled if using the local system;

      Data security [3 max]:
      Is the data safer stored locally or on the cloud?
      Cloud service providers are professionals – they should have stronger security
      than a hospital system.
      What track record / reputation does the cloud service provider have?
      If patient data could be sold/inspected, then both the patient and hospital could
      suffer serious consequences.
      Is the cloud governed by appropriate privacy laws?
      Is it located internationally or is it governed by the laws of the country in
      question?
      Could be intercepted in transmission;                                               [6 max]

11.   (a)   Processes/task are carried out simultaneously/at the same time;                        [1]

      (b)   Install connectors on wall of server room AND Install connector on wall of new
            office space;

            OR

            Test the cabling AND Connect the new computers with the cabling;                   [1 max]

      (c)   Any pair of tasks that are NOT a correct answer to part (b);                       [1 max]

      (d)   Award [1] for stating an advantage, [1] for expansion/example in context.
            Mark as [2] and [2]

            Answers may include:
            Use on the move;
            More versatile staff encouraged to collaborate etc.;

            Allows BYOD:
            Which could lead to greater productivity (as familiarity with device);

            No extra equipment is needed for expansion after initial set-up;
            Which will save the company time and money;

            Reduces wiring;
            Therefore improved safety for employees;                                           [4 max]

      (e)   Mark as [2] and [2].

            The data can be intercepted as it goes through “the air”;
            Can be resolved by strong encryption/protocols;
            WPA-2 / a description of WPA-2;
            Use of trusted MAC addresses;
            Regular changes of router password; [2 max]

            BYOD issues leading to insecure devices;
            Clear company policy regarding use;
            Use of sand-box;
            Only approved devices allowed;
            MAC addresses – only adding clean and tested devices brought in by staff;
            Installation of MDM services;
            Authentication (user ID + password on all devices including BYOD);
            Security features added by company; [2 max]                                        [4 max]

      (f)   A VPN/tunneling allows the employee’s device to appear to be part of / a node of
            the internal company network;
            Thus affording him/her full access to the network resources;

            Data that passes through a VPN can be encrypted;
            So any unauthorized access will not be able to understand the data;

            Tunnelling allows the company’s own protocols to be used/IPsec/TSL ensure
            security;
            Even though the data is passing over an outside network;

            Multiple exit nodes / hidden IP addresses/encrypted connections;
            Make it hard to distinguish where the data was generated;                          [4 max]

(c)   The following are two alternative approaches. Most solutions should fit one or the
      other markscheme. Do not penalise those who introduce separate variables
      instead of arrays.

      Example 1:

      MAXAV = 0
        X = (P_ARRAY.length) - 1
        MAXDAY
        loop for DAY from 0 to 6
           SUM = 0
           COUNTER = 0
           loop for C from DAY to X //loop while C < X
             SUM = SUM + P_ARRAY[C]
             COUNTER = COUNTER + 1
             C = C + 6 // C = C + 7 or allow step 7 in the loop
           end loop
           if SUM/COUNTER > MAXAV
             MAXAV = SUM/COUNTER
             MAXDAY = DAY
           end if
        end loop
      output convert(MAXDAY)

      Award [1] for correct initialization of numerical variables (eg MAXAV, COUNTER, SUM).
      Award [1] for correct loop through each day.
      Award [1] for correct for loop through array.
      Award [1] for incrementing array position by 7 each time.
      Award [1] for calculation of average (SUM/COUNTER).
      Award [1] for comparing this with MAXAV.
      Award [1] for adjusting MAXAV and MAXDAY if necessary.
      Award [1] for correct use of CONVERT sub-procedure.                                 [7 max]

Example 2:

MAXDAY = 0
DAYSUM ARRAY
WEEKS ARRAY
COUNT = 0

while COUNT < P_ARRAY.length //loop through p.array
  DAY = COUNT MOD 7
  WEEKS[DAY] = WEEKS[DAY] + 1 //add number of weeks for this day
  DAYSUM[DAY] = DAYSUM[day] + P_ARRAY[COUNT]
  COUNT = COUNT + 1
end while
COUNT = 0 //reinitialize
while COUNT < DAYSUM.length //loop through dayArray can also be
                            //a for loop as there are 7 days.
  if DAYSUM[COUNT] / WEEKS[COUNT] > MAXDAY //find maxDay
     MAXDAY = COUNT
  end if
  COUNT = COUNT + 1
end while
output convert(MAXDAY)
