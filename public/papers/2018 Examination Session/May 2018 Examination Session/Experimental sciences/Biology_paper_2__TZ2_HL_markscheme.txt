Extended response questions – quality mark

     •   Extended response questions for HLP2 each carry a mark total of [16]. Of these marks, [15] are awarded for content and [1] for the quality
         of the answer.

     •   [1] for quality is awarded when:
          •   the candidate’s answers are clear enough to be understood without re-reading.
          •   the candidate has answered the question succinctly with little or no repetition or irrelevant material.
