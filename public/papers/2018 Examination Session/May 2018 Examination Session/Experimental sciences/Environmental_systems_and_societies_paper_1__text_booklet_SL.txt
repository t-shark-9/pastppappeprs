yy Madagascar is the fourth largest island in the world. It is located in the Indian Ocean, off the eastern
   coast of Mozambique, Africa.
yy The population is approximately 24 million (July 2016).
yy In 2016, the crude birth rate was 32.1/1000 population and crude death rate was 6.7/1000 population.
yy The main employment sectors are agriculture, fisheries and forestry.
yy Exports include textiles, nickel and produce such as coffee, vanilla, sugar and shellfish.
yy Areas of forest are being cleared for:
      ○○ Traditional farming – most of the population relies on traditional subsistence farming
      ○○ Timber – hardwoods such as ebony and rosewood are of high economic value
      ○○ Charcoal production – spiny bush wood is commonly used for charcoal production.
yy Soil erosion is a serious problem in Madagascar. In some areas, up to 363 tonnes/ha/year of soil are
   being lost.

yyMadagascar is home to a diverse range of ecosystems including tropical rainforests, mangroves and
  coral reefs.
yyThe island contains 5 % of the world’s biodiversity.
yyThere are over 200 000 known species in Madagascar of which more than 80 % are endemic to the
  island (endemic species are those species not found anywhere else).
yyMany species are hunted and collected as pets (for example lemurs, chameleons and tortoises).
yyAlien species (for example introduced fish Tilapia) threaten native species (for example endemic
  cichlid fish species).

yyAye-aye are a species of lemur.
yyThese nocturnal (active at night) primates live in trees.
yyThey feed on insects, fruits, nuts and fungi.
yyIn some areas they are killed because:
     ○○ they are believed to be evil and bring bad luck
     ○○ farmers consider them to be a pest, as they eat crops
     ○○ they are a source of food.
yyAye-aye were considered to be extinct in 1933 but populations were rediscovered in 1957.
yyThey are classified as endangered on the IUCN Red List.

yyMaMaBay includes Makira and Masoala National Parks and Antongil Bay shown in Figure 8(b).
yyMasoala National Park was created in 1997 and Makira National Park in 2012.
yyForest within the Antongil Bay watershed contains about 50 % of the island’s biodiversity.
yyAntongil Conservation, an NGO, aims to:
      ○○ preserve diversity of forests
      ○○ develop ecotourism (tourism in which visitors are attracted to see wildlife, has minimal adverse
         impacts on the environment, and supports conservation efforts and local people)
      ○○ create alternative farming methods and income generation for local people.
yyThe bay is home to a wide variety of marine life which includes:
      ○○ 11 whale species
      ○○ 19 shark species
      ○○ over 110 fish species
      ○○ 3 turtle species.
yyIt is an important breeding ground for humpback whales.
yyThe coastal and marine ecosystem is under threat from high levels of fishing including illegal fishing,
  depletion of mangrove forest and sediment from river inputs.
yyThe island of Nosy Mangabe within Antongil Bay provides a sanctuary for the threatened aye-aye.

yyThe high level of biodiversity makes Madagascar an attractive location for further development of
  ecotourism.
yyThe World Travel and Tourism Council predicts that the tourist industry will increase at an average
  rate of 1.1 % per year and will support 912 000 jobs (13.2 % of total employment) by 2025.
