Maximum marks will be given for correct answers. Where an answer is incorrect, some marks may
be given for a correct method, provided this is shown by written working. Answers must be written within
the answer boxes provided. Solutions found from a graphic display calculator should be supported by
suitable working, for example, if graphs are used to find a solution, you should sketch these as part of
your answer.

1.   Each year the soccer team, Peterson United, plays 25 games at their home stadium.
     The owner of Peterson United claimed that last year the mean attendance per game at their
     home stadium was 24 500.

     (a)   Based on the owner’s claim, calculate the total attendance for the games at
           Peterson United’s home stadium last year.                                                                              [2]

     The actual total attendance last year was 617 700.

     (b)   Calculate the percentage error in the owner’s claim.                                                                   [2]

     (c)   Write down your answer to part (b) in the form a × 10k where 1 ≤ a < 10 , k∈ .                                        [2]

4.    A scientist measures the concentration of dissolved oxygen, in milligrams per litre  ( y) , in a river.
      She takes 10 readings at different temperatures, measured in degrees Celsius (x) .

      The results are shown in the table.

      It is believed that the concentration of dissolved oxygen in the river varies linearly with
      the temperature.

      (a)   For these data, find

		          (i)    Pearson’s product-moment correlation coefficient, r ;

      (b)   Using the equation of the regression line, estimate the concentration of dissolved
            oxygen in the river when the temperature is 18 C .                                                                           [2]

7.   Sergei is training to be a weightlifter. Each day he trains at the local gym by lifting a metal
     bar that has heavy weights attached. He carries out successive lifts. After each lift, the same
     amount of weight is added to the bar to increase the weight to be lifted.

     The weights of each of Sergei’s lifts form an arithmetic sequence.

     Sergei’s friend, Yuri, records the weight of each lift. Unfortunately, last Monday,
     Yuri misplaced all but two of the recordings of Sergei’s lifts.

     On that day, Sergei lifted 21 kg on the third lift and 46 kg on the eighth lift.

     (a)   For that day

9.   In an experiment, a number of fruit flies are placed in a container. The population of fruit
     flies, P , increases and can be modelled by the function

 P (t) = 12 × 30.498t , t ≥ 0 ,
	 

     where t is the number of days since the fruit flies were placed in the container.

     (a)   Find the number of fruit flies

		         (i)    which were placed in the container;

		         (ii)   that are in the container after 6 days.                                                                             [4]

     The maximum capacity of the container is 8000 fruit flies.

     (b)   Find the number of days until the container reaches its maximum capacity.                                                  [2]

11.   Matryoshka dolls, or Russian dolls, are similarly designed dolls which open up and fit
      inside each other.

      The height of the largest piece in this set is 54 cm. The heights of successive smaller dolls
      are 94 % of the preceding larger doll, as shown.

13.   Malthouse school opens at 08:00 every morning.

      The daily arrival times of the 500 students at Malthouse school follow a normal distribution.
      The mean arrival time is 52 minutes after the school opens and the standard deviation
      is 5 minutes.

      (a)   Find the probability that a student, chosen at random

		          (i)   arrives at least 60 minutes after the school opens;

		(ii)            arrives between 45 minutes and 55 minutes after the school opens.                                                   [4]

      A second school, Mulberry Park, also opens at 08:00 every morning. The arrival times of the
      students at this school follows exactly the same distribution as Malthouse school.

15.   Consider the functions f (x) = x4 - 2 and g (x) = x3 - 4x2 + 2x + 6 .

      The functions intersect at points P and Q. Part of the graph of y = f (x) and part of the graph
      of y = g (x) are shown on the diagram.
