Please start each question on a new page. Full marks are not necessarily awarded for a correct answer
with no working. Answers must be supported by working and/or explanations. In particular,
solutions found from a graphic display calculator should be supported by suitable working. For example,
if graphs are used to find a solution, you should sketch these as part of your answer. Where an answer
is incorrect, some marks may be given for a correct method, provided this is shown by written working.
You are therefore advised to show all working.

     the roads connecting them can be represented by a graph. Each vertex represents a town,

     using that road. The information is shown in the adjacency table.

(Question 8 continued)

     (b)   Two friends A and B play a ball game with the following rules.

           Each player starts with zero points. Player A serves first and then the players have
           alternate pairs of serves so that the service order is A , B , B , A , A , … When player
           A serves, the probability of her scoring 1 point is pA and the probability of B scoring 1
           point is qA , where qA = 1 - pA .

           When player B serves, the probability of her scoring 1 point is pB and the probability of
           A scoring 1 point is qB , where qB = 1 - pB .

           Show that, after the first 6 serves, the probability that each player has 3 points is
                                                2
                                         x =3
                                              3
                                        ∑      ( p A ) ( pB ) ( q A ) ( qB ) .
                                                        x      x       3− x   3− x
                                                                                                       [5]
                                        x =0  x 


     (c)   After 6 serves the score is 3 points each. Play continues and the game ends when
           one player has scored two more points than the other player. Let N be the number of
           further serves required before the game ends. Given that pA = 0.7 and pB = 0.6 find
           P(N = 2) .                                                                                  [3]


                        1
     (d)   Let M =        N . Show that M has a geometric distribution and hence find the value
                        2
           of E(N ) .                                                                                  [7]
