Please start each question on a new page. Full marks are not necessarily awarded for a correct answer
with no working. Answers must be supported by working and/or explanations. In particular, solutions
found from a graphic display calculator should be supported by suitable working. For example, if
graphs are used to find a solution, you should sketch these as part of your answer. Where an answer
is incorrect, some marks may be given for a correct method, provided this is shown by written working.
You are therefore advised to show all working.

     The weights, X kg, of the males of a species of bird may be assumed to be normally
     distributed with mean 4.8 kg and standard deviation 0.2 kg.

     (a)   Find the probability that a randomly chosen male bird weighs between 4.75 kg and
           4.85 kg.                                                                                      [1]

     The weights, Y kg, of female birds of the same species may be assumed to be normally
     distributed with mean 2.7 kg and standard deviation 0.15 kg.

     (b)   Find the probability that the weight of a randomly chosen male bird is more than twice
           the weight of a randomly chosen female bird.                                                  [6]

     (c)   Two randomly chosen male birds and three randomly chosen female birds are placed
           on a weighing machine that has a weight limit of 18 kg. Find the probability that the
           total weight of these five birds is greater than the weight limit.                            [4]

     Consider an unbiased tetrahedral (four-sided) die with faces labelled 1, 2, 3 and 4
     respectively.
     The random variable X represents the number of throws required to obtain a 1.

     (a)   State the distribution of X .                                                                 [1]

     (b)   Show that the probability generating function, G(t) , for X is given by G (t ) =          .   [4]

     (d)   Determine the mean number of throws required to obtain a 1.                                   [1]

     A smartphone’s battery life is defined as the number of hours a fully charged battery can be
     used before the smartphone stops working. A company claims that the battery life of a model
     of smartphone is, on average, 9.5 hours. To test this claim, an experiment is conducted on a
     random sample of 20 smartphones of this model. For each smartphone, the battery life,
     b hours, is measured and the sample mean, b , calculated. It can be assumed the battery
     lives are normally distributed with standard deviation 0.4 hours.

     (a)   State suitable hypotheses for a two-tailed test.                                           [1]


     (b)   Find the critical region for testing b at the 5 % significance level.                      [4]

     It is then found that this model of smartphone has an average battery life of 9.8 hours.

     (c)   Find the probability of making a Type II error.                                            [3]

     Another model of smartphone whose battery life may be assumed to be normally distributed
     with mean µ hours and standard deviation 1.2 hours is tested. A researcher measures the
     battery life of six of these smartphones and calculates a confidence interval of [10.2 , 11.4]
     for µ .

     (d)   Calculate the confidence level of this interval.                                           [4]

     The random variables X , Y follow a bivariate normal distribution with product moment
     correlation coefficient ρ .

     (a)   State suitable hypotheses to investigate whether or not a negative linear association
           exists between X and Y .                                                                   [1]

     A random sample of 11 observations on X , Y was obtained and the value of the sample
     product moment correlation coefficient, r , was calculated to be -0.708 .

     (b)   (i)    Determine the p-value.

		         (ii)   State your conclusion at the 1 % significance level.                                [4]

     The covariance of the random variables U , V is defined by
                                 Cov(U , V) = E((U - E(U ))(V - E(V ))) .

     (c)   (i)    Show that Cov(U , V) = E(UV ) - E(U )E(V ) .

		         (ii)   Hence show that if U , V are independent random variables then the population
                  product moment correlation coefficient, ρ , is zero.                                [6]


                                                                                                Turn over

     Let U = nP(1 - P) .

     (b)   (i)    Show that E(U ) = (n - 1)p(1 - p) .
