The translation is assessed in its basic units of clause and sentence. To this end, the original text is
chunked in a fixed number of sections (or “sense units”), 15 at SL and 30 at HL. Every section is
awarded two separate marks according to the two descriptors outlined below.

Each section is awarded 0 to 3 marks for descriptor A (Meaning) and 0 to 3 marks for descriptor B
(Vocabulary & Grammar).

The range of marks for each section is therefore 0 to 6, while the maximum number of marks for the
whole text is 90 at SL (15 sections  6 marks).

Criterion A (Meaning) assesses how well the meaning of each sense unit has been communicated.

Criterion B (Vocabulary & Grammar) assesses how correctly vocabulary and grammar have been
rendered in relation to each sense unit. The term “grammar” here includes syntax and accidence.

As a guideline, criterion A tends to look at the translation as a whole (eg stylistic, literal and idiomatic
meanings conveyed), while criterion B tends to assess the conformity of the single section with the
original text (eg grammatical accuracy of translation, apparent understanding of source language syntax
and vocabulary).

While it may not always be possible to give the full range of marks for a single sense unit, the range of
marks necessary for differentiation is present over the whole exam.

By way of example, the marking of different translations of the sense unit causa quae sit videtis found in a
Cicero passage (SL specimen papers) would be as follows:
 “You see what the case is”: A=3, B=3.
 “You don’t see what the case is”: A=2 (the meaning has been partially communicated; errors impair
   the translation), B=3 (most grammar is rendered accurately).
 “You see the case”: A=3, B=2 (grammar is rendered adequately despite inaccuracies).
 “You saw what the case is”: A=3, B=2 (grammar is rendered adequately despite inaccuracies).
 “You have the case”: A=2 (the meaning has been partially communicated), B=1 (limited grammar is
   rendered accurately).
 “The reason which is you see”: A=1 (the translation conveys some meaning), B=2 (some vocabulary
   and some grammar are rendered appropriately).

Square brackets [ ] indicate that the words in the sense unit have been inserted out of the order of the
text.
