Complete one of the following tasks. Write 250 to 400 words.

1.   Cultural diversity

     You are currently attending a school in an English-speaking country, and a newly arrived refugee
     has just joined your class. You interviewed this student about their first impressions of their new
     home, and their hopes for the future. Write an article based on this interview to be published in
     your school magazine. Do not simply write the words (transcript) of the interview.


2.   Customs and traditions

     The principal of your school is proposing to reduce the length of the school’s main holiday. This
     matter will be debated at the next Parent Teacher Association meeting. As one of those invited to
     present a student perspective, write the text of your opening speech to be given at the meeting,
     either supporting or opposing the principal’s proposal.


3.   Health

     You recently attended a one-day workshop organized by your student council entitled: “Health
     and Wellness for Students.” Write an email to a friend in which you describe the activities you
     participated in and evaluate their benefits.


4.   Leisure

     A recent national survey has found that a majority of teenagers believe online gaming should be
     classed as a sport. Write a blog entry in which you discuss to what extent you agree with this view,
     giving reasons for your opinion.


5.   Science and technology

     Your local government has recently banned all petrol and diesel vehicles from your city centre,
     allowing access only to electric vehicles. As a local resident, you have been invited to give
     feedback on this scheme by submitting a report. Write the report, describing the impact this
     scheme has had on the community, and suggesting modifications.
