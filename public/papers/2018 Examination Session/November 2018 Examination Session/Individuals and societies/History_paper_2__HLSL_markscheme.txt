Markbands for paper 2

 Marks     Level descriptor
 13–15     Responses are clearly focused, showing a high degree of awareness of the demands and implications of the
           question. Answers are well structured and effectively organized.
           Knowledge of the world history topic is accurate and relevant. Events are placed in their historical context, and
           there is a clear understanding of historical concepts.
           The examples that the candidate chooses to discuss are appropriate and relevant, and are used effectively to
           support the analysis/evaluation. The response makes effective links and/or comparisons (as appropriate to the
           question).
           The response contains clear and coherent critical analysis. There is evaluation of different perspectives, and this
           evaluation is integrated effectively into the answer. All, or nearly all, of the main points are substantiated, and the
           response argues to a consistent conclusion.
 10–12     The demands of the question are understood and addressed. Answers are generally well structured and
           organized, although there is some repetition or lack of clarity in places.
           Knowledge of the world history topic is mostly accurate and relevant. Events are placed in their historical context,
           and there is some understanding of historical concepts.
           The examples that the candidate chooses to discuss are appropriate and relevant, and are used to support the
           analysis/evaluation. The response makes effective links and/or comparisons (as appropriate to the question).
           The response contains critical analysis, which is mainly clear and coherent. There is some awareness and
           evaluation of different perspectives. Most of the main points are substantiated and the response argues to a
           consistent conclusion.
 7–9       The response indicates an understanding of the demands of the question, but these demands are only partially
           addressed. There is an attempt to follow a structured approach.
           Knowledge of the world history topic is mostly accurate and relevant. Events are generally placed in their
           historical context.
           The examples that the candidate chooses to discuss are appropriate and relevant. The response makes links
           and/or comparisons (as appropriate to the question).
           The response moves beyond description to include some analysis or critical commentary, but this is not sustained.
 4–6       The response indicates some understanding of the demands of the question. While there may be an attempt to
           follow a structured approach, the response lacks clarity and coherence.
           Knowledge of the world history topic is demonstrated, but lacks accuracy and relevance. There is a superficial
           understanding of historical context.
           The candidate identifies specific examples to discuss, but these examples are vague or lack relevance.
           There is some limited analysis, but the response is primarily narrative/descriptive in nature rather than analytical.
 1–3       There is little understanding of the demands of the question. The answer is poorly structured or, where there is a
           recognizable essay structure, there is minimal focus on the task.
           Little knowledge of the world history topic is present.
           The candidate identifies examples to discuss, but these examples are factually incorrect, irrelevant or vague.
           The response contains little or no critical analysis. The response may consist mostly of generalizations and poorly
           substantiated assertions.
 0         Answers do not reach a standard described by the descriptors below.



Examiners are reminded of the need to apply the markbands that provide the “best fit” to the responses
given by candidates and to award credit wherever it is possible to do so. If an answer indicates that
the demands of the question are understood and addressed but that not all implications are
considered (for example, compare or contrast; reasons or significance; methods or success),
then examiners should not be afraid of using the full range of marks allowed for by the markscheme:
as such, responses that offer good coverage of some of the criteria should be rewarded accordingly.

For the attention of all examiners: if you are uncertain about the content/accuracy of a
candidate’s work please contact your team leader.

Topic 1: Society and economy (750–1400)

1.   Discuss the significance to intellectual development of two key individuals, each from a different
     region.

     The question requires that candidates offer a considered and balanced review of the significance
     of two key individuals to intellectual development. While the two individuals must be from different
     regions, they may or may not have been contemporaries. A comparative approach may or may
     not be used. Candidates may refer to the individuals’ significance in a variety of ways, for
     example, the proposal of new scientific theories or the contribution of inventions that affected the
     spread of knowledge. Discussion of their significance may extend beyond the timeframe provided
     there is a clear link back to the individual(s). While other relevant factors may be referred to, for
     example the wider advances in science and technology, the bulk of the response will remain on the
     issue raised in the question.


2.   Evaluate the role of religious leaders in the government and administration of two states.

     The question requires that candidates make an appraisal of the interrelationship between religious
     leaders and the government and administration of two states. The two states may or may not be
     from the same region and the events examined may or may not have been contemporaneous with
     each other. A comparative approach may or may not be used. Candidates may refer to the nature
     of religious leaders’ roles and note, for example, if they were supporters of, and/or advisors to, the
     government, if they were critics who used their influence to bring about change, or if, perhaps, their
     actions directly influenced the structure and authority of the government or the administration of a
     state. While other relevant interrelationships may be considered—to provide context to, or
     commentary on, the significance of the role of religious leaders—the bulk of the response will
     remain on the role of religious leaders.
                                                  –5–                  N18/3/HISTX/BP2/ENG/TZ0/XX/M


Topic 2: Causes and effects of medieval wars (750–1500)

3.   Discuss the role of territorial disputes in causing two medieval wars.

     The question requires that candidates offer a considered and balanced review of the role of
     territorial disputes in causing two medieval wars. The two wars may or may not be from the same
     region and they may or may not have occurred at the same time. The territorial disputes discussed
     may predate the timeframe but they must be clearly linked to wars that took place between 750
     and 1500. A comparative approach may or may not be used. Candidates may refer to conflict
     arising from attempts at territorial acquisition for strategic, economic or political purposes. While
     other relevant factors may be referred to, for example religious disputes or economic competition,
     the bulk of the response will remain on territorial disputes.


4.   “Women made an important contribution to medieval wars.” Discuss with reference to two wars.

     The question requires that candidates, referring to two wars, offer a considered and balanced
     review of the statement that women made an important contribution to medieval wars. The wars
     may or may not be from the same region and they may or may not have occurred at the same
     time. A comparative approach may or may not be used. Candidates may refer to women,
     collectively and/or individually, engaging in fighting (perhaps as leaders), becoming camp followers
     and/or substituting the role of male relatives, for example, serving as regents. While other relevant
     factors may be referred to, for example the role of leaders or the tactics used, the bulk of the
     response will remain on the importance of the contribution of women. Candidates may agree,
     partly agree or disagree with the statement.
                                                  –6–                  N18/3/HISTX/BP2/ENG/TZ0/XX/M


Topic 3: Dynasties and rulers (750–1500)

5.   Discuss the reasons why two rulers, each from a different region, expanded their power.

     The question requires that candidates offer a considered and balanced review of the reasons why
     two rulers expanded their power. While the two rulers must be from different regions, they may or
     may not have been contemporaries. A comparative approach may or may not be used.
     Candidates may refer to a ruler’s need for increased authority over the population, to implement a
     doctrine of legitimacy and to secure the succession of their heirs. Alternatively, candidates may
     discuss why rulers expanded their power through the acquisition of new territory: to secure trading
     routes, to spread religious beliefs and to secure strategic locations such as ports or seaways.


6.   Evaluate the importance of developments in the administration and interpretation of law in two
     dynasties/kingdoms.

     The question requires that candidates make an appraisal of developments in the administration
     and interpretation of law in two dynasties/kingdoms, weighing up their strengths and limitations.
     The two dynasties/kingdoms may or may not be from the same region and the developments
     evaluated may or may not have occurred at the same time. The significance of the developments
     may extend beyond 1500, but they must be clearly linked to developments that occurred within the
     timeframe. A comparative approach may or may not be used. Candidates may refer to the
     importance of trial by jury, the establishment of courts of law, the compilation of a written code of
     justice and the training and employment of legal experts to administer the law. Both strengths and
     limitations must be clearly indicated but there does not need to be an equal number of/focus on
     each. While other relevant factors may be referred to, for example the methods of government or
     the role of personnel, the bulk of the response will remain on the issue raised in the question.
                                                  –7–                   N18/3/HISTX/BP2/ENG/TZ0/XX/M


Topic 4: Societies in Transition (1400–1700)

7.   Compare and contrast the treatment of minorities in two societies.

     The question requires that candidates give an account of the similarities and differences between
     two societies in terms of their treatment of minorities, referring to both societies throughout. The
     two societies may or may not be from the same region and the examples used for one society
     need not be contemporaneous with the examples used in the other. Candidates may refer to the
     enactment of laws to identify and oppress minority groups, restrictions on their settlement and
     religious intolerance. In one society or both societies assessed, minorities may have been treated
     well and examples may include privileges for minorities who had specific skills, benefits for
     religious minorities favoured by rulers and financial or political opportunities for minorities who
     provided military support. Both similarities and differences must be clearly indicated, but there
     does not need to be an equal focus on each.


8.   “Religion was a support rather than a challenge to state authority.” Discuss with reference to two
     states.

     The question requires that candidates offer a considered and balanced review of the ways in which
     religion supported and/or presented a challenge to two states. The two states may or may not be
     from the same region and the examples used in one state may or may not have been
     contemporaneous with those used in the other. A comparative approach may or may not be used.
     Candidates may refer to the provision of religious support for the legitimacy of a state, the fusion of
     religion and the state through law and institutions or support for expansion and conquest in the
     name of religion. Religion may be argued to have challenged one or both states in several ways,
     for example, by denying the legitimacy of a ruler or rousing popular opinion against the state
     through religious leaders and institutions. Candidates may agree, partly agree or disagree with the
     statement.
                                                 –8–                   N18/3/HISTX/BP2/ENG/TZ0/XX/M


Topic 5: Early modern states (1450–1789)

9.    “Their successes outweighed their failures.” With reference to two rulers, each from a different
      region, to what extent do you agree with this statement?

      The question requires that candidates consider the merits or otherwise of the statement that rulers’
      successes outweighed their failures. The two rulers must be from different regions but they may or
      may not have been contemporaries. Where relevant, the effects of a ruler’s successes and failures
      may extend beyond 1789, but these effects must be clearly linked to the actions of rulers from the
      given timeframe. A comparative approach may or may not be used. Candidates may refer to the
      success and/or failure of the rulers regarding issues such as treatment of opposition, confirmation
      of legitimacy, foreign policies, fiscal policies and military prowess (or lack thereof). Candidates
      may agree, partly agree or disagree with the statement.


10.   Compare and contrast the treatment of opposition by two rulers, each from a different region.

      The question requires that candidates give an account of the similarities and differences between
      two rulers in terms of their treatment of opposition, referring to both rulers throughout. The two
      rulers must be from different regions but they may or may not have been contemporaries.
      Candidates may refer to a variety of methods rulers may have used to deal with opposition and
      these may include imprisonment and/or execution of opponents, military action, the introduction of
      laws restricting privileges and/or freedoms, banishment into exile or the seizure of land owned by
      opponents. In some cases, candidates may suggest that rulers carried out pre-emptive strikes to
      stymie nascent opposition and/or to make examples of those who might seek to oppose the ruler.
      Both similarities and differences must be clearly indicated but there does not need to be an equal
      focus on each.
                                                  –9–                   N18/3/HISTX/BP2/ENG/TZ0/XX/M


Topic 6: Causes and effects of early modern wars (1500–1750)

11.   Evaluate the strategies that determined the outcome of two early modern wars.

      The question requires that candidates make an appraisal of the strategies that determined the
      outcome of two early modern wars, weighing up the strengths and limitations of those strategies.
      The two wars may or may not be from the same region and they may or may not have occurred at
      the same time. A comparative approach may or may not be used. Candidates may refer to the
      use of infantry, cavalry, artillery, gunpowder technology, sieges and the utilization of superior
      geographic/maritime knowledge. Additionally, or alternatively, they may focus on fortifications,
      economic embargos or tariffs, alliances, logistics and supply.


12.   “Peacemaking had limited success in the early modern period.” With reference to two examples,
      to what extent do you agree with this statement?

      Candidates will consider the merits or otherwise of the statement that peacemaking had limited
      success in the early modern period. The two examples may or may not be from the same region
      and they may or may not have been contemporaneous with each other. Long-term effects, where
      they existed, may extend beyond 1750, but they must be clearly linked to peacemaking efforts that
      occurred within the timeframe. A comparative approach may or may not be used. Candidates
      may refer to the success or otherwise of peacemaking in ending conflicts, securing lasting peace,
      resolving the causes of conflict or whether the peace, ultimately, exacerbated tensions. While
      other, relevant, factors may be referred to, the bulk of the response will remain on the issue raised
      in the question. Candidates may agree, partly agree or disagree with the statement.

Topic 7: Origins, development and impact of industrialization (1750–2005)

13.   Evaluate how important human and natural resources were to the industrialization of one country.

      The question requires that candidates make an appraisal of the importance of human and natural
      resources, weighing up the significance or otherwise of each to the industrialization of one country.
      A comparative approach may or may not be used. Candidates may refer to human resource
      issues such as population locale (rural and/or urban), slave labour, population growth, skilled
      workers, education and social structure. Some reference to specific individuals may be relevant.
      Natural resources may include navigable coasts, internal waterways, coal, iron, oil, timber and
      cotton, and/or the availability of renewable energy sources such as wind and water. While other
      relevant factors may be considered, for example the role and significance of technological
      developments, the bulk of the response will remain on human and natural resources.


14.   Examine the impact of industrialization on political representation in two countries.

      The question requires that candidates consider the interrelationship between industrialization and
      political representation in two countries. A comparative approach may or may not be used.
      Candidates may refer to the emergence of new political ideologies and their impact on political
      representation, the way elected bodies changed to reflect: new social classes; changes to social
      hierarchies; changes to political representation because of population growth; and/or to voting
      policies, which influenced political representation. Candidates may evaluate the impact of
      industrialization on political representation by considering positive and/or negative outcomes.
      While other relevant interrelationships may be considered—to provide context to, or commentary
      on, the significance of the impact of industrialization on political representation—the bulk of the
      response will remain on that raised in the question.

Topic 8: Independence movements (1800–2000)

15.   “Religion was an important factor in the development of independence movements.” With
      reference to two independence movements, each from a different region, to what extent do you
      agree with this statement?

      The question requires that candidates consider the merits or otherwise of the statement that
      religion was an important factor in the development of independence movements. The two
      independence movements must be from different regions but they may or may not have existed at
      the same time. Factors may predate 1800, but they must be clearly linked to an independence
      movement that developed within the timeframe. A comparative approach may or may not be used.
      Candidates may refer to the repression of religious groups, the desire for religious freedom and/or
      a desire to reassert historical religious (and perhaps, therefore, cultural) norms and methods of
      worship. While other relevant factors, for example race or socio-economic issues, may be referred
      to, the bulk of the response will remain on the importance of religion. Candidates may agree,
      partly agree or disagree with the statement.


16.   Evaluate how effectively two states responded to the challenges they faced in the first 10 years of
      independence.

      The question requires that candidates make an appraisal of the responses of two states to the
      challenges they faced in their first ten years of independence, weighing up the strengths and
      limitations of those responses. The two states may or may not be from the same region and the
      periods evaluated may or may not be contemporaneous with each other. The long-term effects of
      the responses discussed may extend (briefly) beyond 2000, but they must be clearly linked to
      challenges that occurred within the timeframe. A comparative approach may or may not be used.
      Candidates may refer to attempts to establish political systems and achieve political stability,
      facilitating social unification, addressing economic problems or encouraging economic
      development, resolving territorial conflicts and developing foreign policy.
                                                – 12 –               N18/3/HISTX/BP2/ENG/TZ0/XX/M


Topic 9: Evolution and development of democratic states (1848–2000)

17.   Evaluate the importance of leaders in the emergence of two democratic states.

      The question requires that candidates make an appraisal of the importance of leaders to the
      emergence of two democratic states, weighing up the importance or otherwise of those leaders (be
      that one leader or multiple leaders for each or either state). The two states may or may not be
      from the same region and their emergence may or may not have occurred at the same time.
      Factors may predate 1848 but they must be clearly linked to a state that emerged within the
      timeframe. A comparative approach may or may not be used. Candidates may refer to the
      importance of leaders in key turning points, policy decisions, propaganda, the gaining of popular
      support, development of ideology and in determining strategy. While other relevant factors may be
      referred to, for example political upheaval or external influences, the bulk of the response will
      remain on the issue raised in the question.


18.   Examine the impact made by democracy on the arts and media in two states, each from a different
      region.

      The question requires that candidates consider the interrelationship between democracy and the
      arts and media in two states. The two states must be from different regions but the issues
      discussed may or may not have occurred at the same time. Long-term effects may extend (briefly)
      beyond 2000, but these must be clearly linked to events from within the timeframe. A comparative
      approach may or may not be used. Candidates may refer to freedom of speech and expression,
      changes in visual arts (such as painting, sculpture, photography and architecture and design)
      and/or focus on literature, theatre, music, dance, cinema, radio, television, newspapers and
      magazines/journals. References may also be drawn between democracy and freedom of cultural
      expression, funding of cultural endeavours and the use of cultural propaganda. While other
      relevant interrelationships may be considered—to provide context to, or commentary on, the
      significance of the impact of democracy on the arts and media—the bulk of the response will
      remain on that raised in the question.
                                                   – 13 –               N18/3/HISTX/BP2/ENG/TZ0/XX/M


Topic 10: Authoritarian states (20th century)

19.   Examine the impact of the foreign policy of two authoritarian states on the maintenance of power
      in those states.

      The question requires that candidates consider the interrelationship between foreign policy and the
      maintenance of power in two authoritarian states. The two states may or may not be from the
      same region and the periods discussed may or may not have occurred at the same time. The
      impact may extend (briefly) beyond 2000, but it must be clearly linked to the foreign policy of the
      states from within the timeframe. A comparative approach may or may not be used. Candidates
      may refer to foreign policy under one leader, multiple leaders, or throughout the duration of an
      authoritarian state. It may be suggested that successful foreign policy benefitted a regime by
      increasing its popularity and/or diverting attention from domestic problems. Foreign policy failures
      that undermined the regime may also be addressed. While other relevant interrelationships may
      be considered—to provide context to, or commentary on, the significance of the impact of foreign
      policy on the maintenance of power—the bulk of the response will remain on that raised in the
      question.


20.   “Social and economic policies in authoritarian states did not always achieve their aims.” Discuss
      with reference to one authoritarian state.

      The question requires that candidates offer a considered and balanced review of the statement
      that social and economic policies of one authoritarian state did not always achieve their aims. The
      results of the policies may extend (briefly) beyond 2000, but they must be clearly linked to policies
      from within the timeframe. A comparative approach may or may not be used. Candidates may
      refer to the social and economic policies of one ruler, multiple rulers, or throughout the duration of
      the authoritarian state. Social policies may focus on religion, education, youth, families, women,
      minorities and social welfare. Economic policies may focus on industrialization, agriculture,
      transport, taxation, trade and labour. Candidates may agree, partly agree or disagree with the
      statement.

Topic 11: Causes and effects of 20th-century wars

21.   Discuss the importance of technological developments to the outcome of two 20th-century wars,
      each from a different region.

      The question requires that candidates offer a considered and balanced review of the importance of
      technological developments to the outcome of two 20th-century wars. The two wars must be from
      different regions but they may or may not have occurred at the same time. A comparative
      approach may or may not be used. Candidates may refer to a range of methods under the
      heading of technological developments, including developments in the production and
      effectiveness of weapons, the development of aircraft/ tanks/battleships or the technology available
      on the battlefield for military forces. Candidates will discuss the importance of such developments
      in relation to the outcome of the two wars. While other, relevant, factors may be referred to, for
      example the mobilization of human resources or influence of foreign powers, the bulk of the
      response will remain on the issue raised in the question.

      Please note that while the First and Second World Wars may be used in a regional context (for
      example, the Second World War in the Pacific), they cannot then be re-used as an example of a
      war in a different region.


22.   “Territorial changes were the most significant consequence of war.” Discuss with reference to two
      wars.

      The question requires that candidates offer a considered and balanced review of the statement
      that territorial changes were the most significant consequence of war. The two wars may or may
      not be from the same region and they may or may not have occurred at the same time.
      Consequences may extend (briefly) beyond the timeframe but they must be clearly linked to the
      issue raised in the question. A comparative approach may or may not be used. Candidates may
      refer to a range of consequences including border changes and possible consequent shifts in
      demographics, the relinquishing or the acquisition of colonies, and/or enmity, which may have
      resulted from the gain or loss of territory. While other relevant factors, for example changes in the
      role and status of women, will be referred to, the bulk of the response will remain on the
      significance (or otherwise) of territorial changes. Candidates may agree, partly agree or disagree
      with the statement.

Topic 12: The Cold War: Superpower tensions and rivalries (20th century)

23.   “Superpower rivalry in Europe and Asia between 1943 and 1949 led to the breakdown of the grand
      alliance.” To what extent do you agree with this statement?

      The question requires that candidates consider the merits or otherwise of the statement that
      superpower rivalry in Europe and Asia during the suggested timeframe led to the breakdown of the
      grand alliance. Candidates may consider events that extend beyond 1949, but they must be
      clearly linked to the rivalries from within the timeframe. A comparative approach may or may not
      be used. While other relevant factors, for example different ideologies and/or styles of leadership,
      may be referred to, the bulk of the response will remain on the issue raised in the question.
      Candidates may agree, partly agree or disagree with the statement.


24.   Discuss the impact of two Cold War crises, each from a different region, on the development of
      superpower tensions.

      The question requires that candidates offer a considered and balanced review of the impact of two
      Cold War crises upon the development of superpower tensions. The two crises must be from
      different regions but they may or may not have been occurred at the same time. A comparative
      approach may or may not be used. Candidates may refer to a range of factors including increasing
      tensions (perhaps even to the point of risking nuclear war), an easing of tensions and/or the
      geographical expansion of the Cold War. While other relevant factors, for example ideology, may
      be referred to, the bulk of the response will remain on the issue raised in the question.
