Apply the markbands that provide the “best fit” to the responses given and award credit wherever it is
possible to do so. If an answer indicates that the demands of the question are understood and
addressed but that not all implications are considered (for example, compare or contrast; reasons
or significance; methods or success), then examiners should not be afraid of using the full range of
marks allowed for by the markscheme. Responses that offer good coverage of some of the criteria
should be rewarded accordingly.

Section 1: The ‘Abbasid dynasty (750–1258)

1.   “The success of ‘Abbasid rule up to 850 was mainly due to political factors.” Discuss.

     The question requires that candidates offer a considered and balanced review of the argument that
     political factors were the most important reason for the success of ‘Abbasid rule up to 850.
     Candidates may agree, partly agree or disagree with the statement. Political factors may address
     the inclusion of the Arab Kharijites and Persian Shi‘ites, while retaining positions of power in Arab
     Sunni hands in Baghdad and the strength of the leadership. Other political factors may include the
     adoption of Sassanian regional political structures such as the Persian satrapy system and the
     notion of the Sultan as the Shahanshah. Non-political factors that candidates may address include
     the rise of the Mu‘tazila, an Islamic theological school. The Golden Age brought wealth and
     prestige to the dynasty and there was no powerful source of opposition at this time. Additionally,
     there may be reference to the role of often ethnically Persian Shi‘a Imams in preaching social
     stability.


2.   To what extent was the collapse of the ‘Abbasid dynasty caused by the Mongol invasion?

     The question requires that candidates consider the merits or otherwise of the argument that the
     Mongol invasion of 1258 caused the collapse of the ‘Abbasid dynasty. Candidates may suggest
     that the Mongol chief Hülegü Khan killed the last ‘Abbasid sultan in the siege of Baghdad in 1258,
     and that this affirms the suggestion in the question. On the other hand, candidates may argue that
     the ‘Abbasid dynasty had long since collapsed in all but name. Candidates may argue that dynastic
     struggles for succession after Harun Al Rashid (d 809) greatly weakened the empire, as did
     territorial losses to rivals such as the Fatimids Turkish soldiers became the dominant military force
     in the empire and the Persian Shi‘a Buyids ruled the empire from 942, followed by the Seljuk
     Turks from 1055. Both groups maintained the ‘Abbasid Sultan but he had no political power.
                                                  –6–                  N18/3/HISTX/HP3/ENG/TZ0/AF/M


Section 2: The Fatimids (909–1171)

3.   Evaluate the role of political and economic factors in the foundation of the Fatimid dynasty.

     The question requires that candidates make an appraisal of the role of political and economic
     factors, weighing up their importance or otherwise to the foundation of the Fatimid dynasty.
     Regarding political factors, candidates may suggest that the Fatimids were able to expand their
     territory eastwards into formerly ‘Abbasid Egypt from Tunisia, exploiting a political vacuum because
     of weakness in Baghdad. The Fatimids gave all inhabitants of their empire access to influence in
     the political power-structure, regardless of religion. This attracted talented individuals who
     strengthened the dynasty. In terms of economic factors, candidates may refer to the foundation of
     Cairo as the capital of the empire in 969, which established dominance of the fertile Nile region, as
     well as strengthening trade routes into Africa up the Nile, in the Red Sea, the Indian Ocean and the
     Mediterranean. The Fatimids also emphasized long-distance trade established through diplomatic
     contacts.


4.   “Fatimid claims to the caliphate were weaker than those of the ‘Abbasids and of the Umayyads of
     Spain.” Discuss.

     The question requires that candidates offer a considered and balanced review of the argument that
     Fatimid claims to the caliphate were weaker than those of the ‘Abbasids and the Umayyads of
     Spain. In support of the statement, candidates may consider the merits of Ismaili Shi‘a claims to
     the caliphate through the line of Fatima al-Zahra, Muhammad’s daughter. ‘Abbasid claims to the
     caliphate were through Abbas ibn Abd al-Muttalib, the Prophet’s uncle. The ‘Abbasids refuted the
     Fatimid claim as invalid because it was through the female line. In 929 the Spanish Umayyad ruler
     Abd ar-Rahman III made a claim to the caliphate based on old Umayyad claims through Umayya
     ibn Abd Sham, another uncle of the Prophet. Candidates may discuss the realities of the power
     politics of the era and the need to establish the legitimacy of a dynastic line. Declining Fatimid
     strength in the late 11th century made their claims difficult to pursue and enforce.
                                                 –7–                N18/3/HISTX/HP3/ENG/TZ0/AF/M


Section 3: The Crusades (1095–1291)

5.   Discuss the reasons for the collapse of the Crusader states.

     The question requires that candidates offer a considered and balanced review of the reasons for
     the collapse of the Crusader states. Candidates may consider that state loyalty was determined by
     the leader’s original vassal state and that leaders were prone to manipulation by their European
     monarchs. Candidates may argue that the distinct hierarchy in the states and the lack of
     cooperation between them was a reason for their failure. They may also claim that Jerusalem was
     not dominant enough to control the other states, a fact that contributed to the collapse of the
     Crusader States. The failure of the Second Crusade because of the on-going lack of manpower,
     the fall of Jerusalem in 1187 and the consequent failure of the Third Crusade may also be
     discussed. Furthermore, candidates may consider that the resurgence of Islamic power contributed
     to the collapse of the Crusader states.


6.   Discuss the impact of the Crusades on the Byzantine Empire.

     The question requires that candidates offer a considered and balanced review of the impact of the
     Crusades on the Byzantine Empire. Candidates may approach the question in a variety of ways,
     adopting a chronological approach or a thematic approach. For example, they could categorize the
     impact as positive and negative. Pressures on the Byzantine Empire due to the expansion of Islam
     were relieved by the First Crusade and the establishment of the Crusader states. However, the
     treaty between Constantinople and Saladin (Salah ad-Din) in 1187, through which the Byzantines
     agreed not to help the Crusaders, indicated the extent to which the Byzantines now regarded the
     Crusades as a negative force. The Fourth Crusade sacked Constantinople in 1204 and this was
     arguably the greatest impact of all the Crusades, as it dramatically weakened the Byzantines and
     contributed to their ultimate collapse in 1453.
                                                 –8–                  N18/3/HISTX/HP3/ENG/TZ0/AF/M


Section 4: The Ottomans (1281–1566)

7.   To what extent was the Ottoman expansion into Anatolia and the Balkans achieved through
     warfare?

     The question requires that candidates consider the merits or otherwise of the view that Ottoman
     expansion was achieved through warfare in Anatolia and the Balkans. Candidates may refer to
     Ottoman success in warfare such as the capture of Adrianople (1361), Constantinople (1453) and
     Belgrade (1521). They may consider battles such as the Battle of Kosovo Polje (1389) and the
     Battle of Chaldiran (1514). Consideration of other factors, not related to warfare, may include
     Ottoman involvement in Byzantine factionalism, which led to the movement of Ottoman forces to
     the Balkans from Anatolia in 1352. Another factor was the use of marriage alliances, such as that
     between the Ottoman Prince Halil and the Byzantine Princess Irene in 1359. Candidates may also
     refer to the use of diplomacy, for example the Treaty of Edirne with Hungary (1444). The efficiency
     and popularity of the Ottoman regime attracted support from the population.


8.   Discuss the achievements of two of the following Ottoman leaders: Mehmet II (1451–1481);
     Selim I (1512–1520); Suleiman the Magnificent (1520–1566).

     The question requires that candidates offer a considered and balanced review of the achievements
     of two of the Ottoman leaders; Mehmet II (1451–1481) and/or Selim I (1512–1520) and/or
     Suleiman the Magnificent (1520–1566). Candidates may approach the question in several ways,
     for example they may adopt a chronological approach or choose to categorize the various
     achievements, such as political, military, economic or social and cultural achievements. In terms of
     military success, all the Sultans expanded the empire by waging war, for example, Selim I claimed
     the title of caliph after defeating the Mamluk Sultanate of Egypt. In terms of political success,
     reference could be made to Suleiman’s institution of laws or Mehmet’s establishment of
     Constantinople as the capital of the empire. Candidates may or may not choose to use a
     comparative approach.

Section 5: Trade and the rise and decline of African states and empires (800–1600)

9.    Evaluate the importance of the trans-Saharan trade in gold and salt to the rise of the Ghana
      Empire.

      The question requires that candidates make an appraisal by weighing up the strengths and
      limitations of the importance of trans-Saharan trade in gold and salt to the rise of the Ghana
      Empire. Candidates may refer to factors including the location of the empire at the nexus of trading
      routes, which allowed it to levy taxes on trade in gold and salt. The king exercised a personal
      monopoly on gold nuggets that allowed him to accrue enormous wealth. A market economy was
      developed, based on trade in commodities and manufactured goods. Revenues from trade allowed
      the empire to expand to the south so that many gold mines came under its control. Candidates
      may consider other factors, including trade in other goods such as peacock feathers, the role of
      individual leaders, the effectiveness of a strong centralized administration,
      and the subjugation of neighbouring states that were forced to pay tribute to the empire.


10.   Discuss the factors that contributed to the emergence of a cosmopolitan Swahili culture.

      The question requires that candidates offer a considered and balanced review that includes a
      range of factors that contributed to the emergence of a cosmopolitan Swahili culture. Evidence
      may include the development of Swahili as a regional lingua franca that facilitated the transmission
      of ideas. The development of Indian Ocean trading networks, particularly those that linked the
      coast to the Red Sea and Persian Gulf regions, led to the intermingling of cultures and the
      emergence of Swahili city states such as Kilwa, Malindi and Zanzibar. These acted as
      cosmopolitan hubs for the region. Traders from Arabia, Persia, Iran and Portugal settled in the
      cities and sometimes married African women. Other factors include the caravan routes from the
      Great Lakes region that brought influences from Central Africa. Candidates may conclude that the
      common faith of Islam worked as a gel that bound together diverse cultural influences.

Section 6: Pre-colonial African states (1800–1900)

11.   Evaluate the effects of the Mfecane/Difaqane.

      The question requires that candidates make an appraisal by weighing up the strengths and
      limitations of the various effects of the Mfecane/Difaqane. They may consider effects such as the
      widespread conflict and displacement of populations resulting from Shaka’s aggression. Men were
      slaughtered during and after the battle, and women and children incorporated into the wider Zulu
      population. Political changes included the emergence of the Zulu as the dominant force in the
      region, while Moshoeshoe’s Sotho kingdom, which offered shelter to refugees, grew larger. Other
      new states, such as the Ndebele and Swazi, were created to the north, while depopulation of large
      parts of the subcontinent facilitated the settlement of the interior by the Voortrekkers. The
      emergence of a powerful Zulu state also led to contact and conflict with the Boers, Portuguese and
      British. Candidates may conclude by reaching a judgment about the relative significance of the
      different effects they have considered.


12.   Examine the roles of Yohannes IV and Menelik II in the unification and expansion of Ethiopia.

      The question requires that candidates consider the roles of Yohannes and Menelik in the
      unification and expansion of Ethiopia in a way that uncovers the assumptions and
      interrelationships of the issue. For Yohannes, candidates may consider his outmanoeuvring of
      rivals following Tewedros’s death, thus preventing the disintegration of the empire. They may also
      focus on his success in heading off external threats to Ethiopian independence. For Menelik, they
      may refer to victory over the Italians and subsequent expansion to the south. Candidates are not
      expected to have an equal balance between unification and expansion. However, there must be
      some consideration of each factor. Candidates may or may not choose to use a comparative
      approach and may conclude that while Yohannes’s achievement was the survival of a unified state,
      Menelik’s main accomplishment was expansion. They may refer to Menelik’s modernization
      policies but only in the context of strengthening the Ethiopian state.
                                                   – 11 –                 N18/3/HISTX/HP3/ENG/TZ0/AF/M


Section 7: The slave trade in Africa and the Middle East (1500–1900)

13.   Discuss the role of two individuals in the slave trade in Africa.

      The question requires that candidates offer a considered and balanced review of the roles played
      by two individuals in the slave trade. Candidates may refer to their chosen individuals’ roles in
      procuring slaves for the market, whether it be raiding, trafficking or selling. Participation of
      individuals for personal gain or profit may also be discussed as may opposition to the trade by
      missionaries and diplomats in Africa or involvement in the parliamentary abolitionist movement.
      Candidates may comment on the nature of the trade in different regions, for example between the
      Atlantic trade and East African trade, but only in the context of the role of individuals. Candidates
      may choose to adopt a comparative approach even though this is not a requirement of the set
      question.


14.   Evaluate the reasons for the decline of slavery in the Ottoman Empire.

      The question requires that candidates make an appraisal by weighing up the strengths and
      limitations of the different reasons for the decline of slavery in the Ottoman Empire. They may
      focus on the constriction of the Ottoman state during the latter part of the period, particularly in the
      Balkans and the Black Sea region. French colonization in Algeria, and Egyptian independence,
      similarly eroded those territories that the Ottomans had used within their empire for the supply of
      slaves. Candidates may look at how their use of slave markets in East Africa was curtailed
      following British expansion in that region and the closing of the Zanzibar market in 1873. They may
      point out that the changing moral climate over the course of the nineteenth century was a major
      factor in the decline of slavery more generally. Candidates may reach a judgment about the
      relative significance of various reasons they have considered.

Section 8: European imperialism and the partition of Africa (1850–1900)

15.   To what extent was the partition of Africa caused by British concerns over control of the sea route
      to the East?

      The question requires that candidates consider the merits or otherwise of the suggestion that the
      partition of Africa was, in some way, caused by British concerns over control of the sea route to the
      east. They may consider British concerns with safeguarding sea routes to India—the jewel in the
      crown of its empire—or its desire to consolidate control of South Africa, a factor which brought it
      into conflict with the Boer republics. Candidates may also focus on rivalry with France over Suez
      and the occupation of Egypt, followed by the breakdown of the gentleman’s agreement in West
      Africa, and British concerns over the headwaters of the Nile, which stimulated colonization in East
      Africa. Candidates may explore weaknesses in the strategic argument, for example by arguing the
      partition was already underway before 1882. They may also consider the significance of other
      factors, such as economic causes of the partition.


16.   “The activities of King Leopold II of Belgium in the Congo were a more important factor in
      accelerating the partition of Africa than those of de Brazza.” Discuss.

      The question requires that candidates offer a considered and balanced review of Leopold’s
      activities in the Congo and whether these were a more important factor in accelerating the partition
      of Africa than de Brazza’s activities. For Leopold, this may include his creation of the International
      African Association and the hiring of Stanley to explore and advance his claims to the entire region
      of the Congo basin. For de Brazza, reference may be made to exploration and to the treaty he
      signed with Makoko, which ensured that the right bank of the Congo would become a French
      protectorate. Candidates may argue that Leopold and de Brazza were equally important by linking
      their rivalry to the convening of the Berlin West Africa Conference. This conference established
      that a power had to demonstrate “effective occupation” for claims of sovereignty to be recognized,
      a move that precipitated a second scramble for the continent.

Section 9: Response to European imperialism (1870–1920)

17.   Compare and contrast the responses of the Mandinka and the Zulu to challenges to their
      independence.

      The question requires that candidates give an account of similarities and differences in the
      responses of the Mandinka and the Zulu to challenges to their independence, referring to both
      throughout. For similarities, candidates may note that both were powerful states with large standing
      armies, which meant that they could afford to choose armed resistance against enemies
      determined to destroy their independence. Both won early victories before retreating to avoid
      provoking their foes. For differences, candidates may contrast the sustained resistance of the
      Mandinka to the much shorter resistance of the Zulu. Other differences may include the point that
      the Mandinka, unlike the Zulu, could regroup and wage guerrilla warfare, and the fact that
      Mandinka resistance was influenced by their Islamic faith. While both similarities and differences
      must be addressed, there need not be an equal number of each.


18.   Discuss the reasons why Lewanika and Khama decided to collaborate with the British.

      The question requires that candidates offer a considered and balanced review that includes a
      range or factors involved in the decisions of Lewanika and Khama to collaborate with the British.
      Candidates may note that many of the reasons for collaboration were similar. Both ruled over
      strong kingdoms, which meant that the British would find it costly to defeat them by military force.
      In each case leadership was undisputed, meaning that there would be no internal opposition to
      collaboration. Each leader was influenced by Christian missionaries, and each anticipated that
      collaboration might result in gains over regional rivals. Candidates may argue that as the stronger
      power it was the British, and not Lewanika or Khama, who decided that they would become
      collaborators and not resisters. Candidates may adopt a comparative approach, or alternatively
      one where the decisions of Lewanika and Khama are discussed separately.
                                                  – 14 –               N18/3/HISTX/HP3/ENG/TZ0/AF/M


Section 10: Africa under colonialism (1890–1980)

19.   “The impact of Portuguese rule in Angola and Mozambique was entirely negative.” Discuss.

      The question requires that candidates offer a considered and balanced review that includes a
      range of arguments concerning the impact of Portuguese rule in Angola and Mozambique.
      Candidates may argue that Portuguese rule was entirely negative by pointing to the extractive and
      exploitative nature of the colonial economy, underdevelopment and neglect of infrastructure, the
      impoverishment of peasants who were heavily taxed and subjected to forced labour, post-war
      immigration of white workers whose jobs were protected, racial segregation and discrimination,
      and the devastating economic and human impact of the liberation wars. Candidates may agree,
      partly agree or disagree with the statement, though they are more likely to conclude that
      Portuguese rule was overwhelmingly negative. However, they may argue that it led to the
      development of nationalism and ultimately independence, and that this was a positive result.
      They may also focus on the policy of assimilation and the emergence of a mestizo community.


20.   Evaluate the factors that promoted the choice of administrative systems in Nigeria.

      The question requires that candidates make an appraisal by weighing up the strengths and
      limitations of the factors that promoted the choice of administrative systems in Nigeria. They may
      focus their responses on the system of indirect rule and argue that it appealed to the British
      because it involved minimal interference in traditional ways of life while defraying the financial
      costs and administrative burdens of colonialism and shielding them from popular protest.
      Candidates may note that Northern Nigeria, with its large, centralized units ruled by powerful Fulani
      emirs, seemed ideal for the implementation of this system. They may argue that indirect rule was
      modified in other parts of the country, including Yorubaland, where tension resulted from the
      selection of some traditional rulers over others, and in Igboland, where an acephalous society
      made it difficult to identify rulers, and where the legitimacy of warrant chiefs was challenged and
      their authority resented.

Section 11: 20th-century nationalist and independence movements in Africa

21.   Evaluate the factors that contributed to Senegalese independence to 1960.

      The question requires that candidates make an appraisal by weighing up the strengths and
      limitations of the factors that contributed to the achievement of Senegalese independence.
      Possible factors are: the sentiment for decolonization in the UN placed pressure on colonial
      powers; decolonization in British West Africa provided a model and the painful French experience
      in Algeria encouraged support for decolonization. Other factors may include the growth of political
      parties and emergence of leaders seeking independence in French colonies such as Guinea and
      Cote d’Ivoire and the existence of moderate leaders in Senegal such as Leopold Senghor. The
      desire by Senegal and other colonies to retain links with France made the granting of
      independence more likely. Candidates may note that in Senegal, pressure for independence was
      limited but it received its independence as part of a decision by France to grant independence to all
      its colonies.


22.   Evaluate the importance of Julius Nyerere to the achievement of Tanganyikan independence up
      to 1961.

      The question requires that candidates make an appraisal by weighing up the strengths and
      limitations of Julius Nyerere’s contribution to the struggle for independence in Tanganyika.
      Candidates may consider his leadership in the creation of the Tanganyika African National Union
      (TANU). In addition, the respect gained by Nyerere amongst the Tanganyikan population through
      his dedication to the cause of independence, his diplomatic skills in bringing different factions
      together and the support he gained because of his integrity may be considered. His moderate
      approach and negotiating skills impressed the British and, thus, aided the progress towards
      independence. Candidates may discuss other factors such as the impact of international
      anti-colonial sentiments that emerged after the Second World War and the effect of the outbreaks
      of violence in other British colonies in Africa. The decline of British economic and military power
      influenced the British decision to grant independence to many African states.

Section 12: The Ottoman Empire (c1800–1923)

23.   Evaluate the reasons for, and the results of, Muhammad Ali’s challenge to Ottoman power.

      The question requires that candidates make an assessment of the reasons for, and the results of,
      Muhammad Ali’s challenge to Ottoman power. For reasons, candidates may refer to outside
      interference such as defeats by Russia (1829) and France (1830) and nationalist causes such as
      the Greek War of Independence (1832) that illustrated Ottoman weakness. Candidates may also
      refer to unpopular and, in the short term, damaging army reforms within the Ottoman Empire. This
      encouraged Muhammad Ali to strike into Syria from Egypt (1831). For results, candidates may
      consider that Muhammad Ali was made the governor of Syria (1833). Candidates may also
      consider foreign interference by Russia (1832) and Britain (1838). Within the Ottoman Empire the
      defeat stimulated the Tanzimat reforms. Candidates may reach a judgment concerning the relative
      significance of the various factors they have considered.


24.   Evaluate the impact of the Committee of Union and Progress on the Ottoman Empire.

      The question requires that candidates make an appraisal of the impact of the Committee of Union
      and Progress on the Ottoman Empire. Candidates may refer to the progressive, reformist, and
      westernizing impact of the Committee, which dominated after 1908. The reduction of the power of
      the Sultan may be considered. Further effects include the deepening of the Ottoman–German
      alliance and participation in the First World War, the Committee playing a key role at Gallipoli
      (1915) and the Armenian genocide. The Committee was terminated in the trials of 1919–1920.
      Candidates may refer to the Committee’s legacy as a long-term impact, setting the pattern for the
      worsening relations with the Greek community and the rise of Ataturk and republican Turkey.
      Candidates may reach a judgment concerning the relative significance of the various effects they
      have considered.

Section 13: War and change in the Middle East and North Africa 1914–1945

25.   Evaluate the impact of French administration in Syria and Lebanon.

      The question requires that candidates make an appraisal of the impact of the French
      administration in Syria and Lebanon. Candidates may consider the impact of the enforcement of
      the mandate upon the inhabitants, owing its origins to the Sykes–Picot agreement. The US King
      Crane Commission (1919) confirmed the distaste of Arabs for the French mandate of Syria and
      Lebanon. This led to the Faisal’s Syrian uprising, followed by another general insurrection in 1925.
      Another effect was political fragmentation. Lebanon became independent in 1920, and the Hatay
      region joined Turkey in 1935. The French continued to rule Syria as a series of semi-independent
      kingdoms, strengthening local autonomy and creating a post-war legacy for an independent Syria
      (1946). Candidates may refer to increased religious and cultural divisions in Lebanon and Syria as
      a result of French influence and favouritism towards certain groups .


26.   With reference to the period between 1914 and 1945, evaluate political and social developments in
      one of the following: Iran; Saudi Arabia; a North African state.

      The question requires that candidates make an appraisal of the impact of political and social
      developments in Iran; Saudi Arabia; or a North African state (which may be Egypt). For political
      developments, candidates may consider the role and impact of foreign intervention as well as
      indigenous political development, for example the role of tribal groups and regions in their relations
      with the capital city. For social developments gender, racial and religious aspects may all be
      considered. Candidates may also consider the interplay between social and political development,
      for example regionalism, religion and tribalism as forces against the political capital or colonial
      power or their impact on the modernization of values. The effect of the two world wars on both
      political and social development is a likely focus.

Section 14: Africa, international organizations and the international community (20th century)

27.   Discuss the reasons for the failure of UN intervention in Somalia up to 1995.

      The question requires that candidates offer a considered and balanced review that includes a
      range of reasons for the failure of the UN intervention in Somalia up to 1995. Candidates may
      consider the significance of internal Somali problems such as the lack of an effective central
      government and the presence of several hostile armed factions supporting different leaders.
      The extensive supply of arms from the Cold War period increased the levels of violence. Factors
      relating to the UN may include a lack of adequate resources and personnel in Somalia to influence
      the political and military situations, and the lack of support for various aid and relief efforts. The
      inability or unwillingness of UN troops to disarm warring groups prevented political solutions and
      allowed civil war to continue. The importance of the withdrawal of American support after
      casualties occurred amongst UN troops may also be considered.


28.   Evaluate the impact of two UN specialized agencies in Africa.

      The question requires that candidates make an appraisal by weighing up the strengths and
      limitations of the factors that influenced the impact of two specialized UN agencies in Africa.
      Candidates may select any two UN agencies as the basis of their response. Factors which affected
      the impact of UN agencies may include the extent of their resources; their ability to deliver, support
      and maintain services and the willingness of countries to receive aid. The nature of their impact will
      vary from country to country and candidates may also consider a range of reasons for this.
      Candidates may consider political, economic, geographic and ideological factors which enabled or
      impeded the work of the chosen agencies. Internal and external conflicts may have affected their
      impact. The enthusiasm for and support of the work of these agencies by
      non-African countries may also be considered.

Section 15: Developments in South Africa 1880–1994

29.   Discuss the impact of the policy of segregation between 1910 and 1948.

      The question requires that candidates offer a considered and balanced review of the impact of the
      segregation policy between 1910 and 1948. Candidates may consider the impact of legislation
      such as the Natives Land Act, the National Urban Areas Act and others designed to limit the
      economic and political rights of Africans. The physical separation of white and African populations
      limited residential, employment and mobility rights of Africans; the significance of this
      discrimination in jobs and wages against Africans may also be discussed. Political effects may
      include the rise of protest groups (African National Congress) amongst the African and other
      non-white populations. Social effects may include declining living, health and education standards
      for Africans and the increasing wealth and power gaps between them and the white population.
      The economic and political advantages for the white population may be considered along with
      hardening racial attitudes of both white and African populations.


30.   Evaluate the importance of Sharpeville to the struggle against apartheid.

      The question requires that candidates make an appraisal by weighing up the strengths and
      limitations of the importance of the Sharpeville massacre in the struggle against apartheid.
      Candidates may consider material from inside and outside South Africa in their response.
      Internally, Sharpeville resulted in large increases in internal protests, strikes and other forms of
      opposition. The banning of the African National Congress and Pan Africanist Congress began the
      move from peaceful protest to armed struggle, increased white opposition to apartheid and
      emigration by white South Africans and the political militancy of African women. It may have
      hardened support for apartheid amongst some whites. Externally, Sharpeville resulted in
      widespread condemnation of South Africa at the UN, expulsion from the Commonwealth as well as
      a decline in investment and immigration. These factors may be seen to have increased the
      pressure on South Africa to change its policies as it might suffer increasing isolation from the
      world.

Section 16: Social and cultural developments in Africa in the 19th and 20th centuries

31.   Discuss the impact of immigration and emigration in two African countries.

      The question requires that candidates offer a considered and balanced review that includes a
      range of factors that reflect on the impact of immigration and emigration in two African countries.
      The response need not offer equal coverage of immigration and emigration, nor must there be an
      equal treatment of the two countries selected. For immigration, candidates may consider the
      economic effects of labour imported from Asia, merchants and traders from other countries, and
      the influx of European settlers, who displaced the native population and created economic, social
      and political effects. Emigration was limited in this period after the end of the slave trade and thus
      its impact may be difficult to identify in many countries. The departure of European colonists from
      some countries may have had a significant economic and social impact. The emigration of many
      educated Africans has had an impact as well. Some candidates may wish to discuss the
      movement of temporary migrant labour but this is not true immigration/emigration and any such
      passages should be brief.


32.   “The impact of colonialism on the role of African women was mostly positive.” Discuss.

      The question requires that candidates offer a considered and balanced review of the argument that
      the impact of colonialism on the role of African women was mostly positive. They may support the
      argument by addressing ways in which colonial governments and missionaries provided some
      education for girls. The new colonial order also offered women the prospect of financial
      independence through wage labour or as market traders. Candidates may also look at how
      missionaries sought to eliminate discriminatory traditional practices such as polygamy and female
      genital mutilation. For areas of disagreement, candidates may consider how colonialism led to an
      increase in the average female workload, with men often having to leave home to work as migrant
      labourers in mines or on plantations. They may also focus on the gender structures of colonial
      administration and the ways in which it served to reinforce existing patterns of patriarchy and male
      domination.

Section 17: Post-war developments in the Middle East (1945–2000)

33.   Discuss the effects of the 1948–1949 War on Israel up to 1956.

      The question requires that candidates offer a considered and balanced review of the effects, up to
      1956, for Israel of the 1948–1949 War. This will include a range of arguments, factors or
      hypotheses. Candidates may consider a range of military effects including territorial changes,
      casualties, the establishment of a new state, the displacement of the non-Israeli population and the
      resulting tensions. Candidates may address the impact on society of measures for defence and
      security including the financial costs, the militarization of society and constant threat of attack.
      Population increase because of immigration may be considered. Candidates may focus on the
      need for economic development and financial support from external sources. Other effects may
      include the challenges and threats posed by the ongoing hostility of the Arab states and the
      Palestinian issue including the threat of war or terrorist activity.


34.   To what extent was Nasser responsible for the collapse of the United Arab Republic (UAR)?

      The question requires that candidates consider the merits or otherwise of the argument that
      Nasser was responsible for the collapse of the United Arab Republic (UAR). Candidates may
      consider Nasser’s desire to be seen as the leader of the Arab world, his determination to dominate
      the UAR and make Cairo its centre, a factor that alienated Syrian leaders and people, and his
      perceived subordination of the Syrian army within the UAR, which caused resentment and led to a
      revolt in 1961. Nasser’s ambitions caused many Syrians including the ruling party to suspect that
      he wished to severely limit their sovereignty and status, which undermined support for the UAR.
      Candidates may also consider other factors such as historic differences between Egypt and Syria
      and differences in their economic and political philosophies that made any union difficult. In
      addition, consideration may be given to the cultural, linguistic and religious differences between the
      two states.

35.   “Destabilization by outside forces was the main cause of conflict.” Discuss with reference to two
      post-independence African countries.

      The question requires that candidates offer a considered and balanced review that includes a
      range of arguments, factors or hypotheses regarding the importance of destabilization by outside
      forces as the cause of conflict. Candidates may consider a range of causes related to outside
      forces. These may include the communication of alternative ideas or ideologies that may have
      divided or agitated the population and encouraged revolts or civil wars through support of rival
      internal factions with arms or money. Other factors may include the recruitment and training of
      opposition movements or military invasions. Economic factors such as sanctions or promises of
      prosperity/investment if political changes occurred may be considered. Candidates may refer to
      other causes of conflict as alternative explanations, including ethnic and political rivalry, economic
      disputes, personal ambitions and historic animosities.


36.   Compare and contrast the impact of military rule on two post-independence African countries.

      The question requires that candidates give an account of the similarities and differences with
      respect to the impact of military rule on two post-independence African countries. Both countries
      must be referred to throughout the response. Candidates may consider a range of issues including
      the method used by the military to seize power, the nature of the government that was replaced by
      the military, the physical destruction or social and political conflict arising from their assumption of
      power, the degree to which the military was able to maintain or improve government operations,
      their treatment of the civilian population including legal rights and cultural or religious issues, and
      their role in promoting or preventing internal or external conflicts. Economic effects and foreign
      relations may be considered as well as their attitude to the restoration of civilian government. While
      both similarities and differences must be addressed, there need not be an equal number of each.
