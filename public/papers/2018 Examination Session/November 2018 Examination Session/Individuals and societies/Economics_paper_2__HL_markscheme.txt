                          at a lower opportunity cost than another country.

     (b)   Explain why “deteriorating terms of trade have resulted in a worsening of the current
           account” in South Sudan (paragraph ).                                                        [4]

                 definition/explanation of terms of trade
                 fall in the price of oil leads to a worsening of the terms of trade in South Sudan
                 demand for oil is price inelastic
                 thus a fall in the terms of trade leads to a fall in export revenue resulting in a
                  worsening on the current account on the balance of payments.

      and limitations. Opinions and conclusions should be presented clearly and
      supported with appropriate evidence and sound argument.

      Answers may include:
       definition of economic integration
       definition of common market.

      Advantages/opportunities of economic integration:
       larger export markets, may allow South Sudan producers to gain economies of
        scale, as noted in part (c). In the market for rice, this may allow South Sudan to
        develop a comparative advantage (paragraph )
       larger market may encourage diversification, and reduce South Sudan’s reliance
        on oil
       further stimulus for foreign direct investment as foreign companies will benefit
        from the larger market size; however, this may be limited by the low levels of
        human capital and high production costs (paragraph )
       opportunities to South Sudan workers who, with free movement of labour, may
        work in other East African countries
       advantages to South Sudan companies who, with free movement of capital, may
        invest in other East African countries
       cost of imported factors of production may decrease
       South Sudan can gain from the rapidly growing trade within the trading bloc
        (graph)
       greater political stability and cooperation, (paragraph ) may also result in higher
        levels of investment, leading to economic growth
       trade creation will benefit producers who can import inputs without tariffs
        (paragraph )
                                     –6–                N18/3/ECONO/HP2/ENG/TZ0/XX/M


 greater efficiency as domestic producers will have to compete with lower priced
  imports from other member countries
 consumers may have access to less expensive imported goods and services.
  However, this might be limited if trade diversion takes place and the new
  common external tariff makes some imported products more expensive
 bargaining power of South Sudan in multilateral trade negotiations can improve if
  it is part of the larger trading bloc
 economic integration can result in greater peace.

Disadvantages/challenges of economic integration:
 trade diversion (paragraph )
 the role of the WTO might be undermined, since it allows East African Countries
   to look inwards
 trade becomes more complicated with a series of intra-trading bloc agreements
 unemployment, as less efficient South Sudan companies (with higher labour
   costs, paragraph ), can’t compete with lower priced imports from other member
   countries
 any potential new trade agreements with non-members may be restricted by
   common external tariffs
 the larger the group the more difficult it is to come to agreements.

Any reasonable evaluation.

                          the economy.
                          For [2] there must be some indication of time eg sustained,

                        in a fixed exchange rate system
                        as a result of government or central bank intervention.

      Command term
      “Evaluate” requires candidates to make an appraisal by weighing up the strengths
      and limitations. Opinions and conclusions should be presented clearly and
      supported with appropriate evidence and sound argument.

Responses may include:

Strengths:
 will not need to use foreign currency reserves as much, which have fallen, to
   control the exchange rate (paragraph )
 the lower exchange rate should improve the balance of trade and so increase
   aggregate demand, helping to combat the negative economic growth
   (paragraph )
 the lower exchange rate may attract foreign investment
 interest rates will be freer for use in other policies
 could reduce levels of speculation
 lower export prices and higher import prices may increase AD and cause
   economic growth (paragraph ) depending on the Marshall Lerner condition
 could encourage import substitution (paragraph ) and help to diversify the
   Nigerian economy.

Limitations:
 there may still be some need to use reserves to maintain the “managed float”
  (paragraph )
 the fall in the value of the naira will raise the prices of imported necessity goods,
  negatively affecting poverty
 increased uncertainty and harder to plan ahead, which may limit the inflow of FDI
 speculation may increase
 the falling value of the naira may cause cost-push inflation/imported inflation
  (paragraph )
 may increase the cost of imported raw materials, increased cost of production to
  Nigerian firms, loss of competitiveness and possibly unemployment
 there may be a need for tighter monetary policy to deal with the higher inflation.
  This would increase the exchange rate and undo many of the benefits
  (paragraph ).

Any reasonably balanced evaluation.

To reach level 3, candidates must be aware of the particular situation in the Nigerian
economy, not just present a discussion of changing from a fixed exchange rate to a
floating exchange rate in general.

Responses may include:
 definition of economic development
 definition of appropriate technology
 definition of access to credit (including micro-credit)
 a way to break out of the poverty trap (paragraph )
 access to credit allows farmers to move away from subsistence farming
  (paragraph )
 examples of access to M-Kopa solar panels, allows shopkeepers to have access
  to electricity, keep shops open and earn more income, which contributes to
  economic development (paragraph )
 customers can save US$750 over four years (paragraph )
 solar power as an alternative to “dirty” electricity (causing negative externalities)
 M-Kopa offers loans for other equipment (paragraph ) which would improve the
  standards of living, that customers otherwise weren’t able to afford, due to a lack
  of collateral (paragraph )
 buying a water tank would improve sanitation (paragraph )
 the company is offering loans to pay for school fees, improving education

 better health due to the reduction of kerosene use (paragraph )
 increasing access to credit of US$100 000 per day to people who might otherwise
  not have access to credit (paragraph )
 M-Kopa (potentially) employs locals.

Any reasonable examination.

To reach level 3, candidates must make reference to economic development, and
both access to credit and appropriate technology should be addressed in

      Command term
      “Evaluate” requires candidates to make an appraisal by weighing up the strengths
      and limitations. Opinions and conclusions should be presented clearly and
      supported with appropriate evidence and sound argument.

      Responses may include:
       definition of economic development
       definition of FDI.

Consideration of potential benefits of FDI for development:
 provision of infrastructure may lead to economic growth which may lead to
  economic development (paragraph )
 FDI directly helps to boost economic growth rates and job opportunities in
  Myanmar, thereby improving the real income earned per person
 foreign firms facilitate the transfer of knowledge, which can help to improve the
  quality of the local labour (human capital), thereby enabling domestic workers to
  gain higher-paying jobs
 to attract more FDI, the government will have to invest more in infrastructure
  (paragraph )
 with increased access to infrastructure and electricity, more households could
  enjoy a higher standard of living and greater access to merit goods (eg
  healthcare and education services)
 to attract more FDI, the government will have to invest in human capital,
  potentially raising the living standards
 if Myanmar attracts Japanese and South Korean manufacturing MNCs, there
  might be increased access to consumer goods (paragraph )
 other possible benefits include:
   filling the domestic savings gap
   improving the country’s infrastructure
   increasing exports
   bringing in more foreign exchange
   greater tax revenues may be used to finance development objectives.

Consideration of potential costs of FDI for development:
 unsustainable development (paragraph )
 MNCs may not necessarily create jobs for locals. Even if there are, domestic
  workers may be limited to low-end paying jobs, or subjected to unfair employment
  conditions (paragraph )
 negative externalities generated from production could have detrimental effects
  on nearby communities, affecting their livelihood (paragraph )
 MNCs may not lead to diversification and the need for higher value-added
  production (paragraph )
 to attract MNCs, Myanmar may pursue “regulatory incentives” which may be
  harmful (paragraph )
 although MNCs may contribute to tax revenues, the tax incentives offered to
  attract MNCs may diminish this (paragraph )
 some FDI exploit a country’s scarce resources and are mainly beneficial the
  MNC.

Any reasonable evaluation.
