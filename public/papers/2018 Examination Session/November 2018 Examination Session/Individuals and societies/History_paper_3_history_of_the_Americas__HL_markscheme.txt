Apply the markbands that provide the “best fit” to the responses given and award credit wherever it is
possible to do so. If an answer indicates that the demands of the question are understood and
addressed but that not all implications are considered (for example, compare or contrast; reasons
or significance; methods or success), then examiners should not be afraid of using the full range of
marks allowed for by the markscheme. Responses that offer good coverage of some of the criteria
should be rewarded accordingly. If you are uncertain about the content/accuracy of a candidate’s
work please contact your team leader.

Section 1: Indigenous societies and cultures in the Americas (c750–1500)

1.   Evaluate the role of local and state authorities in one pre-Columbian society.

     The question requires that candidates make an appraisal of the role of local and state authorities in
     one pre-Columbian society. Candidates may argue that in some cases local authorities were more
     important than state authorities or vice versa depending on their chosen example. Candidates may
     address local and state authorities separately or they may attempt to compare their role in various
     fields. They may refer to the impact of local and state authorities on religious life, their control of
     cities or the organization of military forces. In agricultural societies, local or state authorities
     organized labour and introduced improvements in infrastructure. State authorities organized trade
     systems and controlled roads. Local authorities oversaw the distribution of lands and goods and
     the organization of daily life, and some local authorities cooperated with state authorities while in
     other cases there were tensions between the two.


2.   Discuss the role and nature of the tribute in two pre-Columbian societies.

     The question requires that candidates offer a considered and balanced review of the role and
     nature of the tribute in two pre-Columbian societies. Candidates may refer to the differing nature of
     tribute: products, labour or a kind of currency, such as cacao in some Mesoamerican areas. They
     may distinguish between state and local tributes. Candidates may mention the use of tribute for the
     development of infrastructure. They may argue that tribute also sustained rulers, political and
     religious hierarchies, and state bureaucracy. Additionally, or alternatively, candidates may discuss
     reciprocity and redistribution relationships, the use of tributaries, the relationship between local and
     state authorities (for example the caciques’ tributes to the Zipa in Chibcha culture, or the curacas’s
     tributes to the Inca).
                                                 –6–                 N18/3/HISTX/HP3/ENG/TZ0/AM/M


Section 2: European explorations and conquests in the Americas (c1492–c1600)

3.   Compare and contrast Spanish exploration of the Caribbean and British exploration of North
     America.

     This question requires that candidates give an account of the similarities and differences between
     the Spanish exploration of the Caribbean and the British exploration of North America, referring to
     both areas throughout. The aim of the British and Spanish explorations was to find a new route to
     Asia. The rulers of both countries permitted the explorations (with some limited funding), and both
     explorations were organized by companies that had to largely finance their own voyages. For
     contrast, candidates may argue that while the Spanish exploration arrived in areas with a more
     substantial indigenous population and used indigenous labour, the British reached areas with thinly
     dispersed populations. Therefore, the Spanish established closer contact with the indigenous
     peoples. Candidates may conclude that Spanish exploration was more successful as they
     established colonies. Both similarities and differences must be clearly indicated but allow for some
     imbalance between the number of comparisons and contrasts made.


4.   “The New Laws of the Indies (1542) protected indigenous populations.” To what extent do you
     agree with this statement?

     The question requires that candidates consider the merits or otherwise of the view that indigenous
     populations were protected by the terms of the New Laws of the Indies. Candidates may consider
     that the New Laws demanded fair indigenous tribute, prohibited the enslavement of indigenous
     people and the use of free labour. However, candidates may also argue that although the Laws
     opposed the encomienda, many initial measures were revoked. The use of indigenous labour
     continued under the institutions of mita and yanaconaje. Candidates may mention the positive
     effect of restricting the work undertaken by indigenous workers in the mines, but they could also
     claim the Laws established that indigenous labour may be used when necessary. Candidates may
     claim that the New Laws failed as a consequence of the protests of the encomenderos, such as
     the rebellion led by Gonzalo Pizarro.
                                                  –7–                  N18/3/HISTX/HP3/ENG/TZ0/AM/M


Section 3: Colonial government in the New World (1500–1800)

5.   Evaluate the factors that contributed to the success of colonial American economies.

     The question requires that candidates make an appraisal of the factors that contributed to the
     success of colonial American economies. There may be different approaches to this question as
     candidates may choose to discuss one economy in depth or offer a broader discussion of two or
     more. Either of these approaches is valid. In relation to some areas, candidates may argue that the
     success of colonial economies depended on the exploitation of minerals and relate it to their
     importance in mercantilist policies. In others, they may consider the availability of agricultural land
     and the production of valuable commodities, such as tobacco and sugar, for transatlantic trade.
     Indigenous or slave labour may be considered as a necessary factor to exploit the resources.
     Candidates may refer to the economic contribution of silver mines or slavery if relevant. The control
     of transatlantic trade may also be addressed.


6.   Discuss the nature and impact of the Bourbon reforms.

     The question requires that candidates offer a considered and balanced review of the Bourbon
     reforms in terms of their nature and impact. Although both nature and impact must be addressed,
     allow for some imbalance in each candidate’s treatment of the two factors. Candidates may refer to
     the economic, territorial and political nature of the reforms and their relationship to the
     Enlightenment. They may consider their impact on tax collection and social unrest. They may refer
     to the effect of specific reforms, such as Decrees of Free Trade, the intendancies or the
     establishment of new viceroyalties. Candidates may discuss how the reforms clashed with the local
     elites’ interests and their reactions to reforms. They may refer to the impact on the indigenous
     population and mestizos. They may consider the links between the reforms and rebellions in
     Southern and Alto Perú such as Túpac Amaru.
                                                –8–                  N18/3/HISTX/HP3/ENG/TZ0/AM/M


Section 4: Religion in the New World (1500–1800)

7.   “The Jesuits had a positive impact on the indigenous populations of Spanish and Portuguese
     America.” To what extent do you agree with this statement?

     The question requires that candidates consider the merits or otherwise of the assertion that the
     Jesuits had a positive impact on the indigenous populations in both Spanish and Portuguese
     America. In supporting the statement, candidates may argue that Jesuit reductions protected
     indigenous populations from the abuses of Spanish and Portuguese authorities and slave traders.
     Jesuits taught the indigenous populations agricultural techniques and crafts, and granted them
     working rights, such as a six-hour working day. The Jesuits respected some cultural values of the
     indigenous populations provided these did not clash with Christianity. To challenge the statement,
     candidates may argue that although some level of syncretism existed, Catholic practices such as
     baptism were enforced. They may refer to the corporal punishments inflicted on the native
     populations. They may also state that, although some communities could speak their native
     languages, the enforcement of the Spanish and Portuguese languages contributed to the decline
     of native tongues.


8.   “Religious syncretism contributed to the establishment of Christianity in the New World.” Discuss.

     The question requires that candidates offer a considered and balanced review of the impact of
     religious syncretism on the establishment of Christianity in the New World. Candidates may refer to
     the success of syncretism in Mexico in the 1530s. They may refer to how it assisted in the
     transition from polytheism to monotheism as local gods were associated with Christian saints.
     However, candidates may also claim that there were certain levels of resistance to Christianity by
     referring to the development of rituals and cults, such as Santería, which were condemned by the
     Church, but nonetheless continued to exist secretly. Candidates may offer a review of other
     contributing factors such as encomiendas and reductions. They may conclude that syncretism
     showed that the indigenous populations pretended to accept Christianity but continued to uphold
     their beliefs.
                                                  –9–                   N18/3/HISTX/HP3/ENG/TZ0/AM/M


Section 5: Slavery and the New World (1500–1800)

9.    Evaluate the contribution of slavery to economic growth in the Americas.

      The question requires that candidates make an appraisal of the contribution of slavery to economic
      growth in the Americas. Candidates may argue that slavery contributed to economic growth by
      solving the shortage of labour that followed the decimation of indigenous groups in many regions,
      such as the Caribbean. Slaves were used in infrastructural work, utilizing semi-skilled and unskilled
      labour. Slavery became an essential component of the economic growth of plantation agriculture.
      Candidates may also argue that the slave trade became an economic activity with high levels of
      profits for slave traders. On the other hand, candidates may note the relatively low productivity of
      slavery, which, combined with the cost of slavery, hindered economic growth. They may also state
      that, due to high mortality levels, it was economically unviable to use slaves in the silver mining
      industry.


10.   Discuss the living and working conditions of slaves on plantations in the West Indies and in Brazil.

      The question requires that candidates offer a considered and balanced review of the living and
      working conditions of slaves in the West Indies and in Brazil. While both areas must be discussed
      there need not be equal treatment of both. Topics discussed may include the difficult conditions
      endured by slaves. Slaves, including children and pregnant women, were forced to work long
      hours. Candidates may refer to high mortality rates among slaves, slaves’ limited access to
      education and health, and the abuse of slaves by owners. Candidates may also argue that there
      were differences in the conditions for slaves depending on the nature of their work. For example,
      domestic slaves had better living and working conditions than slaves working on the land.
      Candidates may argue that the conditions of slaves in plantations owned by religious orders in
      Brazil were less cruel. They may also claim that the splitting of families because of the slave trade
      was less frequent in Brazil. Candidates may or may not choose to use a comparative approach.

Section 6: Independence movements (1763–1830)

11.   “Independence movements in the Americas emerged because of economic factors rather than
      political factors.” With reference to one independence movement, to what extent do you agree with
      this statement?

      The question requires that candidates consider the merits or otherwise of the suggestion that
      economic causes were more important than political causes in starting independence movements
      in the Americas. Candidates may agree, partly agree or disagree with the statement. For economic
      causes, candidates may refer to mercantilism, and to the strict control of trade and taxation. For
      Spanish colonies, Creoles felt they were prevented from economic success by the Peninsulars,
      who ran the colonies and had greater ties to Spain. Candidates may refer to political causes such
      as the ideas of the Enlightenment, laws being imposed on the colonies by the mother country, and
      lack of representation. Spanish colonies were reluctant to be ruled by Joseph Bonaparte, the
      French replacement for Ferdinand VII.


12.   “The achievement of independence for new nations was beneficial to the indigenous peoples who
      lived in them.” To what extent do you agree with this statement?

      The question requires that candidates consider the merits or otherwise of the statement that the
      indigenous peoples of the Americas benefitted from living in newly-independent nations. There
      may be different approaches to this question as candidates may choose to discuss one people in
      depth or offer a broader discussion of two or more peoples. Either approach is valid. Candidates
      may argue that independence was fully, partly or not at all beneficial for indigenous peoples in the
      Americas. For the latter two, they may argue that indigenous groups were expelled from their lands
      or denied land rights or that the massacres of indigenous groups occurred in many parts of the
      Americas. They may also claim that indigenous peoples were denied the right to vote, lacked
      educational opportunities and were forbidden to speak their languages. In contrast, it may be
      suggested that some indigenous peoples voluntarily abandoned their communities looking for
      better economic opportunities in cities.

Section 7: Nation-building and challenges (c1780–c1870)

13.   “Newly-established political systems in Latin America faced significant challenges.” Discuss with
      reference to one Latin American country.

      The question requires that candidates offer a considered and balanced review of the challenges
      faced by new political systems in one country of Latin America. The extent of economic, political or
      social challenges to one new political system may be assessed and candidates may argue that
      one of these was more significant than the others. For economic challenges, candidates may
      consider the impact of factors such as the disruption of trade patterns, the cost of the wars of
      independence, the difficulty to raise taxes or the lack of infrastructure. For political challenges, they
      may discuss the influence of political instability, revolts, territorial fragmentation, or rivalries or
      political tensions between conservatives and liberals. Candidates may also argue that absence of
      institutions to replace the colonial administration, combined with lack of experience, were
      significant challenges. For some countries, candidates may argue that the absence of a significant
      middle class was a challenge, as was racial conflict.


14.   “The Mexican–American War (1846–1848) had a greater impact on the US than on Mexico.”
      To what extent do you agree with this statement?

      The question requires that candidates consider the merits or otherwise of the assessment that the
      US, rather than Mexico, was affected more significantly by the Mexican–American War.
      Candidates may agree, partly agree or disagree with the statement. They may refer to the terms of
      the Treaty of Guadalupe–Hidalgo, which included recognition of American claims to Texas and
      ceded much of northern Mexico, which became the southwest US, including gold rich California.
      The US agreed to pay Mexico US$15 million for the land. American victory strengthened feelings
      of Manifest Destiny and reopened the debate over the expansion of slavery. For Mexico, the loss
      of nearly one third of its land and population caused the conservative government to collapse. The
      defeat caused a loss of national honour and a lasting resentment towards the US.

Section 8: United States’ Civil War: Causes, course and effects (1840–1877)

15.   Discuss the strengths and weaknesses of the Union and the Confederacy at the outbreak of the
      Civil War.

      The question requires that candidates offer a considered and balanced review of the strengths and
      weaknesses of the Union and the Confederacy at the outbreak of the US Civil War. No approach is
      specified. Candidates may, for example, choose to address the strengths and weaknesses of each
      side in discrete groups, or they may choose to focus on individual arguments in their assessment.
      Candidates may refer to Union strengths as population, industrial output, railroads, an established
      military consisting of an army and a navy, and a solid government. Weaknesses could be quality of
      initial generals and reasons for going to war. Confederate strengths could be military leadership,
      King Cotton and motivation to fight to defend their way of life. Candidates might see Confederate
      weaknesses as a newly formed government, lack of financial resources, inability to make seceded
      states cooperate, and a lack of a navy and an established army.


16.   “Congressional plans for Reconstruction aimed to punish, rather than rebuild and reform the
      South.” To what extent do you agree with this statement?

      The question requires that candidates consider the merits or otherwise of the assessment that
      Congressional plans for Reconstruction were guided not so much by the desire to rebuild and
      reform as they were by a desire to punish the South. Candidates may agree, partly agree or
      disagree with the statement. Candidates may refer to Radical Republicans being dissatisfied with
      President Johnson’s Reconstruction plans, especially after scores of former Confederate officers
      were returned to Congress in the initial post-war elections. The Republicans saw Johnson’s plan
      as too lenient and they were intent on getting revenge on the South for starting the war. The
      Military Reconstruction Act divided the South into five zones of occupation by the US Federal
      Army. All former Confederate states had to accept the 13th, 14th and 15th Amendments which
      could be seen as reforming the South. No federal funds were used to rebuild the war-torn South,
      and many states were too poor to provide it themselves.

Section 9: The development of modern nations (1865–1929)

17.   Compare and contrast the influence of immigration on the development of two countries in the
      Americas.

      The question requires that candidates, referring to both countries throughout, give an account of
      the similarities and differences between two countries of the Americas in terms of how their
      development was affected by immigration. Although candidates are expected to refer to both
      similarities and differences, there does not need to be an equal number of these. Candidates may
      compare and contrast the extent to which immigration helped to solve the labour shortage in
      different economic activities. They may also compare and contrast the extent to which immigration
      contributed to the growth and development of underpopulated regions in each country. Candidates
      may choose to compare and contrast the cultural and intellectual influence of immigrants with
      reference to the arts, languages and/or popular culture. Additionally, or alternatively, they may refer
      to levels of immigrant assimilation between the two countries.


18.   Discuss the successes and failures of one Latin American leader.

      The question requires that candidates offer a considered and balanced review of the successes
      and failures of a Latin American leader during the requisite timeframe. Candidates may refer to
      domestic economic, social and political issues, as well as foreign policy. Economic policies could
      include development and expansion, trade, land issues, labour, foreign investment, and stability or
      prosperity. Social factors may include health, education, and the position of women and minorities,
      while political factors may include centralization versus regionalism, governmental structure,
      elections, relations with the Church and challenges to authority. Popular choices may be Porfirio
      Diaz or any of the presidents who took power during or after the Mexican Revolution; the
      Argentinians Nicolas Avellaneda, Julio Roca or Hipolito Yrigoyen; Eloy Alfaro of Ecuador; and Jose
      Balmaceda of Chile, but accept any Latin American leader from the period. While other factors may
      be discussed, the bulk of the response will be about the successes and failures of the chosen
      leader.

Section 10: Emergence of the Americas in global affairs (1880–1929)

19.   Discuss the effects of the Spanish–American War (1898) on the US and Cuba.

      The question requires that candidates offer a considered and balanced review of the effects of the
      Spanish–American War on both the US and Cuba. The effects of the war can be during and after
      the war. Being the first US war since the US Civil War, it created a sense of unity between former
      enemies and fostered national pride. It also fuelled the feelings of Anglo–Saxon superiority and
      imperialism. Some candidates may also argue that it made the US a world power. The US gained
      the Philippines, Guam and Puerto Rico and secured the independence of Cuba. With the removal
      of Spain from the area, the US became the dominant force throughout the region. For Cuba,
      candidates are likely to refer to the achievement of independence from Spain, but not total
      independence as the US remained very much involved in Cuba. Cuba wrote a constitution, created
      a national government and elected a president. However, the Platt Amendment to the constitution,
      which gave the US the right to intervene in Cuban affairs, was forced upon them.


20.   Discuss the reasons for, and nature of, Canada’s or one Latin American country’s involvement in
      the First World War.

      The question requires that candidates offer a considered and balanced review of the reasons for,
      and the nature of, the involvement of either Canada or one Latin American country in the First
      World War. Canada was involved from the beginning of the war as part of the British Empire.
      Canadian forces fought on the Western Front throughout the war, participating in many major
      battles, including the victory at Vimy Ridge. Economically, Canada saw an increase in agricultural
      and industrial exports. Although German submarine warfare affected many Latin American nations,
      all remained neutral until after US entry in 1917. Several Caribbean nations declared war, but did
      little else. Cuba sent a contingent of doctors and nurses to the Western Front and was preparing to
      send soldiers as the war ended. Brazil declared war in October 1917 in response to continued
      German U-boat attacks on Brazilian ships. The Brazilian navy patrolled the South Atlantic and a
      small contingent went to Europe.

Section 11: The Mexican Revolution (1884–1940)

21.   Compare and contrast the leadership of Madero and Zapata during the Mexican Revolution.

      The question requires that candidates give an account of the similarities and differences in the
      leadership of Madero and Zapata, referring to both leaders throughout. Although candidates are
      expected to refer to both similarities and differences, there does not need to be an equal number of
      each. Candidates may refer to aims, methods and achievements of each leader in comparing their
      leadership. Similarities may include the opposition to Porfirio Diaz and the willingness to use force
      against him. They both desired some element of democratic reform and gave their support to the
      plan of San Luis Potosí. Differences may include Zapata’s greater interest in land reform to benefit
      the peasants, whereas Madero focused more on achieving political reforms. While Madero was a
      reformer who wanted to introduce democratic practices in Mexico, Zapata aimed to lead a radical
      social revolution. Candidates may conclude that while Zapata achieved limited land reform,
      Madero became president of Mexico.


22.   Discuss the impact of the Mexican Revolution on the arts.

      The question requires that candidates offer a considered and balanced review of the impact of the
      Mexican Revolution on the arts, which may include visual art, literature, music, theatre and film
      among others. Candidates may argue that artists were influenced by Marxism and viewed
      intellectual art as a symbol of the old aristocracy. The revolutionary artists, such as Rivera, Orozco
      or Siqueiros, produced artworks for the people and gave importance to mural paintings on and in
      public buildings. Candidates may refer to the changes in the themes of their artworks, which
      became more politicized. Artists and intellectuals focused on Mexican history and traditions, with
      intellectuals, for example Enriquez and Vasconcelos, promoting indigenous cultures. Candidates
      may refer to the foundation of the National Museum of Anthropology and Archaeology or the
      editing of indigenous literature. They may also address the impact of the revolution on literature by
      referring to the novelists of the revolution or to music with the corridos or to educational reform.

Section 12: The Great Depression and the Americas (mid 1920s–1939)

23.   Discuss the political and economic causes of the Great Depression in the Americas.

      The question requires that candidates offer a considered and balanced review of the political and
      economic causes of the Great Depression in the Americas. There may be very different
      approaches to this question as candidates may choose to discuss one country in depth or offer a
      broader discussion of the Americas. Although candidates are expected to refer to political and
      economic causes, there does not need to be an equal focus on each. For political causes,
      candidates may refer to laissez-faire policies or the influence of the US on Latin American
      governments, which limited the development of national industries. For economic causes, they
      may discuss the financial speculation that led to the Wall Street Crash, arguing that, before 1929,
      sources of financing for Latin America were limited as funds were drawn into the US for speculative
      reasons. Candidates may also discuss overproduction, the decline of international prices and/or
      the exhaustion of primary export economies and the shrinking of domestic markets.


24.   Discuss how effectively one country in the Americas responded to the Great Depression.

      The question requires that candidates offer a considered and balanced review of how effective the
      responses to the Great Depression were in one country of the region. If the US is addressed,
      candidates may evaluate the effectiveness of Hoover’s policies and Roosevelt’s New Deal. For
      Canada, the policies of King and Bennett could be discussed. Candidates may consider the
      effectiveness of government response by assessing specific state policies, such as tax incentives,
      public works schemes and investments in strategic areas in one country. Candidates may assess
      the effectiveness of protectionist policies such as import quotas, production and price controls in
      the selected country. They may also assess the strengths and limitations of import substitution
      policies in the promotion of national industries and the development of non-traditional industries.
      Candidates may also evaluate the role of international trade agreements, such as the
      Roca–Runciman Pact, as effective responses to the Great Depression.

Section 13: The Second World War and the Americas (1933–1945)

25.   Examine the application and effects of Franklin D Roosevelt’s Good Neighbor Policy.

      The question requires that candidates consider the interrelationship between the application and
      effects of Roosevelt’s Good Neighbor Policy. Candidates may see the application as an extension
      of the improved relations established by the Hoover administration. However, they must focus on
      the Roosevelt presidency. The Good Neighbor Policy, which was implemented in 1933, pledged
      that the US would stop unilateral interventions in Latin American countries. It was reinforced at the
      Montevideo Conference in December 1933 and at other hemispheric conferences before and
      during the Second World War. The policy resulted in the withdrawal of US Marines from Nicaragua
      and Haiti, and terminated the Platt Amendment with Cuba. It also led to reciprocal trade
      agreements between the US and several Latin American countries. Some candidates may suggest
      that the policy enabled negotiations, rather than military action, between the US and Mexico after
      the seizure of American oil companies in Mexico.


26.   “The treatment of people of Japanese origin was consistent throughout the Americas during the
      Second World War.” Discuss.

      The question requires that candidates offer a considered and balanced review of the assessment
      that the treatment of people of Japanese origin was consistent throughout the Americas during the
      Second World War. Candidates are likely to say that it was, offering the US and Canada as
      examples. In both countries, Japanese were discriminated against and relocated to internment
      camps. Often their homes and businesses were confiscated by the government and sold. Many
      Latin American countries arrested their Japanese and deported them to the US. Some candidates
      will note differences in treatment of Japanese, even within a country. Japanese Americans on the
      west coast were relocated, those on the east coast were not, nor were those in Hawaii. Some
      Japanese–American citizens enlisted in the armed forces. Argentina, Brazil and Chile did not
      mistreat their Japanese population to any great extent.

Section 14: Political developments in Latin America (1945–1980)

27.   “Social rather than political factors were the main cause of the Cuban Revolution.” To what extent
      do you agree with this statement?

      The question requires that candidates consider the merits or otherwise of the assessment that
      social factors were more significant to the outbreak of the Cuban Revolution than political factors.
      Candidates may agree, partly agree, or disagree with the assessment. They may address the
      contribution of social causes to the outbreak of the revolution by referring to the grievances of the
      peasantry and urban workers and consider issues such as shortage of land, poor working and
      living conditions and limited access to healthcare, housing and education. Candidates may
      challenge the statement and claim that political causes played a more significant role in the
      revolution. In doing so, they may gauge the contributions of the rising opposition to Batista and his
      ineffective response, the role of political parties and of Fidel Castro. Candidates may, alternatively,
      argue that other factors played a more substantial role. While this is acceptable, candidates must
      focus on the importance or otherwise of the named issues.


28.   Discuss the origins and growth of the liberation theology movement in Latin America up to 1980.

      The question requires that candidates offer a considered and balanced review of the origins and
      growth of the liberation theology movement in Latin America up to 1980. Although discussion of
      both origins and growth is required, allow for some imbalance in their treatment. For origins,
      candidates may argue that the liberation theology movement responded to unaddressed economic
      and social problems such as poverty and hunger. They may also argue that the Second Vatican
      Council contributed to its foundation. For growth, candidates may discuss the contribution of
      working priests and Christian-based neighbour organizations that worked to promote land
      redistribution and better working conditions. They may argue that the growth of the movement was
      limited by the Church itself and, in some countries, by military governments as they both objected
      to what they claimed was a Marxist element in the ideology of the movement.

Section 15: Political developments in the United States (1945–1980) and Canada (1945–1982)

29.   Evaluate the impact of Truman’s Fair Deal.

      The question requires that candidates make an appraisal of the impact of Truman’s Fair Deal,
      weighing the strengths and limitations of the programme. Impact of the programme may extend
      beyond the timeframe of the Truman presidency. Candidates may refer to the Fair Deal as an
      extension of Franklin D Roosevelt’s New Deal. Truman’s proposals included increasing the
      minimum wage, expanding social security, public housing and health insurance, and protecting the
      civil rights of African Americans. Nearly all were blocked by the Republican Congress, although
      during his second term some, such as minimum wage increase, expansion of social security and
      building low-income housing, were passed. His policies expanded the size and role of the federal
      government and provided support for lower socio–economic groups. His advocacy for healthcare
      and civil rights came to fruition in later presidencies, most notably during that of Johnson with
      Medicare and Medicaid and the Civil Rights Act of 1964. Both strengths and limitations need to be
      discussed but there does not need to be an equal number of each.


30.   Compare and contrast the domestic policies of St Laurent and Diefenbaker.

      The question requires that candidates give an account of the similarities and differences in the
      domestic policies of St Laurent and Diefenbaker, referring to both throughout. They may choose to
      address the comparisons and contrasts in discrete groups, or they may choose to focus on
      individual arguments; no approach is specified. St Laurent, leader of the liberal party, was prime
      minister from 1948 until 1957, while conservative Diefenbaker’s ministry lasted from 1957 until
      1963. For similarities, candidates may argue that both increased pensions, promoted economic
      growth and advocated Canadian expansion; St Laurent by adding Newfoundland and Diefenbaker
      by promoting settlement of the Canadian North. Differences could be in fiscal policy and in
      openness to foreign investment. Both similarities and differences must be clearly indicated, but
      there does not need to be an equal number of each.

Section 16: The Cold War and the Americas (1945–1981)

31.   Discuss the rise of McCarthyism and its effects in the US.

      The question requires that candidates offer a considered and balanced review of the rise of
      McCarthyism and its effects in the US. Although both rise and effects must be addressed, there
      does not need to be an equal focus on each. For rise, candidates may discuss the Red Scare and
      Truman's anti-communism. Candidates may also address the support for McCarthyism from anti-
      communist groups. For effects, candidates may argue that McCarthy led a witch hunt and
      promoted the unfounded persecution of citizens. They may refer to blacklists in Hollywood, the
      persecution of members of left-wing associations, state officials and politicians, the loss of jobs,
      and imprisonments. They may discuss the role of the House of Un-American Activities Committee
      in the investigation of citizens. Candidates may consider the effects of McCarthyism by referring to,
      for example, official propaganda that warned of the dangers of and prepared the population for
      atomic war.


32.   Discuss the effect on Chile of Nixon's covert operations.

      The question requires that candidates offer a considered and balanced review of the effects of
      Nixon's covert operations on Chile. Candidates may adopt a chronological or a thematic approach
      to the question. In their responses, they may refer to Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) activities
      against Allende's election and government and discuss their impact on his fall. Candidates may
      argue that the covert operations funded labour unions and promoted strikes and protests. They
      may claim that Nixon financed some opposition groups and the press. Further, they may address
      the fact that the CIA provided weapons to Chilean military forces. Candidates may also discuss the
      impact of Nixon's economic measures on Chile. They may refer to the end of US economic
      assistance, the discouragement of foreign investments and the disruption of the international
      copper market as complementary ways to bring about instability.

Section 17: Civil rights and social movements in the Americas post-1945

33.   “Dr Martin Luther King Jr was the most influential leader of the African-American civil rights
      movement.” To what extent do you agree with this statement?

      The question requires that candidates consider the merits or otherwise of the statement that
      Dr Martin Luther King Jr was the most influential leader of the African-American civil rights
      movement. Candidates are likely to agree with the statement, but they may decide otherwise and
      indicate other leaders who were important to the movement. Candidates may include King’s
      leading of the Montgomery Bus Boycott, his founding of the Southern Christian Leadership
      Conference, his non-violent protests, marches, speeches and charisma. Other influential
      African-American leaders referred to may include: A Philip Randolph, founder of the Sleeping Car
      Porters Union, advocate for equal hiring during the Second World War and strong leader after the
      Second World War; James Farmer, founder of the Committee (later Congress) of Racial Equality
      (CORE); and Malcolm X.


34.   Evaluate the contributions of Cesar Chavez to the Hispanic American movement.

      The question requires that candidates make an appraisal of the contributions of Cesar Chavez to
      the Hispanic American movement, weighing the strengths and limitations of his efforts. Issues that
      might be addressed include Chavez’s work as a community organizer and in Hispanic voter
      registration drives, as well as his creation of the National Farm Workers Association, which later
      became the United Farm Workers. Chavez led many marches and boycotts, and used hunger
      strikes to gain more attention to the plight of migrant workers. In addition to economic gains,
      candidates may argue that Chavez’s efforts led to increased Hispanic pride and eventually the
      founding in 1970 of La Raza Unida; an Hispanic–American political organization.

Section 18: The Americas (1980–2005)

35.   “Clinton’s domestic policies led to substantial social and economic change.” Discuss.

      The question requires that candidates offer a considered and balanced review of Clinton’s policies
      on domestic social and economic change. Candidates may agree, partly agree, or disagree with
      the statement. While economic and social change must both be addressed, there need not be an
      equal focus on each. For social change, candidates may refer to the impact of racial and gender
      policies on the integration of women and minorities. Candidates may claim that Clinton's welfare
      reforms brought initial social improvement but then reduced families’ assistance. For economic
      change, candidates may consider the role of Clinton’s economic policies that aimed to reduce
      inflation and unemployment, increase productivity and appreciate the value of the dollar. There
      may be some discussion of whether economic growth was a consequence of Clinton's policies or if
      it was the result of a favourable international context.


36.   With reference to two Latin American countries, discuss the aims of violent and/or non-violent
      movements.

      The question requires that candidates, referring to two Latin American countries, offer a considered
      and balanced review of the aims of violent movements, non-violent movements or a combination of
      the two. When considering the aims, candidates may focus on demands for social justice and/or
      the fairer distribution of resources. They may consider demands for land, education, health
      services and access to water. There may also be discussion of the role of movements in promoting
      respect for indigenous traditions and cultures. Candidates may also consider movements for which
      the main aims were political, for example the restoration of democracy or the desire to bring about
      wider political engagement. Candidates may or may not choose to use a comparative approach.
