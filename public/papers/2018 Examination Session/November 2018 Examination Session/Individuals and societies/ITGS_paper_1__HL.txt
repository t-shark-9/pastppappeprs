Answer two questions. Each question is worth [20 marks].

1.   Google healthcare data

     Google is developing an app* to help hospital staff monitor patients with kidney disease. In order
     to develop this app, Google has signed an agreement with the UK’s National Health Service (NHS)
     that will give Google access to data on 1.6 million patients held in the NHS database.

     The database includes health-related data as well as personal data, some of which is sensitive.

     Google plans to use data mining techniques to analyse the data and provide information that can
     be used to improve the app. Once the app has been developed, it will be provided to the NHS.

     (a)   (i)     Identify two items of health-related data that could be used to improve the
                   treatment of patients.                                                                 [2]

		         (ii)    Identify two characteristics of data mining.                                           [2]

		         (iii)   Identify two reasons why NHS records are stored in a database rather than
                   a spreadsheet.                                                                         [2]

     (b)   The agreement between Google and the NHS includes policies for the collection,
           storage and sharing of patient data.

           Explain why it is important that the agreement between Google and the NHS includes
           policies for the collection, storage and sharing of patient data.                              [6]

     (c)   Evaluate the decision by the NHS to share patient data with Google.                            [8]

2.   Cell phone farmers

     Many farmers in Cameroon are not able to use the internet due to the very limited communication
     infrastructure in their country. In addition, accessing the internet is expensive for most farmers.

     As many farmers have cell/mobile phones, they could make better use of technologies such as text
     messaging (texting or SMS*) to access information that would assist them in their farming.

     Recent research has suggested that a lack of internet access is not the main factor limiting the
     development of farming in Cameroon. The main factor is farmers’ lack of IT knowledge.

     Some farmers in Cameroon are trialling a system called Agritexte that uses SMS to provide
     information on the market prices of produce such as cassava leaves and cocoa, see Figure 1.

(Question 2 continued)

     (a)   (i)     Identify two advantages of using text messaging to communicate.                   [2]

		         (ii)    Identify two items that contribute to the cost of accessing the internet.         [2]

		         (iii)   Outline the difference between the internet and the World Wide Web.               [2]

     (b)   Analyse the effectiveness of using face-to-face (F2F) training compared to distance
           learning to train farmers to use Agritexte.                                               [6]

     (c)	
         The government of Cameroon is watching the results of the Agritexte initiative. It is
         considering two options:
         • Extend the functionality of Agritexte into a web-based information system.
         • Invest in education and training on the use of the existing Agritexte SMS system.

           Evaluate these two options.                                                               [8]

3.   Sports photographs

     Action Link Click Photography (ALC Photography) is a company that specializes in taking
     photographs of participants in large sporting events, such as cycling and running events.
     ALC recently photographed the participants in a cycle event, see Figure 2.

     ALC’s photographers were positioned at five different points on the course, including the start
     and finish lines. Each photographer was equipped with a digital camera that takes
     high-resolution images. The photographer’s job is to photograph as many participants as possible.

     After the event, the photographs are compressed using lossless compression and transferred
     from the cameras’ memory cards to the ALC database. The photographs have tags added by the
     software, which recognizes the race participant by the number pinned to their bike.

     The images for each participant have their resolution reduced and are watermarked before they
     are added to ALC’s website. The participants are then able to purchase high-resolution copies of
     the photographs that do not have watermarks.

     It is also possible for anybody who views the image to purchase and download a
     high-resolution copy.

           uploaded to the ALC’s website.                                                            [6]

     (c)   Some people feel uncomfortable about having their photographs taken and posted on a
           public website.

           To what extent is it acceptable for ALC Photography to take photographs of
           participants, post them online and sell them?                                             [8]

4.   Route finding in Paris

     The Paris Transport Council has decided to develop the Système de Voyage dans Paris (SVP), an
     integrated journey planning system that will enable its users to find routes to their destination using
     different types of transport, see Figure 3.

                            Figure 3: An example of a route suggested by SVP




                               [Source: © International Baccalaureate Organization 2018]

     After some research, it was revealed that many factors influence people’s journey decisions.
     For example, travel time would be a key factor for someone going to work, as they would want the
     fastest route. However travel time would be a less significant factor for a tourist who may prefer a
     more scenic route. As a consequence, SVP project managers have put principles of fuzzy logic at
     the core of their system.

     Initially Joelle de Stark, the project manager decided to use an agile development methodology for
     SVP. However, as she got closer to the release of SVP, she also included the phases of alpha and
     beta testing as part of user acceptance testing (UAT).

(Question 4 continued)

     (a)   (i)    In addition to travel time, identify four other factors that could be used in the
                  development of the SVP.                                                                   [4]

		         (ii)   Identify two development personnel that would be included in Joelle de Stark’s
                  team.                                                                                     [2]

     (b)   (i)    Distinguish between alpha testing and beta testing.                                       [2]

		         (ii)   Explain why the project manager decided to use an agile development
                  methodology for the SVP.                                                                  [4]

     SingBot Robotics has developed a humanoid robot called Dennis. A large restaurant chain,
     Gustavo’s, has recently purchased a number of Dennis robots to use as waiters for one of its
     restaurants in Singapore.

     Customers can give Dennis their orders in two ways:
     • They can talk directly to him, in which case Dennis uses pattern recognition to distinguish menu
       items ordered, see Figure 4.
     • They can enter their choice directly on a touch screen, see Figure 5.

     When the order is ready, Dennis collects it from the kitchen and brings it to the table. Customers
     can pay by swiping their credit card above Dennis’s card reader.

     The marketing manager at Gustavo’s says that the robots improve the convenience and efficiency
     of the ordering process. She adds that “in their feedback, customers tell us that Dennis makes
     their experience more memorable”.

     The managers at Gustavo’s are considering the introduction of Dennis robot waiters in all
     their restaurants. They need to decide between using a Gantt chart or a Pert chart as project
     management tools.

(Question 5 continued)

     (a)   (i)     Identify two characteristics of a humanoid robot.                                    [2]

		         (ii)    Identify two methods that the marketing manager at Gustavo’s could use
                   to collect feedback from customers about Dennis.                                     [2]

		         (iii)   Identify two sensors that Dennis needs in order to operate successfully in the
                   restaurant.                                                                          [2]

     (b)   (i)     Customers speak to Dennis to give him their orders. Dennis uses pattern
                   recognition to understand what has been said to him.

                   Explain why Dennis uses pattern recognition rather than pattern matching to
                   understand what customers are saying to him.                                         [3]

		         (ii)    Explain why the managers at Gustavo’s would choose a Gantt chart as a

6.   Use of expert systems in university admissions departments

     Many universities have more applicants than places available. Eli McClure is the admissions
     officer for engineering at Curitiba University. It is his job to decide which students should be offered
     places on the engineering program. Many programs receive as many as 15 applications for every
     place and it is not possible to interview each student. Many of these applications are from students
     who are not suitable for the engineering program, as some do not have a mathematics qualification
     while others are predicted to achieve a low grade.

     At the moment, Eli’s staff look through each application and decide which applicants will be offered
     an interview. Eli is concerned that some suitable applicants may be incorrectly rejected because
     staff cannot read all of the applications as carefully as they would like. He wants to improve the
     application process, and is considering the introduction of an online questionnaire linked to a
     forward chaining expert system. Prospective students can take the questionnaire and answer
     a number of yes/no questions to find out whether they are likely to be offered a place at Curitiba
     University before they apply. This should then reduce the number of applications Eli’s team has to
     process and lead to the most appropriate applicants being selected for an interview.

     Eli is going to use a prototype of the expert system. It is anticipated that in the next five years this
     expert system will be used by all departments at Curitiba University.

     (a)   (i)     Identify two reasons why a prototype of the expert system was developed prior to
                   its release.                                                                            [2]

		         (ii)    Identify two constraints that the developers of the expert system might face.           [2]

		         (iii)   Outline the difference between forward chaining and backward chaining.                  [2]

(Question 6 continued)

     (b)   (i)    Explain why Curitiba University would use a phased changeover method for the
                  introduction of the expert system.                                                  [3]

		         (ii)   The diagram below shows the beginning of a decision tree that is part of an           
                  expert system to advise prospective students on their suitability for studying
                  engineering at Curitiba University.

                  Read the rules below, then copy and complete the decision tree.                     [3]

                  • Applicants will be suitable to progress to the interview if they are taking
                    mathematics AND are predicted to achieve a grade 4 or above.

                  • If an applicant meets both these requirements, they will receive the following
                    message: “You should continue with your application”.

                  • If an applicant does not meet both these requirements, they will receive the
                    following message: “Unfortunately you do not meet the requirements”.



                                           Do you wish to apply
                                             for engineering?


                                    Yes                             No




                             Are you studying
                              mathematics?




     (c)   As part of the admission process, some universities are considering the introduction of
           an online questionnaire and video submission, where the prospective student explains
           why they are applying for the program. It is hoped that the online questionnaire and
           video in combination with the face-to-face interview will give the admissions department
           the information required to decide whether or not to accept a student.

           To what extent will the introduction of an online questionnaire and video submission
           assist the admissions department when deciding whether to accept a student?                [8]
