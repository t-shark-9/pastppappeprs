Please start each question on a new page. Full marks are not necessarily awarded for a correct answer
with no working. Answers must be supported by working and/or explanations. In particular, solutions
found from a graphic display calculator should be supported by suitable working. For example, if
graphs are used to find a solution, you should sketch these as part of your answer. Where an answer
is incorrect, some marks may be given for a correct method, provided this is shown by written working.
You are therefore advised to show all working.

     A contagious virus affects the population of a small town with 5000 inhabitants.
     Let In denote the total number of people who have been infected by the end of the nth week.
     In the first week there were 10 cases of infection and by the end of the second week there
     was a total of 22 cases. A proposed model is that the number of cases is increasing in such
     a way that the number of new cases in any week is 1.2 times the number of new cases in the
     previous week.

     (a)   Show that In satisfies the recurrence relation In+2 - 2.2In+1 + 1.2In = 0 .            [2]

     (b)   State appropriate initial conditions.                                                  [1]

     (c)   Solve the recurrence relation to obtain an expression for In in terms of n .[6]

     (d)   Hence find during which week the whole town will become infected.                      [2]

     (e)   State two limitations of the model.                                                    [2]

     (a)   State, with a reason, whether or not G has an Eulerian circuit.                             [1]

     (b)   Use Kruskal’s algorithm to find a minimum spanning tree for G, stating its total weight.
           Indicate clearly the order in which the edges are added.                                    [4]

     The graph G is a plan of a holiday resort where each vertex represents a villa and the edges
     represent the roads between villas. The weights of the edges are the times, in minutes,
     Mr José, the security guard, takes to walk along each of the roads. Mr José is based at villa A.

     (c)   Use a suitable algorithm to show that the minimum time in which Mr José can get from
           A to E is 13 minutes.                                                                       [5]

     (d)   Find the minimum time it takes Mr José to patrol the resort if he has to walk along
           every road at least once, starting and ending at A. State clearly which roads need to
           be repeated.                                                                                [7]
