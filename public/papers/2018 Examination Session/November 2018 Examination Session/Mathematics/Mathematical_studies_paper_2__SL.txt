Answer all questions in the answer booklet provided. Please start each question on a new page.
You are advised to show all working, where possible. Where an answer is incorrect, some marks may
be given for a correct method, provided this is shown by written working. Solutions found from a graphic
display calculator should be supported by suitable working, for example, if graphs are used to find a
solution, you should sketch these as part of your answer.

     The marks obtained by nine Mathematical Studies SL students in their projects ( x) and their
     final IB examination scores ( y) were recorded. These data were used to determine whether
     the project mark is a good predictor of the examination score. The results are shown in the table.

           (i)     x , the mean project mark;

           (ii)    y , the mean examination score;

           (iii)   r , Pearson’s product–moment correlation coefficient.                               [4]

     The equation of the regression line y on x is y = mx + c .

     (b)   (i)     Find the exact value of m and of c for these data.

           (ii)    Show that the point M ( x , y ) lies on the regression line y on x .[4]

     A tenth student, Jerome, obtained a project mark of 17.

     (c)   (i)     Use the regression line y on x to estimate Jerome’s examination score.

           (ii)    Justify whether it is valid to use the regression line y on x to estimate Jerome’s
                   examination score.                                                                  [4]

     160 students attend a dual language school in which the students are taught only in Spanish
     or taught only in English.
