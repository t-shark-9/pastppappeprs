Extended response questions – quality mark

        ∝ Extended response questions for HLP2 each carry a mark total of [16]. Of these marks, [15] are awarded for content and [1] for the
          quality of the answer.

        ∝ [1] for quality is to be awarded when:

             ∝ the candidate’s answers are clear enough to be understood without re-reading.
             ∝ the candidate has answered the question succinctly with little or no repetition or irrelevant material.

        ∝ Candidates that score very highly on the content marks need not necessarily automatically gain [1] for quality (and vice versa).
