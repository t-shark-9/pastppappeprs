19.   In 1789 Gilbert White, a naturalist, observed eight breeding pairs of swifts (Apus apus) in the
      English village of Selborne.  On average, each pair of swifts produces two offspring per year.  
      This would allow the population to rise to 1030 swifts over 200 years.  A bird survey carried out
      in 1983 revealed only 12 breeding pairs in this village.

      What could have prevented the numbers rising to 1030?

		          I.       The number of nesting sites remained the same.
		          II.      The food supply of the swifts remained constant.
		          III.     Predatory birds in the area were exterminated.

24.   Limpets are molluscs with conical shells that cling tightly to rocks on seashores.  In a study of
      two species of limpets found on rocks along the Oregon coast, 30 randomly placed quadrats were
      used to determine how often the two species occurred together. The table shows the data that
      were collected.
