      The sub-sea oil and gas exploration and production unit of the company relies on thousands
      of kilometres of pipeline which are monitored by a computer control system which can detect
      leaks.

      (c)   Explain the environmental benefit of using a computer control system to monitor the
            pipeline.[3]

      The process of detecting leaks is carried out by sensors which are continuously monitoring
      changes in the flow and pressure of the liquids in the pipes.

      This data is processed on a computer in the office.

      If any of sensor values are outside of the acceptable parameters stored on a disk in the
      office, the following error routines are performed:

      • an alarm is sounded on the computer at the office
      • an email message is sent to managers in the Head Office.
      A member of staff can also configure the system.

      (d)   Explain the relationship between sensors, output transducers and processor in this
            situation.[4]

11.   The names of vegetables must be always held in alphabetical order in a list in the
      main memory.

      The application program should allow insertion and deletion of the names of vegetables from
      this list.

      (a)   Compare the use of a dynamic linked list for holding these names of vegetables with a
            static one-dimensional array.                                                                   [3]

      Given the following vegetables: potato, asparagus, lettuce, radish.

      (b)   Sketch a single linked list holding these vegetables.                                           [2]

      (c)   (i)    List the steps required to insert cabbage into the linked list.                          [4]

            (ii)   Explain why deleting the first node in this list is different to deleting other nodes.   [2]

      (d)   State the dynamic data structure suitable for maintaining this list of vegetables which
            will allow faster searching for a given vegetable name.                                         [1]

      The vegetable names are input in the following order

                                   potato, asparagus, lettuce, radish.

      (e)   Sketch the data structure suggested in part (d) containing the vegetable names sorted
            in alphabetical order.                                                                          [3]

            (ii)      Suggest how the algorithm used in method swap() would need to be modified to
                      successfully exchange the values of variables A and B.                         [2]

      Method swapRows(MAT,K,L) swaps the elements of two rows (row K and row L) in the
      two‑dimensional array MAT.

(Question 12 continued)

     A game consists of four rounds. In each round a player can score up to 100 points.

     The data about the game is sorted in alphabetical order of names and stored in the memory
     as follows

     Where
     PLAYERS is a one-dimensional array holding names of players (currently sorted in
     alphabetical order).
     ROUNDS is a two-dimensional array holding players’ scores.
     TOTALS is a one-dimensional array holding total scores.

     For example,
     PLAYER[1] is Boris. The total number of points he scored is 180 and this can be found in
     TOTALS[1].
     Boris scored 40 points in the first round which can be found in ROUNDS[1][0].
     The value stored in ROUNDS[1][2] is 50 which means that Boris scored 50 points in the
     third round.
