            Taiwan KOM Challenge – A Personal Account
            By Daniel Carruthers1




            I had heard of the famous Toroko Gorge climb to the summit of Wuling a few years ago and
            had always dreamed of doing the ascent to the clouds and beyond; but never found time to go
            and do it. This time, I was back in Taiwan competing in the Tour de Formosa, an invitational
            seven-day international race for deaf riders. The only problem was that the KOM (King of the
      5     Mountain) Challenge was the day after my 800km race around the island of Taiwan concluded
            and I would already be very tired, however the allure of climbing the “blood-stained beast”, as
            termed by Taiwan expat pro rider Lee Rodgers, deeply gripped me and I was going to do the
            climb no matter how tired I was. As an 85kg cyclist, I am by no means of climber build, nor do
            I profess myself to be a good climber – in fact I dread hills in bike races as they are the places
     10     where I am dropped by the lighter weight riders. Despite confronting what seems to be “every
            cyclist’s nightmare”, I was attracted to participating in the epic climb. I also knew that the road
            that we would race over is featured in the world’s top 10 most dangerous roads (mostly due to
            the numerous landslides and the way the road snakes its way around the edges of the gorge
            with a gaping drop opening below).
                                                      –3–                      N18/1/AYENG/HP1/ENG/TZ0/XX

    15    It is also billed as one of the most stunningly beautiful roads to cycle over. In short, it is a climb
          that should be on every cyclist’s bucket list2!

          The first 15km was a neutral roll-out before the gun was sounded at the start of the climb.
          The pack just surged forward and I found myself racing up near the front and, perhaps foolishly,
          attempted an acceleration at the very front, and then launching one of my trade-mark “suicide”
    20    attacks going up a steep grade into the tunnel. Italian rider Orrico Davide from the Atlas-Enervit
          team responded to my attack by chasing me down. I turned and saw him coming; as I sat up I
          saw that he had a smirk on his face and continued his acceleration. From this point on, I was
          content with riding comfortably in the pack.

          Once I had re-grouped myself after being dropped, I found myself picking off blown riders one
    25    by one, passing almost a dozen riders. It is a good motivating point when this is happening.
          I also had time to check out the scenery on the way up and just could not believe my eyes at
          how fantastically beautiful it looked. There was such contrast too as I rode higher and higher.
          From the lush green dense native bush to large twisted gaunt old trees that were straight out of
          the Goblin forest and the large pine forests in the drier alpine climate areas. Finally, at the top,
    30    it was a pretty barren wind-swept landscape.

          My Garmin3 recorded a total ascent of 3 500m and within the magnificent climb there was one
          3–4km descent that was welcomed after 70km of solid climbing. Just when you think you got a
          good tempo going, boom the road goes straight up for the last 13km with impossible gradients
          of up to 27% showing up on my GPS. Even the 28t sprocket I installed on my bike especially
    35    for this event was not enough as in some sections I found myself zig-zagging. The one good
          thing happening in those closing stanzas was that after every impossibly steep section, the road
          would briefly flatten out before dishing out the punishment again.

          Finally, the 1km sign appeared, but the gradient just got even steeper and what made matters
          worse was traffic was allowed to pass by and since I was zig-zagging a bit, a car nearly clipped
    40    me causing me to yell insanely. The onlookers also yelled at the car that went by as they
          understood my plight. I could see the finish banner looming up the top with a large crowd of
          people gathered to watch the finishers. Still I had 300m of steep hill to climb, but I had renewed
          energy and pressed on the pedals harder and even sprinted in the last 100m – free-wheeling
          past the head commissionaire who gave me a high-five. He was also the head commissionaire
    45    for the Tour de Formosa that I had just completed and he knew what a week I had gone
          through.

          I’d like to see another climb in the world that can rival this magnificent beast rising out of the
          island of Taiwan. At 100km long, even factoring in some short downhills within, it is possible
          that this is the longest and most varied beautiful climb in the world. Put it on your bucket list
    50    of cycling events to do in your lifetime. Every keen cyclist I have spoken to about this KOM
          challenge has gotten excited as the allure of the mountain has gripped their imagination.
