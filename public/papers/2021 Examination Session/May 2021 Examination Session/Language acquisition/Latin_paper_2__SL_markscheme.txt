     (b)    Award [1] for any relevant point of discussion supported by the Latin text; and [1] for a
            credible effect, such as:
               • alliteration (eg, cursu concitus) emphasizes the effort of the throw
               • assonance (eg, on -m- currentem se nec cognoscit euntem tollentemve manus

               • Polysyndeton (neque currentem se nec…euntem tollentemve…saxumve…moventem)
                   adds tension as the list increases and adds emphasis to the totality of the motions.

               • Anastrophe (heros) placed at the end of the line to emphasize Turnus’ effort
               • Alliteration (genua labant, gelidus) – underscores Turnus’ fright

            totum or neque pertulit ictum) [1].

     (d)    Just as in dreams [1]; our bodies sometimes do not react like we wanted/ we are powerless
            to change the outcome (or similar) [1]; so was Turnus powerless [1] under the effect of the
            goddess [1]. The student must include both parts of the simile (i.e. explaining elements of

            in hostem) [1]; he did not see his charioteer or chariot (currus or aurigam) [1] or his sister
            (sororem) [1]. If the student is identifying Turnus’ charioteer as his sister (aurigamve
            sororem) (as she has taken the form of his charioteer) the student can receive two points if
            they identify it with the chariot.
                  Currus + aurigam →1 point
                  Currus + sororem →2 points
                  Aurigam + sororem → 2 points
                  Currus + aurigamve sororem → 2 points
