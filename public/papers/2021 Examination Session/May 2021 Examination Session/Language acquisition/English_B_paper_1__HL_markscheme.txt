Criterion A: Language

How successfully does the candidate command written language?
• To what extent is the vocabulary appropriate and varied?
• To what extent are the grammatical structures varied?
• To what extent does the accuracy of the language contribute to effective communication?

  Marks                                         Level descriptor
     0       The work does not reach a standard described by the descriptors below.
             Command of the language is limited.
             Vocabulary is sometimes appropriate to the task.
    1–3      Some basic grammatical structures are used, with some attempts to use more
             complex structures.
             Language contains errors in both basic and more complex structures. Errors interfere
             with communication.
             Command of the language is partially effective.
             Vocabulary is generally appropriate to the task and varied.
    4–6      A variety of basic and some more complex grammatical structures is used.
             Language is mostly accurate for basic structures, but errors occur in more complex
             structures. Errors at times interfere with communication.
             Command of the language is effective and mostly accurate.
             Vocabulary is appropriate to the task, and varied, including the use of idiomatic
             expressions.
    7–9
             A variety of basic and more complex grammatical structures is used effectively.
             Language is mostly accurate. Occasional errors in basic and in complex grammatical
             structures do not interfere with communication.
             Command of the language is mostly accurate and very effective.
             Vocabulary is appropriate to the task, and nuanced and varied in a manner that
             enhances the message, including the purposeful use of idiomatic expressions.
  10–12      A variety of basic and more complex grammatical structures is used selectively in
             order to enhance communication.
             Language is mostly accurate. Minor errors in more complex grammatical structures
             do not interfere with communication.

Language
Not all errors have the same importance, and examiners should bear this in mind. Some errors
affect the communication of meaning significantly, and others do not. Also, some errors indicate a
fundamental lack of command of the language, while others may simply indicate a moment of
forgetfulness.

SLIPS – mistakes at all levels of difficulty, but erratic and occasional – eg the candidate normally
forms past tenses well, but occasionally forgets “-ed”.

FLAWS – errors occur more regularly, particularly in certain structures – eg past tenses are formed
correctly quite often, but are not really reliable, and there may be basic confusions (eg past simple
versus present perfect).

GAPS – some structures are rarely correct, or simply don’t appear – eg the past tenses are
needed, but do not appear.

Criterion B: Message
To what extent does the candidate fulfil the task?
  • How relevant are the ideas to the task?
  • To what extent are ideas developed?
  • To what extent do the clarity and organization of ideas contribute to the successful delivery of
    the message?

The “descriptor unpacked” explain the assessment criteria in greater detail. Where a candidate’s
response does not correspond exactly to a single mark band, the statements in bold should be
used as a guide for the ‘best fit’ approach.

Note: When marking candidate responses, keep in mind that neither the factual accuracy of the
information presented, nor the validity of the candidates’ personal opinions, are being assessed.
Therefore, scripts that are factually inaccurate should not be marked down, provided the ideas
presented have coherence and are sufficiently developed.



Criterion C: Conceptual understanding

To what extent does the candidate demonstrate conceptual understanding?
   •       To what extent is the choice of text type appropriate to the task?
   •       To what extent are register and tone appropriate to the context, purpose and audience of the
           task?
   •       To what extent does the response incorporate the conventions of the chosen text type?

Note: Examiners must balance all three elements in criterion C (choice of text type,
appropriateness of tone and register, and use of text type conventions) to arrive at the final mark.

Question specific guidance (Criterion B and C)

Task 1

 You notice that many languages in the world are in danger of disappearing and feel that the
 international community is not doing enough to save them. You want to raise awareness of this
 and urge the world to take action. Write a text in which you describe the causes of the
 languages’ disappearance, explain why preserving them is important, and suggest what world
 leaders should do.

 Letter to the editor              News report                      Set of guidelines

Criterion B:
• The three required elements of the task are: (i) to describe the causes, (ii) to explain why
  preservation is important, and (iii) to suggest actions.
• Equal weight does not have to be given to all three elements, but all should be given some
  developed attention. If one is ignored, or given only cursory attention (e.g. dismissed in one
  sentence), no more than the 4-6 band should be awarded, since the task has only been “generally
  fulfilled” at best.
• Factual knowledge about the causes of language disappearance need not be accurate; and the
  suggestions do not have to be strictly credible. Neither of these factors should affect marking, so
  long as the ideas provided are reasonably relevant.


Criterion C:

                                             a mass audience, but it is typically used to inform on
                                             recent events in a neutral way. The choice may be
                                             considered “appropriate” only if the response covers
                                             the task elements ‘explain’ and ‘suggest’ through

                                             would be for “world leaders”. Individuals tend not to
                                             proactively write instructions for world leaders.

Note: If a response makes the context, audience and purpose of the writing clear, and these
conform to the task, the “generally appropriate” text type may be considered “appropriate”, or the
“generally inappropriate” text type considered “generally appropriate”.

Register and tone:
• semi-formal to formal register
• an appropriately serious tone

Please refer to the appendix for a list of text type conventions.

Task 2

 Your city has become a very popular destination for tourists from around the world. You have
 inquired into the impact of mass tourism on different groups of people in the city. You want to
 inform the public about your investigation. Write a text in which you describe the situation,
 highlight opinions from the different groups of people, and draw attention to what needs to be
 addressed going forward.

 News report                       Set of guidelines                Speech

Criterion B:
• The three required elements of the task are: (i) describe the situation, (ii) summarise opinions of
  different groups, and (iii) draw attention to (i.e. explain) what needs to be corrected.
• Equal weight does not have to be given to all three elements, but all should be given some
  developed attention. If one is ignored, or given only cursory attention (e.g. dismissed in one
  sentence), no more than the 4-6 band should be awarded, since the task has only been “generally
  fulfilled” at best.
• The phrase “what needs to be addressed” only applies, strictly speaking, to the problems
  perceived – it does not require solutions. If solutions are provided, this may indicate thoughtful
  development, but it is more than the task actually requires and so neither presence nor absence
  of solutions should affect marking.

                                             smaller, more clearly defined group of people. The
                                             choice may be considered “appropriate” if the
                                             response makes clear that the speech is addressing a
                                             wide group of people (e.g. the town’s population

Task 3

 You have just returned from a volunteering programme overseas and have been invited to share
 your experience with students who are considering the same programme. Write a text in which
 you describe what was most challenging in achieving the programme’s objectives, explain how
 you addressed it, and reflect on how it has changed your outlook on life.

 Letter to the editor              Official report                  Speech

Criterion B:
• The three required elements of the task are: (i) describe “most challenging”, (ii) explain how
  addressed, and (iii) reflect on personal change.
• All three action verbs should be linked to “the programme’s objectives” in reasonably clear ways.
  A response which digresses significantly into general personal experience (e.g. “I missed my
  family” at length) should not receive more than the 7-9 band, unless the personal experience has
  at least some evident link to the programme’s work.
• Equal weight does not have to be given to all three elements, but all should be given some
  developed attention. If one is ignored, or given only cursory attention (e.g. dismissed in one
  sentence), no more than the 4-6 band should be awarded, since the task has only been “generally
  fulfilled” at best.
• The “volunteering programme overseas” does not have to be described in great detail, but the
  “objectives” should be clear.
