Answer all questions.

12.   A school currently has a cabled network but wants to add wireless networking across
      the whole campus.

      (a)   Describe two hardware components the school will need to implement the
            wireless network.                                                                           [4]

      (b)   Identify two advantages to the students of the new wireless network.                        [2]

      There are concerns that unauthorized people could access the data on the wireless network.

      (c)   Outline two methods the school could employ to prevent network data from being
            accessed over their wireless system.                                                        [4]

      The school has decided to implement a virtual private network (VPN) to provide access
      to its network.

      (d)   Identify two technologies the school would require to provide a VPN.                        [2]

      (e)   Explain one benefit to the staff of using a VPN to remotely access the school network.      [3]


13.   A company has 600 employees whose names are currently stored using a collection
      called NAMES. The names are stored as surname, first name. For example: Smith, Jane,
      Uysal, Rafael, Ahmed, Ishmael, Jonsonn, Sara, …

      (a)   Construct a pseudocode algorithm that will store the surnames in one array and
            first names in another.                                                                     [4]

      The names in the collection are kept in a random order. However, it would be more useful
      if they were kept in alphabetical order.

      (b)   Construct a pseudocode algorithm that will sort the surnames into alphabetical order
            using the bubble sort method. The order of the first names must also be changed so
            that they keep the same index as their corresponding surname.                               [5]

      The company’s staff list is now organized in the arrays in alphabetical order.

      A binary search was used to find a specific name in the array.

      (c)   Describe the process a binary search would follow to find a record in the surname array.    [4]

      (d)   Outline one benefit of using sub-programmes to implement your algorithms from parts
            (a) and (b).                                                                                [2]

      cannot be negative.

      The flowchart contains a logic error that will affect the algorithm’s functionality.


                                                   START

(Question 14 continued)

      (a)   (i)	Identify the logic error in the algorithm.                                                  [1]

            (ii)   Outline how the error in the algorithm identified in part (i) can be corrected.           [2]

      The algorithm is to be altered to restrict the values that are input to whole numbers
      between 0 and 1000.

      (b)   State the name of the method that could be used to restrict the values that are input.           [1]

      A further change has been requested for the algorithm to enable it to calculate the average of
      all the numbers entered. The average will be output when the algorithm terminates.

      (c)   Based on the flowchart, construct this algorithm using pseudocode. You must include
            the required changes:
            • correction of logic error
            • only allow input of integers between 0 and 1000
            • calculation of average of all numbers entered
            • output of final average.                                                                       [8]


15.   A business has a range of different computers within the organization, including laptops,
      desktops and file servers. Wherever possible the organization uses a common operating
      system on its computers.

      (a)   Outline two resource management techniques that are likely to be carried out by the
            operating system of a desktop computer.                                                          [4]

      (b)   Outline one way the operating system hides the complexity of the hardware from the
            computer user.                                                                                   [2]

      Memory requirements and processor speed will vary depending on the tasks required of
      the computer.

      (c)   (i)	Contrast the memory requirements of a laptop computer and a file server.                    [2]

            (ii)   Contrast the processor speed requirements of a laptop computer and a file server.         [2]

      The business has decided to implement a computer-based system to switch the room lights
      on and off automatically. The lights will only be switched on if the level of light is below a
      specific reading and there are people in the room. The lights will be switched off when the
      room has been unoccupied for at least five minutes.

      (d)   State two types of sensor that are required to control the lighting to ensure it switches
            on when it is required.                                                                          [2]

      (e)   Explain how the system makes use of the data it receives from the sensors to
            determine when to switch the lights on.                                                          [4]

      (f)   Outline how the system will prevent the lights from being switched off too quickly when
            it thinks the room is unoccupied.                                                                [2]



                                                                                                      Turn over

16.   A network is set up with shared printers so that when a user wishes to print, print jobs are
      sent to a queue until the printer is available.

      (a)     Outline why a queue is the appropriate data structure to manage print jobs.                       [2]

      (b)     Draw a diagram to show how a print queue may be implemented using a linked list.                  [3]

      (c)     Explain why a stack would not be appropriate as a data structure for managing print jobs. [3]

      The factorial of the positive integer n, which is written n!, is the product of all the positive
      integers less than or equal to n. A stack may be used to perform a factorial calculation as
      shown by the algorithm:

      //stack for factorial(NUM)
      //creates a stack of (NUM - 1) elements
      //when NUM = 6
      NUM = 6
      loop while NUM > 1
          stack.push(NUM)
          NUM = NUM – 1
      end loop
      PRODUCT = 1
      loop while not stack.isEmpty()
          NUM = stack.pop()
          PRODUCT = PRODUCT * NUM
      end loop
      output PRODUCT

      (d)     Copy and complete the trace table for the algorithm shown for NUM = 6.[3]

                                    NUM            PRODUCT             OUTPUT

                                     6



      (e)     Explain how a stack may be used in the implementation of a recursive function.                    [4]
