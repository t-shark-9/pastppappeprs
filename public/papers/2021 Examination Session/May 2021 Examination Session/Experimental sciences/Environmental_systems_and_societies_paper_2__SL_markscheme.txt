Subject details: Environmental systems and societies SLP2
Markscheme
Mark allocation

Candidates are required to answer:
• ALL questions in Section A [25] and TWO questions in Section B [40].
• The maximum total = [65].


1.   Environmental systems and societies uses marking points and markbands to determine the
     achievement of candidates

     When using marking points (All of this paper except Section B, part (c) questions):
       i.    A markscheme often has more marking points than the total allows. This is intentional
      ii.    Each marking point has a separate line and the end is shown by means of a semi-colon
             (;)
      iii.   Where a mark is awarded, a tick/check () must be placed in the text at the precise
             point where it becomes clear that the candidate deserves the mark. One tick to be
             shown for each mark awarded
     iv.     The order of marking points does not have to be as in the markscheme, unless stated
             otherwise.

     When using markbands (Only for Section B, part (c) questions):
       i.    Read the response and determine which band the response fits into
      ii.    Then re-read the response to determine where the response fits within the band
      iii.   Annotate the response to indicate your reasoning behind the awarding of the mark
             Do not use ticks at this point
     iv.     Decide on a mark for the response
      v.     At the end of the response place the required number of ticks to enable RM Assessor to
             input the correct number of marks for the response.


2.   An alternative answer or wording is indicated in the markscheme by a slash (/). Either wording
     can be accepted.

3.   Words in brackets ( ) in the markscheme are not necessary to gain the mark.

4.   Words that are underlined are essential for the mark.

5.   If the candidate’s answer has the same “meaning” or can be clearly interpreted as being of
     equivalent significance, detail and validity as that in the markscheme then award the mark.
     Where this point is considered to be particularly relevant in a question it is emphasized by
     OWTTE (or words to that effect).
                                                    –4–            M21/4/ENVSO/SP2/ENG/TZ0/XX/M


6.   Remember that many candidates are writing in a second language. Effective communication
     is more important than grammatical accuracy.

7.   Occasionally, a part of a question may require an answer that is required for subsequent
     marking points. If an error is made in the first marking point then it should be penalized.
     However, if the incorrect answer is used correctly in subsequent marking points then follow
     through marks should be awarded. When marking, indicate this by adding ECF (error carried
     forward) on the script.

8.   Do not penalize candidates for errors in units or significant figures, unless it is specifically
     referred to in the markscheme.

                                             Section A
1.   (a)   With reference to Figures 1(a) and 1(b):

           (i)    State the food that has the highest environmental impact.                        [1]

                  beef;

           (ii)   State the food that has the highest recommended consumption.                     [1]

                  fruit/vegetables;

     (b)   Describe the relationship between both pyramids in Figures 1(a) and (b).           [2 max]

           generally, the foods with the higher level of recommended consumption
           have a lower environmental impact;
           foods at the “top” (pictorially, rather than both apices) of both pyramids tend
           to be from higher trophic levels/produce a higher ecological footprint (EF) /
           foods at “bottom” of both pyramids tend to be from lower trophic
           levels/primary producers/produce a lower EF;
           pyramids appear opposite to one another / have an inverse
           relationship/negative correlation;

     (c)   Identify two environmental impacts associated with producing the foods near
           the base of the recommended consumption pyramid (Figure 1(a)).                     [2 max]

           use of pesticides/herbicides causing soil degradation / superbugs /
           superweeds;
           over use of fertilizers causing soil degradation / eutrophication;
           over-cultivation of land causing soil degradation;
           intensive irrigation/over use of water leading to water scarcity / salinization;
           mono-cropping reducing biodiversity/increasing risk of losses through
           disease;
           use of fossil fuels through mechanization/intense farming/food miles that
           release GHGs/CO2;
           methane released from rice-farming;

           Credit can be given to any valid impact of agricultural food production.
           Credit may be given for positive impacts (eg roots prevent soil erosion/crop rotation
           enriches soils) but not just the absence of negative impacts (eg less methane/less
           water, etc)
                                             –6–            M21/4/ENVSO/SP2/ENG/TZ0/XX/M


(d)   Describe how foods high on the environmental impact pyramid, shown in
      Figure 1(b), are likely to affect the ecological footprint of global food
      production.                                                                        [2 max]

      Ecological footprint will be greater because…
      higher trophic levels/more energy loss…;
      …greater land area required (to produce same quantity of food);
      more dependence on fossil fuels/mechanisation/food miles (+ release of
      GHG/CO2);
      release of methane from cattle increases global greenhouse gas
      concentration;
      higher water consumption when farming animals;
      overgrazing leading to loss of arable land;

      Award [1 max] if INCREASE in ecological footprint/land area required is not
      mentioned.
      Credit may be given for any valid impact on EF due to production of food high on
      environmental impact (beef/pork/poultry/fish/cheese/olive oil)


(e)   Outline two reasons why the composition of a typical diet in other regions of
      the world may differ from the Western European diet shown in Figure 1(a).          [2 max]

      Their choice may be influenced by…
      traditional/cultural/religious values of certain foods;
      suitability of the prevailing climate/topography/arable land;
      availability of water supply;
      available technology/expertise for certain cultivation techniques;
      wealth / relative cost of production;
      some countries/cultures may have different perceptions of what constitutes
      health/healthy eating;
      some cultures may consider environmental impacts/have EVS that influences choice of
      food production;
      some LEDCs may not be able to import foods so rely on more local foods;

      This is a general question addressing potential factors affecting food choice; no specific
      examples of other diets are required for full credit.
                                                  –7–            M21/4/ENVSO/SP2/ENG/TZ0/XX/M


2.   (a)   State the general pattern of change in global water scarcity predicted from
           1995 to 2025 as shown in Figure 2.                                                 [1 max]

           in many countries water scarcity will increase / higher percentages of water
           present will be extracted;
           changes are usually greater in the mid to lower latitudes/nearer the equator
           (than the poles);

     (b)   Identify two ways in which climate change may influence the predicted
           changes shown in Figure 2.                                                         [2 max]

           increased global temperatures will change wind/precipitation patterns
           affecting water supplies;
           increased precipitation will increase availability reducing scarcity / decreased
           precipitation will decrease availability increasing scarcity;
           increased temperatures will increase evaporation losses/drought/drying up
           of water sources (lakes, rivers, reservoirs) reducing availability;
           increased temperatures will melt ice storages increasing availability / run off
           into oceans decreasing availability;
           rising sea levels may cause salinisation of freshwater sources;

     (c)   Identify two possible human influences, not related to climate change, that
           may cause the changes in water scarcity predicted for 2025.                        [2 max]

           increased population (demanding more water);
           increased/intensive food production/agriculture (demanding more water);
           increased standards of living/industrialization (demanding more water);
           increased levels of contamination/pollution (through industrial development);
           damming of river/water supply upstream reducing available water
           downstream;
           increased surface run off due to urbanisation;

     (d)   Outline two reasons why some countries are unlikely to experience water scarcity.
                                                                                        [2 max]

           favourable climate where precipitation is high/evaporation is low;
           countries may have large replenishable storages (eg lakes/rivers/ice);
           developed countries with technology for effective water harvesting /
           desalination;
           more ecocentric value systems promoting sustainable use of water
           resources / limited pollution;
           no external conflicts over water sources;
           low population densities (with lower industrial/agricultural/domestic
           demands);
           low standards of living (with lower industrial/agricultural/domestic demands);
                                                  –8–             M21/4/ENVSO/SP2/ENG/TZ0/XX/M


3.   (a)   State where the ozone hole referred to in Figure 3 is located.                        [1]

           in the (lower) stratosphere / over the poles / above the Antarctic/Arctic / at
           higher latitudes / Australia/NZ;

     (b)   Describe the changes in mean ozone hole area between 1979 and 2016.               [2 max]

           rapid increase during the 1980s/up to 1990s/ from 1979–87;
           reaches maximum in late 1990s;
           relative stable during late1990s;
           fluctuating from 2000 onwards;
           possibly declining in late 2000s/from 2014;

           Be prepared to give a little leeway in precise years for changes in trends, but
           some reference to their timing is required.

     (c)   Identify one possible reason for the changes shown during the 1980s.              [1 max]

           increasing use of/disposal of refrigerants containing CFCs;
           increasing use of CFCs in aerosols;
           increasing release of NOx from fossil fuel combustion;
           increasing use of methyl bromides as pesticides;

           Responses should identify the ODS and its use for full credit.

     (d)   Explain how the data in Figure 3 can be used in judging the success of the
           Montreal Protocol in addressing ozone depletion.                                  [4 max]

           Montreal Protocol was introduced in 1987/graph covers period before and
           after introduction of Montreal Protocol;
           it introduced a ban on the use of CFCs / led to use of alternative HCFs/HFs;
           rate of ozone destruction/growth of the ozone hole slows down/stops soon
           after this date;
           suggesting it had some success/favourable impact on ozone depletion;
           however, there is little evidence of ozone levels being restored to earlier
           levels / hole disappearing;
           possibly some evidence in last few years/2014–2016 on graph of ozone hole
           reducing/ozone being restored;
           the stabilisation/limited decline in ozone hole may suggest black market sale
           of ODSs (limited success);
           continued impact of long-lasting ODSs (CFCs/HCFs) delay final judgement;
                                                     –9–             M21/4/ENVSO/SP2/ENG/TZ0/XX/M


                                               Section B

Part (c) questions in Section B are all to be assessed using the markbands on
page 17 with the guidance given below for each question.

4.   (a)   Outline the processes by which a species may evolve a greater tolerance to higher
           temperatures                                                                   [4 max]

           a species will contain a variety of different genotypes/characteristics / mutations
           will increase the variety of genes/characteristics;
           some genes may provide greater tolerance to high temperature than others;
           individuals with these genes are more likely to survive if high temperatures are
           limiting / there will be “survival of the fittest” / tolerant will outcompete intolerant;
           these individuals will reproduce offspring with their tolerance/genetic
           characteristics / their characteristics are heritable/passed on to next generation;
           natural selection will eliminate intolerant individuals/increase frequency of
           tolerant individuals;
           over time/generations, tolerance may become a dominant characteristic in
           population;

           If candidates mistakenly address process of speciation then just credit those
           aspects that are equally valid in microevolution, eg natural selection/survival of
           fittest/heritability, etc

     (b)   Explain how the atmosphere plays a role in maintaining life-supporting
           temperatures over the Earth’s surface.                                                      [7 max]

           atmosphere allows solar energy/wide range of wavelengths to reach Earth’s surface;
           water vapour/humidity/clouds absorb/reflect incoming IR/solar energy exerting a
           cooling effect;
           greenhouse gases such as CO2/methane/NOx/tropospheric ozone/
           CFC/HCFCs/water vapour;
           absorb re-radiated heat/outgoing longer wavelength (Earth's) radiation;
           this creates greenhouse effect that keeps planet warmer;
           most heat is radiated to the equatorial/lower/tropical latitudes;
           the tricellular model/convection currents/prevailing winds transfer this heat to higher
           latitudes;
           maintaining a greater dispersal of life-supporting temperatures over planet;
           heat at equator causes rapid evaporation;
           …this water vapour carries latent heat that can be released on condensation/at higher
           latitudes;
           tropical cyclones transfer large quantities of such heat to higher latitudes;
           winds may contribute to oceanic currents transferring heat;


           Credit should be awarded only for MPs that address role of atmosphere, not other
           influences on temperature.
           Do not credit response that ozone hole leads to warming ...unless it is qualified by being
           a relatively insignificant contribution.

(c)   In addressing environmental issues, mitigation strategies may be seen as
      primarily ecocentric and adaptation strategies as primarily technocentric.

      To what extent is this view valid in the context of named strategies for
      addressing the issue of global warming?                                         [9 max]

      The following guide for using the markbands suggests certain features that
      may be offered in responses. The five headings coincide with the criteria
      given in each of the markbands (although “ESS terminology” has been
      conflated with “Understanding concepts”). This guide simply provides some
      possible inclusions and should not be seen as requisite or comprehensive.
      It outlines the kind of elements to look for when deciding on the appropriate
      markband and the specific mark within that band.

      Answers may include:
      • understanding concepts and terminology of mitigation, adaptation,
         ecocentric/technocentric values, causes and impacts of global warming,
         strategies for reducing causes/managing impacts, carbon sinks, etc;
      • breadth in addressing and linking wide range of relevant strategies
         with mitigation or adaptation and with ecocentric values eg restraint/low
         consumption, changed lifestyles, sustainability, low technology,
         decentralization, and technocentric values eg maximizing growth,
         unlimited exploitation, resolving issues through technology, & scientific
         expertise, etc;
      • examples of mitigation improving energy efficiency/consumption,
         alternative energies, reduction of emissions, eg catalytic converters,
         geoengineering, fertilizing oceans, afforestation/forest protection, UN-
         REDD, carbon capture and storage, nutrifying oceans, etc and
         adaptation flood defence, desalinization, vaccination, crop choice, etc;
      • balanced analysis of the extent to which mitigation strategies are
         genuinely ecocentric and adaptation strategies are technocentric
         including counterarguments (may include reference to anthropocentric
         nature of some strategies) etc;
      • a conclusion that is consistent with, and supported by, analysis
         and examples given eg “although, in general terms, ecocentric values
         favour a preventative approach and living within the sustainable limits
         rather than adapting to human impacts, some mitigation strategies
         involve a heavy use of large scale technology, acceptable to
         technocentrics, but to which ecocentrics are generally opposed”;

      Please see markbands on page 17.

5.   (a)   Outline the procedures in a laboratory-based method to find the gross
           productivity for a population of named aquatic animals in terms of biomass
           per day.                                                                         [4 max]

           find the dry weight of food presented to the population at start;
           collect and find the dry weight of food remaining after a number of days;
           subtract the weight of food remaining from that presented / find dry weight of
           food eaten;
           collect and find the dry weight of feces produced over this period;
           subtract weight of feces from food eaten to find food absorbed/gross
           productivity / food eaten – fecal loss = gross productivity;
           divide final weight/gross productivity by number of days of the study;

           Do not credit reference to weighing organisms (only relevant in net
           productivity).


     (b)   Explain how acid deposition falling on a forest may impact a nearby aquatic
           ecosystem.                                                                       [7 max]

           run-off/groundwater flow may carry acidity directly to water body;
           acidity/low pH may directly reduce survival of sensitive species;
           reduced productivity of aquatic plants reduces food for higher trophic levels;
           acidity in soils will release/leach cations/metal ions from soil particles;
           aluminium/metal ions released from soil will enter water body;
           aluminium ions may affect gills of fish reducing their survival;
           other metal ions (cadmium) may be more toxic/lethal;
           acidity reduces solubility of nutrients (eg N, P) so less nutrients leach/flow
           into aquatic system;
           loss of trees/terrestrial/riparian vegetation may lead to erosion of soil into
           water body/reduced shade/increased temperatures;
           more soil entering water body will increase turbidity;
           high turbidity may lead to reduced photosynthesis/lower productivity;
           all these impacts will lead to loss of biodiversity/low productivity;
           forest soil may be alkaline reducing acidity of impact on aquatic system;

           Only credit impacts on aquatic system, not impacts solely affecting forest.

(c)   When harvesting is limited to the sustainable yield, associated processes
      involved in a food production system may still make the production
      unsustainable.

      In this context, to what extent can aquatic food production systems be truly
      sustainable?                                                                       [9 max]

      The following guide for using the markbands suggests certain features that
      may be offered in responses. The five headings coincide with the criteria
      given in each of the markbands (although “ESS terminology” has been
      conflated with “Understanding concepts”). This guide simply provides some
      possible inclusions and should not be seen as requisite or comprehensive.
      It outlines the kind of elements to look for when deciding on the appropriate
      markband and the specific mark within that band.

      Answers may include:
      • understanding concepts and terminology of harvesting wild
         populations, capture fisheries, quotas, maximum sustainable yield, net
         productivity, fish stocks, overfishing, aquaculture, eutrophication,
         aquatic pollution, habitat loss, marine protection/exclusion zones,
         commercial vs. subsistence FPSs, etc;
      • breadth in addressing and linking aquaculture with unsustainable
         impacts eg eutrophication from excess feed/fecal deposits, genetic
         degradation of wild populations through escapees, pollution with
         medication, and means of reducing impacts eg polyculture, biological pest
         control, etc and wild fishing with unsustainable impacts eg overfishing,
         capture of other species/immature individuals, lost nets/gear, water
         pollution due to mechanization, fossil fuel use, etc and means to reduce
         impacts eg quotas, legislation on mesh size, seasonal limits, exclusion
         zones, possible miscalculation of MSY, etc;
      • examples of unsustainable impacts from aquaculture eg anti-fouling
         agents; antibiotics; excess feed, medicines, genetic modification,
         escapees, disease, etc and fishing eg trawling, physical damage to eg
         corals/sedentary species, mesh size, bycatch, lost fishing gear, etc;
      • balanced analysis of degree to which collateral impacts of
         aquaculture/capture fisheries through mechanization, fossil fuel use, etc can
         be sustainably managed including counterarguments, etc;
      • a conclusion that is consistent with, and supported by, analysis
         and examples given eg “a great deal can be done through legislation
         and choice of appropriate strategies to move aquatic food production
         toward true sustainability but ultimately certain unsustainable impacts
         are inevitable”;

6.   (a)   With reference to four different properties of a soil, outline how each can
           contribute to high primary productivity.                                         [4 max]

           particle size affects ability of soil to store/retain water necessary for
           productivity;
           high mineral content provides nutrients for healthy growth/productivity;
           high organic content / deep humus provides long term storage of nutrients
           (released through decomposition);
           air spaces provide more O2 to roots for growth/respiration / allow deeper
           penetration of roots;
           appropriate porosity allows soil to hold enough water for plant growth;
           better drainage prevents water-logging that inhibits growth/productivity;
           abundant biota help to aerate/break up the soil allowing for better root
           growth/recycle nutrients;
           microorganisms contribute to mineral-cycling promoting growth/productivity;
           neutral to slightly acidic pH is the optimal for most plants (6.0–7.5);
           low or no slope prevents water erosion / loss of soil;

           No credit for ground cover reducing wind erosion / soil conservation/management (not soil
                properties)


     (b)   Explain how the level of primary productivity of different biomes influences
           their resilience.                                                                [7 max]

           resilience is the ability to withstand disturbances / tendency to maintain
           stability/avoid tipping points;
           generally, biomes with higher primary productivity (eg
           rainforests/estuaries/wetlands) are more resilient than those with lower
           productivity (eg tundra/deserts);
           more productive biomes can support more species/diversity;
           diversity increases resilience because loss of one species is more easily
           replaced by others;
           more productive biomes support more branching food chains / greater complexity
           of interrelationships;
           …that allows for more negative feedback mechanisms/shifting feeding habits
           maintaining stability/providing more resilience;
           more productive biomes produce larger biotic storages;
           larger storages are less likely to be eliminated/reduced beyond a tipping point so
           contribute to greater resilience;
           larger storages provide higher maximum sustainable yields so are less prone to
           overharvesting;
           higher productivity entails faster plant growth, thus more effective regeneration
           after a disturbance;
           oceanic biomes have low productivity per unit area but their large size increases
           their resilience;
           coral reefs have high productivity but narrow niche requirements give them low
           resilience;

           Allow credit for valid counterexamples as in last two MPs.

(c)   Discuss the role of feedback mechanisms in maintaining the stability and
      promoting the restoration of plant communities threatened by human
      impacts.                                                                        [9 max]

      Answers may include:
      • understanding concepts and terminology of negative and positive
         feedback, steady state and dynamic equilibria, tipping points, resilience,
         sustainability, colonization, pioneer communities, succession,
         biodiversity, variety of nutrient and energy pathways, human threats eg
         climate change, eutrophication, deforestation, land degradation, marine
         pollution, toxic pollution of lakes;
      • breadth in addressing and linking negative feedback with stability,
         steady state, resilience in natural systems mitigating adverse impacts;
         and positive feedback with dynamic equilibria, growth, succession in
         restoration as well as amplifying/exacerbating human disturbance and
         destabilization of systems, etc;
      • examples of organisms, feeding and non-feeding relationships, abiotic
         & biotic interactions generating negative feedback loops in natural
         systems and positive feedback promoting population growth, succession
         (ie earlier successional stages modifying environment to allow more and
         more colonization of later stages), and human impacts leading to
         positive feedback through eg agriculture, unsustainable exploitation,
         overharvesting, eutrophication, global warming, etc;
      • balanced analysis of the extent to which feedback mechanisms
         maintain stability and promote restoration in face of human impact with
         counter examples of positive feedback leading to greater destabilization,
         or to a new equilibrium (past a tipping point), etc;
      • a conclusion that is consistent with, and supported by, analysis
         and examples given eg “generally, negative feedback is significant in
         maintaining stability, while positive feedback promotes restoration of
         plant communities. However, human impacts frequently drive systems
         beyond their tipping point, and then positive feedback drives the system
         even further from its naturally stable equilibrium”;

7.   (a)   Identify four ways to ensure reliability of the mark–release–recapture
           method in estimating population size.                                            [4 max]

           ensure process of capture does not reduce/increase potential for recapture /
           generate trap-shy/trap-happy individuals;
           ensure marking process does not impact individual’s survival;
           ensure method of marking is durable for period of investigation;
           ensure sufficient proportion of population is caught/marked in first capture;
           repeat procedure/recapture to increase reliability;
           ensure traps are well distributed throughout area of population;
           ensure sufficient time between captures to allow mixing of population;
           only apply procedure to motile species that do not travel outside study area;

     (b)   Explain how the interactions between a species and its environment give
           rise to the S-shape of its population curve.                                     [7 max]

           the slow initial growth rate is due to low numbers reproducing;
           …and/or unfamiliarity with resources / threats of the newly colonized habitat;
           growth rates/numbers increase more rapidly due to abundance/accessibility
           of resources/greater numbers reproducing;
           …leading to positive feedback/exponential growth;
           growth rate subsequently decrease/numbers increase more slowly due to
           limiting/density dependent environmental factors/environmental resistance;
           …eg limited food/greater predation/competition/nesting sites, etc;
           growth rate eventually becomes zero / population stabilizes / fluctuates
           around carrying capacity;
           due to reaching the carrying capacity of the environment;
           …kept stable by density dependent factors / negative feedback / predator–
           prey cycles;

           Note: These marking points may be achieved through an appropriately
           annotated diagram.

(c)   The future growth of human populations is unlikely to be limited by the
      availability of energy resources. However, they could easily be limited by the
      impacts of energy production.

      Discuss the validity of this statement.                                          [9 max]

         would prevent energy itself becoming a limiting factor, countries still persisting
         in their dependence on fossil fuels may well impair the availability of food and
         water and spread of disease, each of which could soon become a limiting
         factor to the growth of human populations”;
