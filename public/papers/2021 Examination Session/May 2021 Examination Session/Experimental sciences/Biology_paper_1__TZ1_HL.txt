34.   Which method can be used to induce short-day plants to flower out of season?

      A.   Grow them in winter

      B.   Grow them in summer

      C.   Expose them to a brief period of light during the night time

      D.   Cover them with opaque cloth for several hours before sunset


35.   Which statement is valid regarding chromatids?

      A.   Sister chromatids separate during meiosis I.

      B.   Chiasmata form between non-sister chromatids.

      C.   Crossing over is the exchange of DNA between sister chromatids only.

      D.   Non-sister chromatids have the same combination of alleles.


36.   In fruit flies (Drosophila melanogaster), grey bodies (b+) are dominant to black bodies (b)
      and normal wings (vg+) are dominant to vestigial wings (vg). Homozygous vestigial winged,
      black bodied flies were crossed with individuals that were heterozygous for both traits.
      2300 individuals were counted and the phenotypes observed were recorded as shown.

                                        965 normal wings, grey bodies
                                        944 vestigial wings, black bodies
                                        206 vestigial wings, grey bodies
                                        185 normal wings, black bodies

      Which statement is valid?

      A.   The predicted phenotypic ratio was 9 : 3 : 3 : 1.

      B.   There is independent assortment of wings but not body colour.

      C.   The expected number of vestigial winged, grey bodied flies was 575.

      D.   The traits are on different chromosomes.




                                                                                               Turn over

37.   The diagram represents a sarcomere. Which structure is myosin?




                          A.       B.                                                 C.   D.


38.   What is normally found in the urine of a healthy individual?

      A.    Glucose

      B.    Red blood cells

      C.    Proteins

      D.    Sodium ions

      detection of this hormone indicating pregnancy?

      A.    HCG is involved in milk production.

      B.    HCG production is blocked by negative feedback during menstruation.

      C.    HCG is produced by an embryo.

      D.    HCG is released during the acrosome reaction.


40.   Expansin is a plant protein that loosens connections between cellulose fibres in plant cell walls,
      allowing growth. In what location would expression of the expansin gene be expected to be
      increased?

      A.    On the shaded side of a shoot being exposed to light

      B.    On the light side of a shoot being exposed to light

      C.    On the shaded side of a leaf that is transpiring rapidly

      D.    On the light side of a leaf that is transpiring rapidly
