Answer all questions in the answer booklet provided. Please start each question on a new page.
Full marks are not necessarily awarded for a correct answer with no working. Answers must be
supported by working and/or explanations. Solutions found from a graphic display calculator should
be supported by suitable working. For example, if graphs are used to find a solution, you should sketch
these as part of your answer. Where an answer is incorrect, some marks may be given for a correct
method, provided this is shown by written working. You are therefore advised to show all working.

     A medical centre is testing patients for a certain disease. This disease occurs in 5 % of
     the population.

     They test every patient who comes to the centre on a particular day.

     (a)   State the sampling method being used.                                                            [1]

     It is intended that if a patient has the disease, they test “positive”, and if a patient does not
     have the disease, they test “negative”.

     However, the tests are not perfect, and only 99 % of people who have the disease test positive.
     Also, 2 % of people who do not have the disease test positive.

     The tree diagram shows some of this information.

                                                          99 %      test positive

                                                                    test positive

                                         no disease
                                                            d       test negative

     (b)   Write down the value of

           (i)     a.

           (ii)    b.

           (iii)   c.

           (iv)    d .                                                                                      [4]

(Question 1 continued)

     (c)   Use the tree diagram to find the probability that a patient selected at random

           (i)     will not have the disease and will test positive.

           (ii)    will test negative.

           (iii)   has the disease given that they tested negative.                                     [8]

     (d)   The medical centre finds the actual number of positive results in their sample is
           different than predicted by the tree diagram. Explain why this might be the case.            [1]

     The staff at the medical centre looked at the care received by all visiting patients on a
     randomly chosen day. All the patients received at least one of these services: they had
     medical tests (M), were seen by a nurse (N), or were seen by a doctor (D). It was found that:
     y 78 had medical tests,
     y 45 were seen by a nurse;
     y 30 were seen by a doctor;
     y 9 had medical tests and were seen by a doctor and a nurse;
     y 18 had medical tests and were seen by a doctor but were not seen by a nurse;
     y 11 patients were seen by a nurse and had medical tests but were not seen by a doctor;
     y 2 patients were seen by a doctor without being seen by nurse and without having medical tests.

     (e)   Draw a Venn diagram to illustrate this information, placing all relevant information on
           the diagram.                                                                                 [3]

     The town wishes to build a carpark here. They ask the farmer to exchange the part of the
     field represented by triangle DCE. In return the farmer will get a triangle of equal area ADF,
     where F lies on the same line as D and E, as shown in the diagram above.

     A new concert hall was built with 14 seats in the first row. Each subsequent row of the hall
     has two more seats than the previous row. The hall has a total of 20 rows.

     (a)   Find:

           (i)     the number of seats in the last row.

           (ii)    the total number of seats in the concert hall.                                      [5]

     The concert hall opened in 2019. The average number of visitors per concert during that year
     was 584. In 2020, the average number of visitors per concert increased by 1.2 %.

     (b)   Find the average number of visitors per concert in 2020.[2]

     The concert organizers use this data to model future numbers of visitors. It is assumed that
     the average number of visitors per concert will continue to increase each year by 1.2 %.

     (c)   Determine the first year in which this model predicts the average number of visitors per
           concert will exceed the total seating capacity of the concert hall.                         [5]

     It is assumed that the concert hall will host 50 concerts each year.

           people expected to attend the concert hall from when it opens until the end of 2025.[4]
