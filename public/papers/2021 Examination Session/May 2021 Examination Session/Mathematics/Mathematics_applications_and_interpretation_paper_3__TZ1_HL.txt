Answer both questions in the answer booklet provided. Please start each question on a new page.
Full marks are not necessarily awarded for a correct answer with no working. Answers must be
supported by working and/or explanations. Solutions found from a graphic display calculator should
be supported by suitable working. For example, if graphs are used to find a solution, you should sketch
these as part of your answer. Where an answer is incorrect, some marks may be given for a correct
method, provided this is shown by written working. You are therefore advised to show all working.

1.   [Maximum mark: 27]

     A suitable site for the landing of a spacecraft on the planet Mars is identified at a point, A.
     The shortest time from sunrise to sunset at point A must be found.

     Radians should be used throughout this question. All values given in the question should be
     treated as exact.

     Mars completes a full orbit of the Sun in 669 Martian days, which is one Martian year.

     On day t , where t ∈ ℤ , the length of time, in hours, from the start of the Martian day until
     sunrise at point A can be modelled by a function, R(t) , where

                                        R(t) = a sin (bt) + c , t ∈ ℝ .

     The graph of R is shown for one Martian year.

                                                              –3–                                                        2221 – 7208


(Question 1 continued)

     The time of sunrise on Mars depends on the angle, δ , at which it tilts towards the Sun.
     During a Martian year, δ varies from −0.440 to 0.440 radians.

     The angle, ω , through which Mars rotates on its axis from the start of a Martian day to the
     moment of sunrise, at point A, is given by cos ω = 0.839 tan δ , 0 ≤ ω ≤ π .

     (c)    (i)	Show that the maximum value of ω = 1.98 , correct to three significant figures.                                [3]

            (ii)    Find the minimum value of ω .                                                                               [1]

     (d)    Use your answers to parts (b) and (c) to find

            (i)     the maximum value of R(t ) ;                                                                                [2]

            (ii)    the minimum value of R(t ) .                                                                                [1]

     (e)    Hence show that a = 1.6 , correct to two significant figures.                                                       [2]

     (f)    Find the value of c .[2]

     Let S (t ) be the length of time, in hours, from the start of the Martian day until sunset at
     point A on day t . S (t ) can be modelled by the function

                                       S (t ) = 1.5 sin (0.00939t + 2.83) + 18.65 .

     The length of time between sunrise and sunset at point A, L(t) , can be modelled by the function

                             L(t ) = 1.5 sin (0.00939t + 2.83) − 1.6 sin (0.00939t ) + d .

     (g)    Find the value of d .[2]

     Let f (t ) = 1.5 sin (0.00939t + 2.83) − 1.6 sin (0.00939t ) and hence L(t ) =  f (t ) + d .

     f (t ) can be written in the form  ​Im (​ ​z​1​− ​z​2​)​ , where  ​z​1​  and  ​z​2​  are complex functions of t .

     (h)    (i)	Write down  ​z​1​  and  ​z​2​  in exponential form, with a constant modulus.                                   [3]

            (ii)    Hence or otherwise find an equation for L in the form L(t ) = p sin (qt + r) + d ,
                    where p , q , r , d ∈ ℝ .                                                                                   [4]

            (iii)   Find, in hours, the shortest time from sunrise to sunset at point A that is predicted
                    by this model.                                                                                              [2]




                                                                                                                         Turn over

2.   [Maximum mark: 28]

     A firm wishes to review its recruitment processes. This question considers the validity
     and reliability of the methods used.

     Every year an accountancy firm recruits new employees for a trial period of one year from a
     large group of applicants.

     At the start, all applicants are interviewed and given a rating. Those with a rating of either
     Excellent, Very good or Good are recruited for the trial period. At the end of this period,
     some of the new employees will stay with the firm.

     It is decided to test how valid the interview rating is as a way of predicting which of the new
     employees will stay with the firm.

     Data is collected and recorded in a contingency table.

                                                  Interview rating

                                      Excellent       Very good         Good

                            Stay          12               20             19
                           Leave          10               15             24

     (a)   Use an appropriate test, at the 5 % significance level, to determine whether a new
           employee staying with the firm is independent of their interview rating. State the null
           and alternative hypotheses, the p-value and the conclusion of the test.                           [6]

     The next year’s group of applicants are asked to complete a written assessment which
     is then analysed. From those recruited as new employees, a random sample of size 18
     is selected.

     The sample is stratified by department. Of the 91 new employees recruited that year,
     55 were placed in the national department and 36 in the international department.

     (b)   Show that 11 employees are selected for the sample from the national department.                  [2]

(Question 2 continued)

     At the end of their first year, the level of performance of each of the 18 employees in the
     sample is assessed by their department manager. They are awarded a score between
     1 (low performance) and 10 (high performance).

     The marks in the written assessment and the scores given by the managers are shown in
     both the table and the scatter diagram.

      The same seven employees are given the written assessment a second time, at the end of

      (e)     The written assessment is in five sections, numbered 1 to 5. At the end of the year,
              the employees are also given a score for each of five professional attributes:
              V, W, X, Y and Z.

              The firm decides to test the hypothesis that there is a correlation between the mark
              in a section and the score for an attribute.

              They compare marks in each of the sections with scores for each of the attributes.

              (i)     Write down the number of tests they carry out.                                              [1]

              (ii)    The tests are performed at the 5 % significance level.

                      Assuming that:
                      y there is no correlation between the marks in any of the sections and scores
                        in any of the attributes,
                      y the outcome of each hypothesis test is independent of the outcome of the
                        other hypothesis tests,

                      find the probability that at least one of the tests will be significant.                    [4]

              (iii)   The firm obtains a significant result when comparing section 2 of the written
                      assessment and attribute X. Interpret this result.                                          [1]
