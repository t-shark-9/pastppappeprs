Answer all questions in the answer booklet provided. Please start each question on a new page.
Full marks are not necessarily awarded for a correct answer with no working. Answers must be
supported by working and/or explanations. Solutions found from a graphic display calculator should
be supported by suitable working. For example, if graphs are used to find a solution, you should sketch
these as part of your answer. Where an answer is incorrect, some marks may be given for a correct
method, provided this is shown by written working. You are therefore advised to show all working.

     The stopping distances for bicycles travelling at ​20 km ​h​-1​are assumed to follow a normal
     distribution with mean 6.76 m and standard deviation 0.12 m.

     (a)   Under this assumption, find, correct to four decimal places, the probability that a bicycle

     1000 randomly selected bicycles are tested and their stopping distances when travelling
     at ​20 km ​h​-1​are measured.

     Charlotte decides to model the shape of a cupcake to calculate its volume.

     through the points (0 , 3.5), (4 , 6), (6.5 , 4), (7 , 3) and (7.5 , 0), where all units are in
     centimetres. The cross-section is symmetrical in the x-axis, as shown below:

                four points.

     Charlotte thinks that a quadratic with a maximum point at (4 , 6) and that passes through
     the point (7.5 , 0) would be a better fit.

      A biologist introduces 100 rabbits to an island and records the size of their population (x) over
      a period of time. The population growth of the rabbits can be approximately modelled by the
      following differential equation, where t is time measured in years.

                                                     ​​  dx ​ = 2x​

      A population of 100 foxes is introduced to the island when the population of rabbits has
      reached 1000. The subsequent population growth of rabbits and foxes, where y is the
      population of foxes at time t , can be approximately modelled by the coupled equations:
    dx ​ = x​(​2 - 0.01y​)​
	​​ ___
    dt
    dy
	​​ ___ ​ = y​(​0.0002x - 0.8​)​
    dt
      (b)     Use Euler’s method with a step size of 0.25, to find

              (i)    the population of rabbits 1 year after the foxes were introduced.

              (ii)   the population of foxes 1 year after the foxes were introduced.                        [6]
