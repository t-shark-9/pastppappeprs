Answer all questions in the answer booklet provided. Please start each question on a new page.
Full marks are not necessarily awarded for a correct answer with no working. Answers must be
supported by working and/or explanations. Solutions found from a graphic display calculator should
be supported by suitable working. For example, if graphs are used to find a solution, you should sketch
these as part of your answer. Where an answer is incorrect, some marks may be given for a correct
method, provided this is shown by written working. You are therefore advised to show all working.

     The town wishes to build a carpark here. They ask the farmer to exchange the part of the

     It is known that the weights of male Persian cats are normally distributed with mean 6.1 kg
     and variance ​0.5​2​ ​kg​​  2​.

           than 5.3 kg.[3]

     The male cats are now joined by 80 female Persian cats. The female cats are drawn
     from a population whose weights are normally distributed with mean 4.5 kg and standard
     deviation 0.45 kg.

     (d)   Ten female cats are chosen at random.

           (i)    Find the probability that exactly one of them weighs over 4.62 kg.

     In a small village there are two doctors’ clinics, one owned by Doctor Black and the other
     owned by Doctor Green. It was noted after each year that 3.5 % of Doctor Black’s patients
     moved to Doctor Green’s clinic and 5 % of Doctor Green’s patients moved to Doctor Black’s
     clinic. All additional losses and gains of patients by the clinics may be ignored.

     their register, compared to Doctor Green’s 3500 patients.

     Hank sets up a bird table in his garden to provide the local birds with some food. Hank notices
     that a specific bird, a large magpie, visits several times per month and he names him Bill. Hank
     models the number of times per month that Bill visits his garden as a Poisson distribution with
     mean 3.1.

     (a)   Using Hank’s model, find the probability that Bill visits the garden on exactly four
           occasions during one particular month.                                                        [1]

           (i)    on exactly 12 occasions.

           (ii)   during the first and third month only.                                                 [5]

     After the first year, a number of baby magpies start to visit Hank’s garden. It may be

     a Poisson distribution with mean 2.1.
