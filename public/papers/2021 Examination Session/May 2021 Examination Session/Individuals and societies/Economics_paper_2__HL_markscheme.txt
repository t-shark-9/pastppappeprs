                      A clear understanding demonstrated by listing two of the
                      following functions of the WTO for its member countries:
                       to set and enforce rules for international trade
                       to provide a forum for negotiating trade liberalization

(b)   Using an AD/AS diagram, explain how removing “the import quota will reduce the
      inflation rate in the Philippines” (paragraph ).                                      [4]

                   An AD/AS diagram showing a shift of AS to the right
                   and a fall in the price level
                   OR
                   an explanation that removing the quota will decrease
                   the price of rice, this will increase AS due to decreased
                   costs of production leading to a decrease in the price
                   level, reducing the inflation rate.

      Candidates who incorrectly label diagrams can be awarded a maximum of [3].

      For AD/AS the vertical axis may be average (general) price level, APL or price
      level. For the horizontal axis, real output, real national output, real income, real
      national income, real GDP or real Y. Any abbreviations are acceptable. A title is
      not necessary.

(c)   Using a perfect competition diagram, explain whether farmers in the Philippines
      are making an economic profit or loss (Table 1).                                      [4]

                   ATC curve above the AR curve at a level of output
                   indicating a loss
                   OR
                   an explanation that they are making a loss, because
                   ATC (PH₱12.41) is above AR (PH₱12.19).
          2        There is a correct diagram AND an accurate written          3–4
                   response.

                   ATC (PH₱12.41) is above AR (PH₱12.19)

      Candidates who incorrectly label diagrams can be awarded a maximum of [3].

      NB Candidates must state the values in either the diagram or the explanation for
      full marks.

      NB Some candidates may refer to the Vietnamese price of PH₱9.64 shown in
      Table 1. This is also acceptable as it must be assumed that these candidates
      consider that, once the quota is removed, the price in the Philippines will fall to
      the Vietnamese level. Both PH₱12.19 and PH₱9.64 should be accepted as valid
      prices.

      For a perfectly competitive diagram, the vertical axis may be labelled Cost (C),
      Price (P) or Revenue (R). The horizontal axis may be labelled Quantity (Q) or
      Output. A title is not necessary. AC or ATC can be used.

      NB MC curve is not required for full marks.

(d)   Using information from the text/data and your knowledge of economics, evaluate
      the impact on the economy in the Philippines of removing the rice quota.               [8]

      Examiners should be aware that candidates may take a different approach which,
      if appropriate, should be rewarded.

               There is effective application/analysis.
               There is synthesis/evaluation, supported by appropriate theory and
               evidence.

      “Evaluate” requires candidates to make an appraisal by weighing up the
      strengths and limitations.

      Economic Analysis may include:
       trade protection
       theory of comparative advantage / allocation of resources
       AD /AS
       employment
       inflation
       standard of living
       economies of scale.

      Positive impacts may include:
       attempts at self-sufficiency of production improved by eliminating quotas
        (paragraph ) and providing assistance to farmers (paragraph )
       rice is a staple food so less volatility in rice prices when quota removed –
        helps households (paragraph )
       lowers rice price for households – significant annual savings (paragraph )
       lower rice price has forward linkage effect reducing input costs for food
        manufacturers (paragraph )
       more competition from Vietnamese rice imports encourages domestic
        producer efficiency and innovation (paragraph )
       more efficient allocation of resources if farmers “move to producing other
        crops” – comparative advantage (paragraph )
       opportunity to achieve economies of scale in the long run by bringing “down
        the cost of production” (technical economies through mechanization and
        possibility of farm consolidations) (paragraph )
       lower rice prices reduce input costs and increase SRAS therefore relieving
        cost-push inflation (paragraph ).

           Negative impacts may include:
            goal of self-sufficiency in rice could be compromised in the long run if the
             number of rice farmers is reduced (paragraph )
            rice is a staple food so maintaining rice production is a matter of national
             security (paragraph )
            rice farmers are already making a loss so removing quotas will increase
             losses and cause some farmers to leave the rice market in the long run
             (Table 1)
            likely to be unemployment in the sector as rice farmers leave the market
             (paragraph  and Table 1)
            local unemployment can lead to hollowing out of rural communities as
             unemployed migrate to urban areas
            government revenue allocated to support programs to help rice farmers adjust
             carries significant opportunity costs (paragraph )
            ATC in the Philippines is almost double that in Vietnam, so it might take a long
             time for Filipino farmers to become competitive (Table 1).

           Any reasonable evaluation.

      “Discuss” requires candidates to offer a considered and balanced review that
      includes a range of arguments, factors or hypotheses. Opinions or conclusions
      should be presented clearly and supported by appropriate evidence.

      Responses may include:
       definitions of depreciation, managed exchange rate.

      Economic analysis may include:
       Marshall-Lerner and J curve
       AD / AS
       exchange rate theory
       balance of payments
       government macroeconomic objectives.

      Arguments supporting the claim may include:
       increased AD by decreasing relative price of exports, increasing export
         revenue if X PED>1
       increases relative price of imports, decreasing import expenditure if M PED>1
       increasing export revenue increases current account surplus (paragraph )
       increase in net export component of AD leading to increasing economic
         growth (paragraph )
       increases in foreign exchange reserves (assuming export revenue is
         increasing and is greater than import expenditure)
       increases Chinese ownership of foreign assets and foreign debt
       China exports to countries other than the US
       protects Chinese exporters from US tariff costs (paragraph ).

Arguments against the claim may include:
 the claim that the depreciating RMB is good for the Chinese economy is made
   by a US official who may be justifying the punitive US tariff regime (paragraph
   )
 depreciation of the RMB could compromise the market-based reforms to the
   exchange rate (paragraph )
 main cause of depreciation is “shrinking current account surplus” caused by
   trade war – falling demand for the RMB (paragraph )
 normal benefits of depreciating currency (lower relative price of exports)
   cancelled out by US tariffs hence no increase in export revenue on current
   account (paragraph )
 depreciation increases relative import prices therefore increasing import
   expenditure (“widening trade deficit”) and reducing the current account surplus
   – increasing supply of Renminbi (paragraph )
 export sector needs government help to compete as depreciation not
   sufficiently offsetting effect of US tariffs (paragraph )
 depreciation will increase relative price of imported components therefore
   decreasing SRAS
 slower economic growth due to lower net export component causing
   slowdown in AD
 rising US interest rates could lead to capital flight from China (paragraph )
 depreciating currency could cause capital flight as speculators seek out the
   strengthening US dollar therefore “negatively affecting China’s financial
   account” (paragraph )
 indebted Chinese firms harmed if interest rates rise to support the Renminbi
   and prevent capital flight (paragraph )
 depreciating exchange rate tends to cause political tensions with US (China’s
   biggest trade partner).

Any reasonable discussion.

      “Evaluate” requires candidates to make an appraisal by weighing up the
      strengths and limitations.

      Responses may include:
       a definition of economic development
       a definition of interventionist policies.

       Economic analysis may include:
       poverty cycle
       interventionist supply-side policies
       trade protection
       PPC
       FDI.

      Strengths of interventionist policies may include:
       government could provide a social safety net as GDP per capita is low
         (paragraph )
       government spending to encourage investment in agricultural sector (eg
         subsidies) (paragraph )
       increased spending in the agricultural sector will create jobs (paragraph )
       increased spending in the agricultural sector will reduce reliance on imports
         and improve food security
       government provision of infrastructure in roads and cities encourages future
         FDI which may create jobs (increase in LRAS or PPF) (paragraph )
       government building hydroelectric generation plants increases electricity
         access to citizens and business and encourages FDI which creates jobs
         (paragraph )
       tariffs can supply additional revenue for government spending (paragraph )
       tariffs can protect infant industries particularly in agriculture (paragraph )
       positive externalities / welfare loss reduced when government increases
         healthcare provision (paragraph ).

Limitations of interventionist policies may include:
 overdependence on income from mining sector (paragraph )
 increased government intervention may increase corruption (paragraph )
 weak private sector means reduces potential to collect tax revenue
 significant costs to budget to provide road and hydroelectricity infrastructure
   (paragraph  and )
 government investment in infrastructure may lead to high debt creating a
   burden to future generations (paragraph  and )
 increasing red tape discourages investment in the private sector (paragraph
   )
 tariffs on imported inputs increases input costs for firms and reduces output
   (paragraph ).

To reach level 3, students must show awareness of the ways in which
interventionist policies will impact upon economic development (not simply
discuss the advantages and disadvantages of interventionist policies in general).
This means to link the evaluation to how they will reduce poverty, increase living
standards, reduce income inequalities and increase employment opportunities,
improve health and education indicators.

Any reasonable evaluation.

     (b)   Using a perfectly competitive firm diagram, explain the effect of declining prices
           of coffee beans on the profits of Honduras’ coffee farmers in the short run
           (paragraph ).                                                                           [4]

                     OR
                     for an explanation that lower coffee prices will reduce the AR
                     (total revenue) at the new profit-maximizing (loss-minimizing)
                     level of output (for which MC  MR). At this output average total
                     costs are greater than AR and therefore the Honduran coffee
                     farmers will incur a loss (in the short run).

      For [4] the candidate must either correctly show the loss on the diagram in the
      form of a revenue box or have sufficient labelling to be able to correctly identify
      the loss in their written explanation.

      For a perfectly competitive firm diagram, the vertical axis may be labelled Cost
      (C), Price (P) or Revenue (R). The horizontal axis may be labelled Quantity (Q) or
      Output. A title is not necessary.




(c)   With reference to the data in Table 2, explain why the GNI per capita for
      Guatemala is lower than its GDP per capita.                                           [4]

      [1] for showing an awareness of the difference between GNI and GDP (by GNI =
      GDP + Net income abroad OR GNI is income from productive factors owned by
      residents of the country whereas GDP is income produced in the country).

      [1] for an explanation that the GNI per capita in Guatemala at 7278 is lower than
      the GDP per capita at 8100.

      [2] for an explanation that this means that the net income from abroad is negative
      OR that foreign owners of productive resources in Guatemala are earning more
      income than owners from Guatemala are earning in foreign countries.

      NB Responses that do not refer to the data in Table 2 can be awarded a
      maximum of [3].

(d)   Using information from the text/data and your knowledge of economics, contrast
      the potential for economic development in Guatemala and Honduras.                         [8]

      Examiners should be aware that candidates may take a different approach which,
      if appropriate, should be rewarded.

      Do not award beyond Level 2 if the answer does not contain reference to the
      information provided.

      “Contrast” requires candidates to give an account of the differences between two
      (or more) items or situations, referring to both (all) of them throughout

      Economic analysis may include:
       poverty cycle
       Lorenz curve / Gini
       primary products PED YED
       terms of trade
       FDI
       growth.

      Responses may include:
       a definition of economic development
       a comparison of the HDI ranking, noting that Guatemala’s ranking is
        marginally better than Honduras’ (Table 2)
       GNI per capita is notably higher in Guatemala, but education and health
        indices are similar for both countries (Table 2)
       the difference in GNI per capita may be exaggerated for Guatemala as it
        seems to be more dependent on inflows of remittances which would inflate
        GNI (paragraph )
       Honduras’ better access to sanitation (Table 2) may contribute to higher
        economic development and may result in a similar life expectancy despite its
        significantly lower GNI per capita
       Honduras’ larger expenditure on education and health care as a percentage of
        GDP may contribute to higher economic development (Table 2)
       in the long run, greater expenditure on health care and education may result in
        a healthier and more productive work force, contributing to greater economic
        growth and development
       Honduras collects more tax revenue (as a percentage of GDP), which may
        explain its capacity to spend more on merit goods (as a percentage of GDP)
        (Table 2)

 PPC curve or LRAS curve to show effect of improvement in quality of labour
  for Honduras
 Honduras’ lower Gini coefficient suggests a more equal distribution of income
  (Table 2) even though Honduras’ GNI per capita income is lower than
  Guatemala, income is more equally distributed
 Guatemala probably has more people living in absolute poverty, particularly in
  rural areas (paragraph )
 while Guatemala has a larger population and economy (paragraph ), it may
  be over-reliant on remittances and agricultural exports as a source of
  economic growth (paragraph  and ) when compared to Honduras
  (paragraph )
 it takes less time in Honduras to start a business, which encourages
  entrepreneurship and increases SRAS (Table 2)
 Honduras’ economy is becoming more diversified (paragraph ), meaning
  that it may be more able than Guatemala to withstand global fluctuations in
  commodity prices in the future
 concerns about poor security in both countries that may discourage FDI
 poor infrastructure in Guatemala (paragraph ) may discourage FDI which is
  needed to diversify the economy and increase economic growth
 use of data to make predictions of future economic development.

Any reasonable evaluation.
