Apply the markbands that provide the “best fit” to the responses given and award credit wherever it is
possible to do so. If an answer indicates that the demands of the question are understood and
addressed but that not all implications are considered (for example, compare or contrast; reasons
or significance; methods or success), then examiners should not be afraid of using the full range of
marks allowed for by the markscheme. Responses that offer good coverage of some of the criteria
should be rewarded accordingly.

 Marks     Level descriptor
           • Responses are clearly focused, showing a high degree of awareness of the demands
              and implications of the question. Answers are well structured, balanced and effectively
              organized.
           • Knowledge is detailed, accurate and relevant. Events are placed in their historical
              context, and there is a clear understanding of historical concepts.
13–15      • Examples used are appropriate and relevant, and are used effectively to support the
              analysis/evaluation.
           • Arguments are clear and coherent. There is evaluation of different perspectives, and this
              evaluation is integrated effectively into the answer.
           • The answer contains well-developed critical analysis. All, or nearly all, of the main points
              are substantiated, and the response argues to a reasoned conclusion.
           • The demands of the question are understood and addressed. Answers are generally
              well structured and organized, although there may be some repetition or lack of clarity in
              places.
           • Knowledge is accurate and relevant. Events are placed in their historical context, and
              there is a clear understanding of historical concepts. Examples used are appropriate and
10–12
              relevant, and are used to support the analysis/evaluation.
           • Arguments are mainly clear and coherent. There is some awareness and evaluation of
              different perspectives.
           • The response contains critical analysis. Most of the main points are substantiated, and
              the response argues to a consistent conclusion.
           • The response indicates an understanding of the demands of the question, but these
              demands are only partially addressed. There is an attempt to follow a structured
              approach.

              coherence.
4–6        • Knowledge is demonstrated but lacks accuracy and relevance. There is a superficial
              understanding of historical context. The answer makes use of specific examples,
              although these may be vague or lack relevance.
           • There is some limited analysis, but the response is primarily narrative/descriptive in
              nature, rather than analytical.
           • There is little understanding of the demands of the question. The response is poorly
              structured or, where there is a recognizable essay structure, there is minimal focus on
              the task.

Section 1: Indigenous societies and cultures in the Americas (c750–1500)

1.   “The relationship between religious and political powers was mutually beneficial.” Discuss with
     reference to two pre-Columbian societies.

     The question requires that candidates offer a considered and balanced review of the statement
     that the relationship between religious and political powers in pre-Columbian societies was
     mutually beneficial. Candidates may offer equal coverage of the two societies, or they may
     prioritize their evaluation of one of them. However, both societies will be a feature of the response.
     Candidates may discuss the part played by religious authorities in state affairs or the role played by
     religion to justify territorial expansion. They may argue that religious power benefitted from the
     political conquest of other societies by, for example, expanding a religion or gaining prisoners for
     human sacrifices. They may claim that religious temples and sacred cities were physical evidence
     of the political power of a society. Other relevant factors may be addressed, for example how the
     theocratic nature of political power provided political stability. Candidates’ opinions or conclusions
     will be presented clearly and supported by appropriate evidence.


2.   Evaluate the contribution of written and unwritten language in two indigenous societies.

     The question requires that candidates make an appraisal of the contribution of written and
     unwritten language in two indigenous societies. Contributions may extend beyond the timeframe
     but they must be clearly linked to the issue raised in the question. Candidates may offer equal
     coverage of written and unwritten language, or they may prioritize their evaluation of one of them.
     However, both aspects will be a feature of the response. Candidates may refer to literary
     production, the registry of history and religious rituals, as well as mathematical and scientific
     developments. Other relevant factors may be addressed, for example the role of language in the
     consolidation of territorial conquests, but with a focus on the issue in the question. Candidates may
     argue that the conquest destroyed much evidence of indigenous languages so it is difficult to fully
     evaluate the extent of their contribution. Candidates’ opinions or conclusions will be presented
     clearly and supported by appropriate evidence.
                                                  –5–                 M21/3/HISTX/HP3/ENG/TZ0/AM/M


Section 2: European explorations and conquests in the Americas (c1492–c1600)

3.   To what extent were colonizing countries successful in the exploitation of resources in the
     Americas?

     The question requires that candidates consider the merits or otherwise of the suggestion that
     colonizing countries were successful in the exploitation of resources in the Americas.
     Consequences may extend beyond the timeframe but they must be clearly linked to the issue
     raised in the question. Candidates may refer to the Spanish exploitation of gold and jewels in the
     conquering of the Aztecs, silver in Peru and Mexico, and indigenous labour through the
     encomienda system along with the French exploitation of fish off Newfoundland and of animal pelts
     through the fur trade with First Nation peoples. Other relevant factors may be addressed, for
     example it could be argued that the conversion of indigenous souls by the Catholic Church was a
     form of resource exploitation, but with a focus on the issue in the question. Candidates’ opinions or
     conclusions will be presented clearly and supported by appropriate evidence.


4.   “Bartolomé de las Casas improved the treatment of indigenous populations.” Discuss.

     The question requires that candidates offer a considered and balanced review of the statement
     that Bartolomé de las Casas improved the treatment of the indigenous populations in the
     Americas. Improvements may extend beyond the timeframe but they must be clearly linked to the
     issue raised in the question. Candidates may refer to de las Casas’ efforts to document the
     mistreatment of the indigenous populations, efforts that led to the Hieronymite reforms (though
     largely unsuccessful); success in arguing for the issuance of the New Laws that would call for the
     termination of the encomienda system; his participation in the Valladolid debates arguing for the
     indigenous as “fully human” and for their improved legal status. Other relevant factors may be
     addressed, for example the death threats that caused de las Casas to leave New Spain or the
     limited impact of the reforms, but with a focus on the issue in the question. Candidates’ opinions or
     conclusions will be presented clearly and supported by appropriate evidence.
                                                  –6–                 M21/3/HISTX/HP3/ENG/TZ0/AM/M


Section 3: Colonial government in the New World (1500–1800)

5.   “Colonial government successfully established royal authority.” Discuss with reference to British
     and French political organization in their North American colonies.

     The question requires that candidates offer a considered and balanced review of the statement
     that colonial government was successful in establishing royal authority in British and French North
     America. Candidates may offer equal coverage of British and French North America, or they may
     prioritize their discussion of one of them. However, both regions will be a feature of the response.
     Candidates may refer to the extent to which governors could exercise royal authority in colonies
     and refer to, for example, the competing interests between royal authority and the colonists. They
     may claim that royal attempts to control trade (ie, Navigation Acts) were ineffective and furthered
     the colonial challenge of royal authority. Candidates may argue that events in Europe such as the
     English Civil War or the French Revolution, challenged the successful establishment of royal
     authority. Other relevant factors such as the remoteness of Europe could be discussed.
     Candidates’ opinions or conclusions will be presented clearly and supported by appropriate
     evidence.


6.   Discuss the reasons for, and impact of, the Pombaline reforms.

     The question requires that candidates offer a considered and balanced review of the reasons for,
     and impact of, the Pombaline reforms. Discussion of both reasons and impact may extend beyond
     the timeframe but it must be clearly linked to the issue raised in the question. Candidates may offer
     equal coverage of reasons and impact, or they may prioritize their discussion of one of them,
     however, both aspects will be a feature of the response. For reasons, candidates may discuss the
     influence of the Enlightenment, the aim of making the administration of Portuguese colonies more
     efficient and trade more profitable. For impact, candidates may discuss the new territorial divisions,
     the increase in taxation pressure, the creation of new trade companies or the expulsion of the
     Jesuits. Candidates may argue that the reforms failed to consolidate royal authority and led to riots
     and demonstrations. Candidates’ opinions or conclusions will be presented clearly and supported
     by appropriate evidence.
                                                  –7–                 M21/3/HISTX/HP3/ENG/TZ0/AM/M


Section 4: Religion in the New World (1500–1800)

7.   “The main aim of the Catholic Church in Spanish and Portuguese America was the conversion of
     indigenous people.” Discuss.

     The question requires that candidates offer a considered and balanced review of the statement
     that the main aim of the Catholic Church in the Americas was the conversion of indigenous people.
     Candidates may offer equal coverage of Spanish and Portuguese America, or they may prioritize
     their discussion of either. However, both aspects will be a feature of the response. Candidates may
     refer to the extension of language, culture and political control to alter the nomadic nature of
     indigenous life; the attempt of pacification (both for security and protection); the establishment of
     schools and farms for the benefit of the indigenous people and the mission of the Catholic Church
     to save souls through conversion. Other relevant factors may be addressed, for example the
     Jesuits’ establishment of “reductions” to protect the indigenous from enslavement, but with a focus
     on the issue in the question. Candidates’ opinions or conclusions will be presented clearly and
     supported by appropriate evidence.


8.   Compare and contrast the impact of religious orders in New France and in Spanish America.

     The question requires that candidates give an account of the similarities and differences between
     New France and Spanish America in terms of the impact of religious orders, referring to both
     throughout. There does not need to be an equal number of each. Consequences/results may
     extend beyond the timeframe but they must be clearly linked to the issue raised in the question.
     For comparison, candidates may refer to the common aim of conversion to Christianity (with
     coercion as an acceptable method), the unintended spread of disease that resulted in severe
     depopulation and the acquisition of knowledge as to flora, fauna and geography. Candidates may
     contrast how successful the conversion efforts were (such as the relative failure of the Jesuits
     among the Huron and the more successful efforts of the Catholic missions in New Spain) and the
     extent of protection the religious orders were able to provide against harmful colonial influence,
     such as the introduction of slavery and alcohol. Candidates’ opinions or conclusions will be
     presented clearly and supported by appropriate evidence.
                                                  –8–                  M21/3/HISTX/HP3/ENG/TZ0/AM/M


Section 5: Slavery and the New World (1500–1800)

9.    Discuss the nature of, and reasons for, the social structures on plantations in either the West
      Indies or Brazil.

      The question requires that candidates offer a considered and balanced review of the nature of and
      reasons for the social structures of plantations in either the West Indies or Brazil. For nature,
      candidates may argue that the social structure was based almost exclusively on race, defined
      status and power in the plantations. Candidates may discuss that lighter skinned African American
      slaves were higher on the social structure than darker skinned slaves. They may refer to social
      differences within groups such as white indentured servants or domestic servants being above
      African American slaves. As to reasons, candidates may argue that the imposed social structure
      “justified” and enforced the supremacy of Europeans in the colonies and aided in the control of
      both indigenous and African American peoples. Candidates’ opinions or conclusions will be
      presented clearly and supported by appropriate evidence.


10.   Evaluate the impact of slave resistance and slave rebellions in British America before 1776.

      The question requires that candidates make an appraisal of slave resistance and slave rebellions
      in British America before 1776, weighing up its impact or otherwise. Candidates may offer equal
      coverage of slave resistance and slave rebellions, or they may prioritize their evaluation of one.
      However, both aspects will be a feature of the response. Candidates may refer to methods of slave
      resistance such as breaking tools or sabotaging production and their impact on productivity. They
      may evaluate the impact of slave resistance to Christianity and European cultural values and the
      emergence of syncretism and transculturation. They may evaluate the impact of the Stono
      Rebellion of 1739, such as the passing of the Negro Act. Other relevant factors may be addressed,
      for example runaway slaves, but with a focus on the issue in the question. Candidates’ opinions or
      conclusions will be presented clearly and supported by appropriate evidence.
                                                  –9–                  M21/3/HISTX/HP3/ENG/TZ0/AM/M


Section 6: Independence movements (1763–1830)

11.   Discuss the impact of military campaigns/battles on the outcome of two Latin American
      independence processes.

      The question requires that candidates offer a considered and balanced review of the impact of
      military campaigns and battles to the outcome of two independence processes in Latin America.
      The impact may extend beyond independence but it must be clearly linked to the issue raised in
      the question. Candidates may offer equal coverage of both independence processes, or they may
      prioritize their discussion of one. However, two independence processes will be featured in the
      response. Candidates may refer to the contributions of the campaigns coordinated by Bolivar and
      San Martin to independence, for example. They may discuss how military campaigns and battles
      promoted patriotism and united Latin Americans from different social and racial backgrounds.
      Other relevant factors may be addressed, for example how campaigns and battles contributed to
      shape political rivalries in the region, but with a focus on the issue in the question. Candidates’
      opinions or conclusions will be presented clearly and supported by appropriate evidence.


12.   “Independence established new and effective trade relations.” Discuss with reference to two
      societies of the Americas.

      The question requires that candidates offer a considered and balanced review of the statement
      that independence shaped new and effective trade relations in the Americas. Candidates may offer
      equal coverage of each society or they may prioritize their discussion of one. However, both
      societies will be a feature of the response. Candidates may refer to how, with the end of colonial
      monopoly, the Americas became markets for European industrial goods. They may also claim that
      Europe and the US became markets for Latin American sugar, coffee and tobacco. Candidates
      may argue that the lack of infrastructure made it difficult for new trade patterns to emerge and that
      trade within the region, especially in Latin America, continued to be limited. Other relevant factors
      may be addressed, for example the continuity of monoculture patterns, but with a focus on the
      issue in the question. Candidates’ opinions or conclusions will be presented clearly and supported
      by appropriate evidence.
                                                  – 10 –               M21/3/HISTX/HP3/ENG/TZ0/AM/M


Section 7: Nation-building and challenges (c1780–c1870)

13.   “The Mexican–American War (1846–1848) was mainly caused by the actions of the Mexican
      government.” To what extent do you agree with this statement?

      The question requires that candidates consider the merits or otherwise of the statement that the
      Mexican–American War was caused mainly by the actions of the Mexican government. Causes
      may predate the timeframe but they must be clearly linked to the issue raised in the question.
      Candidates may refer to Mexico’s internal divisions that led to the Texas independence movement
      (resulting in a boundary dispute as a precursor to war) and Mexico’s refusal to meet with US
      diplomat John Slidell which allowed US President Polk to claim that Mexico had rejected peaceful
      overtures. Other relevant factors may be addressed, for example the influence of manifest destiny
      sentiment in the US as a justification for war as well as Polk’s desire to serve Southern interests by
      the expansion of slavery into territory acquired through war with Mexico, but with a focus on the
      issue in the question. Candidates’ opinions or conclusions will be presented clearly and supported
      by appropriate evidence.


14.   “The Durham Report was successful in resolving political discontent in Canada.” To what extent do
      you agree with this statement?

      The question requires that candidates consider the merits or otherwise of the statement that the
      Durham Report was successful in resolving political discontent in Canada. Results may extend
      beyond the timeframe but they must be clearly linked to the issue raised in the question.
      Candidates may refer to the rebellions of 1837 that led to the Durham report, the success in
      achieving unification of Upper and Lower Canada, and the acceptance of Durham’s call for
      responsible government. Candidates may contest the success of the report based on the long
      delay in the extension of self-government to the colonies or Durham’s call for assimilation of
      French-Canadians which was in conflict with his advocacy of local self-government. Other relevant
      factors may be addressed, for example the argument that the role of British and colonial reformers
      was a significant factor in both the advancement and the delay of responsible government, but with
      a focus on the issue in the question. Candidates’ opinions or conclusions will be presented clearly
      and supported by appropriate evidence.
                                                 – 11 –              M21/3/HISTX/HP3/ENG/TZ0/AM/M


Section 8: US Civil War: causes, course and effects (1840–1877)

15.   “Economic differences between the North and South were the most important factor in causing the
      Civil War.” To what extent do you agree with this statement?

      The question requires that candidates consider the merits or otherwise of the statement that
      economic differences between the North and South were the most important factor in causing the
      Civil War. Causes may predate the timeframe but they must be clearly linked to the issue raised in
      the question. Candidates may refer to the tariff issue as emblematic of North–South economic
      differences, the largely agrarian nature of the Southern economy in contrast to emerging Northern
      industrialization, the competition for territorial expansion between slave-labour interests of the
      South versus Northern interests in wage-labour and the emergence of the Republican party that
      represented the economic interests of the North and West only. Other relevant factors may be
      addressed; for example the assertion that states’ rights, slavery and the struggle for political
      dominance were major causes of war, but with a focus on the issue in the question. Candidates’
      opinions or conclusions will be presented clearly and supported by appropriate evidence.


16.   Evaluate the impact of the Emancipation Proclamation (1863) on the outcome of the Civil War.

      The question requires that candidates make an appraisal of the Emancipation Proclamation,
      weighing up the strengths and limitations of its impact on the outcome of the US Civil War. The
      impact may extend beyond the timeframe but they must be clearly linked to the issue raised in the
      question. Candidates may note the proclamation committed the nation to the ultimate end of
      slavery thus adding a moral cause to that of “preserving the Union”; the proclamation virtually
      ended Southern hope for British or French intervention on behalf of the South; the proclamation
      increased the manpower available to the North by authorizing the recruitment of freed slaves into
      the Union army. Other relevant factors may be addressed, for example the intention to weaken the
      Confederacy by disrupting the labour force and by causing internal insurrections, but with a focus
      on the issue in the question. Candidates’ opinions or conclusions will be presented clearly and
      supported by appropriate evidence.

Section 9: The development of modern nations (1865–1929)

17.   Discuss the impact of neocolonialism in two countries.

      The question requires that candidates offer a considered and balanced review of the impact of
      neocolonialism in two countries. Such impact may extend beyond the timeframe but it must be
      clearly linked to the issue raised in the question. Candidates may offer equal coverage of both
      countries or they may prioritize their discussion of one. However, both countries will be a feature of
      the response. Candidates may refer to the rise of a wealthy and often politically powerful
      landowning class. They may discuss the contribution to urbanization by displaced indigenous
      groups and rural workers joining the urban workforce. They may discuss the countries’ exposure to
      the fluctuation of the international prices of commodities and to the economic and political influence
      of multinational corporations. Other relevant factors may be addressed, for example the extent to
      which neocolonialism discouraged the development of national industries. Candidates’ opinions or
      conclusions will be presented clearly and supported by appropriate evidence.


18.   Evaluate the impact of the Jim Crow Laws on the social and economic conditions of African
      Americans.

      The question requires that candidates make an appraisal of the Jim Crow Laws, weighing up their
      impact on the social and economic conditions of African Americans. The impact may extend
      beyond the timeframe but it must be clearly linked to the issue raised in the question. Candidates
      may offer equal coverage of social and economic conditions or they may prioritize their evaluation
      of one. However, both aspects will be a feature of the response. Candidates may refer to the ways
      the Jim Crow Laws enforced racial segregation in neighbourhoods, schools, restaurants, and
      transport and widened the gap between African American and white citizens. They may claim that
      the Laws restricted the economic opportunities of African Americans. Other relevant factors may be
      addressed, for example the use of intimidation and violence to enforce the Laws, but with a focus
      on the issue in the question. Candidates’ opinions or conclusions will be presented clearly and
      supported by appropriate evidence.

Section 10: Emergence of the Americas in global affairs (1880–1929)

19.   Evaluate the impact of the Big Stick policy on US foreign relations.

      The question requires that candidates make an appraisal of the Big Stick policy, weighing up the
      strengths and limitations of its impact on US foreign relations. Consequences may extend beyond
      the timeframe but they must be clearly linked to the issue raised in the question. Candidates may
      refer to US rhetoric regarding the pursuit of peaceful diplomacy but with the threat of military
      intervention, the first application of the Big Stick in response to the 1902 Venezuelan debt crisis,
      intervention in Columbia to build the Panama Canal and the 1904 statement of the Roosevelt
      Corollary. Other relevant factors may be addressed, for example the Big Stick was applied in the
      voyage of the Great White Fleet to impress other countries with US naval power, but with a focus
      on the issue in the question. Candidates’ opinions or conclusions will be presented clearly and
      supported by appropriate evidence.


20.   To what extent was US foreign policy neutral prior to entering the First World War?

      The question requires that candidates consider the merits or otherwise of the suggestion that US
      foreign policy was neutral prior to entering the First World War. Candidates may argue either in
      support of or against neutrality by their interpretation of US cultural ties to Great Britain and
      France; the impact of European war orders on the US economy; President Wilson’s 1916
      campaign rhetoric as compared to actual US policy; war loans to the Allied Powers; the US
      response to Germany’s submarine warfare as compared to Great Britain’s naval embargo of
      Europe. Other relevant factors may be claimed as affecting US foreign policy, for example the
      political impact of events, such as the sinking of the Lusitania and the revelation of the Zimmerman
      Note resulting in anti-German sentiment, but with a focus on the issue in the question. Candidates’
      opinions or conclusions will be presented clearly and supported by appropriate evidence.

Section 11: The Mexican Revolution (1884–1940)

21.   Discuss the impact of the Maximato.

      The question requires that candidates offer a considered and balanced review of the impact of the
      Maximato. The impact may extend beyond the timeframe but arguments must be clearly linked to
      the issue raised in the question. Candidates may refer to the influence of Plutarco Calles on the
      Maximato presidents; the combination of political ideas linked to the Mexican Revolution with a
      conservative rule; the impact of political struggles between supporters and detractors of Calles and
      the founding of the National Revolutionary Party (PNR) that would control presidential succession
      for decades to come in Mexico. Candidates may also discuss the end of anticlericalism and the
      Cristero rebellion, changes in labour legislation and education. Other relevant factors may be
      addressed, for example the failure to implement effective land reforms, but with a focus on the
      issue in the question. Candidates’ opinions or conclusions will be presented clearly and supported
      by appropriate evidence.


22.   To what extent did Lázaro Cárdenas advance the renewal of the revolution?

      The question requires that candidates consider the merits or otherwise of the suggestion that
      Lázaro Cárdenas advanced the renewal of the revolution. Candidates may claim that Cárdenas
      consolidated the relationship between government and the working class by giving workers
      participation in the management of public companies and implementing corporatism. They may
      argue that he limited foreign influence by nationalizing the oil industry, expropriating the railways
      and placing them under workers’ administration. Candidates may evaluate Cárdenas’s education
      policies. Schooling became compulsory and free while special education programmes for the
      indigenous populations were implemented. They may also refer to Cárdenas land redistribution
      programme and argue, however significant, it could not end inequality. Candidates may argue that
      Cárdenas was not revolutionary as his reforms aimed at improving, rather than changing,
      conditions. Candidates’ opinions or conclusions will be presented clearly and supported by
      appropriate evidence.

Section 12: The Great Depression and the Americas (mid 1920s–1939)

23.   “Economic factors were more important than political factors in causing the Great Depression.”
      Discuss with reference to one country of the Americas.

      The question requires that candidates, with reference to one country of the Americas, offer a
      considered and balanced review of the statement that economic factors were more important than
      political factors in causing the Great Depression. Candidates may offer equal coverage of political
      and economic causes, or they may prioritize their evaluation of either. For the US, candidates may
      refer to the laissez-faire policies and high tariffs of the 1920s as political factors; while the impact of
      Wall Street speculation, economic disparity and surplus agricultural production may be argued as
      economic causes. For Canada, candidates might apply environmental factors, the drop in world
      commodity prices and the impact of US markets as economic causes; while acknowledging the
      lack of intervention as a political cause. For countries in Latin America, candidates might
      emphasize the impact of US and British trade policies or their own export-based economic models.
      Other relevant factors may be addressed, for example the limited extent of economic decline in
      Argentina, but with a focus on the issue in the question. Candidates’ opinions or conclusions will be
      presented clearly and supported by appropriate evidence


24.   To what extent did the New Deal change the US political system?

      The question requires that candidates consider the merits or otherwise of the suggestion that the
      New Deal changed the US political system. Consequences of the New Deal may extend beyond
      the timeframe but they must be clearly linked to the issue raised in the question. Candidates may
      refer to the extent to which citizens began to depend upon the national, rather than state and local
      governments for problem-solving and economic intervention; the growth of the federal bureaucracy
      and regulatory function; the establishment of a Democratic party coalition that would control the
      three branches of government for several decades; the trend toward the president and cabinet
      surpassing Congress as a major force in drafting legislation. Other relevant factors may be
      addressed, for example the fact that the New Deal had little impact in advancing the political rights
      of African Americans, but with a focus on the issue in the question. Candidates’ opinions or
      conclusions will be presented clearly and supported by appropriate evidence.

Section 13: The Second World War and the Americas (1933–1945)

25.   Discuss the impact of events in Europe and Asia on inter-American diplomacy up to 1941.

      The question requires that candidates offer a considered and balanced review of the impact on
      inter-American diplomacy of events in Europe up to 1941. The impact may extend beyond the
      timeframe but it must be clearly linked to the issue raised in the question. Candidates may refer to
      the Panama Conference (1939) in which participant nations adopted a position of neutrality
      towards the war in Europe. They may discuss plans for economic cooperation within the region.
      They may also discuss the impact of the Havana Conference (1940) which aimed at upholding the
      Monroe Doctrine and implementing collective security to protect the region from European and
      Asian expansionism. Candidates may discuss the diplomatic response to the Second World War
      leading to the Permanent Joint Board of Defense (1940) by Canada and the US. Candidates’
      opinions or conclusions will be presented clearly and supported by appropriate evidence.


26.   Compare and contrast the involvement of two countries of the Americas in the Second World War.

      The question requires that candidates give an account of the similarities and differences of the
      involvement of two countries of the Americas in the Second World War, referring to both
      throughout. Candidates may compare and contrast the countries’ diplomatic policies and their
      relations with belligerent nations. They may also compare and contrast the extent of involvement of
      both countries by, for example, referring to whether they declared war or remained neutral. They
      may compare and contrast the role played by the US to involve the selected countries in the
      Second World War. They may also compare and contrast the significance of the countries’ military
      contribution with reference to their contribution of troops, access to military bases or territory and
      contribution to equipment. Candidates may also compare and contrast the economic contributions
      to the war’s efforts by making reference to trade during the war. Candidates’ opinions or
      conclusions will be presented clearly and supported by appropriate evidence.

Section 14: Political developments in Latin America (1945–1980)

27.   Evaluate the consequences of guerrilla movements on the domestic development of one country.

      The question requires that candidates make an appraisal of guerrilla movements weighing up the
      consequences on one country. Consequences may extend beyond the timeframe but they must be
      clearly linked to the issue raised in the question. Candidates may refer to political consequences,
      such as the increase of political instability, the challenges to political or military authority. They may
      also evaluate the impact of guerrilla violence in spreading panic among the population. Candidates
      may claim that the confrontations led to an increase in poverty, territorial displacements and the
      death of innocent citizens. Other relevant factors may be addressed, for example the use of “dirty
      war” or military repression, but with a focus on the issue in the question. Candidates’ opinions or
      conclusions will be presented clearly and supported by appropriate evidence.


28.   “The liberation theology movement had a significant impact on Latin America.” To what extent do
      you agree with this statement?

      The question requires that candidates offer a considered and balanced review of the statement
      that the liberation theology movement had a significant impact on Latin America. The impact may
      extend beyond the timeframe but it must be clearly linked to the issue raised in the question.
      Candidates may refer to the extent to which liberation theology promoted and achieved change in
      Latin America. They may assess the impact of their base communities in the fight against poverty
      and, also, evaluate their work with indigenous communities. Candidates may evaluate the role
      played by the liberation theology movement in the defence of human rights in countries under
      military rule or dictatorships and assess the impact of the leaders in this struggle. Other relevant
      factors may be addressed, for example the challenge posed by liberation theology to the Catholic
      Church by proposing a “popular church”, but with a focus on the issue in the question. Candidates’
      opinions or conclusions will be presented clearly and supported by appropriate evidence.

Section 15: Political developments in the United States (1945–1980) and Canada (1945–1982)

29.   Compare and contrast the domestic policies of Ford and Carter.

      The question requires that candidates give an account of the similarities and differences between
      Ford and Carter in terms of their domestic policies, referring to both throughout. There does not
      need to be an equal number of each. For comparison candidates may refer to the efforts of both to
      restore trust in government (Ford following Watergate and Carter following Vietnam), their loss of
      public support due to controversial pardons (Ford of Nixon and Carter of Vietnam draft resisters),
      the dominance of energy issues and their difficult relations with Congress. For contrast, candidates
      may address Ford’s limited legislative initiatives and the impact of “stagflation” (low growth and
      high inflation) with Carter’s relative success in initiatives such as the creation of the Superfund to
      clean toxic environmental sites, de-regulation of the transportation industry and legislation for
      energy independence. Candidates’ opinions or conclusions will be presented clearly and supported
      by appropriate evidence.


30.   “Diefenbaker’s domestic policies were successful in solving Canada’s problems.” To what extent
      do you agree with this statement?

      The question requires that candidates consider the merits or otherwise of the statement that
      Diefenbaker’s domestic policies were successful in solving Canada’s problems. Results may
      extend beyond the timeframe but they must be clearly linked to the issue raised in the question. As
      successes, candidates may refer to Diefenbaker’s “Vision speech” which provided a progressive
      plan for Canada’s future, extension of the vote to First Nation people, passage of the Canadian Bill
      of Rights, enactment of old age pensions and the opening of new markets for Canadian wheat
      sales. Other relevant factors may be addressed, for example it might be argued that Diefenbaker’s
      failure to appoint Quebec residents to cabinet positions eroded support from Quebec and that high
      unemployment and a decline in the value of the Canadian dollar was indicative of domestic policy
      failure, but with a focus on the issue in the question. Candidates’ opinions or conclusions will be
      presented clearly and supported by appropriate evidence.
                                                   – 19 –               M21/3/HISTX/HP3/ENG/TZ0/AM/M


Section 16: The Cold War and the Americas (1945–1981)

31.   “The diplomatic and political impact of the Korean War was limited.” Discuss with reference to two
      countries.

      The question requires that candidates offer a considered and balanced review of the statement
      that the diplomatic and political impact of the Korean War was limited. Candidates may offer equal
      coverage of diplomatic and political impact, or they may prioritize their discussion of either. For
      diplomatic impact, candidates may discuss the war as vindication of the United Nations’s potential
      to use military force against an aggressor and the establishment of a defence treaty between the
      US and South Korea. For political impact, candidates may address the war as helping secure
      support in the US for increased military spending (NSC-68) and Eisenhower’s political benefit in
      the 1952 election by pledging to end the war. Other relevant factors may be addressed, for
      example the extensive military involvement of Canada resulted in internal controversy that may
      have contributed to their decision to maintain official neutrality in the Vietnam War. Conversely, for
      Colombia, (the only Latin American country to enter the war), there was temporary improvement of
      relations with the US, but this had little long-term impact, other than the controversy over the
      treatment of Colombia’s Korean War veterans. Candidates’ opinions or conclusions will be
      presented clearly and supported by appropriate evidence.


32.   Compare and contrast the foreign policies of John F Kennedy and Lyndon B Johnson.

      The question requires that candidates give an account of the similarities and differences between
      John F Kennedy and Lyndon B Johnson in terms of their foreign policy, referring to both
      throughout. There does not need to be an equal number of each. For comparison, candidates may
      address the dominance held by foreign policy issues in both administrations (Kennedy with the
      Cuban Missile Crisis and Johnson with Vietnam); that both engaged in a military invasion of a Latin
      American country (Kennedy in Cuba and Johnson in the Dominican Republic); the commitment of
      both to the maintenance of independent government for South Vietnam. For contrast, candidates
      may discuss Kennedy’s refusal to approve a combat role for the US in Vietnam, while Johnson
      committed over 500 000 troops; Kennedy’s attempt to improve relations with Latin America through
      the Peace Corp and Alliance for Progress, while Johnson did not have comparable initiatives.
      Candidates’ opinions or conclusions will be presented clearly and supported by appropriate
      evidence.

Section 17: Civil rights and social movements in the Americas post-1945

33.   “The civil rights of indigenous peoples in the Americas improved after 1945.” To what extent do you
      agree with this statement?

      The question requires that candidates consider the merits or otherwise of the statement that the
      civil rights of indigenous peoples in the Americas improved after 1945. Candidates may refer to the
      US passage of the Indian Civil Rights Act (1968), the Supreme Court case of US v. Wheeler that
      extended tribal autonomy over reservation policy, and the actions of the US National Indian Youth
      Council and the American Indian Movement. In Canada, the Indian Act (1961) and the
      Constitutional Act (1982) advanced indigenous rights in respect to reserve land and funds. It may
      also be argued that legislation was not consistently implemented or enforced and that the
      legislation often failed to rectify the civil rights’ disparities of the past. Other relevant factors may be
      addressed, for example in Latin America, indigenous groups were able to advance land rights and
      gain respect for cultural identity as well as resistance to forced assimilation, but with a focus on the
      issue in the question. Candidates’ opinions or conclusions will be presented clearly and supported
      by appropriate evidence.


34.   To what extent was the US Supreme Court successful in challenging segregation in education?

      The question requires that candidates consider the merits or otherwise of the suggestion that the
      US Supreme Court was successful in challenging segregation in education. Candidates may refer
      to the Brown v. Board of Education (1954); Brown II (1955) and Swann v. Mecklenburg (1971)
      Supreme Court cases; as well as Eisenhower’s intervention at Little Rock Central High, (based on
      the Brown decision), as responsible for public school integration reaching approximately 45 % by
      1988. Other relevant factors may be addressed, for example candidates may also argue that the
      Supreme Court’s lack of enforcement power, “white flight” to private schools and Southern
      “massive resistance” to integration limited the advancement of integration, but with a focus on the
      issue in the question. Candidates’ opinions or conclusions will be presented clearly and supported
      by appropriate evidence.

Section 18: The Americas (1980–2005)

35.   To what extent were the domestic policies of GHW Bush a success between 1989 and 1993?

      The question requires that candidates consider the merits or otherwise of the suggestion that the
      domestic policies of GHW Bush (1989–1993), were a success. Candidates may evaluate Bush’s
      economic policies and argue that he failed to abide by his promise not to raise taxes. Candidates
      may refer to his bailout of the Savings and Loans industry with funds to pay depositors, a policy
      which was criticised for costing billions in taxpayers’ money. Candidates may evaluate Bush’s
      environment policies, for example The Clean Air Act Amendments, which aimed at curbing
      pollution. Candidates may argue that, although the Americans with Disabilities Act, forbidding
      discrimination on the bases of disabilities, was criticised because of its cost, it was one of Bush’s
      successes. Other relevant factors may be addressed, such as the fact that Bush ruled with a
      Congress controlled by the Democratic Party, but with a focus on the issue in the question.
      Candidates’ opinions or conclusions will be presented clearly and supported by appropriate
      evidence.


36.   Discuss the role of the military in two Latin American countries following their transition to
      democracy.

      The question requires that candidates offer a considered and balanced review of the role of the
      military following the transition to democracy. Candidates may offer equal coverage of both
      countries or they may prioritize their discussion of one. However, both countries will be a feature of
      the response. Candidates may refer to the trials of military leaders following the restoration of
      democracy in some countries. They may argue that public opinion was highly critical of them and,
      for this reason, their role was limited. They may, however, also discuss the challenges to
      democracy posed by the military. They may discuss the role of the military in international conflicts
      in the region. Other relevant factors may be addressed, for example the role of the military in the
      fight against terrorism and the war on drugs, but with a focus on the issue in the question.
      Candidates’ opinions or conclusions will be presented clearly and supported by appropriate
      evidence.
