Microeconomics

1.   (a)       Explain why the price elasticity of demand for primary commodities is often
               relatively low while the price elasticity of demand for manufactured goods is often
               relatively high.                                                                      [10]

               Answers may include:
                definitions of PED, primary commodities, manufactured goods
                diagram(s) to show low (inelastic) demand for primary commodities and high
                 (elastic) demand for manufactured goods
                explanation of low PED for primary commodities and high PED for
                 manufactured goods in terms of the number and closeness of substitutes,
                 degree of necessity and proportion of income spent on the good
                examples of primary commodities with a relatively low PED and manufactured
                 goods with a relatively high PED.

          demand for a firm’s decision making.                                                    [15]

            changes in the price of substitutes and complements

            price changes and the importance of XED when there are changes in the price
            of substitutes or complements

          Discussion may include: the difficulty of obtaining reliable estimates in reality due
          to imperfect information, past data not necessarily being a guide to the future, the
          unreliability of consumer survey techniques, the problem of estimating variables
          that are not constant and the impact of factors other than the price of the good
          and the price of other goods.

          Award a maximum of [9] if only PED or only XED is addressed.

(b)       Discuss the view that tradable permits are more effective than taxes in reducing

          Answers may include:
           definitions of tradable permits, taxes
           supply and demand diagram(s) to show the use of tradable permits, and/or
            supply shifting left due to taxes, to tackle pollution
           explanation that both methods represent market-based policies, tradable
            permits working via set allowances to pollute with implications for profits for
            over- or under-shooting, and taxes working via the effect on supply, price and
            quantity
           examples of the use of taxes and/or tradable permits in practice
           synthesis or evaluation (discuss).

          Discussion may include: The advantage of tradeable permits over taxation is they
          create an incentive for firms to develop systems to reduce pollution and taxes just
          penalize all producers in a market and add to costs and the final selling price to
          households. The weakness of tradeable permits is the system is complicated to set
          up and administer and taxes are easier for a government to use.

          Award a maximum of [9] if only tradeable permits or only tax is addressed.

(b)   Evaluate the effectiveness of interventionist supply-side policies in reducing the
      level of unemployment in an economy.                                                 [15]

      Answers may include:
       definitions of unemployment, interventionist supply-side policies
       diagram showing LRAS shifting right and/or supply of labour increasing in a
        labour market diagram; candidates may also show AD shifting right as a
        short-term effect of supply-side policies
       explanation that interventionist supply-side policies increase the quantity and
        quality of factors of production and thus increase the productive capacity of
        the economy and can be targeted at particular sectors of the economy; this
        may help to reduce structural unemployment in the long term and also
        contribute to the reduction of demand-deficient unemployment in the short
        term through the impact on AD
       examples of interventionist supply-side policies helping to reduce
        unemployment in practice
       synthesis or evaluation.

      Evaluation may include: the importance of the type of unemployment (eg
      demand-deficient unemployment may be more directly reduced through
      expansionary monetary and fiscal policies); consideration of the effectiveness of
      supply-side policies (eg in terms of time lags, the ability to create employment,
      the impact on the government’s budget deficit, opportunity cost); government
      investment in new technologies (eg robotics/artificial intelligence) may lead to
      displacement of labour.

4.   (a)       Explain how expansionary monetary policy could be used to close a deflationary
               (recessionary) gap.                                                                     [10]

               Answers may include:
                definitions of monetary policy, expansionary monetary policy, deflationary gap
                diagrams to show a deflationary gap and how it would be closed by a shift of AD to the
                 right and/or increasing money supply that leads to decrease in the interest rates
                explanation that by increasing the money supply/decreasing the interest rate the central
                 bank stimulates consumption, investment and/or net export, leading to an increase in AD
                 and return of the real GDP to its potential level
                examples of countries that have used expansionary monetary policy to close a
                 deflationary gap.

(b)       Evaluate the effectiveness of monetary policy in reducing an economy’s rate of
          inflation.                                                                               [15]

          Answers may include:
           definitions of monetary policy, inflation
           diagram to show AD shifting left as a result of contractionary monetary policy
           explanation of how contractionary monetary policy may help to reduce
            demand-pull inflation in terms of the mechanisms by which higher interest
            rates reduce AD via the effect on consumption, investment and/or net exports
           examples of contractionary monetary policy being used in practice or
            examples of inflation targeting
           synthesis or evaluation.

          Evaluation may include: the implications of monetary policy in terms of the ability
          to implement changes in interest rates relatively quickly through the banking
          system, the possible conflicts with other objectives of economic policy, such as
          growth / unemployment, time lags, the independence of the central bank; the
          ineffectiveness of monetary policy in relation to cost-push inflation; the possibility
          that alternative policies (eg supply-side policies) may be more effective.
