Prescribed subject 1: Military leaders

For the attention of all examiners: if you are uncertain about the content/accuracy of a
candidate’s work please contact your team leader.

1.   (a)   What, according to Source C, encouraged violence against the Jews?                    [3]

           •   Richard I’s punishments were inadequate.
           •   The houses of the financiers were a source of envy.
           •   Local barons and knights were in debt to the Jews.
           •   Crusaders wanted plunder.

     The above material is an indication of what candidates may elect to write about in their
     responses. It is neither prescriptive nor exhaustive and no set answer is required.
     Award [1] for each relevant point up to a maximum of [3].

     (b)   What does Source D reveal about anti-Jewish violence in York in 1190?                 [2]

           • There was a large group of people involved.
           • The church was involved in the attack.
           • The castle offered the Jews limited protection against the violence.

     The above material is an indication of what candidates may elect to write about in their
     responses. It is neither prescriptive nor exhaustive and no set answer is required.
     Award [1] for each relevant point up to a maximum of [2].


2.   With reference to its origin, purpose and content, analyse the value and limitations of
     Source A for an historian studying the treatment of the Jews during the reign of
     Richard I.                                                                                  [4]

     Value:
     • The author is an historian, specializing in medieval history, and is likely to have
       based his research on detailed information.
     • The author’s intention is to provide an overall account of Richard I’s reign and thus
       the source provides context of the situation of the Jews during his reign.
     • It offers detail on the violence against the Jews and Richard I’s reactions to the
       events.

     Limitations:
     • The source was written about 800 years after the events it describes, so it may have
       been more difficult to find resources.
     • The source is on Richard I, rather than specifically on the treatment of Jews, so the
       material offered on this subject may be limited.
     • The source gives a mainly positive view on Richard I’s response to the events and
       so may not consider any failures.

     The focus of the question is on the value and limitations of the source. If only value or
     limitations are discussed, award a maximum of [2]. Origin, purpose and content should
     be used as supporting evidence to make relevant comments on the value and
     limitations. For [4] there must be at least one reference to each of them in either the
     value or the limitations.

3.   Compare and contrast what Sources B and C reveal about the massacre of the Jews in
     York in 1190.                                                                                  [6]

      Marks     Level descriptor
       5–6      • The response includes clear and valid points of comparison and of contrast.
       3–4      • The response includes some valid points of comparison and/or of contrast,
                   although these points may lack clarity.
        1–2     • The response consists of description of the content of the source(s), and/or general
                   comments about the source(s), rather than valid points of comparison or of
                   contrast.
         0      • The response does not reach a standard described by the descriptors above.

     Apply the markbands that provide the “best fit” to the responses given by candidates
     and award credit wherever it is possible to do so. The following material is an
     indication of what candidates may elect to write about in their responses. It is neither
     prescriptive nor exhaustive and no set answer is required.

     Comparison:
     • Both sources identify attacks against the Jews perpetrated around the Great
       Sabbath.
     • Both sources mention attacks on the houses and property of Jews.
     • Both sources comment that Rabbi Yomtob played an important part in the Jews’
       decision to kill their families.

     Contrast:
     • Source B states that they sought refuge in the house of prayer, whereas Source C
       states that they found refuge in the castle.
     • Source B states that only knights participated in the killings, while Source C states
       that a wider section of the population was involved, such as the clergy, youth and
       workmen.
     • Source B only focuses on the course of events in York, whereas Source C provides
       reasons why massacres occurred.

4.   Using the sources and your own knowledge, examine the view that there was limited
     protection for the Jews in England during the reign of Richard I.                                   [9]

     Apply the markbands that provide the “best fit” to the responses given by candidates

     prescriptive nor exhaustive and no set answer is required. While it is expected that
     there will be coverage of at least two of the sources, candidates are not required to
     refer to all four sources in their responses.

     Indicative content

     Source A             The source indicates that Christians attacked the Jews and
                          Richard was unable to prevent this despite sending out letters to
                          all regions of England.

     Source B             The source indicates that there was little protection of the Jews
                          who saw their houses destroyed and their goods taken.
                                        –6–                   M21/3/HISTX/BP1/ENG/TZ0/XX/M




Source C        The source argues that Richard I’s punishments were inadequate.
                It states that protection for the Jews was limited and that violence
                occurred again when senior officials were in France. However, in
                1190 the Chancellor tried to restore order.

Source D        The source suggests that there was no safe place for the Jews in
                York as anti-Jewish feeling was widespread in the population.

Own knowledge   Candidates may consider the inability of the government to control
                popular anti-Jewish feeling, particularly once Richard was on
                crusade. They may also consider that, despite the fact that the
                Jews were under Richard’s special protection, they were still
                persecuted. They may argue that there was some level of
                protection as some Jews were helped to escape attacks.
                Legislation seemed not to provide protection as shown by the
                Exchequer of the Jews issued in 1194, which controlled some of
                the financial activities of the Jews such as loans and interest rates.
                Candidates may refer to the reaction of the government after the
                York massacre and mention the dismissal of the sheriff and the
                castellan.

Prescribed subject 2: Conquest and its impact

For the attention of all examiners: if you are uncertain about the content/accuracy of a
candidate’s work please contact your team leader.

5.   (a)   What, according to Source E, were the causes of the Spanish expansion?                [3]

           • The Spanish expansion was part of a general European pattern after the
             depopulation of Europe in the 14th century.
           • The threatening presence of Muslims and Turks also urged the expansion.
           • Spaniards were driven by the zealotry of the Church.
           • Spaniards were looking for trade, territories and populations to submit.

     The above material is an indication of what candidates may elect to write about in their
     responses. It is neither prescriptive nor exhaustive and no set answer is required.
     Award [1] for each relevant point up to a maximum of [3].

     (b)   What does Source F suggest about the actions of the Spanish conquerors
           towards the indigenous population?                                                    [2]

           • They took the goods of the vanquished communities (livestock, precious
             metals [note: silver was important in Mexico]).
           • They forced the indigenous population to work for them.
           • They used military force to control the population.

     The above material is an indication of what candidates may elect to write about in their
     responses. It is neither prescriptive nor exhaustive and no set answer is required.
     Award [1] for each relevant point up to a maximum of [2].


6.   With reference to its origin, purpose and content, analyse the value and limitations of
     Source H for an historian studying the Spanish conquest of the Americas.                    [4]

     Value:
     • The author lived in the Americas at the time of the conquest.
     • As an official authority, his purpose was to report the abuses committed by the
       conquerors to Prince Philip II of Spain, therefore detail can be expected.
     • It provides information on the motives and behaviour of the conquerors.

     Limitations:
     • The source was written in 1542 while the conquest was still under development and
       it may not provide a full explanation of the motives behind the conquerors’ acts.
     • Since its purpose was to report to the king about the situation in the Americas, some
       aspects could have been exaggerated.
     • The source does not provide information about the royal response.

     The focus of the question is on the value and limitations of the source. If only value or
     limitations are discussed, award a maximum of [2]. Origin, purpose and content should
     be used as supporting evidence to make relevant comments on the value and
     limitations. For [4] there must be at least one reference to each of them in either the
     value or the limitations.

7.   Compare and contrast what Sources E and G reveal about the causes for the Spanish
     exploration and conquest of the Americas.                                                      [6]

     indication of what candidates may elect to write about in their responses. It is neither
     prescriptive nor exhaustive and no set answer is required.

     Comparison:
     • Both sources claim that Spain wanted dominion over new lands and population.
     • Both sources state that trade was an important reason for the Spanish expansion.
     • Both sources state that religious motives played a role in the Spanish expansion.
     • Both sources claim that the Reconquista played a significant role.

     Contrast:
     • While Source E attributes that the Spanish expansion emerged after the crisis in
       Europe in the 14th century, Source G considers it as a continuation of the
       Reconquista of Spain.
     • Although both sources refer to a range of contributing causes, only Source E
       decides that one factor, in this case economic motivations, played a greater part in
       the Spanish expansion.

     refer to all four sources in their responses.

     Indicative content

     Source E             The source claims that even if there was a range of motives, the
                          expansion was primarily caused by economic factors.

     Source F             The source depicts the conquerors enriching themselves by using
                          the workforce of the indigenous communities and taking their
                          property.

     Source G             The source states that the Spanish expansion was a continuation
                          of the Reconquista of Spain. It claims that besides the search for
                          trade and lands, colonization was a great act of faith.

     Source H             The source claims that conquerors were moved by greed and their
                          ambition was to take the gold from the natives and raise
                          themselves to high positions. It also denounces the crimes
                          committed against the natives.

Own knowledge   Candidates may support the statement by considering the
                expansion of the bourgeoisie and its trade activities, the demand
                for products such as spices, cotton, silk, gemstones and medicinal
                plants, and the blocking of established routes by the Ottomans that
                forced the Europeans merchants to find new routes.
                Candidates may offer further detail on the opportunities for social
                promotion that came with the acquisition of land. They may refer to
                the European demands for precious metals.
                Candidates may challenge the statement by referring to scientific
                developments and improvements in navigation techniques that
                promoted exploration. They can also consider the political rivalry
                between Portugal and Spain that led both crowns to expand their
                dominions. They could offer further detail on the role played by the
                Church in its quest to expand its influence.

Prescribed subject 3: The move to global war

For the attention of all examiners: if you are uncertain about the content/accuracy of a
candidate’s work please contact your team leader.

9.    (a)   What, according to Source I, did Fascism and Nazism have in common?                    [3]

            •   They both desired peace.
            •   They had common enemies.
            •   Both believed violence was a determining force.
            •   Both counted on the youth.

      The above material is an indication of what candidates may elect to write about in their
      responses. It is neither prescriptive nor exhaustive and no set answer is required.
      Award [1] for each relevant point up to a maximum of [3].

      (b)   What does Source J suggest about the foreign policies of Italy and Germany?            [2]

            • They had similar foreign policies.
            • Their foreign policies were aggressive.
            • Their policies could result in war.

      responses. It is neither prescriptive nor exhaustive and no set answer is required.
      Award [1] for each relevant point up to a maximum of [2].


10.   With reference to its origin, purpose and content, analyse the value and limitations of
      Source K for an historian studying the impact of ideology on the foreign policies of Italy
      and Germany.                                                                                 [4]

      Value:
      • The author had direct experience of Nazi Germany.
      • His purpose was to inform on his visit to Nazi Germany.
      • It discusses reasons for Italo-German cooperation.

      Limitations:
      • The source is from 1937 when events were still unfolding.
      • The book is intended to be a study of Nazi Germany, so the attention to Italian
        foreign policy could be limited.
      • As a visitor in Germany, he may not have had an in-depth understanding of Nazi
        ideology and its foreign policy.

      The focus of the question is on the value and limitations of the source. If only value or
      limitations are discussed, award a maximum of [2]. Origin, purpose and content should
      be used as supporting evidence to make relevant comments on the value and
      limitations. For [4] there must be at least one reference to each of them in either the
      value or the limitations.

      Indicative content

      Source I             This source states Fascist and Nazi foreign policies shared
                           ideological principles. However, it also mentions the existence of
                           common enemies as a factor influencing their foreign policies.

      Source J             This source represents the significance of force in Italian and
                           German foreign policies. It is consistent with the importance given
                           to it by Fascist and Nazi ideologies.

      Source K             The source argues Germany and Italy clashed on essential issues.
                           It argues they had been drawn together because they had
                           common enemies. It claims that the Germans did not respect the
                           Italians.

      Source L             The source states Germany and Italy had a significant ideological
                           affinity. It also mentions the role of other factors, such as strategy,
                           in shaping their foreign policies. It claims their territorial ambitions
                           were not incompatible.

Own knowledge   Candidates may provide additional information on the role of
                ideology in Italian and German foreign policies. For example, they
                both supported General Franco’s Fascist forces and opposed the
                Left during the Spanish Civil War.
                Candidates may refer to the Nazi–Soviet Pact of August 1939 and
                claim that it showed ideology was not a significant factor for Hitler.
                They may argue that relations between Italy and Germany were
                also based on pragmatism as Hitler recognised Italian control of
                Abyssinia to gain Mussolini’s support for the German annexation of
                Austria. They could also refer the Anglo–Italian agreement in April
                1938 and claim it demonstrated Mussolini’s lack of concern for
                ideology. Candidates may discuss the role of opportunism and
                argue that Hitler allied with Mussolini only to prevent him from
                joining Great Britain and France. In a similar way, Italy found in an
                alliance with Germany protection for its continental territory and an
                opportunity to expand in Africa and the Mediterranean.

14.   With reference to its origin, purpose and content, analyse the value and limitations of
      Source M for an historian studying the African American struggle for civil rights during
      the period 1954–1965.                                                                        [4]

      Value:
      • The source gives insight into the contemporary attitudes of the Student Non-violent
        Coordinating Committee.
      • It offers the arguments used in favour of non-violence.
      • It demonstrates how students were involved in the struggle for civil rights.

      Limitations:
      • It does not show how effective the outcome of the non-violent approach was.
      • The source only offers the perspective of one organization.
      • It is seeking to persuade in favour of non-violence, ignoring other approaches.

      The focus of the question is on the value and limitations of the source. If only value or
      limitations are discussed, award a maximum of [2]. Origin, purpose and content should
      be used as supporting evidence to make relevant comments on the value and
      limitations. For [4] there must be at least one reference to each of them in either the
      value or the limitations.

      • Both sources claim that acts of disobedience were supported.
      • Both sources identify non-violence as one of the methods used during the struggle.

      Contrast:
      • While Source O focuses only on the leading role of Martin Luther King, Source P
        also discusses the role of Malcolm X.
      • Source O’s emphasis is about the application of love in the face of violence,
        whereas in Source P Malcolm X advocated the use of violence in self-defence.
      • In Source O, Martin Luther King seeks an end to segregation. In contrast, in Source
        P, Malcolm X seeks complete separation between black and white people.

      Apply the markbands that provide the “best fit” to the responses given by candidates
      and award credit wherever it is possible to do so. The following material is an
      indication of what candidates may elect to write about in their responses. It is neither
      prescriptive nor exhaustive and no set answer is required. While it is expected that
      there will be coverage of at least two of the sources, candidates are not required to
      refer to all four sources in their responses.

      Indicative content

      Source M             The source claims that non-violence is an effective method in
                           achieving civil rights. It shows the importance of non-violence in
                           the SNCC’s strategies.

      Source N             This source demonstrates the likely ineffectiveness of non-violence
                           in the face of police brutality.

      Source O             This source demonstrates not only Martin Luther King and his
                           followers’ belief in non-violence in the face of violence, but it also
                           shows the effectiveness of such an approach in ending
                           segregation on buses in Montgomery.

      Source P             This source offers Malcolm X’s arguments on the ineffectiveness
                           of non-violence and his support of armed self-defence.

Own knowledge   Candidates may refer to examples of non-violence being effective
                in furthering civil rights. For example, they may discuss successful
                legal challenges, such as Brown versus Board of Education. They
                may refer to marches and rallies which brought civil rights to the
                fore, spurring the federal government into action and leading to the
                passing of the Civil Rights Act 1964.
                Candidates may offer further details on divisions within the civil
                rights movement as a result of the non-violent approach. They may
                also refer to disillusion with King’s methods. Candidates may
                argue the brutal deaths of freedom riders in 1964 were a
                consequence of the ineffectiveness of the non-violent approach.
                Candidates may argue that non-violence failed to eliminate deep-
                seated racism.

            • The Hutu power structure controlled most of the camps’ administration.
            • They worked with the UNHCR and NGOs on food distribution, health and
              schooling.
            • They collected taxes from the refugees.
            • They controlled dissenters through violence.

      (b)   What does Source R suggest about the living conditions of Rwandan refugees in
            camps?                                                                                [2]

            • There was overcrowding.
            • Healthcare was basic.
            • Children suffered malnutrition and/or disease.

18.   With reference to its origin, purpose and content, analyse the value and limitations of
      Source Q for an historian studying the Rwandan refugee crisis of 1994–1996.                 [4]

      Value:
      • It provides information on the magnitude of the crisis and actions undertaken by
        UNHCR officials.
      • It offers a contemporary assessment of the UNHCR’s performance in dealing with
        the refugee crisis.
      • It offers the UNHCR's views on the role played by NGOs.

      Limitations:
      • Published by the UNHCR, the source may exaggerate its success in dealing with
        the crisis.
      • It was written at a time when the crisis was unfolding.
      • The source focuses on one refugee camp only and therefore information on the
        Rwandan crisis may be limited.

      The focus of the question is on the value and limitations of the source. If only value or
      limitations are discussed, award a maximum of [2]. Origin, purpose and content should
      be used as supporting evidence to make relevant comments on the value and
      limitations. For [4] there must be at least one reference to each of them in either the
      value or the limitations.

19.   Compare and contrast what Sources Q and S reveal about the problems faced by the
      UNHCR during the refugee crisis.                                                               [6]

      and award credit wherever it is possible to do so. The following material is an
      indication of what candidates may elect to write about in their responses. It is neither
      prescriptive nor exhaustive and no set answer is required.

      Comparison:
      • Both sources agree on the magnitude of the emergency to be faced: 250 000
        Rwandan refugees had fled into Tanzania.
      • Both sources argue that coordinated action between the UNHCR and NGOs led to a
        successful resolution of the emergency crisis.
      • Both sources suggest that the UNHCR had to deal with security issues.

      Contrast:
      • Source S suggests that the response was ineffective, whereas Source Q suggests
        the overall response was effective.
      • While Source Q mentions a range of problems that the UNHCR had to deal with,
        Source S focuses exclusively on security issues.
      • While in Source Q the challenges faced by the UNHCR are ascribed to the large
        number of refugees, Source S claims that the UNHCR problems were due to the
        presence of alleged war criminals.

20.   Using the sources and your own knowledge, to what extent do you agree with the view

      Indicative content

      Source Q             The source argues that cooperation between the UNHCR and
                           NGOs allowed a secure entrance into Tanzania of 250 000
                           Rwandese in April 1994 and saved lives. It praises actions carried
                           out by partner NGOs to grant refugees protection. However, it
                           describes challenges faced on a daily basis in terms of providing
                           protection against epidemics, hunger, access to water, and
                           security.
      Source R             The source suggests that healthcare was organized in camps by
                           NGOs such as the Red Cross to protect refugees against
                           epidemics. However, it reveals that sickness and malnutrition
                           threatened the population.

Source S        This source argues that the UNHCR, in collaboration with partner
                NGOs, organized a successful emergency response. However, it
                claims that alleged war criminals at camps threatened security.

Source T        The source states that camps organized health, schooling and
                food distribution. However, it argues that Hutu extremists
                threatened the personal security of opponents and of those who
                wished to return to Rwanda.

Own knowledge   Candidates may offer further details on the actions carried out to
                provide safe water, education and health, including vaccination
                campaigns. They may refer to the logistic support provided by the
                US military. They may also argue that, fearing Rwandan Patriotic
                Front (RPF) violence, many Hutu found greater protection in
                camps than in Rwanda.
                Candidates may also discuss that camps in Tanzania provided
                better protection than camps in Zaire, as the former had already
                hosted Burundi refugees in 1993; and politics and ethnic divisions
                in Zaire allowed Hutu power leadership to militarize camps.
                Candidates may argue that the outbreak of the First Congo War in
                1996 had a negative impact on conditions in camps.
                Candidates may also evaluate the impact of foreign powers on
                living conditions in the camps. They may refer to the cholera
                epidemic which killed over 50 000 Rwandans at the Goma camp in
                July 1994.
