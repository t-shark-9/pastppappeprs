Apply the markbands that provide the “best fit” to the responses given and award credit wherever it is
possible to do so. If an answer indicates that the demands of the question are understood and
addressed but that not all implications are considered (for example, compare or contrast; reasons
or significance; methods or success), then examiners should not be afraid of using the full range of
marks allowed for by the markscheme. Responses that offer good coverage of some of the criteria
should be rewarded accordingly.

 Marks     Level descriptor

Section 1: Trade and exchange: The Silk Road in the medieval world (750–1500)

1.   “Merchants were the most important factor in connecting east and west along the Silk Road.”
     Discuss.

     The question requires that candidates offer a considered and balanced review of the statement
     that merchants were the most important factor in connecting east and west along the Silk Road.
     There may be explanation of the role of caravanserais and the mutual demand for valuable
     commodities. Candidates may refer to the role of Islamic merchants in spreading their faith into
     Inner Asia; they may also refer to the booming trade links under the Mongols and, later, Timur. Silk
     was available in Italy in the mid-13th century, while Samarkand, under Timur, became a major
     centre of international commerce. Candidates may discuss increased understanding of the east in
     the west, mentioning, for example, Pegolotti’s handbook (1340), and the Polos. Other relevant
     factors may be addressed, for example, the roles of missionaries, diplomats, pilgrims and
     intellectuals, but with a focus on the question. Candidates’ opinions or conclusions will be
     presented clearly and supported by appropriate evidence.


2.   Examine the role of the Silk Road in encouraging the transmission of religious ideas and art.

     The question requires that candidates consider the interrelationship between the Silk Road and the
     transmission of religious ideas and art. Candidates may refer to the spread of Islam, which began
     with the rise of the ‘Abbasids and became the dominant force along the western half of the Silk
     Road: Islamic society fostered trade and there was an Islamic presence in most Chinese ports.
     Candidates may also examine the impact of Christian missionaries, such as the Dominicans in
     Persia, India and western central Asia and the Franciscans in eastern central Asia, Mongolia and
     China. Examples of the transmission of art could include the adoption of Persian styles and Indian
     ikat by Tang weavers, the popularity of Middle Eastern styles in metalwork, the Chinese influence
     on Iraqi miniaturists, and the introduction of cobalt blue into Chinese porcelain manufacture.
     Candidates’ opinions or conclusions will be presented clearly and supported by appropriate
     evidence.
                                                  –5–                  M21/3/HISTX/HP3/ENG/TZ0/OC/M


Section 2: Japan in the Age of the Samurai (1180–1333)

3.   Discuss the causes and the consequences of the Gempei War (1180–1185).

     The question requires that candidates offer a considered and balanced review of the causes and
     the consequences of the Gempei War. They may offer equal coverage of causes and
     consequences, or they may emphasize their discussion of one, but both will be a feature of the
     response. Candidates may identify the rivalry between the Minamoto and Taira clans that predates
     the timeframe, but it must be clearly linked to the issue raised in the question. They may refer to
     the intermarriage between each clan and the imperial family, the Taira’s influence after Emperor
     Takakura’s abdication, and the start of civil war. Candidates may consider consequences such as
     the dominance of the Minamoto, the Kamakura Shogunate, the relationship between emperor and
     shogun, and the rise of the warrior class. Other relevant factors may be addressed, for example,
     the geography of Japan and the feudal system, but with a focus on the issue in the question.
     Candidates’ opinions or conclusions will be presented clearly and supported by appropriate
     evidence.


4.   Evaluate the impact of the Mongol invasions of Japan.

     The question requires that candidates make an appraisal of the impact of the Mongol invasions of
     Japan by weighing up their importance or otherwise regarding political, economic, social or cultural
     outcomes in Japanese society, but these need not all be covered or covered equally. They may
     adopt a chronological approach that contextualises the invasions. Candidates may refer to aspects
     such as the unity of the samurai clans, the changes to Japanese weaponry and to warfare
     strategies and the construction of extra fortifications. They may also identify the creation of a sense
     of nationalism, the rise of a mass following of Zen Buddhism amongst the samurai, changes to
     daily life and the family, and the unpopularity of the additional taxes. Some candidates may focus
     on the immediate aftermath whilst others will extend their appraisal to re-emergence of internal
     political unrest and the fall of the Kamakura Shogunate in 1331. Other relevant factors may be
     addressed, for example, the cultural significance of the kamikaze storms, but with a focus on the
     issue in the question. Candidates’ opinions or conclusions will be presented clearly and supported
     by appropriate evidence.
                                                  –6–                  M21/3/HISTX/HP3/ENG/TZ0/OC/M


Section 3: Exploration, trade and interaction in East Asia and South-East Asia (1405–1700)

5.   Evaluate the political and economic importance to China of the “treasure ships” and the voyages of
     Zheng He.

     The question requires that candidates make an appraisal of the “treasure ships” and the voyages
     of Zheng He by weighing up their political and economic importance or otherwise to China.
     Candidates may offer equal coverage of the political and economic aspects, or they may
     emphasize their evaluation of one, but both will be a feature of the response. Candidates may
     adopt a chronological approach and evaluate each of Zheng He’s seven voyages between 1405
     and 1433. Alternatively, they may refer to the desire to impress foreigners with the wealth of China,
     the expansion of military and diplomatic influence, and the establishment of tributary relationships.
     Candidates may also consider the role of the Yongle Emperor and the division in the imperial court
     about the economic value of Zheng He’s activities. Other relevant factors may be addressed, for
     example acquisition of scientific and geographic knowledge, but with a focus on the issue in the
     question. Candidates’ opinions or conclusions will be presented clearly and supported by
     appropriate evidence.


6.   Compare and contrast the impact of the Spanish and Dutch settlements in East Asia and South-
     East Asia.

     The question requires that candidates give an account of the similarities and differences between
     the impact of the Spanish and Dutch settlements in East Asia and South-East Asia in the given
     timeframe for the section, referring to both throughout. The similarities and differences must be
     clearly indicated, but there does not need to be an equal number of each. Candidates may note
     that the Spanish in the Philippines and the Dutch in the East Indies established settlements at
     different times with different aims. They may adopt a chronological approach and/or they may
     identify the similarities and the differences separately. Candidates may consider an integrated
     approach and refer to the impact of both in areas such as political and bureaucratic structures,
     agriculture and trade, relations with the indigenous population and the level of violence used to
     maintain control, religious and missionary activity, and the lifestyles of the colonial masters. These
     may not all be covered or covered equally. Candidates’ opinions or conclusions will be presented
     clearly and supported by appropriate evidence.
                                                   –7–                 M21/3/HISTX/HP3/ENG/TZ0/OC/M


Section 4: The rise and fall of the Mughal Empire (1526–1712)

7.   “The Mughal Empire was secure by the end of Babur’s reign.” To what extent do you agree with
     this statement?

     The question requires that candidates consider the merits or otherwise of the statement that the
     Mughal Empire was secure by the end of Babur’s reign. Candidates may adopt a chronological
     approach that contextualises Babur’s reign prior to the given timeframe, but this must be clearly
     linked to the issue raised in the question. Candidates may refer to key battles between 1524 and
     1528 and the expansion of Babur’s territory into northern India, and identify that this was the
     beginning of the Mughal Empire, which he ruled until 1530. Candidates may also consider the
     power struggles of his successor, Humayun, who initially lost and then regained territory by 1555,
     to argue that the Mughal Empire was not completely secure by the end of Babur’s reign. Other
     relevant factors may be addressed, for example, diplomatic alliances, religious toleration, cultural
     developments and economic policies, but with a focus on the issue in the question. Candidates’
     opinions or conclusions will be presented clearly and supported by appropriate evidence.


8.   To what extent did the religious and economic policies of Shah Jahan I contribute to instability in
     the Mughal Empire?

     The question requires that candidates consider the merits or otherwise of the suggestion that the
     religious and economic policies of Shah Jahan I contributed to instability in the Mughal Empire.
     Candidates may offer equal coverage of religious and economic policies, or they may emphasize
     their assessment of one, but both aspects will be a feature of the response. They may identify that
     he did not practice religious toleration like his father and grandfather and refer to his imposition of
     Sharia law, the destruction of churches and temples, and the revolts of the Sikhs in the Punjab and
     the Rajput princes. Candidates may also consider the lavish court and building expenditure, which
     led to economic instability and opposition. Other relevant factors may be addressed, for example,
     the bureaucratic nature of his administration, but with a focus on the issue in the question.
     Candidates’ opinions or conclusions will be presented clearly and supported by appropriate
     evidence.
                                                  –8–                 M21/3/HISTX/HP3/ENG/TZ0/OC/M


Section 5: Colonialism and the development of nationalism in South-East Asia (c1750–1914)

9.    Evaluate the economic and social effects of the Liberal Policy introduced in the Dutch East Indies.

      The question requires that candidates make an appraisal of the Liberal Policy introduced in the
      Dutch East Indies, weighing up the importance or otherwise of social and economic effects.
      Candidates may offer equal coverage of social and economic effects, or they may prioritize their
      evaluation of either of them. However, both aspects will be a feature of the response. Candidates
      may evaluate the economic and social consequences of the Agrarian Law (1870) and the Coolie
      Ordinance (1880), which contributed to an injection of private capital and an export boom and the
      establishment of vast tobacco and rubber plantations. However, there were social costs, such as
      forced migration and the displacement of indigenous peoples. Candidates may also evaluate
      developments in infrastructure (such as railways, ports and processing and storage facilities),
      migration into cities, increasing inter-ethnic contact and non-agricultural employment. Candidates’
      opinions or conclusions will be presented clearly and supported by appropriate evidence.


10.   Compare and contrast the contributions of Rizal and Aguinaldo to the development of nationalism
      in the Philippines.

      The question requires that candidates give an account of the similarities and differences between
      the contributions of Rizal and Aguinaldo to the development of nationalism in the Philippines,
      referring to both throughout. There does not need to be an equal mention of each. Both Rizal and
      Aguinaldo are recognized as heroes in the independence struggle, and both either founded or led
      organizations which threatened Spanish rule. Rizal attacked the colonial system through his novels
      and dissociated himself from violence (as shown in the aims of his La Liga Filipina) and yet his
      martyrdom was an inspiration to Bonifacio and the Katipuneros. In contrast, Aguinaldo came to
      nationalism through public office, and then as leader of the Katipunan, who engaged in armed
      conflict, fighting wars against Spain and the US, and formulated the Malolos constitution. It may be
      argued that Rizal’s reputation was undamaged, whereas Aguinaldo, arguably with no option,
      surrendered Filipino independence after defeat in the American War. Candidates’ opinions or
      conclusions will be presented clearly and supported by appropriate evidence.
                                                    –9–                  M21/3/HISTX/HP3/ENG/TZ0/OC/M


Section 6: India, Afghanistan and Burma (1750–1919)

11.   Discuss the reasons for the expansion of the British East India Company in the Indian subcontinent
      up to the end of the Anglo-Maratha Wars.

      The question requires that candidates offer a considered and balanced review of the reasons for
      the expansion of the British East India Company in the Indian subcontinent up to the end of the
      Anglo-Maratha Wars. Reasons, such as European rivalries, may predate the timeframe, but they
      must be clearly linked to the issue raised in the question. Candidates may refer to the Battle of
      Plassey, the Anglo-Mysore Wars and the Anglo-Maratha Wars, and the end result of the East India
      Company gaining control of most of India. They may identify that factors such as strategic
      interests; the Industrial Revolution in Britain; and demands for tea, cotton, silk, indigo, saltpetre and
      opium all created the desire for a monopoly of trade and markets. Other relevant factors may be
      addressed, for example, the activities of individuals such as Robert Clive and Warren Hastings
      may be considered, but with a focus on the issue in the question. Candidates’ opinions or
      conclusions will be presented clearly and supported by appropriate evidence.


12.   Evaluate the reasons for the growth of national consciousness in India up to the end of the First
      World War.

      The question requires that candidates make an appraisal of the reasons for the growth of national
      consciousness in India up to the end of the First World War by weighing up the importance or
      otherwise of various political, economic, social and cultural factors. These need not all be covered
      or covered equally. They may adopt a chronological approach that contextualises events beginning
      in the mid-19th century or in the early 20th century. Candidates may refer to the role of political
      organizations such as the Indian National Congress, the All India Muslim League and the Home
      Rule Leagues, and the growing demands for self-government, including the 1916 Lucknow Pact.
      Some candidates may also evaluate the contributions of individuals such as Gokhale, Tilak and
      Besant. Other relevant factors may be addressed, for example, the British divide and rule policies
      and the impact of the First World War, but with a focus on the issue in the question. Candidates’
      opinions or conclusions will be presented clearly and supported by appropriate evidence.
                                                  – 10 –               M21/3/HISTX/HP3/ENG/TZ0/OC/M


Section 7: Challenges to traditional East Asian societies (1700–1868)

13.   Evaluate the reasons why western trade missions failed to change the Chinese tribute system.

      The question requires that candidates make an appraisal of the reasons why western trade
      missions failed to change the Chinese tribute system, weighing up their importance or otherwise.
      Candidates may offer equal coverage of western trade missions and the tribute system, or they
      may prioritize their evaluation of one of them. However, both aspects must be a feature of the
      response. There may be evaluation of the importance of the tribute system to the emperors, who
      regarded trade as a privilege to be granted, and not a right. The tributary system conferred status
      and benefits both for the emperor and the tributaries. Candidates may argue that the western
      missions failed because of British reluctance to perform the kowtow. There were also worsening
      relations over, for example, British actions in Nepal and Macao. The growth of trade outside the
      tributary system lessened the need for change. Candidates’ opinions or conclusions will be
      presented clearly and supported by appropriate evidence.


14.   Evaluate the political and economic reasons for the crisis of the Bakumatsu period (1853–1868) in
      Japan.

      The question requires that candidates make an appraisal of the political and economic reasons for
      the crisis of the Bakumatsu period in Japan, weighing up their importance or otherwise. Candidates
      may offer equal coverage of political and economic reasons, or they may prioritize their evaluation
      of one of them. However, both aspects must be a feature of the response. Political reasons could
      include the lack of political representation of the emergent merchant class, the political impact of
      Commodore Perry’s visits and subsequent treaties and weak leadership during the crisis of 1857–
      1863. Economic reasons could include the impact of drought and population increase on formerly
      prosperous peasants and the samurai, and the impact of unequal trade treaties. It may be argued
      that the frustrated daimyo were supported by social classes who were suffering economically,
      showing how political and economic reasons were combined. Candidates’ opinions or conclusions
      will be presented clearly and supported by appropriate evidence.
                                                  – 11 –               M21/3/HISTX/HP3/ENG/TZ0/OC/M


Section 8: British colonialism and emerging national identities in Oceania (1788–1919)

15.   Discuss the aims and effectiveness of the Treaty of Waitangi (1840).

      The question requires that candidates offer a considered and balanced review of the aims and
      effectiveness of the Treaty of Waitangi. They may offer equal coverage of aims and effectiveness,
      or they may emphasize their discussion of one, but both aspects will be a feature of the response.
      Candidates may identify aims such as British sovereignty over the land and giving the Maori status
      as British subjects with some land rights. Candidates may argue there are various interpretations
      of the treaty. They may consider that the effectiveness of the treaty was limited and refer to
      methods used by settlers to acquire Maori crown land, the Maori Wars between 1845 and 1872,
      the 1863 Settlements Act, and the Public Works Acts of 1864 and 1876. Other relevant factors may
      be addressed, for example, the Maori political exclusion nationally until the 20th century, but with a
      focus on the issue in the question. Candidates’ opinions or conclusions will be presented clearly
      and supported by appropriate evidence.


16.   Discuss the factors that led to the growth of cities in Australia and New Zealand before the First
      World War.

      The question requires that candidates offer a considered and balanced review of the factors that
      led to the growth of cities in Australia and New Zealand before the First World War. They may offer
      equal coverage of the two countries or they may emphasize their discussion of one, but both will
      be a feature of the response. Candidates may outline urbanization in each separately or they may
      integrate material and discuss political, economic, social and cultural aspects, but these need not
      all be covered or covered equally. They may refer to settlement plans, gold rushes, trade unionism
      and industrialization. Candidates may identify that cities appealed to immigrants, because they
      replicated provincial cities in Britain, were commercial and cultural centres, developed pleasant
      suburbs, and housed the growing working class. Other relevant factors may be addressed, for
      example, welfare legislation in the early 20th century, but with a focus on the issue in the question.
      Candidates’ opinions or conclusions will be presented clearly and supported by appropriate
      evidence.

Section 9: Early modernization and imperial decline in East Asia (1860–1912)

17.   To what extent was Prince Gong successful in reforming and modernizing China?

      The question requires that candidates consider the merits or otherwise of the suggestion that
      Prince Gong was successful in reforming and modernizing China. They may contextualize Gong
      within the Tongzhi Restoration and Self-Strengthening Movement. Candidates may refer to his
      creation of the Zongli Yamen and the Tongwenguan, and his support for sending educational
      missions abroad. They may also identify that he encouraged new approaches to military training,
      the manufacture of western-style weapons and reform of the navy. Candidates may also consider
      Gong’s relationship with Cixi, with whom he fell out of favour in 1865, 1874 and 1884 and the effect
      on his power and influence. These need not all be covered or covered equally. Other relevant
      factors may be addressed, for example candidates may balance Gong’s contribution against those
      of other reformers, but with a focus on the issue in the question. Candidates’ opinions or
      conclusions will be presented clearly and supported by appropriate evidence.


18.   Evaluate the impact of the 1889 Constitution on Japan.

      The question requires that candidates make an appraisal of the impact of the 1889 Constitution on
      Japan by weighing up its importance or otherwise regarding political, economic, military, social or
      cultural outcomes, but these need not all be covered or covered equally. They may contextualize
      the 1889 Constitution within the reforms of the Meiji period. Candidates may refer to it being mainly
      based on the German model with the emperor retaining a veto, supreme command of the military,
      and some judicial powers. Candidates may identify that this limited constitutional monarchy had a
      small electorate and, consequently, considerable power remained with the genro. They may also
      consider its impact with regard to civil rights and dissent as well as the resurgence of militarism in
      the 1890s and beyond. Other relevant factors may be addressed, for example Japanese
      expansionism in the early 20th century, but with a focus on the issue in the question. Candidates’
      opinions or conclusions will be presented clearly and supported by appropriate evidence.

Section 10: Nationalism and independence in India (1919–1964)

19.   Discuss the reasons for, and the impact of, the Quit India campaign (1942) on the struggle for
      independence.

      The question requires that candidates offer a considered and balanced review of the reasons for,
      and the impact of, the Quit India campaign (1942) on the struggle for independence. They may
      offer equal coverage of reasons and impact, or they may emphasize their discussion of one, but
      both will be a feature of the response. For reasons, candidates may refer to aspects such as the
      legacy of previous non-cooperation campaigns; the impact of the Salt March and the emergence of
      a mass movement; the dissatisfaction of Congress and many Indian nationalists with the 1935
      Government of India Act; the pressures of the Second World War and the failure of the Cripps
      Mission to achieve constitutional reform and gain Congress support. They may identify different
      perspectives about Quit India’s impact such as the view is that it influenced Wavell’s decisions or
      that it exacerbated the divide between Congress and the League, which led to partition. Other
      relevant factors may be addressed, for example, the roles of individuals such as Gandhi, Nehru
      and Jinnah, but with a focus on the issue in the question. Candidates’ opinions or conclusions will
      be presented clearly and supported by appropriate evidence.


20.   Evaluate the factors that led to Kashmir becoming part of post-independence India.

      The question requires that candidates make an appraisal of the factors that led to Kashmir
      becoming part of post-independence India by weighing up their importance or otherwise in the
      context of the partition of the South Asian subcontinent in 1947. Candidates may refer to events
      both before and after partition, but these must be clearly linked to the issue raised in the question.
      Candidates may identify the choice offered to the princely states of joining Pakistan or India,
      religious diversity in Kashmir, geographic pressures, the Maharajah’s desire to remain neutral, and
      economic pressure applied by Pakistan. They may also consider that border skirmishes with
      Pakistan continued throughout 1948 and the Maharajah asked for Indian military assistance, which
      was not given until he signed an accession to India document. Other relevant factors may be
      addressed, for example, the Indo-Pakistani Wars in 1965 and 1971, but with a focus on the issue
      in the question. Candidates’ opinions or conclusions will be presented clearly and supported by
      appropriate evidence.

Section 11: Japan (1912–1990)

21.   Discuss the impact of the growth of liberal values and the two-party system during the Taisho
      democracy.

      The question requires that candidates offer a considered and balanced review of the impact of the
      growth of liberal values and the two-party system during the Taisho democracy. Candidates may
      offer equal coverage of the growth of liberal values and the two-party system, or they prioritize their
      discussion of one of them. However, both aspects will be a feature of the response. They may
      discuss the halting emergence of the two-party system as a result of the vagueness of the Meiji
      Constitution and the continued power and/or influence of the emperor, the military, the oligarchs
      and the privy council. During 1924–1932 the two-party system was at its height, when universal
      male suffrage was established, and there was limited progress for the rights of women and labour.
      Liberal values could not withstand the economic and military challenges of the early 1930s.
      Candidates’ opinions or conclusions will be presented clearly and supported by appropriate
      evidence.


22.   Evaluate the reasons for, and the results of, Japan’s signing of the Three Party/Tripartite Pact
      (1940).

      The question requires that the candidates make an appraisal of the reasons for, and results of,
      Japan’s signing of the Three party/Tripartite Pact, weighing up their importance, or otherwise.
      Candidates may offer equal coverage of reasons and results, or they may prioritize one or the
      other. However, both aspects will be a feature of the response. Candidates may evaluate Japan’s
      need for allies, as progress in the Chinese campaign was slow and draining Japan’s resources.
      Candidates may evaluate the shared ideology between the three powers and how the Axis powers
      were potentially sympathetic to the Japanese cause. The Pact was a victory for the pro-Axis lobby
      in Tokyo, and it was hoped that Japan would gain support in expanding into South-East Asia.
      However, candidates may argue that although Japan was able to station troops in Indo-China, the
      US was provoked into imposing a damaging trade embargo, and that little military benefit was
      derived. As a result of the trade embargo, Japan looked to the Dutch East Indies for oil and, to
      ensure success there, the Japanese took the decision to go on the offensive and attacked the US
      naval base at Pearl Harbor in December 1941. Candidates may therefore argue that a result of the
      Tripartite Pact was war in the Pacific and Japan’s eventual defeat. Candidates’ opinions or
      conclusions will be presented clearly and supported by appropriate evidence.
                                                   – 15 –                M21/3/HISTX/HP3/ENG/TZ0/OC/M


Section 12: China and Korea (1910–1950)

23.   Compare and contrast the contributions of Yuan Shikai and Sun Yixian to the rise of national
      identity in China.

      The question requires that candidates give an account of the similarities and differences between
      the contributions of Yuan Shikai and Sun Yixian to national identity in China, referring to both
      throughout. There does not need to be equal coverage of both. It may be argued that both leaders
      contributed to the rise of national identity but in very different ways. Yuan Shikai’s actions may
      include a consideration of his banning of the GMD, closing the National Assembly, accepting the
      21 Demands and proclaiming himself emperor. By undermining the new republic in this way, Yuan
      united people against him and towards the concepts of national unity, democracy and
      modernisation. In contrast, Sun is regarded as ‘the father of modern China’. He founded the
      Guomindang in 1894 and set out an ideological vision for China through his Three Principles of the
      People. Following his return to leadership of China, Sun agreed to the Sun-Joffe Agreement in
      1923. As a result of this agreement the GMD began the process of forming a United Front with the
      CCP with the aim of destroying the warlords and finally uniting China. Candidates’ opinions or
      conclusions will be presented clearly and supported by appropriate evidence.


24.   “Political factors were more important than military factors in the communist victory in the Chinese
      Civil War (1946–1949).” Discuss.

      The question requires that candidates offer a considered and balanced review of the statement
      that political factors were more important than military factors in the communist victory in the
      Chinese Civil War (1946–1949). There does not need to be equal coverage of both military and
      political factors. Candidates may refer to the earlier phases of the civil war in their response
      however, they should also consider how the events of 1946-9 led to a communist victory. Political
      factors may include a discussion of how Jiang Jieshi was regarded by many as an agent of the
      West who accepted billions of dollars from the US. Jiang was also perceived as a corrupt and cruel
      leader who had done little to ease the suffering of the peasants during the Nanjing Decade and
      had abandoned his people throughout the Sino-Japanese War. Therefore, candidates may argue
      that there were high desertion rates amongst the Nationalist ranks and considerably more peasant
      support for the communists. This peasant support enabled the communists to use guerrilla tactics
      successfully in the earlier part of the conflict. Military factors may also include reference to the CCP
      gaining control of Manchuria following Japan’s defeat. Candidates may also discuss how the
      nature of fighting changed during the years 1946-9 as the CCP’s increasing strength meant they
      were able to face the GMD in conventional battles, such as the Battle of Shangcai. Candidates’
      opinions or conclusions will be presented clearly and supported by appropriate evidence.
                                                  – 16 –              M21/3/HISTX/HP3/ENG/TZ0/OC/M


Section 13: Impact of the Second World War on South-East Asia

25.   “Japanese occupation had a negative impact.” Discuss with reference to two South-East Asian
      countries.

      The question requires that candidates offer a considered and balanced review of the statement
      that Japanese occupation had a negative impact. Candidates may offer equal coverage of two
      countries, or they may prioritize their discussion of one of them. However, both countries will be a
      feature of the response. Korea, Japan and China are not valid options. Topics for discussion could
      include the treatment of the Chinese populations in, for example, Malaya and Vietnam; policies
      towards censorship and freedom of speech; economic exploitation and the suppression of
      resistance movements. There may be discussion of the deportation of labour from, for example,
      Indonesia, and the use of “comfort women” in, for example, the Philippines and Indonesia. Positive
      impacts to balance the discussion could include the boosting of nationalism intentionally in
      Indonesia and unintentionally in the Philippines. Candidates’ opinions or conclusions will be
      presented clearly and supported by appropriate evidence.


26.   “Sukarno’s leadership was the most important factor in Indonesia gaining its independence in
      1949.” Discuss.

      The question requires that candidates offer a considered and balanced review of the statement
      that the leadership of Sukarno was the most important reason for Indonesia gaining its
      independence. Candidates may refer to the Sukarno’s role in founding the first pro-independence
      party and his leadership of the Partindo. They may discuss his role during the Second World War,
      including his collaboration with the Japanese and campaigns for independence; his negotiation of a
      constitution despite factional rivalry; and his leadership of the struggle against the Dutch after
      1945. Other relevant factors may be addressed, such as the contributions of other leaders such as
      Hatta, Soedirman and Nasution, the Japanese encouragement of nationalism, the harsh tactics of
      the Dutch during the independence struggle and international pressure, especially US threats to
      withhold Marshall Aid. However, the focus will be in the issue in the question. Candidates’ opinions
      or conclusions will be presented clearly and supported by appropriate evidence.
                                                  – 17 –               M21/3/HISTX/HP3/ENG/TZ0/OC/M


Section 14: The People’s Republic of China (1949–2005)

27.   “Land reform was the most important factor in the consolidation of the communist state
      (1949–1961).” To what extent do you agree with this statement?

      The question requires that candidates consider the merits or otherwise of the statement that land
      reform was the most important factor in the consolidation of the communist state (1949–1961).
      Candidates may refer to the importance of land reform to the peasantry, whose expectations had
      been raised by the Communist Party’s policies during the Civil War. There may be consideration of
      the extent of land reform, and the role of Speak Bitterness meetings in inspiring peasant support,
      while also destroying the landlord class. Candidates may also consider the impact of
      collectivisation and the establishment of communes during the Great Leap Forward. Other relevant
      factors may be addressed, for example, economic stabilization and growth (1949–1955), other
      campaigns of mass mobilization, gaining direct control of Tibet, surveillance, and the elimination of
      opponents. However, the focus will be on the issue in the question. Candidates’ opinions or
      conclusions will be presented clearly and supported by appropriate evidence.


28.   Evaluate the extent of China’s regional and global power between 1949 and 1976.

      The question requires that candidates make an appraisal of Chinese regional and global power
      between 1949 and 1976, weighing up its strengths and limitations. Candidates may offer equal
      coverage of regional and global power, or they may prioritize coverage of one or the other. There
      may be instances where regional and global power combine. However, both aspects will be a
      feature of the response. Candidates may evaluate the Chinese role in Korea, which promoted both
      regional and global power; they may evaluate relations with the US, from relative weakness with
      regard to Taiwan to rapprochement under Nixon; they may evaluate Russian relations, from the
      1950 agreement through to the Sino-Soviet split. They may also evaluate China’s relations with
      India, and its involvement in Vietnam. Candidates may evaluate Chinese military capability, its
      acquisition of the nuclear bomb, and its entry into the United Nations. Candidates’ opinions or
      conclusions will be presented clearly and supported by appropriate evidence.

Section 15: Cold War conflicts in Asia

29.   “The Malayan Emergency (1948–1960) was resolved because the colonial government had
      popular support.” Discuss.

      The question requires that candidates offer a considered and balanced review of the statement
      that the Malayan Emergency (1948–1960) was resolved because the colonial government had
      popular support. Candidates may discuss the counter-productive Briggs Plan, which, while
      including improved health care and education in the New Villages, also involved forced
      deportation, mass arrests and harsh curfews. They may contrast such measures with Templar’s
      “hearts and minds” campaign which improved community relations (promoted by Templar’s
      numerous visits to the New Villages), and was supported by effective propaganda and the
      establishment of law and order. Security measures were softened. Other relevant factors may be
      addressed, for example, military tactics which involved close air support, search and destroy
      missions and the efficient coordination of the war effort by the War Executive Committee. However,
      there will be a focus on the issue in the question. Candidates’ opinions or conclusions will be
      presented clearly and supported by appropriate evidence.


30.   To what extent did the failures of Sihanouk’s rule lead to the rise of the Khmer Rouge in
      Cambodia?

      The question requires that candidates consider the merits or otherwise of the suggestion that the
      failures of Sihanouk’s rule led to the rise of the Khmer Rouge in Cambodia. Candidates may refer
      to Sihanouk’s failure to establish a proper democracy which could have insulated Cambodia
      against extremist take-over. Instead, he killed and imprisoned opponents, and was faced by an
      attempted coup (1957) and insurrection (1967). His inconsistent foreign policy meant that
      Cambodia had no secure alliances and he could not prevent the US bombing in 1969. There may
      be reference to the mixed results of Sihanouk’s economic policy, which failed to achieve
      diversification, despite significant development of the infrastructure, and to corruption. Other
      relevant factors may be addressed, for example the instability of neighbouring countries and the
      leadership qualities and strategies of Pol Pot, but with a focus on the issue in the question.
      Candidates’ opinions or conclusions will be presented clearly and supported by appropriate
      evidence.

Section 16: Developments and challenges in South Asia after 1947

31.   To what extent was Rajiv Gandhi successful in dealing with the social and political challenges in
      India?

      The question requires that candidates consider the merits or otherwise of the suggestion that Rajiv
      Gandhi was successful in dealing with the social and political challenges in India. Candidates may
      offer equal coverage of social and political, or they may emphasize their assessment of one, but
      both aspects will be a feature of the response. Candidates may refer to him becoming prime
      minister after his mother’s assassination and his subsequent landslide election victory. They may
      identify his social successes with regard to the expansion of education; the support for women in
      modifying the dowry laws and in encouraging the vocational training of girls; the recognition of
      Muslim and Sikh issues; but the negative effects of the Shah Bano divorce rulings may also be
      considered. Candidates may identify his political successes to include international relations and
      the anti-defection law, but they may also look at controversial aspects such as the martial law in
      the Punjab, the Bofors scandal and his handling of the Bhopal disaster. Other relevant factors may
      be addressed, for example, Indian involvement in Sri Lanka, but with a focus on the issue in the
      question. Candidates’ opinions or conclusions will be presented clearly and supported by
      appropriate evidence.


32.   Evaluate the reasons why Benazir Bhutto’s first government ended in 1990.

      The question requires that candidates make an appraisal of the reasons why Benazir Bhutto’s first
      government ended in 1990 by weighing up the importance or otherwise of various political,
      economic, social and cultural factors. These need not all be covered or covered equally.
      Candidates may contextualize this government within the framework of Pakistani politics and
      consider long-term reasons as well as events during her prime ministership. They may refer to
      rising inflation and high unemployment, the inability to fulfil the election promises, the increase in
      crime and the drug trade, corruption, and the deterioration of relations with the civil service.
      Candidates may also consider opposition to her within her own party and that her government did
      not pass any major legislation. Other relevant factors may be addressed, for example, the
      dismissal by President Khan and the 1990 election, but with a focus on the issue in the question.
      Candidates’ opinions or conclusions will be presented clearly and supported by appropriate
      evidence.

Section 17: Developments in Oceania after the Second World War (1945–2005)

33.   Discuss the policies and achievements of the Chifley government.

      The question requires that candidates offer a considered and balanced review of the policies and
      achievements of the Chifley government. They may identify that initially Chifley’s policies, such as
      the reformed tax system, the extension of manufacturing and industry, wage regulation, petrol
      rationing and social service benefits were a continuation of those under Curtin. They may refer to
      Chifley’s unsuccessful attempts to extend Commonwealth powers and to nationalize the banks.
      Candidates may identify achievements such as the Snowy Mountain Hydroelectric Scheme; the
      production of Holden cars; the immigration policy; the introduction of Australian citizenship; the
      expansion of university education; a national airline; and the Commonwealth Scientific and
      Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO). Other relevant factors may be addressed, for example,
      trade unions and foreign relations, but with a focus on the issue in the question. Candidates’
      opinions or conclusions will be presented clearly and supported by appropriate evidence.


34.   Evaluate the impact of Britain joining the EEC (later European Union) on Australia and New
      Zealand.

      The question requires that candidates make an appraisal of the impact of Britain joining the EEC
      on Australia and New Zealand by weighing up the importance or otherwise of domestic and foreign
      policy outcomes, but these need not be both covered or covered equally. They may refer to the
      reduction of trade with Britain, the import and export imbalance, and the economic difficulties of
      high unemployment and inflation. Candidates may identify that it caused them to turn to East and
      South-East Asia in search of economic partners. They may also consider that both countries
      increased their support for developing nations in the region with military and economic aid and
      expertise, and were involved in the Colombo Plan, ASEAN and the South Pacific Forum (later the
      Pacific Island Forum). Other relevant factors may be addressed, for example, their continued
      membership of the Commonwealth, but with a focus on the issue in the question. Candidates’
      opinions or conclusions will be presented clearly and supported by appropriate evidence.

Section 18: Social, cultural and economic developments in Asia (excluding China, Japan and
            India) (1980–2005)

35.   With reference to two countries (excluding China, Japan and India), examine the extent of
      changes in traditional arts and culture.

      The question requires that candidates consider the extent of changes in traditional arts and culture.
      Candidates may offer equal coverage of their chosen countries, or they may prioritize their
      examination of one or the other. However, both countries will be a feature of the response.
      Oceanic countries are not acceptable choices and examples may not be taken from the period
      after 2005. Arts and culture will not necessarily be discrete categories. Candidates may explore
      traditional forms of dance and musical expression, belief systems and religion. They may examine
      tangible cultural expressions such as drawings, designs, pottery, woodwork, metalwork, jewellery,
      glassware, carpets and architecture. They may examine traditional languages and oral tradition.
      Candidates are likely to examine the degree to which traditional arts and culture have had to adapt
      to social, economic and political change. Candidates’ opinions or conclusions will be presented
      clearly and supported by appropriate evidence.


36.   With reference to two countries (excluding China, Japan and India), evaluate the effect of
      globalization on standards of living.

      The question requires that candidates make an appraisal of the effect of globalization on two
      countries. Candidates may offer equal coverage of their chosen countries, or they may prioritize
      their examination of one or the other. However, both countries will be a feature of the response.
      Oceanic countries are not acceptable choices and examples may not be taken from the period
      after 2005. Candidates will need to demonstrate an understanding of how standards of living may
      be measured, perhaps in terms of real income and enjoyment of consumer goods. Countries
      where the economy has a strong financial sector may have experienced a different impact from
      those which are agriculturally based. Globalization may have benefited industrial workers, where
      their products had access to new markets. Globalization may have altered the balance between
      economic sectors, and have promoted the growth of a middle class. Candidates’ opinions or
      conclusions will be presented clearly and supported by appropriate evidence.
