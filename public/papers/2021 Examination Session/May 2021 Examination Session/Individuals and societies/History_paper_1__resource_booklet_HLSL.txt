Prescribed subject 1: Military leaders

Read sources A to D and answer questions 1 to 4. The sources and questions relate to case study 2:
Richard I of England (1173–1199) — Impact: social, cultural and religious impact: anti‑Jewish violence.


Source A                John Gillingham, an historian specializing in medieval history, writing in the
                        academic book Richard I (2002).

While celebrations went on inside the palace, a riot developed outside. Some Jews, bringing gifts for
the new king, had tried to enter, but the Christian crowd at the gates would not allow it. They fell upon
the Jews, killing some and wounding others. The trouble then spread to the city of London, where it
continued throughout the night. Jews were killed, their houses robbed and burned down. Next day,
Richard had some of the rioters arrested, three of them hanged. A Jew who in fear of his life had agreed
to be baptized a Christian, Richard encouraged him to return to his religion. The king sent letters to every
region ordering that the Jews should be left in peace … Despite his efforts, there were more anti‑Jewish
riots in the next few months at Lynn, Norwich, Lincoln and Stamford. This wave of popular anti‑Semitism
[anti‑Jewish feelings] reached its height at York in March 1190, by which time Richard had already left
the country.

In the year 1190, a group of knights attacked the Jews, in the city of York, on the Great Sabbath [before
Passover]. The Jews fled to the house of prayer. Here Rabbi Yomtob stood and slaughtered sixty souls,
and others were also killed. Some there commanded that they should slaughter their only sons. The
number of those killed and burned was one hundred and fifty souls, men and women. Their houses also
the knights destroyed, stole their gold and silver and many splendid books, precious as gold. These they
brought to Cologne and to other places, where they sold them to the Jews.

Prescribed subject 2: Conquest and its impact
Read sources E to H and answer questions 5 to 8. The sources and questions relate to case study 2:
The conquest of Mexico and Peru (1519–1551) — Context and motives: political and economic motives
for exploration and conquest.
Source E                R. Hassig, an American anthropologist specializing in Aztec history, writing in the
                        academic book Mexico and the Spanish Conquest (2006).
Spain’s expansion was part of a general European pattern that emerged after the economic and social
crisis following the massive depopulation in the fourteenth century. But Europe also felt threatened by
Muslims to the south and Ottoman Turks to the east, and much of its expansion—made possible by
naval technological advances—was dictated ideologically and guided geographically by these concerns.
Along with other Europeans, Spaniards ventured into foreign lands, driven by the zealotry [fanaticism]
of the Church but also encouraged by the lure [appeal] of greater trade, new territory, and subject
[conquered] population. Thus, when Spaniards moved into the Americas, they brought with them the
powerful legacy of their expansionary experience, which was to influence their relations with the Indians.
The men who reached Mexico had already participated in the earliest Spanish exploration of what was
to them the New World, and they built on their experiences of conquering and colonizing Arab Spain and
the Canary Islands. Spanish expansion beyond Iberia was primarily economic in motivation …
Religious justifications marked much of the expansion into Mexico, as it had the Reconquista. The
Spaniards used essentially the same ideology in the conquest of native populations as they had against
the Muslims during the Reconquista. The conquest of Mexico, however, was primarily a political and
military affair.

                       Abbreviated, of the Destruction of the Indies (1542).

The cause for which the Christians have slain [killed] and destroyed so many and such infinite numbers
of souls, has been simply to get, as their ultimate end [main goal], the Indians’ gold. To stuff themselves
with riches in a very few days and to raise themselves to high estates [status] without proportion to
[regardless of] their birth or breeding, owing to the greed and ambition that they have had, which has
been greater than any the world has ever seen before … All the Indians of all the Indies never once did
aught [any] hurt or wrong to Christians, but rather held them to be descended from heaven, from the sky,
until many times they or their neighbours received from the Christians many acts of wrongful harm, theft,
murder and violence.

Prescribed subject 3: The move to global war
Read sources I to L and answer questions 9 to 12. The sources and questions relate to case study 2:
German and Italian expansion (1933–1940) — Causes of expansion: impact of Fascism and Nazism on
the foreign policies of Italy and Germany.

Source I                  Benito Mussolini, Italian Prime Minister, in a speech delivered during a state visit
                          to Germany (29 September 1937).

Fascism and Nazism express the parallel historical situations which link the life of our nations …

The Rome–Berlin Axis is not directed at other states, because we, Nazis and Fascists alike, want peace
and are always ready to work for a real fruitful [productive] peace which does not ignore but resolves the
problems of the coexistence of peoples …

Not only have Nazism and Fascism everywhere the same enemies who serve the same masters, the
Third International, but they share many conceptions of life and history. Both believe in violence as a
force determining the life of peoples, as a dynamo [driving force] of their history, and hence reject the
doctrines of the so-called historical materialism and their political and philosophical by-products. Both of
us exalt at [glorify] work in its countless manifestations as the sign of nobility of man; both of us count on
youth, from which we demand the virtues of discipline, courage, tenacity and patriotism.

Source L                Reynolds M Salerno, an historian specializing in international history, writing
                        in the book Vital Crossroads: Mediterranean Origins of the Second World War,
                        1935–1940 (2002).

Hitler’s determination to rearm and to revise the terms of [the Treaty of] Versailles inspired Mussolini
to revitalize Fascist foreign policy and to reconsider his strategy for imperial expansion. He wanted to
integrate Fascist Italy’s ideological motives with its strategic objectives. Although Fascist Italy retained its
strategic and economic interests in southern and east-central Europe, Mussolini increasingly appreciated
that an extensive Italian empire in the greater Mediterranean region could exist alongside a German-
dominated continent but would directly conflict with British and French vital interests. The possibility
of becoming a strategic and ideological partner with Nazi Germany, which could challenge Britain and
France to the north and help Italy achieve its imperial ambitions to the south, steadily encouraged
Mussolini …

As Nazi Germany had influenced Fascist foreign policy, Italy’s Mediterranean ambitions motivated a
reconsideration of German strategy. The basis of Hitler’s foreign policy was the concept of a central
European economic bloc with Germany at its core. Mussolini’s Mediterranean ambitions and willingness
to challenge Britain and France worked to Germany’s strategic advantage: an Anglo-French-Italian
tension or conflict in the Mediterranean would facilitate Germany’s military conquest of Central and
Eastern Europe. For this strategic reason as well as the close ideological affinities [connections] between
German National Socialism and Italian Fascism, Hitler supported and demonstrated extraordinary loyalty
to Mussolini before and during the war.

Prescribed subject 4: Rights and protest

Read sources M to P and answer questions 13 to 16. The sources and questions relate to case study 1:
Civil rights movement in the United States (1954–1965) — The role and significance of key actors/
groups: key groups: National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP); Southern
Christian Leadership Conference (SCLC) and Student Non-violent Coordinating Committee (SNCC); the

                        Committee (SNCC), revised 29 April 1962.

We affirm [state] the philosophical or religious ideal of nonviolence as the foundation of our purpose …
Through nonviolence, courage displaces fear; love transforms hate. Acceptance dissipates [banishes]
prejudice; hope ends despair. Peace dominates war; faith reconciles doubt. Mutual respect cancels
hatred. Justice for all overcomes injustice …
Love is the central theme of nonviolence. Love is the force by which God binds man to himself and man
to man. Such love goes to the extreme; it remains loving and forgiving even in the midst of hostility. It
matches the capacity of evil to inflict suffering with an even more enduring capacity to absorb evil, all the
while persisting in love …
Nonviolence nurtures [encourages] the atmosphere in which reconciliation and justice become actual
possibilities.

                        Rights Movement (1990).

King urged Negroes to sacrifice, to go to jail if necessary, not to defeat whites but to free all Montgomery
from injustice … Gradually he accepted absolute nonviolence as the spiritual foundation on which to
build any movement for justice. After discussions with his wife he rescinded [withdrew] an application
for a gun permit and dismissed the volunteers guarding his home, despite dozens of death threats
against him and his family. When a bomb narrowly missed killing his wife and children, in January 1956,
King upheld his faith in nonviolence by dispersing a mob that had gathered outside the remains of his
dynamited front porch. Hurrying home after the blast, he arrived in time to hear a Negro provoke a
policeman, “Now you got your .38 [gun] and I got mine; so let’s battle it out.” Fearing an imminent race
riot, King told the armed and angry mob that there was a higher way: “We must love our white brothers
no matter what they do to us. We must make them know that we love them.” To the astonished relief of
white onlookers, King’s Negro listeners quietly returned to their homes … The [Montgomery bus] boycott
lasted nearly a year … Late in December 1956, blacks boarded the buses in Montgomery as peacefully
as possible, in accordance with the instructions of boycott leaders. Several whites took seats beside
Negroes, and there was little violence.


Source P                Steve Estes, an historian writing in the academic book I Am a Man! Race,
                        Manhood, and the Civil Rights Movement (2005).

Nation of Islam members and ministers called civil rights leaders unmanly cowards, in large part
because of their allegiance to the philosophy of nonviolence. Discussing the student sit-ins that swept
across the South in 1960 and inspired the formation of the Student Non-violent Coordinating Committee
(SNCC), Malcolm X told reporters, “Anybody can sit. An old woman can sit. A coward can sit … It takes a
man to stand.” Likewise, when Martin Luther King led a nonviolent civil rights campaign in Birmingham,
Alabama, Malcolm questioned his recruitment of women and children for marches. “Real men don’t put
their children on the firing line.” …

More to Malcolm’s liking were southern rebels who recommended armed self-defence. Like these men,
Malcolm and other ministers in the Nation articulated [voiced] their support for self-defence in terms of
protecting womanhood. “You’ve got Ku Klux Klan (KKK) members knocking Black women down in front
of a camera and that poor Black man standing on the sidelines because he’s nonviolent,” Malcolm said,
scolding those who responded peacefully …

Malcolm and King were both “God’s angry men,” but the two charismatic ministers were far apart
philosophically. King’s faith in Christian love and nonviolent protest seemed unstoppable. This
contrasted dramatically with Malcolm’s equally passionate faith in complete racial separation and the
Nation of Islam.

Prescribed subject 5: Conflict and intervention

Read sources Q to T and answer questions 17 to 20. The sources and questions relate to case study 1:
Rwanda (1990–1998) — Impact: social impact; refugee crisis.


Source Q               Philippe Lamair, a Belgian journalist specializing in international politics, writing
                       in the article “Cooperation crucial in Rwanda crisis” for the UNHCR’s Refugees
                       Magazine (September 1994).
On 28 April 1994, some 250 000 Rwandese flooded into Tanzania in one single human wave—at the
time, it was the biggest and fastest refugee movement the United Nations High Commissioner for
Refugees (UNHCR) had ever witnessed …
Jacques Franquin, coordinator of UNHCR activities in Ngara, Tanzania remembers his initial reaction
was to call his non-governmental organization (NGO) colleagues. “I rushed to my radio and called
Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) to quickly send us reinforcements, supplies and, above all, a water
provision specialist. MSF worked all night in Benaco (a refugee camp in Tanzania) to provide a minimum
of drinking water to the refugees.”
Thanks to constant cooperation from NGOs, UNHCR managed to cope with the arrival of this human tide
and saved many lives.
“The cooperation between UNHCR and the NGOs in this emergency situation was almost perfect,” said
Franquin …
More than 15 NGOs work at the Benaco site. Each one is part of a complex project managed by the
UNHCR, and each one has its speciality …
Despite the early successes, the battle has not yet been won. Big problems are an everyday fact of life
here. Just to avoid starvation, some 200 tons of food must be shipped to Benaco each and every day …
Add to that the problems of hygiene, the prevention of epidemics, the search for new sources of water,
and the security problems inevitable in a population of hundreds of thousands of refugees …
So the work goes on, day by day, problem by problem. So far, UNHCR and its NGO partners have
exceeded expectation.

The Hutu power structure ruled unchallenged in the camps … The very men who had organized and
carried out the genocide were in charge of most administrative aspects of camp life. The United Nations
High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) and many non-governmental organizations (NGOs) worked
with them on matters of food distribution, health and schooling. Ex-FAR (Forces Armees Rwandaises/
Rwandan Armed Forces) soldiers and Interahamwe militiamen trained in full view of the foreign camp
personnel. They collected taxes from the refugees and dealt violently with dissenters [those who
refused]. Beatings and murders were commonplace, as was the intimidation of those who refused to
collaborate with the extremist leadership. Refugees who talked about going back to Rwanda were
endangering their lives.
