                                                Section A

1.   (a)   Describe one step in the development of a brand.                                          [2]

           Common steps in developing a brand include:
           • consideration of the business’ strategy
           • identification of the target market
           • doing market research
           • focusing the four Ps for purposeful positioning
           • development of market vision around the USP
           • selection of a name and logo
           • development of a marketing strategy.

           Accept any other relevant step. Candidates do not have to use identical wording
           to the above.

           Award [1] for identification of a step and [2] for an appropriate description of it e.g
           this might include an example – does not have to be TPS.

     (b)   Calculate:

           (i)    which store made the highest net profit before interest and tax (no working
                  required);                                                                         [1]

                              Store 1             Store 2             Store 3
                              $90 000            $103 000              $85 000
                             –$66 000            –$76 000            –$67 000
                              $24 000              $27 000             $18 000

                  Store 2 made the highest profit.

                  Award [1] for the correct answer. Working not required. Actual profit NOT
                  required.

           (ii)   which store had the highest profitability (show all your working).                 [2]

                   $24 000
                           = 13.33 %
                  $180 000

                   $27 000
                           = 12.11 %
                  $223 000

                   $18 000
                           = 10.59 %
                  $170 000

                  Store 1 had the highest profitability.

                  Award [1] for correct working and [1] for correct answer. Own figure rule
                  does not apply since there are no calculations in b(i). Must include
                  percentage for full marks. Do not penalize rounding of decimals
                                                 –5–                  M21/3/BUSMT/HP2/ENG/TZ0/XX/M


               N.B. Please reward candidates that provide correct working using Gross
               Profit. In this case Stores 1 and 3 have the same profitability of 50 percent.



(c)         Calculate:

      (i)      TPS’ equity;                                                                     [1]

               $200 000 [total assets] – $120 000 [total liabilities] = Equity
                                                                     = $80 000

               Award [1] for the correct answer. Working NOT required. Do not penalize
               lack of $ sign.

      (ii)     TPS’ return on capital employed (ROCE) (show all your working).                  [2]

               Step 1: add up the profits from the three stores. (award 1 mark)

               $24 000 + $27 000 + $18 000 = $69 000

               Step 2: Calculate ROCE.

                                $69 000
                                                            =53.08%
               $50 000 ( loan capital ) + $80 000 Equity 

               Award [1] for correct working and [1] for correct answer. Own figure rule
               applies but final answer must be consistent with correct use of formula
               Deduct 1 mark if no percentage. Accept 53.1%.

(d)   Explain one effect that the $50 000 long-term debt may have on TPS’ profit and
      loss account.                                                                             [2]

      The $50 000 in long-term debt would have to be repaid with interest. That interest
      expense would have three effects:
      • The interest expense would be subtracted from net profit before interest and
        tax, thereby lowering TPS’ net profit before tax.
      • The corporate tax rate would be applied to TPS’ net profit before tax. Because
        this figure is lower than it would have been had TPS not had an interest
        expense, TPS’ income tax expense is reduced.

      Award [1] mark for an identification and explanation of an effect. Award [1] mark
      for direct application to TPS which may include reference to actual net profit and
      interest figures AFTER tax.

      N.B. Do NOT credit “increases expenses” since it is a deduction AFTER profit
      before interest and tax. Deductions before profit before interest and tax are
      expenses.

2.   (a)   Describe one feature of a cooperative.                                                   [2]

           One feature of a cooperative:
                    • decision making is usually shared by all members
                    • any profits (or surpluses) and losses arising from this decision are
                        also shared
                    • decision making is regarded as more democratic
                    • membership is voluntary
                    • although a for-profit business there is usually some sort of social
                        improvement goal

           Award [1] for a partial description of a cooperative.

           Award [2] for a fuller description which may include an element of profit (surplus)
           or loss sharing.

     (b)   Using total contribution, calculate the forecasted total profit for SSL before the
           introduction of the new promotional strategy (show all your working).                    [2]

           Unit contribution is $10.20 – $6.40 = $3.80

           Total contribution = 3200 x $3.80 = $12 160

           Total profit = $12 160 – $7980 = $4180

           Award [1] for a correct calculation for both total contribution and one mark for
           total profit similar to the working shown above.

           If the candidate correctly calculates total profit but does not make any reference
           to contribution, then award [1] only.

           If candidate incorrectly calculates contribution but applies correctly to Total Profit
           then OFR and 1 mark.

           Do not penalize lack of $ sign.
                                              –7–                 M21/3/BUSMT/HP2/ENG/TZ0/XX/M


(c)   Construct a fully labelled break-even chart for SSL for before the new
      promotional strategy is introduced (show all your working).                             [4]




      Award [1] for correct labelling of both x and y axis – total costs and revenue (y)
      and output or units produced (x).

      Award [1] for accurate total cost curve.

      Award [1] for accurate total revenue curve.

      Award [1] for identifying the break-even point = Do Not reward calculations of BE
      quantity when not accompanied by chart.

      Candidates are NOT required to produce Fixed Costs FC or show the B/E
      Revenue line.

      Accuracy of TC and TR is based on the ability to approximate the B/E quantity
      based on the scale chosen for the x and y axes (this allows for the cases where
      graph paper has not been used).

      If B/E not accurate but identified DO NOT penalize if either TR and/or TC already
      penalized. Hence OFR applied.


(d)   Explain one advantage to SSL from implementing the new promotional strategy.            [2]

      The new promotional strategy will allow SSL to generate considerable goodwill,
      publicity and social responsibility. This will boost output from the current level of
      3200 to the maximum of 4000. SSL may be able to reduce costs through greater
      bulk buying of ingredients and this could lead to an increase in profits.

As SSL has a minimum order size of 50, the promotional offer is likely to
encourage more schools to order.

Award [1] for an advantage and an additional [1] for clear application to SSL.

                                       Section B
3.   (a)   State two features of product innovation.                                           [2]

           Product innovation features could include:
           • the development of a new, redesigned goods or services – creative innovation
           • quality improvements made to a product
           • the inclusion of new components, materials or desirable functions into an
              existing product. – adaptive innovation
           • It results from successful research and development which can be expensive,
              time consuming and risky

           Accept any other relevant feature of product innovation. Candidates are not
           expected to word their responses exactly as above. Award [1] for each relevant
           feature of product innovation identified. Award a maximum of [2]. N.B. do not
           credit features which are in fact repetitions.

     (b)   Explain one advantage and one disadvantage for SSC of having a product-
           orientated marketing approach.                                                      [4]

           As a product-orientated business, SSC can:
           • concentrate resources and efforts to produce high quality products. Customers
             reviews are very positive about SSC’s quality ad effectiveness. It seems that
             SSC has built a good brand image and a good brand awareness by focusing
             on the product
           • be the first to develop and produce innovative products, such as the first
             sunscreen free of synthetic chemicals, to get the first mover advantage in a
             highly competitive market
           • avoid spending money in market research, to know what customers dictate or
             the type of products to develop. Market research costs are usually very high
             and SSC can devote more finance into research and development or into
             corporate social responsibility practices
           • benefit from economies of scale. As SSC only produces a small range of high
             quality facial creams and soaps focusing on quality products, they can benefit
             from economies of scale due to greater product specialization
           • can develop new products and be able to sell them with relatively little
             marketing. SSC has an established customer base that trusts them. So far
             they have relied on social media and word of mouth only.

           However:
           • SSC faces higher risks. Without market research, the risks that customers
             may not be interested or like their new products, such as the sunscreen free of
             synthetic chemicals, are higher. If the sunscreen free of synthetic chemicals
             doesn't sell losses could be substantial.
           • Research and development costs are usually steep in the cosmetic industry.
             SSC is already facing difficulties in financing the development of new
             products.
           • New ideas from customers may emerge from a market research. As a
             product-orientated business, SSC may not get this valuable information in a
             highly competitive market.

           Accept any other relevant and applicable advantage/disadvantage.

           Mark as 2 + 2.
                                             – 10 –              M21/3/BUSMT/HP2/ENG/TZ0/XX/M


      Award [1] for identifying or describing the advantage/disadvantage of having a
      product-orientation and a further [1] for a development with respect/application to
      SSC.
      Award a maximum of [2].
      [2] cannot be awarded per advantage/disadvantage if the response lacks either
      explanation and/or application.

      For example:
      • for an identification or a description of an advantage/disadvantage with or
        without application [1].
      • for explanation of an advantage/disadvantage with no application [1] for
        explanation of an advantage/disadvantage and application [2].

(c)   Explain one advantage and one disadvantage to SSC of practising corporate
      social responsibility (CSR).                                                           [4]

      By practising corporate social responsibility, SSC will be able to:
      • increase their customer base. Consumers that are compromised with the
        environmental or animal cause and health seekers, may be drawn to buy
        SSC’s products. Customers with this profile may be willing to buy from
        companies that have a reputation of being good corporate citizens
      • keep support from pressure groups. SSC already receives public recognition
        from animal support pressure groups. As SSC only relies on word of mouth
        and social media, keeping good publicity from these groups is vital for
        reputation and brand image
      • attract investors. SSC’s image plays an important role in attracting investors. If
        SSC is engaged in CSR their image may get boost and attract
        capital/investors to finance research and development.

      However:
      • Practising corporate social responsibility increases costs to relatively small
        businesses like SSC. For instance, not testing on animals can increase SSC’s
        production costs. Charity support may also increase SSC’s expenses,

(d)   Discuss Chelsea’s idea to convert SSC into a public limited company.                   [10]

      If SSC converts to a public limited company they will be able to finance product
      innovation, research and development. SSC is already facing difficulties to fund
      internally the development of a sunscreen free of synthetic chemicals. If the
      company goes public, they will be able to sell shares in the stock market to raise
      the required capital to develop and produce it.

      With share capital, SSC will also be able diversify their production and offer a
      wider range of creams, soaps and other innovative cosmetics. Through the
      expansion of their product portfolio, it is likely that SSC’s customer base and
      sales will increase.

      SSC is probably missing sales opportunities by selling online only. As a Plc, they
      will have the financial means to develop alternative distribution channels, to reach
      unsatisfied national and international demand. Sales turnover may increase and
      SSC will ultimately grow.

      Share capital will also open up advertising possibilities. SSC will be able to
      finance costly above the line advertising instead of relying on social media and
      word of mouth.

      However, converting to a public limited company could be is a risky move. The
      cosmetic market is dominated by multinational companies. If more than 50 % of
      shares are bought by another company Tiffany and Chelsea will lose their control
      over SSC.

      New shareholders may have a different perspective in several aspects such as
      SSC corporate social responsibility or SSC product orientation. Clashing
      perspectives may arise. Tiffany is already worried about losing control. New
      shareholders may replace SSC’s ethical objectives and focus on profit
      maximization. Tiffany’s commitment to the animal cause may be lost. Pressure
      groups may react as well as stop their support to the company.

      It is likely that as a bigger company SSC may also change into market
      orientation. SSC may decide to produce what the market wants instead of
      focusing on high quality healthy products. Healthy products may be replaced by
      nice smelling and looking ones. Current customers may perceive this change and
      stop buying SSC.

      Overall, it seems that SSC needs to grow externally. The cosmetic market is
      highly competitive and it is dominated by multinational companies. SSC has no
      chances of expansion with its current level of finance, thus converting to a Plc
      has clear advantages to SSC. However, Tiffany and Chelsea will have to make
      several concessions. It is unlikely that more capital will come without new
      perspectives, new ways of doing things and a new ethos.

      Marks should be allocated according to the markbands on page 3.

      A balanced response is one that covers at least two arguments for and two
      arguments against the option.

4.   (a)   Define the term niche market.                                                        [2]

           A niche market is a small market segment. The products are usually specialised,
           aimed at satisfying specific market needs for a well-defined segment of the
           population.

           Candidates are not expected to word their responses exactly as above.

           Award [1] for some understanding. E.g small market.

           Award [2] for a clear definition, including reference to either specialization,
           segmentation or specific market needs.

           N.B. Examples should NOT be credited.

     (b)   Explain two benefits to RV of the decision to adopt e-commerce.                      [4]

           Benefits must be to RV not just to customers – a benefit to a customer can only
           be rewarded if the answers goes on to explain how this benefit also helps the
           business
           For example, stating that a website allows the customer to view the business
           products 24x7 (or to place orders from the comfort of their own home) is on its
           own not rewardable. The candidate would need to go on to state that this
           situation may lead to increased orders for RV bicycles for the response to be
           rewardable.

           Benefits may include:
           • Lowering costs – RV can reduce the need for employing staff to handle orders
             or take phone calls.
           • Providing abundant information – There are limitations to the amount of
             information that can be displayed in a physical store. It is difficult to equip
             employees to respond to customers who require information across product
             lines. E-commerce websites can make additional information easily available
             to customers. Most of this information is provided by vendors and does not
             cost anything to create or maintain. Will also help overcome problems that RV
             faced .eg RV received an increasing number of customer complaints that
             phone lines were often engaged and calls not returned.
           • Being open 24x7, which may increase orders as customers can order anytime.
           • Making the business more visible – currently 98% of customers are within 50
             miles of RV’s business. N.B given the business has been offering e-commerce
             for at least 3 years then this benefit has yet to be achieved although
             responses of this nature should continue to be rewarded
           Accept any other relevant benefit.

           Award [1] for stating a benefit to RV from adopting e-commerce and an additional
           [1] for its explanation with reference to RV. Award a maximum of [2] per benefit.
           Mark as 2+2. Maximum award: [4].

(c)   (i)    Calculate the payback period if RV chooses Option 2 (show all your
             working).                                                                        [2]

             The payback is:

             Payback formula =     initial investment
                                 net cash flow per year
                 $3 500 000
             =
                  $600 000

             = 5 years and 10 months OR 5.833 years

             OR

             $3.5
             $0.6

             = 5 years and 10 months OR 5.833 years

             Accept 70 months

             Award [1] for correct formula (with or without figures)

             OR

             Award [1] for correct figures but incorrect final answer
                 $3.5
             (eg       = 5.5 years).
                 $0.6

             Award [2] for correct answer with working.
             Accept any other method used if working is included.
             Do not accept 9.96 months if rounded down to 9 months.
             Deduct 1 mark if “years/months” omitted
             Do not accept rounding up to 6 years unless actual figure is shown in
             calculation.

      (ii)   Explain one disadvantage to RV of using the payback period method of
             investment appraisal.                                                            [2]

             One disadvantage is that the payback method fails to take into account the
             time value of money and adjust the cash inflows accordingly. [1 mark]
             Though the forecasted net returns each year are $600 000, the inflation in
             the country is forecast to remain in the 2–3% range for the next three years.
             Therefore, the real value of the annual $600 000 will be less in years 1 to 3,
             thus overstating the return on the investment.

             Also, the payback analysis fails to consider inflows of cash that occur
             beyond the payback period [1] – in this case we are not told the life of the
             investment so we cannot see how much the net returns will be for the life of
             the investment beyond 5 years and 10 months [1].

             The forecast figures are subject to variation based on qualitative factors.
             Although this is also true of other investment appraisal methods it should
             be accepted.

            Award [1] for a disadvantage of the payback method and [1] for its
            application to RV Ltd.


(d)   Recommend whether RV’s directors should choose Option 1 or Option 2.                   [10]

      Option 1 advantages:
      RV will have lower production costs as production costs are lower in China. This
      option will help the business deal with the low-priced imports.

      It will allow RV to concentrate on design and marketing, which may enable it to
      improve its designs and marketing and, thus, increase sales.

      Option 1 disadvantages:
      The Chinese factory uses batch production, which will affect RV’s ability to
      produce bicycles that fit their customer’s demands. Currently, RV can meet
      customer demands because the business uses job production.

      RV will no longer have control over production and quality standards may
      deteriorate.

      Transport issues from China will mean that RV will not be able to deliver bicycles
      to customers within 7 days of receipt of their orders. RV’s advertising slogan will
      need to change as the business will no longer hand make orders in the USA.

      Option 2 advantages:
      RV will have lower production costs because it will no longer need expensive,
      skilled labour. Lower costs will help the business deal with the low-priced imports.

      Production will remain in the USA and it can retain job production.

      RV will likely not have delivery time issues.

      Option 2 disadvantages:
      Will need to make existing skilled employees redundant which will incur
      redundancy costs.

      Require an investment of $3.5m at a time when the business is making losses
      (since 2017) – this may require external finance which will, incur interest charges,
      raising unit costs.

      The payback period is also more than 5 years which is relatively long.

      Will their customer base trust the new production technique which uses glue
      rather than welding?

      Accept any other relevant evaluation.

      Marks should be allocated according to the markbands on page 3.

5.   (a)   Define the term product orientation.                                                    [2]

           A company following a production orientation chooses to ignore their customers’
           needs and to focus only on efficiently building a quality product. They do not
           undertake market research identifying customer reactions to their proposed
           product before commencing production. This type of company believes that if
           they can make the best product their customers will come.

           Candidates are not expected to word their responses exactly as above.

           Award [1] for identification of one characteristic of a product-orientated business.
           Award [2] for a full, clear description.

           Do NOT reward examples.

     (b)   With reference to Option 1, for KT, explain the relationship between the product
           life cycle, investment, profit and cash flow.                                           [4]

           Initial research and development costs plus the costs involved in launching a
           product usually means a product will be a loss maker in its early years. Cash
           flows may be negative. As sales grow and the product moves into the growth
           phase, profits are likely to be positive but the company will require additional
           working capital. Not until the product reaches the maturity phases of the life cycle
           are cash flows and profits likely to be positive. In the decline phase, cash flows
           and profits are likely to remain positive. The cash flows especially should be solid
           with the contraction of necessary working capital. For KT, the investment in R&D
           for the new battery will have had a negative effect on cash flow and profits. Once
           the product is launched, Option 1 forecasts see quite large sales and therefore
           large cash inflows. However, we do not know about the marketing costs, which
           will increase cash outflows. Sometime in year 2, further investment would be
           needed if sales targets in years 3 and 4 are to be fulfilled as projected sales
           exceed capacity. This investment would increase fixed costs and reduce profits.
           However, another option to solve this problem could be to overproduce in years 1
           and 2 to cover the forecast sales for year 3. However this would give problems of
           tying up working capital plus the problems of storage.

           Mark as 2 + 2.
           Award up to [1] for a clear explanation of the relationship between the product
           life cycle, and at least one of investment, profit and cash flow e.g. contrasting
           high initial investment cost OR low or negative cash flow OR negative profit (loss)
           in one of the stages in the product life cycle such as the initial stage.

           Award up to [2] for a clear explanation of the relationship between the product
           life cycle, and at least two of investment, profit and cash flow in one of the
           stages in the product life cycle such as the initial stage OR for a clear explanation
           of one of initial investment, profit or cashflow in TWO or more stages of the
           product life cycle.
           Award an additional [1] for application to each of the items explained above to
           Option 1 for KT. Up to a maximum of [2]. Application may refer to the high initial
           cost as “to borrow significant capital” to finance this option, an increasing cash
           inflow in year 3 and 4 (growth and maturity etc).

           N.B Do not reward renditions of the Product life cycle diagram unless
           accompanied by an “explanation” as this does not meet requirements of the
           command term.

(c)   With reference to KT, explain two problems that a new business may face.                  [4]

      Problems any new business may face include:
      • Competition – KT faces stiff competition in the market for batteries for
         consumer products from multinationals.
      • Cash flow problems – KT suffered from cash flow problems in its first year of
         trading.
      • Human resources issues, particularly finding the right staff.
      • Insufficient marketing. B2C would require much more marketing than KT is
         used to.
      • Market research – KT is product orientated and therefore will not have
         undertaken market research before developing is products.
      • Poor planning.- KT needs to plan beyond 5 years as its new battery will
         obsolete by then.
      • Insufficient start-up capital.- several references to insufficient funds for further
         development.

      Accept any other relevant advantage or disadvantage.

      Mark as 2 + 2.

      For [2], candidates must identify ad advantage or a disadvantage, explain it, and
      apply it to the stimulus.

(d)   Recommend whether KT should choose Option 1 or Option 2.                                 [10]

      Option 1: Selling car batteries directly to car owners. They currently sell B2B
      rather than B2C.

      Advantages:
      • Higher initial revenues per unit – KT will receive $400 per unit by selling
        directly to consumers, compared to only $250 per unit if sold to a car
        manufacturer.
      • Sales are higher in option 1 for the first 2 years and at 410 000 over 5 years
        are 95 000 higher.
      • Total revenues are higher at $164 000 000 compared with $78 750 000.

      Disadvantages:
      • KT has no experience of selling directly to consumers as it is currently a B2B
         business. It will need to decide HOW it will allow customers to order its
         products – via its website or by phone – both solutions will require additional
         spending.
      • KT will need to undertake a marketing campaign to raise awareness of its new
         products. As a B2B business, KT has no experience of engaging consumers.
         Funds will need to be found to finance a marketing campaign to raise
         awareness of its product and to persuade consumers to buy the product.
      • The data in table 1 is only a forecast and therefore may exaggerate its
         potential. KT may sell much less than forecast which affects its profitability.
      • Further investment would be needed to meet demand as full capacity is
         exceeded in years 3 and 4. The cost of this investment is unknown. KT has
         insufficient funds to invest in new capacity.

      Option 2: Form a five-year strategic alliance with a manufacturer of electric cars.

      Advantages:
                                          – 19 –          M21/3/BUSMT/HP2/ENG/TZ0/XX/M


  • Sales are guaranteed as the partner in the strategic alliance has agreed to buy
    a set number for 5 years. This alliance provides the business with certainty.
  • KT avoids capacity issues as maximum annual sales are 85 000 units
    (batteries), which is below KT’s capacity of 90 000 units.
  • No additional marketing costs.

  Disadvantages:
  • Sales are lower than option 1 for years 1,2,3,4 and 5.
  • Unit revenues are lower at $250 rather than $400 per unit.
  • Total sales and sales revenue are lower at 315 000 units with a total revenue
     of $78 750 000.

  Balance in the context of this question means having at least one advantage and
  one disadvantage for each option (and, thus, addressing both options).
