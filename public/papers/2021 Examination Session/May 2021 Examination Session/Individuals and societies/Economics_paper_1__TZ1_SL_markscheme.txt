Microeconomics

1.   (a)       Explain how the price mechanism reallocates resources when there is a
               decrease in the supply of a good.                                                  [10]

               Answers may include:
                definitions of price mechanism, resources, supply
                diagram to show how a decrease in supply leads to a reallocation of resources
                explanation of how a decrease in supply shifts the supply curve left, creates
                 excess demand at the original price, incentivizes producers to increase price,
                 provides signals and incentives to consumers to change their consumption
                 patterns, switches demand to less expensive goods and causes a reallocation
                 of resources
                examples of goods where a decrease in supply has affected the allocation of
                 resources.

(b)   Evaluate the view that the threat to sustainability, caused by economic activity
      requiring the use of fossil fuels, is best addressed through the use of carbon
      taxes.                                                                                [15]

      Answers may include:
       definitions of sustainability, carbon taxes
       diagram to illustrate the use of carbon taxes, showing a shift of the supply
        curve to the left, reflecting the value of the negative externality (or any other
        relevant diagram)
       explanation that the use of fossil fuels generates negative externalities in
        production and/or consumption and therefore poses a threat to sustainability,
        and that this can be addressed through carbon taxes, which make the polluter
        pay
       examples of the use of carbon taxes and fossil fuels
       synthesis or evaluation.

      Evaluation may include: possible advantages and disadvantages of the use of
      carbon taxes, consideration of other available policy options such as cap and
      trade schemes and funding for clean technologies, assessment of “best”.

      A maximum of [12] should be awarded if there is not at least some reference to
      other policies.

      Examiners should be aware that candidates may take a different approach which,
      if appropriate, should be rewarded.

               Answers may include:
                definition of indirect taxes
                diagram to illustrate the imposition of an indirect tax, with the supply curve
                 shifting left, price increasing and quantity demanded decreasing
                explanation that indirect taxes may be imposed to raise tax revenue, to
                 discourage the consumption of demerit goods, to correct negative externalities
                 in production, trade protection, to redistribute income, eg excise taxes on
                 luxury goods
                examples of goods on which indirect taxes are imposed.

               A maximum of [6] should be awarded if only one reason is explained.

3.   (a)       Explain how the size of the circular flow of income in an economy is likely to be
               affected by a decrease in the rate of interest.                                       [10]

               Answers may include:
                definitions of circular flow of income, rate of interest
                diagram of the circular flow of income, showing a decrease in saving and an
                 increase in investment or use of an AD/AS diagram to explain the impact of
                 the decrease in the rate of interest on the circular flow of income
                explanation that a decrease in the rate of interest is likely to reduce saving,
                 and increase business investment; hence a decrease in a leakage and an
                 increase in an injection will exert an upward impact on income and output and
                 increase the size of the circular flow of income
                examples of changes in the rate of interest affecting the circular flow of income
                 in practice, such as the reduction of interest rates to near 0% in many
                 countries at present.

4.   (a)       Explain how aggregate demand is likely to be affected by an increase in the
               wealth of consumers and an increase in business confidence.                         [10]

               Answers may include:
                definitions of aggregate demand, wealth, business confidence
                diagram to show the AD curve shifting to the right
                explanation that an increase in the wealth of consumers may have a positive
                 wealth effect whereby consumption increases as consumers feel richer and
                 are more willing to spend, or can borrow more on the basis of their greater
                 wealth; that an increase in business confidence in relation to being more
                 optimistic about future sales and profits is likely to increase investment; and
                 that the increase in C and I will increase AD
                examples of an increase in consumers’ wealth and/or business confidence
                 increasing AD in practice.

               Award a maximum of [6] if only wealth or only business confidence is addressed.

(b)       Evaluate the effectiveness of monetary policy in reducing an economy’s rate of
          unemployment.                                                                          [15]
          Answers may include:
           definitions of monetary policy, rate of unemployment
           diagram to show AD shifting to the right as a result of expansionary monetary
            policy
           explanation of how expansionary monetary policy may help to reduce cyclical
            (demand-deficient) unemployment in terms of the mechanisms by which lower
            interest rates increase AD via the effect on consumption, investment and/or
            net exports
           examples of expansionary monetary policy being used in practice
           synthesis or evaluation.

          Evaluation may include: the implications of monetary policy in terms of the ability
          to implement changes in interest rates relatively quickly and incrementally, the
          limited political constraints, the possible conflicts with other objectives of
          economic policy, time lags, the independence of the central bank, the
          ineffectiveness of monetary policy in relation to structural unemployment / the
          natural rate of unemployment, its possible ineffectiveness during a recession, the
          possibility that alternative policies (eg supply-side policy) may be more effective.
