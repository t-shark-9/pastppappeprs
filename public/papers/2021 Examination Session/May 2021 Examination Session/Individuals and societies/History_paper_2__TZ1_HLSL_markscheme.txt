           substantiated assertions.
 0         Answers do not reach a standard described by the descriptors below.


Examiners are reminded of the need to apply the markbands that provide the “best fit” to the responses
given by candidates and to award credit wherever it is possible to do so. If an answer indicates that
the demands of the question are understood and addressed but that not all implications are
considered (for example, compare or contrast; reasons or significance; methods or success),
then examiners should not be afraid of using the full range of marks allowed for by the markscheme:
as such, responses that offer good coverage of some of the criteria should be rewarded accordingly.

For the attention of all examiners: if you are uncertain about the content/accuracy of a
candidate’s work please contact your team leader.

Topic 1: Society and economy (750–1400)

1.   Evaluate the impact of population change on two societies, each from a different region.

     The question requires that candidates make an appraisal of the impact of population growth,
     weighing up its importance or otherwise. The two societies must be from different regions. Impact
     may extend beyond the timeframe of the question, but it must be clearly linked to the issue raised.
     Candidates may offer equal coverage of the two societies or they may prioritize discussion of one
     of them. However, both societies will be a feature of the response. Candidates may argue that
     population growth stimulated agricultural efficiency, for example improved axes and ploughs in
     Europe, and economic growth, in places such as Song China, by generating larger markets for
     goods and providing cheap labour. In some areas, urban (for example the Flemish towns) and
     long-distance migration (for example Bantu expansion) resulted. There may be evaluation of the
     social and economic impact of the Black Death, in the long and short term. Candidates’ opinions or
     conclusions will be presented clearly and supported by appropriate evidence.


2.   Compare and contrast the impact of developments in science and technology on two societies,
     each chosen from a different region.

     The question requires that candidates give an account of the similarities and differences between
     the impact of developments in science and technology in two societies, referring to both
     throughout. There does not need to be an equal number of each. The two societies must be from
     different regions. Impact may extend beyond the timeframe, but it must be clearly linked to the
     issue raised in the question. Candidates may refer to the impact of agricultural technology, such as
     ploughs; the technology of production, such as water and windmills; and maritime technology such
     as ship-building and navigational equipment. They may refer to the impact of the Islamic scientific
     revolution, in, for example, medicine and mathematics and its spread into other societies such as
     India; they may also refer to the slow transmission of advanced technology from China such as
     paper-making and the printing press.

Topic 2: Causes and effects of wars (750–1500)

3.   “The most important causes of wars in the period 750–1500 were political.” With reference to two
     wars, to what extent do you agree with this statement?

     The question requires that candidates consider the merits or otherwise of the statement that the
     most important causes of wars in this period were political. The two wars may or may not be from
     the same region. Causes may predate the timeframe but they must be clearly linked to the issue
     raised in the question. Candidates may offer equal coverage of both wars or they may prioritize
     their assessment of one of them. However, both wars will be a feature of the response. When
     discussing political causes candidates may refer to succession and/or dynastic disputes, for
     example Ariq Boke’s challenge to Kublai Khan; or the role of an empire’s decline in encouraging its
     neighbour’s expansionist ambitions, for example, the Seljuk Turks’ excursions into the Byzantine
     Empire during the 11th century. Other relevant factors such as economic or religious factors may
     be addressed, but with a focus on the issue in the question. Candidates may note that wars are
     often caused by a combination of these factors, as in the case of the First Crusade. Candidates’
     opinions or conclusions will be presented clearly and supported by appropriate evidence.


4.   “Wars in the period 750–1500 resulted in significant boundary and dynastic changes.” Discuss with
     reference to two wars, each chosen from a different region.

     The question requires that candidates offer a considered and balanced review of the statement
     that wars in this period resulted in significant boundary and dynastic changes. The two wars must
     be from different regions. Changes may extend beyond the timeframe but they must be clearly
     linked to the issue raised in the question. Candidates may offer equal coverage of both wars or
     they may prioritize their discussion of one of them. However, both wars will be a feature of the
     response. Candidates may discuss territorial and dynastic changes resulting from invasions, as in
     the case of the Crusades or the Norman Conquest. Candidates may also discuss the permanency
     of changes, as in the case of the Hundred Years War, in which the French crown returned to the
     Valois; or the extent of the change in wars of succession where control shifted between contenders
     with the same lineage, for example the ‘Abassid Civil War. Candidates’ opinions or conclusions will
     be presented clearly and supported by appropriate evidence.
                                                  –6–                 M21/3/HISTX/BP2/ENG/TZ1/XX/M


Topic 3: Dynasties and rulers (750–1500)

5.   Evaluate the methods of government and administration of two rulers, each from a different region.

     The question requires that candidates make an appraisal of the methods of government and
     administration of two rulers. The two rulers must be from different regions. Candidates may offer
     equal coverage of both rulers or they may prioritize their discussion of one of them. However, both
     rulers will be a feature of the response. Candidates may refer to models of government and to the
     extent of the centralisation of power with a large bureaucracy, for example the Song dynasty; or a
     decentralised system with powerful private individuals appointed by the ruler, for example
     Shogunate Japan. Candidates may refer to the limits to royal power, for example Magna Carta in
     England or Cortes in Spain. They may also evaluate the use of detailed records of wealth transfer
     or the use of a census system, as used by the Mongols. Other relevant factors may be evaluated,
     for example the use of tools for unification (roads, a common language or state religion), but with a
     focus on the issue in the question. Candidates’ opinions or conclusions will be presented clearly
     and supported by appropriate evidence.


6.   With reference to two rulers, compare and contrast the methods used to address external
     challenges to their power.

     The question requires that candidates give an account of the similarities and differences between
     two rulers in terms of the methods used to address external challenges to their power, referring to
     both rulers throughout. There does not need to be an equal number of each. The two rulers may or
     may not be from the same region. Candidates may refer to the fortification of borders and/or
     protection of territories from encroaching states, as experienced by Abd al-Rahman III who pacified
     borders with Christian Spain and Northern Africa, or Baibars who fought off the Mongol threat.
     Candidates may also refer to the creation of military alliances against a common enemy (for
     example Itzcoatl with the Aztec Triple Alliance), or the formation of trade systems which promoted
     regional hegemony. Other relevant factors may be addressed, for example internal steps taken to
     raise or finance an army and unify an empire, as well as to reduce opposition, but with a focus on
     the issue raised in the question. Candidates’ opinions or conclusions will be presented clearly and
     supported by appropriate evidence.
                                                  –7–                  M21/3/HISTX/BP2/ENG/TZ1/XX/M


Topic 4: Societies in transition (1400–1700)

7.   Evaluate the importance of population expansion and movements as causes of change in two
     societies, each chosen from a different region.

     The question requires that candidates make an appraisal of the importance of population
     expansion and movements as causes of change in two societies, weighing up their importance or
     otherwise. The two societies must be from different regions. Candidates may offer equal coverage
     of the two societies or they may prioritize their evaluation of one of them. However, both societies
     will be a feature of the response. Candidates may refer to increasing numbers of people who could
     not be supported by their families (notably non-inheriting sons) as a consequence of population
     expansion; this may have stimulated movement into towns and cities (such as Naples and
     London), which, in turn, affected mortality and poverty rates. Population expansion may have also
     promoted movement to the Americas. It may, by increasing the size of markets and providing
     cheap labour, have stimulated economic activity, for example in Edo Japan; expansion improved
     agricultural techniques, for example, agrarian reform and improved irrigation systems in Mughal
     India. Candidates’ opinions or conclusions will be presented clearly and supported by appropriate
     evidence.


8.   Discuss the social impact of scientific and technological developments on two societies.

     The question requires that candidates offer a considered and balanced review of the social impact
     of scientific and technological developments. The two societies may or may not be from the same
     region. The social impact may extend beyond the timeframe but they must be clearly linked to the
     issue raised in the question. Candidates may offer equal coverage of the two societies or they may
     prioritize their discussion of one of them. However, both societies will be a feature of the response.
     Candidates may refer to the development of navigation and cartography and discuss their impact
     on European, African or native societies. They may refer to the Copernican revolution and the
     renovation of the scientific method. Candidates may refer to the development of agriculture
     technologies and its impact on social or political groups, for example the use of andenes (terraces)
     and the Inca society. Candidates could discuss the development of anatomy or medicine and their
     impact on beliefs about health, the body and religion. Candidates’ opinions or conclusions will be
     presented clearly and supported by appropriate evidence.
                                                  –8–                  M21/3/HISTX/BP2/ENG/TZ1/XX/M


Topic 5: Early Modern states (1450–1789)

9.    “The most important reasons for the territorial expansion of Early Modern states were religious.”
      With reference to two states, to what extent do you agree with this statement?

      The question requires that candidates consider the merits or otherwise of the statement that the
      most important reasons for territorial expansion were religious. The two states may or may not be
      from the same region. Reasons may predate the timeframe but they must be clearly linked to the
      issue raised in the question. Candidates may offer equal coverage of states or they may prioritize
      their assessment of one of them. However, both states will be a feature of the response.
      Candidates may refer to a desire to evangelize, for example the conversion of the indigenous
      people in Hispanic America. They may refer to the links between religion and political power as a
      reason for the expansion, for example the Ottoman Empire. They may also refer to the lack of
      religious tolerance as a reason for expansion, for example the establishment of some British
      colonies in North America. Other relevant factors may be addressed, for example economic
      reasons or the competition among the states, but with a focus on the issue in the question.
      Candidates’ opinions or conclusions will be presented clearly and supported by appropriate
      evidence.


10.   With reference to one Early Modern state, discuss the challenges to its power and how
      successfully they were overcome.

      The question requires that candidates offer a considered and balanced review of the challenges to
      the power of one Early Modern state and how successfully they were overcome. Challenges may
      predate the timeframe but they must be clearly linked to the issue raised in the question.
      Candidates may refer to political challenges in limiting the power of a king or emperor, for example,
      the challenge of the Shogun to the Emperor in the Tokugawa Shogunate. They may refer to
      religious challenges, for example the conflicts between Emperor Charles V and the Lutheran
      princes in the Holy Roman Empire. Wars or rebellions can also be considered, for example Hindu
      rebellions in the Mughal Empire or the war between Huascar and Atahualpa. They may refer to
      economic issues, for example the slave trade and the power of the Oba in the Benin Empire. In the
      chosen state candidates will discuss how successfully challenges were overcome. Other factors
      may be addressed, for example issues after the conquest of new lands. Candidates’ opinions or
      conclusions will be presented clearly and supported by appropriate evidence.
                                                 –9–                  M21/3/HISTX/BP2/ENG/TZ1/XX/M


Topic 6: Causes and effects of Early Modern wars (1500–1750)

11.   “The most important causes of Early Modern wars were political.” With reference to two wars, to
      what extent do you agree with this statement?

      The question requires that candidates consider the merits or otherwise of the statement that the
      most important causes of Early Modern wars were political. The two Early Modern wars may or
      may not be from the same region. Causes may predate the timeframe but they must be clearly
      linked to the issue raised in the question. Candidates may refer to the confrontation between
      imperial power and local power, for example, the Dutch War of Independence. They may refer to
      issues of succession, for example the Maratha Empire and the war between Sambhaji and
      Rajaram for the throne. They may consider the clashes over the nature of government as a political
      cause, for example the English Civil War. Other relevant factors may be addressed, for example
      territorial expansion, economic interests or religious reasons, but with a focus on the issue in the
      question. Candidates’ opinions or conclusions will be presented clearly and supported by
      appropriate evidence.


12.   “The most important effects of Early Modern wars were economic.” Discuss with reference to two
      wars, each chosen from a different region.

      The question requires that candidates offer a considered and balanced review of the statement
      that the most important effects of war were economic. The two wars must be from different regions.
      Effects may extend beyond the timeframe, but they must be clearly linked to the issue raised in the
      question. Candidates may offer equal coverage of two wars or they may prioritize their assessment
      of one of them. However, both wars will be a feature of the response. Candidates may assess the
      effects of major wars such as the Thirty Years’ War (which devastated cities such as Magdeburg)
      or the Japanese invasions of Korea (which ruined agriculture); they may assess the impact of a
      colonial war, such as the Spanish Inca War, which resulted in depopulation and seizure of control
      over precious metal extraction. Candidates may argue that war did not always have a severe
      economic impact; for example, the Dutch Golden Age began well before the War of Independence
      had ended. Other relevant social, religious, political and territorial effects may be addressed, but
      with a focus on the question. Candidates’ opinions or conclusions will be presented clearly and
      supported by appropriate evidence.
                                                  – 10 –               M21/3/HISTX/BP2/ENG/TZ1/XX/M


Topic 7: Origins, development and impact of industrialization (1750–2005)

13.   Evaluate the significance of developments in energy and power to industrialization in two
      countries.

      The question requires that candidates make an appraisal of developments in energy and power to
      industrialization to two countries, weighing up their importance or otherwise. The two countries
      may or may not be from the same region. Significance may extend beyond the timeframe but it
      must be clearly linked to the issue raised in the question. Candidates may offer equal coverage of
      both countries or they may prioritize their evaluation of one of them. However, both countries will
      be a feature of the response. Candidates may refer to the introduction of new developments, for
      example steam power, which provided an effective and cheap alternative to manual labour and
      enabled a reduction of prices. Candidates may also refer to advancements in gas and electricity,
      which made mechanization, extended working hours or the use of key items (for example
      telegraphs or trams) possible. Other factors may include exploitation of natural resources,
      transportation, mass production or communication. Candidates’ opinions or conclusions will be
      presented clearly and supported by appropriate evidence.


14.   “Opposition to industrialization was limited.” Discuss with reference to two countries, each from a
      different region.

      The question requires that candidates offer a considered and balanced review of the statement
      that opposition to industrialization in two countries was limited. The two countries must be from
      different regions. Candidates may offer equal coverage of both countries, or they may prioritize
      their discussion of one of them. However, both countries will be a feature of the response.
      Candidates should identify the nature of opposition to industrialization and its extent. Candidates
      may refer to the growth in opposition as a result of, for example, changes in the composition of the
      workforce, declining working conditions, impact on urban centres or environmental concerns.
      Candidates may also comment on the growth or decline in opposition as a result of, for example,
      the introduction of legal reforms to safeguard workers, the changes in role and status of women,
      state support of industrialization, as well as growing local and global pressure to protect the
      environment. Other relevant factors may be addressed, for example the differences in the regions
      and periods of industrialization and their impact on the extent of opposition. Candidates’ opinions
      or conclusions will be presented clearly and supported by appropriate evidence.
                                                 – 11 –               M21/3/HISTX/BP2/ENG/TZ1/XX/M


Topic 8: Independence movements (1800–2000)

15.   Evaluate the role of war as a cause for the rise of two independence movements, each from a
      different region.

      The question requires that candidates make an appraisal of the role of war as a cause of the rise of
      two independence movements, weighing up the importance or otherwise. The two independence
      movements must be from different regions. The war or wars may predate the timeframe but must
      be clearly linked to the issue raised in the question. Candidates may offer equal coverage of each
      independence movement, or they may prioritize their evaluation of one of them. However, both
      independence movements will be a feature of the response. Candidates may refer to the role of
      war in the colonial government and/or weakening the metropolitan power, for example, the
      relationship between the Spanish war against Napoleon and the Spanish–American independence
      movement. Other factors may be addressed, for example, the discontent with the colonial rule.
      Candidates’ opinions or conclusions will be presented clearly and supported by appropriate
      evidence.


16.   Evaluate the factors, excluding leadership, that led to the success of one independence
      movement.

      The question requires that candidates make an appraisal of the factors, excluding leadership, that
      led to the success of one independence movement, weighing up their strengths and importance or
      otherwise. Factors may predate the timeframe but they must be clearly linked to the issue raised in
      the question. Candidates may refer to the role of nationalism in the success of the independence
      movement, for example, in the independence of Ireland. They may consider the weakness of the
      colonial power and appraise its importance, for example the situation of the Ottoman Empire and
      the independence of Greece. Candidates may argue the importance of military strategies or
      guerrillas for the success, for example in the Algerian War of Independence. They may refer to
      foreign interests and military or economic help, for example in the independence of Cuba. Other
      factors may include, for example racial, ethnic or religious conflicts. Candidates’ opinions or
      conclusions will be presented clearly and supported by appropriate evidence.

Topic 9: Emergence and development of democratic states (1848–2000)

17.   “Ideology was the most important influence on the evolution of democratic states.” Discuss with
      reference to two states, each from a different region.

      The question requires that candidates offer a considered and balanced review of the statement
      that ideology was the most important influence on the evolution of democratic states. The two
      states must come from different regions. Candidates may offer equal coverage of the two states or
      prioritize their assessment of one of them. However, both states will be a feature of the response.
      Candidates may discuss the Weimar Republic, where a liberal constitution, protected civil liberties,
      promoted gender equality and encouraged artistic freedom. They may refer to Nehru’s India, which
      was guided by socialist economic policies, while also establishing liberal principles, such as
      freedom of speech; or South Africa, where socialist economic and social reform, it may be argued,
      was compromised by corruption and single-party domination. In Alfonsín’s Argentina, ideology
      played little part in the face of economic crisis. Other relevant factors, such as immigration,
      economic forces and foreign influences may be addressed, but with a focus on the issue raised in
      the question. Candidates’ opinions or conclusions will be presented clearly and supported by
      appropriate evidence.


18.   Evaluate the impact of changing social policies in two states, each chosen from a different region.

      The question requires that candidates make an appraisal of the impact of changing social policies
      in two states, weighing up their importance or otherwise. The two states must be from different
      regions. The impact may extend beyond the timeframe but must be clearly linked to the issue
      raised in the question. Candidates may offer equal coverage of the two states or they may prioritize
      their evaluation of one of them. However, both states will be a feature of the response. There may
      be evaluation of the impact of educational policies, such as the abandonment of selection into
      secondary education, broadening access to tertiary education or improving primary provision.
      There may be evaluation of the impact of policies towards women and the family, including
      abortion, marital rights, childcare provision, and access to paid work. There may be evaluation of
      healthcare provision and welfare, and the effectiveness with which poverty was addressed.
      Candidates’ opinions or conclusions will be presented clearly and supported by appropriate
      evidence.

Topic 10: Authoritarian states (20th century)

19.   “The treatment of opposition was the most important factor in the maintenance of power.” Discuss
      with reference to two authoritarian states, each from a different region.

      The question requires that candidates offer a considered and balanced review of the statement
      that the treatment of opposition was the most important factor in the maintenance of power in two
      states. The two authoritarian states must be from different regions. Candidates may refer to the
      importance of eliminating opposition to avoid the rise of political rivals or to avoid controversy over
      domestic and international policies, for example Mao's Cultural Revolution or Stalin's Purges.
      Candidates may refer to the use of propaganda to turn the opposition into an enemy of the nation
      and reinforce the power of the government, for example in Hitler’s propaganda against the KPD
      (German Communist Party). They may also refer to the importance of weakening sections of the
      military to avoid a coup, for example, in Sukarno’s Indonesia. There may be discussion of the
      nature of and threat posed by opposition. Other relevant factors may be discussed, such as
      economic and social factors or the role of leadership, but with a focus on the issue in the question.
      Candidates’ opinions or conclusions will be presented clearly and supported by appropriate
      evidence.


20.   “Full authoritarian control could not be achieved.” With reference to two states, to what extent do
      you agree with this statement.

      The question requires that candidates consider the extent to which full authoritarian control was or
      was not achieved in two states. The two states may or may not come from different regions.
      Candidates may offer equal coverage of the two states or they may prioritize their evaluation of
      one of them. However, both states will be a feature of the response. Candidates may assess the
      extent of rulers’ constitutional power. In Germany, for example, Hitler could make laws without
      requiring the approval of a parliament or superior authority. There may be an assessment of the
      extent of the power of the security forces, such as the NKVD in the USSR, and whether the
      judiciary’s independence had been removed. Candidates may assess the extent both of opposition
      and control over the media, culture, education and social activity. The impact of mass mobilisation,
      such as the Anti movements in China, may be assessed. Candidates’ opinions or conclusions will
      be presented clearly and supported by appropriate evidence.

Topic 11: Causes and effects of 20th century wars

21.   “The most important causes of war were economic.” With reference to two wars, to what extent do
      you agree with this statement?

      The question requires that candidates consider the merits or otherwise of the statement that the
      most important causes of two wars were economic. The wars may or may not come from the same
      region. Causes may predate the timeframe but they must be clearly related to the topic raised in
      the question. Candidates may offer equal coverage of both wars or they may prioritize their
      evaluation of one of them. However, both wars will be a feature of the response. Candidates may
      refer to wars which were a diversion from domestic economic difficulty, such as the Malvinas War
      (Falklands War). Nations may have been protecting or advancing their economic interests, for
      example British protection of Empire in 1914 and Russo–Japanese competition over Manchuria
      and Korea in 1905. Some civil wars, such as in Ireland and China, may partly have been caused
      by the economic disadvantage of sections of the population. Other relevant factors may be
      addressed, such as ideological, political and strategic factors, but with a focus on the issue in the
      question. Candidates’ opinions or conclusions will be presented clearly and supported by
      appropriate evidence.


22.   “Changes to the role and status of women as a result of war were limited.” Discuss with reference
      to two wars, each from a different region.

      The question requires that candidates offer a considered and balanced review of the statement
      that changes to the role and status of women as a result of the war were limited. The two wars
      must be from different regions. Changes may extend beyond the timeframe but they must be
      clearly linked to the issue raised in the question. Candidates may offer equal coverage of both
      wars or they may prioritize their discussion of one of them. However, both wars will be a feature of
      the response. Candidates may refer to the static or changing roles assumed by women in the
      wartime or post-war economy. Candidates may choose a total war in which women replaced men
      or a limited war with little significant change. Candidates may also consider movements (such as
      the suffragettes) and the rights acquired in post-war periods. Candidates may propose that
      changes were neither long lasting nor uniformly experienced across social classes or geographic
      areas. Candidates’ opinions or conclusions will be presented clearly and supported by appropriate
      evidence.

Topic 12: The Cold War: Superpower tensions and rivalries (20th century)

23.   Evaluate the factors which led to detente between the US and USSR between 1971 and 1979.

      The question requires that candidates make an appraisal of factors which contributed to détente
      between the US and USSR between 1971 and 1979, weighing up their importance or otherwise.
      Factors may predate the timeframe but they must be clearly linked to the issue raised in the
      question. Candidates may refer to the financial benefits of reducing arms expenditure for a US
      drained by the Vietnam War and for a USSR that faced a stalled economy and weak satellite
      states. With regard to military factors, both countries were deeply aware of their nuclear
      capabilities (MAD: mutually assured destruction), and having achieved parity, were more prepared
      to discuss arms limitation. Candidates may also refer to political factors such as the US potential
      gain from the Sino–Soviet split by fostering separate relationships with both countries whilst driving
      them further apart; the Soviet wish to secure American recognition of the post-war borders of its
      satellite states; the impact of Ostpolitik which had relaxed tension in Europe and encouraged trade.
      Candidates’ opinions or conclusions will be presented clearly and supported by appropriate
      evidence.


24.   Discuss the impact of two Cold War crises on superpower rivalry.

      The question requires that candidates offer a considered and balanced review of the impact of two
      Cold War crises on superpower rivalry. The two crises may or may not be from the same region.
      Impact may extend beyond the timeframe but it must be clearly linked to the issue raised in the
      question. Candidates may offer equal coverage of both crises or they may prioritize their
      discussion of one of them. However, both crises will be a feature of the response. Candidates may
      refer to the impact of a Cold War crisis in positioning superpowers in opposing camps, for instance
      the Berlin Blockade. Candidates could discuss the impact of crises like Korea (1950) or Congo
      (1960–61) that brought the struggle to new regions, and/or involved the UN in Cold War tensions. It
      would be valid for candidates to discuss the different aspects of crisis, for example Cuba (1962)
      and refer to the negative impact of brinkmanship or to the compromise reached in Turkey. Other
      crises, like Hungary (1956) and Prague Spring (1968), provided an opportunity to discuss steps
      taken by a superpower to deal with perceived challenges to their influence and international
      reactions. Candidates’ opinions or conclusions will be presented clearly and supported by
      appropriate evidence.
