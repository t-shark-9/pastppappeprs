Examiners should be aware that in some cases, candidates may take a different approach, which if
appropriate should be rewarded. If in doubt, check with your team leader.

In the case of an “identify” question read all answers and mark positively up to the maximum marks.
Disregard incorrect answers. In all other cases where a question asks for a certain number of facts
eg “describe two kinds”, mark the first two correct answers. This could include two descriptions,
one description and one identification, or two identifications.

• It should be recognized that, given time constraints, answers for part (c) questions are likely to include
  a much narrower range of issues and concepts than identified in the markband. There is no “correct”
  answer. Examiners must be prepared to award full marks to answers which synthesize and evaluate
  even if they do not examine all the stimulus material.

     Note to examiners:
     • All part (a) questions are marked using ticks and annotations where appropriate.
     • Part (b) and part (c) are marked using markbands. Use annotations and text comments to
       provide a rationale behind the marks you awarded. Do not use ticks.

     (a)   When a user wants to make a payment with the Swish app, the app will need to
           collect data about the transaction.

           (i)    Identify two items of data that the app could collect from the user making
                  the payment.                                                                  [2]

                  Answers may include:
                  • the name of the person making the payment / username / ID Number
                    (accept other personal identifiers)
                  • password
                  • phone number of the person making the payment
                  • bank account to be used for the transaction (in the case that there is
                    more than one account linked to the Swish app)
                  • amount of the transaction/cost of the item
                  • message (to indicate what the transaction was for) / personal greeting
                    card.
                  • name of person receiving the payment
                  • Swish account details / phone number of the person receiving the
                    payment.

                  Note: Do not accept data that are system generated, e.g., date/time of
                  transaction, transaction id, etc.

                  Award [1] for identifying each item of data that the app would collect from
                  the user making the payment up to maximum of [2] marks.

           (ii)   Identify the steps taken by the app to make the payment into the bank
                  account of the person receiving the money.                                    [4]

                  Answers may include:
                  • user is verified
                  • buyer ’s / payer’s bank account is accessed (by the app)
                  • authorization from the bank for the amount required – amount of the
                    transaction is compared to the amount of money/credit available in the
                    buyer’s bank account
                  • authorization from the bank for the amount required – amount of the
                    transaction is compared to the limit the bank permits for Swish
                    transactions
                  • determine the seller’s / payee’s bank in order to initiate a transfer
                  • if authorized, then transfer of money from buyer’s bank to seller’s bank
                  • if not authorized, then error message (to buyer and seller)
                  • message sent (to buyer and seller) to confirm transaction.

                  Award [1] for identifying each step taken by the app to complete the
                  transaction up to maximum of [4] marks.

(b)   Explain why it is important that any data sharing agreement between the Swish
      app and the Swedish banks has policies that address both the storing and
      sharing of app users’ data.                                                        [6]

      Answers may include:
      Storing:
         • to ensure that data is protected by a strong security network (firewalls,
            anti-malware protection, encryption etc)
         • to provide strong security for any machines that have access to the data
         • to ensure that access to data is restricted to people who have a need to
            know
         • to provide protections against loss of data are in place
         • to provide protections against any attacks aimed at stealing or changing
            the data
         • to provide a plan for backup and recovery.
         • to make sure that only relevant data is stored
         • to prevent data being stored after people have left the Swish platform.
         • to make sure that data being stored adheres to data protection laws as
            governed in specific locations, e.g., data stored in Sweden follows GDPR

      Sharing:
        • to ensure that data is only shared with the consent of the app users
        • to ensure that any data shared should be anonymized as far as possible to
            prevent the identity of the app user being determined
        • to ensure that app users should be informed if there are any additional
            organizations that their data may be shared with and for what purpose
        • to ensure that data will be shared using secure means.

      Award [1] for a reason why it is important that any data sharing agreement
      between the Swish app and the Swedish banks has policies that address the
      processing/sharing of app users’ data and [2] for developments of that reason up
      to maximum of [3] marks.

(c)   Many people in Sweden have seen the advantages of using the Swish app. It
      allows friends to share a restaurant bill, to pay where credit or debit cards are not
      accepted, to easily pay for babysitting or parking tickets, or make a donation at
      church. However, some people in Sweden have expressed concerns about not
      using cash and making the Swish app the only means of payment.

      To what extent do the advantages of the Swish app as the only means of
      payment outweigh the disadvantages.                                                     [8]

      Answers may include:
      Advantages of using Swish:
        • no need to carry cash / credit cards – no risk of being stolen/no risk of not
           having enough cash
        • no risk of credit card being used fraudulently
        • transactions are recorded – there is proof of payment
        • payments can be done immediately – no need to wait until person has
           time to go to bank to get cash
        • can solve other problems regarding money – bills can be shared, one
           person pays and money is transferred
        • in an emergency money can be transferred to dependents without them
           being close (eg children at university)
        • allows money transactions between individuals
        • transfers of money are in real time (instantly) and free of charge
        • amount of money to be transferred is limited thus minimising the loss of
           money.
        • many people are already used to the app so it would be a good choice if
           the country were going cashless.
        • easier for users to track budgets / spending as all transactions are on one
           app.

      Disadvantages of using Swish:
         • Swedish banks will be able to obtain more data on their users’ transaction
            habits (privacy concern)
         • is not available to people who do not have a bank account so a potential
            digital divide concern
         • it only works within Sweden, or people who have a Swedish bank account
            so may be problematic for tourists
         • removes the anonymity of the payee in transactions – Swish stores a
            user’s transaction history. This would include date, item, recipient of the
            money and cost of the item
         • the bank controls the maximum amount of money that can be transferred
            – this may limit a person’s spending
         • the transition from a society that uses cash for transactions to one that
            does not may not be possible and in trying to make this transition it may
            cause considerable harm to many citizens.
         • use of the Swish app (specifically) would give the company an unfair
            monopoly over the technology
         • Digital Divide – smartphones ownership and use by mature adults
         • if a person loses his/her phone or breaks it or its battery runs out, he/she
            has no way to pay for anything.
         • failure in / lack of phone network coverage could affect when and where
            people could use the app.
         • Failure of the system / technical issues / down time which would prevent
            people from making transactions.
      Accept implicit and explicit references to the Swish app.

2.   Automatic crop watering system

     (a)   (i)    Identify three characteristics of proprietary software.                            [3]

                  Answers may include:
                    • software is copyrighted
                    • commercial software
                    • relicensing, distribution or copying is prohibited
                    • the user/organization must accept the agreement prior to installing or
                      using the software
                    • requires a subscription or monthly fee
                    • has customer support and maintenance of the software provided by
                      its developers as part of the purchase of the software.

                  Award [1] for identifying each characteristic of proprietary software up to
                  maximum of [3] marks.

           (ii)   A computer program uses the data provided by the rain sensor to decide
                  whether to water the trees. Identify the steps in this program.                    [3]

                  Answers may include:
                    • the sensor gathers analog data
                    • the analog data is converted into digital data
                    • the computer compares the data to a preset level within the program
                      to determine if it is raining.

                    Either:
                    o if it is raining the computer program will not start/will stop watering
                    o if it is not raining the watering continues as programmed.

                   Or:
                   o if the ground reaches a certain dampness then the watering is
                       stopped
                   o if the ground has not reached a certain dampness then the watering
                       continues as programmed.

                  Award [1] for identifying each step the computer program will use when
                  deciding whether to water the trees up to maximum of [3] marks.

(b)   Water is becoming increasingly scarce in Chacra Province and the provincial
      government is concerned there will be a point when there is not enough water for
      all of the farms to water their crops or fruit trees.

      To manage water for the watering of crops and fruit trees, the provincial
      government of Chacra Province intends to create a computer model to calculate
      how much water each farm in the province will receive.

      Explain three factors that will contribute to the accuracy of the model.                [6]

      Answers may include:
        • quality of data input
        • high quality data will allow for a more accurate model to be developed as
           this data will be more reliable / current water levels within each area must
           be accurate.

         •   frequency of readings taken
         •   more frequent readings may be able to pick up more subtle changes in the
             patterns of rainfall to increase the accuracy of the model / if we take daily
             readings and use these to create the model, that will be more accurate
             that monthly readings.

         •   number of variables taken into account when developing the model
         •   more variables will enable other, potentially less important, factors to be
             considered when developing the model / what crops are farmed in
             different areas in the province / the weather conditions in different areas of
             the province.

         •   number of assumptions that have been built into the model
         •   if any of the assumptions are weak or false the model will be inaccurate.

         •   quantity of data input
         •   if the sample of data is larger, then the resulting model would be more
             accurate / spans several years.

      Award [1] for identifying a factor that will contribute to the accuracy of the model
      and [1] for explanation why that will contribute to the accuracy of the model up to
      maximum of [2] marks.

      OR

      Award [1] for each example given and an additional [1] if the explanation
      contributes to the accuracy of the model up to a maximum of [2] marks.

      Mark as [2] + [2] + [2]

      Check with your team leader before accepting additional answers.

(c)   The farmers of Chacra Province are concerned about the provincial government
      using a computer model to determine the amount of water they will be allowed to
      use to water their fruit trees.

      To what extent should the farmers of Chacra Province rely on their knowledge
      and experience, rather than the computer-based solution provided by the
      provincial government, to manage the watering of the fruit trees?                 [8]

      Answers may include:
      Knowledge and experience will:
        • allow the farmers to see more than water needs for a plant (sick leaves,
           buds falling, etc) without needing to develop a model
        • be able to include other factors that may arise from time to time such as
           quality of the water (eg coming with mud) and adjust their watering
           accordingly
        • be able to resolve potential issues that cannot be programmed into the
           computer, or would be outside of the scope of a computational solution
        • provide expertise that cannot be quantified/ensure that in a worst-case
           scenario some of the farmers will be able to grow crops/trees.

      Use of the provincial model will:
        • allow water to be distributed evenly between the farmers on a “needs”
            basis rather than based on the opinions of one or two stronger characters
        • a scientific approach has limits (e.g. there may be variables which the
            model does not take into account), the decisions around the water
            requirements of the trees may be based as much on intuition as
            algorithms and models.
        • model may be biased or influenced by politics e.g. farmers may not have
            fully disclosed their data / government may favour certain groups or
            industries.

      Use of the proprietary computer system will:
        • reduce the amount of time farmers need to spend visibly checking their
            fields
        • allow exact water usage to be measured and lead to potential efficiencies
            in its usage
        • will provide quantitative data that could be used as a model for other
            farmers growing the same trees in similar locations.

3.   Technology disruption in Orams Academy

     (a)   (i)     Identify two characteristics of cloud-based storage.                             [2]

                   Answers may include:
                     • data is stored on remote servers accessed from the internet, or
                       "cloud”
                     • data can be accessed from anywhere as long as the person has an
                       Internet connection
                     • online space allows users to store data, photos, music, and videos
                     • documents stored in the cloud can be shared with others (most of the
                       time) instead of sending them via emails
                     • cloud storage providers may provide other services like backups
                     • requires a username and password for access.

                   Award [1] for each characteristic of cloud-based storage identified up to [2]
                   marks.

           (ii)    Identify two reasons why there might be a lack of bandwidth at times on the
                   school’s network.                                                                [2]

(c)   Discuss whether Daniela should make every teacher at Orams Academy use the
      same learning platform or she should allow each teacher to choose their own
      preferred learning management approach.                                                 [8]

      Answers may include:
      A single learning platform:
         • means that all of the information is centralized and can be easily accessed
           by staff, students and parents
         • the training requirements for staff are reduced as they only have to use one
           system
         • prevents the use of a range of formats that may be incompatible meaning
           that resources cannot be shared, or may need adapting to work on a
           different platform
         • having a common learning platform would make it convenient for the IT
           dept. to take backup/restore and roll-over data to new academic year.
         • makes it easier for senior managers to monitor the actions of staff, to view
           lessons etc for consistency
         • can be integrated into any acceptable-user policy or training requirements
         • may be costly and based on proprietary software meaning that fixes could
           be expensive and take a long time to happen
         • if the single platform is inaccessible for any reason, then all learning
           content would be inaccessible.

      Teachers choosing their own preferred learning management approach:
        • allows teachers to use their expertise of particular tools
        • allows teachers to feel they are being allowed to use their creativity and
          innovative approach to the teaching and learning
        • may integrate with social media tools that may be blocked by the school
          and provide a better user experience
        • may provide better functionality than a “one size fits all” approach
        • may lead to staff or students working outside of an acceptable-user
          policy/using the sites inappropriately
        • the training requirements for staff will be increased if the staff are unfamiliar
          with the platforms / training will only occur on an ad hoc basis / training
          might be decreased since staff are already familiar with the tools they
          choose to use
        • expertise of a platform may depend on particular teachers – if they leave
          then no one may be able to support students with this tool.

                    • first test of new hardware or software
                    • main goal is to refine the product by fixing bugs before releasing to
                      the public
                    • generally done “in house” ie, not by users outside the company
                    • could be done by the developers themselves.

(b)   DidYouSayThat has created a number of prototypes of their voice synthesis
      software.

      Explain three reasons why DidYouSayThat would have used prototypes during
      the development of their voice synthesis software.                                   [6]

      Answers may include:
       • allows failure to take place early in the process ie, identify problems that
          might have been missed
       • so significant costs are not incurred in the creation of a product that is
          flawed.

         • resolve conflicts between different development teams
         • the teams may be forced to appreciate that compromises are required, or
            see the impact of one aspect of the design on the other therefore moving
            the development forward.

         • allows the possibility of estimating production costs, time to create,
           necessary skills and resources.
         • makes the process more efficient and more likely to succeed.

         • allows for early feedback from users
         • reveals how usable and valuable the product will be to the user.

         • reduces the redoing of the work
         • saves time and money.

         • potential investors/customers can see the end product
         • they may be more likely to invest in it.

         • patents can be discussed early
         • this can take place before other companies begin using the ideas for
            competitive products.

      Award [1] for a reason why DidYouSayThat would have used prototypes in the
      development of their voice synthesis software and [1] for a development of that
      reason up to maximum of [2] marks.

(c)   Law professor John Silverman commented, as humans we tend to believe what we
      see and the increased number of tools to make fake media that is unrecognizable
      from real media is going to prove a challenge in the future.

      DidYouSayThat is aware of the ethical implications of this voice synthesis
      technology. Their ethics policy states that with great innovation comes great
      responsibility.

      To what extent should DidYouSayThat be accountable for the fake videos posted
      by users of their software on social media platforms?                               [8]

      Answers may include:
        • DidYouSayThat has positioned itself as a responsible developer, therefore
           they should be “practicing what they preach” and act responsibly by being
           accountable for the content that is posted using their software
        • it is unrealistic, however well intentioned, for DidYouSayThat to be
           accountable for the content of the videos
        • if the end-user agreement stated explicitly that the user would be
           accountable, would that clause be enforceable by DidYouSayThat?
        • it is hard to determine at what point that DidYouSayThat would be
           accountable, because the software itself does not have the capability to
           cause harm, it is the user
        • at what point is a video considered fake, is a spoof video a fake video?
        • although there may be no legal requirement for DidYouSayThat to monitor
           the videos of users of their software, there may be ethical reasons why
           they should.

           (iii)   Expert systems use inference rules.

                   Identify two characteristics of inference rules.                               [2]

                   Answers may include:
                     • inference rules are based on two possible outcomes
                     • it uses chaining to develop an understanding of complex behaviour or
                       information requests from simple requests such as “does A apply?”
                       with possible answers being “Yes” or “No”
                     • inference rules are based on exact matches rather than a range of
                       possible responses
                     • logical form of statements that draw a conclusion.

(b)   (i)    Explain how the quality of the data collected can affect the effectiveness of
             a knowledge base.                                                               [3]

             Answers may include:
               • data needs to be collected from a number of reliable sources
               • the data must be able to reflect the most likely scenarios that would
                 be found when assessing the financial products of Mearlet Finances
               • if this does not occur, the expert system will not function as intended
               • however, if Mearlet Finances does not fit the “standard” model used
                 by finance companies the expert system will be less effective.

             Award [1] for identifying one reason how the quality of the data collected
             can affect the effectiveness of a knowledge base and [1] for each
             subsequent development of that reason up to [3].

      (ii)   Explain why the failure to update data within its knowledge base may cause
             problems for Mearlet Finances.                                                  [3]

             Answers may include:
               • if new financial policies are introduced this will mean that the expert
                 system will become increasingly less expert
               • it may have knock-on effects to other areas of the business as more
                 customers will find that the information they have been given is
                 imperfect
               • this will have negative effects on the customer satisfaction of Mearlet

(c)   Since the introduction of the expert system, Mearlet Finances has been able to
      offer a wider range of financial plans. This has attracted more customers.
      However, Alia believes that the current expert system may not be able to cope
      with the increased size and complexity of the business.

      Alia is considering two options:
      • Option 1: Purchase a new version of the MF expert system, MF v2.0.
      • Option 2: Purchase a new artificial intelligence (AI) system that uses machine
         learning.

      Evaluate these two options.                                                            [8]

      Answers may include:
      Advantages of Option 1:
        • an upgraded expert system is less risky than an AI system
        • an upgrade will not require as extensive staff training
        • an upgrade should be able to be integrated seamlessly with existing IT
          systems
        • an upgrade can be implemented more quickly
        • since the system is being applied to a specific domain, it could be the
          cheapest alternative.

      Disadvantages of Option 1:
         • expert systems are inherently rigid so this one may well be outdated quickly
         • the system will require continual upgrades
         • a chain of if/then rules is too limited and does not allow for complexity.

      Advantages of Option 2:
        • the AI system may be more futureproof than the upgraded expert system
        • machine learning can adapt to new situations
        • AI learns by trial and error rather than applying inference rules, so it is more
          flexible.

      Disadvantages of Option 2:
         • may be much costlier than an expert system
         • often even the experts do not fully understand the decision that the
           software makes
         • training an AI system requires significant amounts of data.

      In part (c) of this question it is expected there will be a balance in the ITGS
      terminology between IT technical terminology and the terminology related to
      social and ethical impacts.

                  Answers may include:
                    • the developers of pepper did not train Pepper beyond the most
                      commonly used dialects/accents
                    • therefore, there may be groups of people whose accent is outside of

                    •   Pepper was not programmed with basic information at the store
                    •   such as the location of various items.

                    •   Pepper was not tested with stakeholders ie, customers in the store
                    •   so designers were unable to ensure that Pepper could answer the
                        customer’s questions.

                  Award [1] for a reason why Pepper could not answer a customer’s question
                  in a supermarket and [1] for a development of that reason up to maximum
                  of [2] marks.

           (ii)   Pepper was developed using an agile development methodology.

                  Outline two reasons why an agile development methodology would have
                  been used for the development of Pepper.                                      [4]

                  Answers may include:
                    • problems are caught early and taken care of before beta testing
                    • clients can provide feedback throughout the process
                    • allows for changes to be made after the initial planning
                    • easier to add a feature that will keep the project up to date with the
                      later developments in the area
                    • faster implementation and delivery time.

                  Award [1] for a reason why an agile project management methodology
                  would have been used for the development of Pepper and [1] for a
                  development of that reason up to maximum of [2] marks.

 (b)    Pepper could use either machine learning or rule-based learning for its natural
        language processing.

        Analyse these two options.                                                                  [6]

        Answers may include:
          • rule based learning has a finite set of words, phrases etc
          • rule based learning is dependent on the initial dataset created in Pepper
             and cannot be extended to address differences in accent/dialect, changes
             to the nature of language
          • rule-based learning is a “safe” option and may be appropriate in certain
             circumstances
          • rule based learning systems are not scalable
          • can operate with basic information and data.

           •   machine learning is able to adapt to different situations , constantly
               evolves
           •   machine learning can be customized for different groups in different
               locations so Pepper can be optimized for use
           •   machine learning can add new terms to Pepper's lexicon
           •   machine learning may be unsupervised - Pepper may be usable by only a
               small number of people who share linguistic similarities.
           •   machine learning systems are scalable
           •   requires more data than rule-based learning.

(c)   King Robotics is planning to use robots in schools. The robots will use a unique
      approach called “care-receiving”. In this approach to teaching the robot does not
      directly instruct the student, instead the robot makes mistakes and asks the
      student for help to correct them. Early studies have found that children respond
      very positively to this approach. The robots will also be able to carry out direct
      teaching activities.

      Evaluate the advantages and disadvantages of using robots such as Pepper to
      support the care-receiving teaching approach as well as carrying out direct
      teaching activities.                                                                 [8]

      Answers may include:
      Advantages:
        • students often respond better to robots as they are very motivating. For
           example, students who are very shy often respond to robots
        • robots that make mistakes may help with special needs children such as
           those with autism
        • by teaching a robot that is less intelligent, children can reinforce their own
           learning. We learn by teaching others
        • the robot’s need will inspire care-taking behavior in the children
        • student’s will want to play with the robot and will feel less pressured to
           perform correctly
        • robots can provide individual attention, so students can learn at their own
           pace
        • robots can coexist with teachers in the classroom serving as assistants
        • if there is a shortage of teachers, then robots can fill in the gap especially
           for teaching repetitive material
        • robots do not have emotions, so they are not affected by health or
           emotional issues.

      Disadvantages:
         • robots can’t inspire students the way human teachers can. They can’t
            teach with passion and emotion
         • robots can’t respond to children being nervous, upset, excited or loud
         • robots can’t create opportunities for students to collaborate and work
            together in the classroom
         • robots can have privacy concerns as they can record the student’s actions
            and voice
         • teachers have responsibilities and a duty of care which robots cannot take
            over
         • teachers may not trust the robots and therefore won’t allow them in the
            classroom.
         • students may not trust the robot and therefore will not participate
         • cost - robots are likely to have a high cost to buyout and also to maintain
            the robot.
         • cost - a team will be needed to control the robot if it stops working and
            fixing certain parts will also be costly to the school.
         • robots could lead to the reduction in staffing.
         • robots may not understand what a student is saying (accents, volume
            level, etc) and students may become frustrated.
         • robots may malfunction, run out of power, etc.
