                                                  Section A

                                                  Section A

1.   (a)   State two features of a cooperative.                                                     [2]

           Co-operatives are businesses owned and run by and for their members. The
           members may be customers, employees or residents. All members have an
           equal say in what the business does and a share in the profits.

           Award [1] for each feature identified – no reference to Hafs is needed:
           • Profits are shared amongst members
           • Members share decision making
           • Each member has the same voting rights on decisions
           • Members are owners of the business
           • Operate in the private sector

     N.B. If a candidate states that a cooperative is a social enterprise, accept that point as
          one feature for [1].

     (b)   Using Figure 1:

           (i)     explain what the y axis shows;                                                   [2]

                   Award [1] for a correct label or naming of revenue and costs and a second
                   mark for a full explanation, such as “The Y-axis represents both the
                   forecasted cost and revenue figures for Hafs. As its sales or output or
                   activity increases (x-axis), Hafs has higher revenue and higher total costs,
                   which can be determined by their relationship to the Y-axis and its scale.
                   Wording does not have to be exactly as above. Maximum award: [2].

           (ii)    calculate the forecasted profit if sales are 25 000 units in 2021 (show all
                   your working);                                                                   [2]

                   The level of profit if sales are 25 000 units in 2021 is
                   TR = $250 000 TC = $175 000 [1]
                   = $75 000 [1]

                   Candidates that do not show any working and simply write 75 000 can only
                   be awarded [1].

           (iii)   calculate the total contribution in 2021 if Hafs only sells 20 000 units (show
                   all your working).                                                               [2]

                   Total contribution is the difference between total sales revenue and total
                   variable costs.

                   At an output of 20 000 units TR = $200 000
                   TVC = $100 000 (TC = $150 000; TFC = $50 000)
                   = $200 000 – $100 000
                   = $100 000

                   To calculate TVC, take total costs and subtract fixed costs, as follows
                   $150 000 minus $50 000 = $100 000
                                             –5–                 M21/3/BUSMT/SP2/ENG/TZ0/XX/M


            Candidates that do not show any working and simply write 100 000 can
            only be awarded [1].



(c)   Explain whether an increase in total fixed costs has an impact on unit
      contribution.                                                                         [2]

      Award [1] for a statement such as “it will have no impact”.

      Award a further [1] for an explanation such as “unit contribution is the difference
      between the selling price and its variable cost, therefore an increase in fixed
      costs will have no impact on unit contribution”.
                                                     –6–                M21/3/BUSMT/SP2/ENG/TZ0/XX/M


2.   (a)   Describe one step in the development of a brand.                                        [2]

           Common steps in developing a brand include:
           • consideration of the business’ strategy
           • identification of the target market
           • doing market research
           • focusing on any one of the four Ps for purposeful positioning
           • development of market vision around the USP
           • selection of a name and logo
           • development of a marketing strategy.

           Accept any other relevant step. Candidates do not have to use identical wording
           to the above.

           Award [1] for identification of a step and [2] for an appropriate description of it.

     (b)   Calculate:

           (i)    which store made the highest net profit before interest and tax (no working
                  required);                                                                       [1]

                              Store 1             Store 2              Store 3
                              $90 000            $103 000              $85 000
                             –$66 000            –$76 000            –$67 000
                              $24 000              $27 000             $18 000

                  Store 2 made the highest profit.

                  Award [1] for the correct answer. Working not required.

           (ii)   which store had the highest profitability (show all your working).               [2]

                   $24 000
                           = 13.33 %
                  $180 000

                   $27 000
                           = 12.11 %
                  $223 000

                   $18 000
                           = 10.59 %
                  $170 000

                  Store 1 had the highest profitability.

                  Award [1] for correct working and [1] for correct answer. Own figure rule
                  applies.

                  On this question, to get marks for correct working, candidates must provide
                  all three calculations and perform all three calculations correctly. Disregard
                  minor errors of rounding provided that those errors are irrelevant to correct
                  determination of which store had the highest profitability.
                                               –7–                 M21/3/BUSMT/SP2/ENG/TZ0/XX/M


(c)   Calculate:

      (i)    TPS’ equity;                                                                   [1]

             $200 000 [total assets] – $120 000 [total liabilities] = Equity
                                                                    = $80 000

             Award [1] for the correct answer.

      (ii)   TPS’ return on capital employed (ROCE) (show all your working).                [2]

             Step 1: add up the profits from the three stores.

             $24 000 + $27 000 + $18 000 = $69 000

             Step 2: Calculate ROCE.

                             $69 000
                                                        = 53.08 %
             $50 000 (loan capital) + $80 000 Equity 

             Award [1] for correct working and [1] for correct answer. Own figure rule
             applies.

(d)   Explain one effect that the $50 000 long-term debt may have on TPS’ profit and
      loss account.                                                                         [2]

      The $50 000 in long-term debt would have to be repaid with interest. That interest
      expense would have three effects:
      • The interest expense would be subtracted from net profit before interest and
        tax, thereby lowering TPS’ net profit before tax.
      • The corporate tax rate would be applied to TPS’ net profit before tax. Because
        this figure is lower than it would have been had TPS not had an interest
        expense, TPS’ income tax expense is reduced.
      • Because a tax rate is less than 100 %, the interest expense is greater than the
        tax savings. Therefore, TPS’ net profit after interest and tax is lower than it
        would have been had TPS not had an interest expense.

      Award [1] for identification of an effect (or demonstration of some understanding).
      The candidate has to link interest expense (from the debt) to the profit and loss
      account and/or to changes in tax. Award an additional [1] for a complete, clear
      explanation. Candidates do not have to explain all three of the bulleted points
      above, only one.
                                                  –8–                M21/3/BUSMT/SP2/ENG/TZ0/XX/M


                                         Section B
3.   (a)   State three of Buzza’s main business functions.                                      [2]

           Possible answers include:
           • human resources
           • finance (and accounts)
           • marketing
           • operations
           • management

           Candidates must use the traditional business functions, such as those noted
           above (or others which are traditionally listed in textbooks). Do not accept terms
           inspired by the stimulus itself (R & D, for example).

           For [2], candidates must state 3 (or more) of the above.
           For [1], candidates must state 2 of the above.
           If a candidate states only one business function, award [0].

     (b)   Explain one advantage and one disadvantage to Buzza of operating as a
           partnership.                                                                         [4]

           Advantages include:
           • Partners can each have different skills, which benefits the business. In this
             case, Jo is a gifted designer and therefore brought key sills to the design side
             of the business, whilst Demi is a business graduate and will know much more
             about how to run a business.
           • More capital is available for the business than when set up as a sole trader.

           Disadvantages include:
           • There is a risk of disagreements amongst partners.
           • The amount of capital that can be raised is limited unless additional partners
              are taken on and in this case the partnership lacked the finance needed for
              expansion.
           • The liability of the partners for the debts of the business is unlimited.

           Each partner is liable for actions by other partners.

           Accept any other relevant advantage or disadvantage.

           Mark as 2 + 2.

           For [2], candidates must identify an advantage or a disadvantage, explain it, and
           apply it to the stimulus.

     (c)   Explain one advantage and one disadvantage of the high labour turnover of
           designers at Buzza.                                                                  [4]

           Advantages and disadvantages can apply to Buzza OR to the designers
           themselves.

           Advantages include:
           • Buzza has a constant supply of new designers with fresh ideas, which is good
             for the business. The fact that the average age of the design team is 26 is
             evidence of the constant supply of new designers.
                                           –9–                 M21/3/BUSMT/SP2/ENG/TZ0/XX/M


      • The “threat” of not having a contract renewed may act as a motivator for
        designers, a situation that benefits Buzza as they will have a very focussed
        team of designers – only 50 % of designers on average gets contracts
        renewed so they know they are under pressure to perform.
      • Buzza does not have to deal with the problem of under-performing designers
        in the long-term as they can simply not renew designers’ 12-month contracts.
        This situation also allows Buzza to avoid the need for redundancy payments.

      Disadvantages include:
      • Buzza will need to continually recruit new designers, which can be expensive
         and time consuming as 50 % of new recruits on average do not have their
         contracts renewed.
      • Labour turnover figures, with 50 % not having contracts renewed, may act to
         discourage some potential good designers from applying and Buzza may lose
         out on potentially gifted designers as other exclusive brands have a lower
         labour turnover figures and may attract applications from such graduates.
      • The high labour turnover figures may cause insecurity amongst the workforce
         and demotivate designers who feel under pressure particularly if after three
         seasons they have not had a design accepted.

      Accept any other relevant advantage or disadvantage.

      Mark as 2 + 2.

      For [2], candidates must identify ad advantage or a disadvantage, explain it, and
      apply it to the stimulus.

(d)   Discuss the two options that Jo and Demi are considering.                           [10]

      Option 1: Sell surplus products at greatly reduced prices via its website.
      • This option has the advantage of increasing revenue as out of season stock is
        sold and at least raises some revenue, even though it will be far less than the
        original price charged.
      • It also avoids the need to destroy stock in an incinerator and may improve the
        business’s image amongst consumers who dislike the idea of perfectly good
        products being burnt, which is a waste of resources and potentially damaging
        to the environment.
      • However, Option 1 can seriously affect the brand’s image amongst wealthy
        consumers– Buzza a highly desirable and exclusive brand bought by wealthy
        consumers – who may take issue with their ‘status symbol’ fashion items
        being sold to less affluent consumers. Desertion of the brand by current
        customers to could seriously undermine the brand image and lead to lost
        sales at high prices charged in approved outlets.
      • The approved retail outlets that sell Buzza products may also object as they
        may lose sales as some wealthy customers may delay purchasing until the
        products they want are sold at much lower prices on the Buzza website.
        These outlets may no longer wish to stock Buzza products, affecting Buzza
        sales, profits and reputation.

      Option 2: Break down returned products to recover raw materials to re-use
      in future products. This process will be costly.
      • This option avoids the need to burn products and therefore will impress those
         who see burning stock as a waste of resources and damaging to the
         environment and will therefore answer social media critics.
                                       – 10 –              M21/3/BUSMT/SP2/ENG/TZ0/XX/M


 • This option is better for Buzza’s brand reputation amongst the wealthy
   consumers as they will not face the prospects of having their exclusive
   products also being worn by those on less in reputation as perfectly good
   products will not be broken up.
 • However, this option is a costly method. Not all materials that are recovered
   may be suitable for use in new season products and so there may still be
   considerable waste.

 No details are provided as to the actual costs of incineration or of breaking down
 products to re-use in future season products. Candidates in the 7+ mark range
 would be expected to refer to this and the need for more information before
 coming to a final decision.

4.   (a)   Define the term niche market.                                                       [2]

           A niche market is a small market segment. The products are usually specialised,
           aimed at satisfying specific market needs for a well-defined segment of the
           population.

           Candidates are not expected to word their responses exactly as above.
           If a candidate uses the word smaller rather than small, accept.

           Award [1] for some understanding.

           Award [2] for a clear definition.

     (b)   Explain two benefits to RV of the decision to adopt e-commerce.                     [4]

           Benefits must be to RV not just to customers – a benefit to a customer can only
           be rewarded if the answers goes on to explain how this benefit also helps the
           business
           For example, stating that a website allows the customer to view the business
           products 24x7 (or to place orders from the comfort of their own home) is on its
           own not rewardable. The candidate would need to go on to state that this
           situation may lead to increased orders for RV bicycles for the response to be
           rewardable.

           Benefits may include:
           • Lowering costs – RV can reduce the need for employing staff to handle orders
             or take phone calls.
           • Providing abundant information – There are limitations to the amount of
             information that can be displayed in a physical store. It is difficult to equip
             employees to respond to customers who require information across product
             lines. E-commerce websites can make additional information easily available
             to customers. Most of this information is provided by vendors and does not
             cost anything to create or maintain. Will also help overcome problems that RV
             faced eg RV received an increasing number of customer complaints that
             phone lines were often engaged and calls not returned.
           • Being open 24x7, which may increase orders as customers can order anytime.
           • Making the business more visible – currently 98 % of customers are within
             5 miles of RV’s business.

           Accept any other relevant benefit.

           Award [1] for stating a benefit to RV from adopting e-commerce and an additional
           [1] for its explanation with reference to RV. Award a maximum of [2] per benefit.

           Mark as 2 + 2. Maximum award: [4].

(c)   (i)    Calculate the payback period if RV chooses Option 2 (show all your
             working).                                                                       [2]

             The payback is:

             Payback formula =     initial investment
                                 net cash flow per year
               $3 500 000
             = $600 000

             = 5 years and 10 months OR 5.833 years

             OR

             $3.5
             $0.6

             = 5 years and 10 months OR 5.833 years

             Award [1] for correct formula (with or without figures)

             OR

             Award [1] for correct figures but incorrect final answer

                   $3.5
             (eg        = 5.5 years).
                   $0.6

             Award [2] for correct answer with working.

      (ii)   Explain one disadvantage to RV of using the payback period method of
             investment appraisal.                                                           [2]

             One disadvantage is that the payback method fails to take into account the
             time value of money and adjust the cash inflows accordingly. [1]
             Though the forecasted net returns each year are $600 000, the inflation in
             the country is forecast to remain in the 2–3 % range for the next three
             years. Therefore, the real value of the annual $600 000 will be less in years
             1 to 3, thus overstating the return on the investment.

             Also, the payback analysis fails to consider inflows of cash that occur
             beyond the payback period [1] – in this case we are not told the life of the
             investment so we cannot see how much the net returns will be for the life of
             the investment [1].

             Award [1] for a disadvantage of the payback method and [1] for its
             application to RV.

(d)   Recommend whether RV’s directors should choose Option 1 or Option 2.                   [10]

      Option 1 advantages:
      RV will have lower production costs as production costs are lower in China. This
      option will help the business deal with the low-priced imports.

      It will allow RV to concentrate on design and marketing, which may enable it to
      improve its designs and marketing and, thus, increase sales.

      Option 1 disadvantages:
      The Chinese factory uses batch production, which will affect RV’s ability to
      produce bicycles that fit their customer’s demands. Currently, RV can meet
      customer demands because the business uses job production.

      RV will no longer have control over production and quality standards may
      deteriorate.

      Transport issues from China will mean that RV will not be able to deliver bicycles
      to customers within 7 days of receipt of their orders. RV’s advertising slogan will
      need to change as the business will no longer hand make orders in the USA.

      Option 2 advantages:
      RV will have lower production costs because it will no longer need expensive,
      skilled labour. Lower costs will help the business deal with the low-priced imports.

      Production will remain in the USA and it can retain job production.

      RV will likely not have delivery time issues.

      Option 2 disadvantages:
      Will need to make existing skilled employees redundant which will incur
      redundancy costs.

      Require an investment of $3.5m at a time when the business is making losses
      (since 2017) – this may require external finance which will, incur interest charges,
      raising unit costs.

      The payback period is also more than 5 years which is relatively long.

      Will their customer base trust the new production technique which uses glue
      rather than welding?

      Candidates may assume that using glue rather than welding means lower quality.
      Accept that assumption.

      Accept any other relevant evaluation.

      Marks should be allocated according to the markbands on page 3.

      The table below should be followed (along with the markbands on page 3). These
      mark awards in the table below should be viewed as maximums. That is, just
      because a candidate has one argument for Option 1 and one argument against
      does not mean that they will automatically get a 4. One strong argument for one
      side and merely a weak or nominal argument for the other side might result in a 3.

5.   (a)   Define the term product orientation.                                                     [2]
           A company following a production orientation chooses to ignore their customers’
           needs and to focus only on efficiently building a quality product. They do not
           undertake market research identifying customer reactions to their proposed
           product before commencing production. This type of company believes that if
           they can make the best product their customers will come.

           Candidates are not expected to word their responses exactly as above.

           If the candidate says something to the effect of “The company focuses on the
           product,” award [1]. A second mark can be awarded if the candidate then offers
           a contradistinction such as “ignores the market,” “does not do market research,”
           “does not appeal to the market,” etc.


           Award [1] for identification of one characteristic of a product-orientated business.
           Award [2] for a full, clear description.

     (b)   With reference to Option 1, for KT, explain the relationship between the product
           life cycle, investment, profit and cash flow.                                            [4]
           Initial research and development costs plus the costs involved in launching a
           product usually means a product will be a loss maker in its early years. Cash
           flows may be negative. As sales grow and the product moves into the growth
           phase, profits are likely to be positive but the company will require additional
           working capital Not until the product reaches the maturity phases of the life cycle
           are cash flows and profits likely to be positive. In the decline phase, cash flows
           and profits are likely to remain positive. The cash flows especially should be solid
           with the contraction of necessary working capital. For KT, the investment in R&D
           for the new battery will have had a negative effect on cash flow and profits. Once
           the product is launched, Option 1 forecasts see quite large sales and therefore
           large cash inflows. However, we do not know about the marketing costs, which
           will increase cash outflows. Sometime in year 2, further investment would be
           needed if sales targets in years 3 and 4 are to be fulfilled as projected sales
           exceed capacity. This investment would increase fixed costs and reduce profits.


           If a candidate shows some understanding the relationship between the product
           life cycle, investment, profit and cash flow, but with no application to the stimulus,
           award [1].

           If the candidate shows clear understanding of the relationship between the
           product life cycle, investment, profit and cash flow, but with no application to the

           If the candidate shows some understanding of the relationship between the
           product life cycle, investment, profit and cash flow and has some application to

           If the candidate shows clear understanding of the relationship between the
           product life cycle, investment, profit and cash flow and has some application to
           the stimulus, award [3].

           If the candidate shows clear understanding of the relationship between the
           product life cycle, investment, profit and cash flow and has detailed application to
           the stimulus, award [4].

      If a candidate writes or draws some sort of table (such as exist in several of the
      textbooks IB students use) listing the stages of the product life cycle and showing
      the relationship between stages of the life cycle and their relationship to
      investment, cash flow and profit, accept and award [2] marks if well executed
      with no application to the stimulus and award [1] if poorly executed with no
      application to the stimulus.

      If the candidate applies to the stimulus, either by making inserts into the table or
      with commentary before or after it, award an additional [1 to 2] according to the
      depth and quality of the application.

(c)   With reference to KT, explain two problems that a new business may face.                [4]
      Problems any new business may face include:
      • Competition – KT faces stiff competition in the market for batteries for
         consumer products from multinationals.
      • Cash flow problems – KT suffered from cash flow problems in its first year of
         trading.
      • Human resources issues, particularly finding the right staff.
      • Insufficient marketing.
      • Market research – KT is product orientated and therefore will not have
         undertaken market research before developing is products.
      • Poor planning.
      • Insufficient start-up capital.
      Accept any other relevant problems that a new business may face.
      Mark as 2 + 2.
      For [2], candidates must identify a problem, explain it, and apply it to the
      stimulus.

      N.B. If the candidate addresses an issue at the end of the time period specified
      in the stimulus and notes a problem that KT may face then, do not accept (as the
      business will no longer be new).




(d)   Recommend whether KT should choose Option 1 or Option 2.                               [10]

      Option 1: Selling car batteries directly to car owners. They currently sell B2B
      rather than B2C.

      Advantages:
      • Higher initial revenues per unit – KT will receive $400 per unit by selling
        directly to consumers, compared to only $250 per unit if sold to a car
        manufacturer.
      • Sales are higher in option 1 for the first 2 years and at 410 000 over 5 years
        are 95 000 higher.
      • Total revenues are higher at $164 000 000 compared with $78 750 000.

      Disadvantages:
      • KT has no experience of selling directly to consumers as it is currently a B2B
         business. It will need to decide HOW it will allow customers to order its
                                        – 17 –            M21/3/BUSMT/SP2/ENG/TZ0/XX/M


  products – via its website or by phone – both solutions will require additional
  spending.
• KT will need to undertake a marketing campaign to raise awareness of its new
  products. As a B2B business, KT has no experience of engaging consumers.
  Funds will need to be found to finance a marketing campaign to raise
  awareness of its product and to persuade consumers to buy the product.
• The data in Table 1 is only a forecast and therefore may exaggerate its
  potential. KT may sell much less than forecast which affects its profitability.
• Further investment would be needed to meet demand as full capacity is
  exceeded in years 3 and 4. The cost of this investment is unknown. KT has
  insufficient funds to invest in new capacity.

Option 2: Form a five-year strategic alliance with a manufacturer of electric cars.

Advantages:
• Sales are guaranteed as the partner in the strategic alliance has agreed to buy
  a set number for 5 years. This alliance provides the business with certainty.
• KT avoids capacity issues as maximum annual sales are 85 000 units
  (batteries), which is below KT’s capacity of 90 000 units.
• No additional marketing costs.

Disadvantages:
• Sales are lower than option 1 for years 1,2,3,4 and 5.
• Unit revenues are lower at $250 rather than $400 per unit.
• Total sales and sales revenue are lower at 315 000 units with a total revenue
