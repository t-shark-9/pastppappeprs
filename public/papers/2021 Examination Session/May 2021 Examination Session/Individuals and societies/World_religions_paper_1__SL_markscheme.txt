Paper 1 part (b) markbands

  Marks     Level descriptor

    0       The work does not reach a standard described by the descriptors below.

            The response displays little understanding of the demands of the question. The response
            is descriptive in nature and where examples are referred to, they are factually incorrect,
   1–2
            irrelevant or vague.
            Terminology used is incorrect or inaccurate.

            The response displays an understanding of the demands of the question, but these are
            only partially addressed. There is some explanation, but this is not fully developed.
   3–4      Examples used are generally appropriate and relevant but do not always support the
            explanation.
            The use of relevant terminology is mostly accurate, with some inconsistencies.

            The demands of the question are met. The response contains a well-developed
   5–6      explanation, which is effectively supported by appropriate and relevant examples.
            The use of relevant terminology is accurate throughout the response.

                                              Section A
Hinduism

1.   “One who is self-controlled and unattached and who disregards all material enjoyments can obtain
     […] the highest perfect stage of freedom from reaction.”

                Bhagavad-Gita 18:49. Text courtesy of The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust International, Inc.
                                                            www.krishna.com. Used with permission.
     (a)   Identify three teachings in this passage.                                               [3]
           Candidates might cite or interpret some of the following points:
           • There are ways to obtain freedom.
           • It is important to attain self-control.
           • It is important to be unattached.
           • It is important to disregard material enjoyments.
           • There is a highest perfect stage.
           • The perfect stage is freedom from reaction.

           Credit candidates who mention karma or moksha appropriately.

           Accept other valid points.

           Award [1] for each relevant point up to a maximum of [3].

     (b)   Explain Hindu teachings about the consequences of karma.                                [6]

           This question is about the consequences of karma, not a general description of karma.

           In explaining teachings about the consequences of karma candidates may refer to the
           following:

           • Karma applies the general principle of cause and effect, action and reaction.
           • Karma means all the actions and even the thoughts and attitudes of people
             influences their reincarnation.
           • Therefore, all karma has consequences, which may appear in a person’s next
             reincarnation or unexpectedly at some future point.
           • Through karma, people who act in accordance with good morals (dharma) may find
             the consequences are being reborn in a better life.
           • Through karma, those who neglect duty maybe reborn in a less favourable body or
             condition, such as within a lower state of being or animal body.
           • Making extra good actions may help to mitigate the effects of bad karma.
           • Hindus aim to escape the cycle of rebirth (samsara) and achieve moksha
             (liberation); one way to attain this is to accumulate good karma through several
             cycles of reincarnation.

           Accept other relevant answers.

           Marks should be allocated according to the markbands on page 5.

Buddhism

2.   “All conditioned things are impermanent…
     All conditioned things are unsatisfactory…
     All things are not self.”

                                                                Courtesy of Buddhist Publication Society.
     (a)   Identify three teachings in this passage.                                                  [3]

           Candidates might cite or interpret some of the following points:
           • Buddhist believe that all existence is characterized by impermanence (anicca).
             Nothing lasts forever.
           • All existence is fundamentally unsatisfactory (dukkha/dukha). Sometimes
             dukkha/dukha is translated as ‘suffering’. Nothing in this life will bring permanent
             satisfaction.
           • Buddhists believe that there is no such thing as an eternal soul (atman) or ‘self’.
           • According to Buddhism, the idea of an eternal soul or self (atman) is an illusion,
             part of maya.
           • All things are not self.
           • Impermanence applies to negative as well as positive experiences. This can be
             related to the Third Noble Truth: suffering can cease.

           Accept other valid points.

           Award [1] for each relevant point up to a maximum of [3].
                                            –6–                M21/3/WLDRE/SP1/ENG/TZ0/XX/M


(b)   Explain Buddhist beliefs about samsara.                                                  [6]

      In explaining Buddhist beliefs about samara candidates may refer to the following:
      • Samsara is the endless cycle of existence and rebirth.
      • The cycle of samsara is governed by the law of karma.
      • Karma is the law of cause and effect with respect to thoughts, actions, speech and
         their consequences.
      • These consequences refer not only to present life, but also to previous and future
         lives.
      • The state of a person’s karma at death determines the nature of their rebirth:
         positive karma leads to positive rebirth in higher realms of existence and negative
         karma leads to negative rebirth in lower realms of existence.
      • There is no permanent soul/self/atman which is reborn.
      • Humans are composed of bundles of components called skandhas.
      • Samsara is also fed by attachment to the skandhas.
      • Buddhists aim at liberation from samara through Enlightenment and achieving
         nirvana/nibbana.
      • Enlightenment involves eliminating the Three Poisons that are at the heart of the
         human condition: ignorance, greed (unfettered desire) and ill-will (aversion).
      • Liberation from samsara involves overcoming maya (illusion) and extinguishing
         craving.
      • Nirvana/nibbana is complete liberation from suffering.
      • Some Buddhist traditions define six main realms of existence and rebirth (humans,
         gods, demi-gods, animals, hungry ghosts, hells).
      • Lower realms of existence characterized by predominance of one of the three
         poisons: ignorance, greed (unfettered desire) and ill-will (aversion).

Sikhism

3.   “Some are very knowledgeable, but if they do not know the Guru, then what is the use of their
     lives? The blind have forgotten nam, […] The self-willed manmukhs are in utter darkness. Their
     comings and goings in reincarnation do not end; through death and rebirth, they are wasting
     away.”

                                                                     Courtesy of Sant Singh Khalsa, M.D.

     (a)   Identify three teachings in this passage.                                                   [3]

           Candidates might cite or interpret some of the following points:
           • Knowledge without knowing the Guru [God] is pointless.
           • The blind have forgotten nam [name of God].
           • Those who cannot see [referring to those who are ignorant] have forgotten to
             meditate on God.
           • The manmukhs follow their own will or ego.
           • They live in darkness meaning they have not achieved liberation or union with God.
           • The manmukhs are held within a cycle of reincarnation which carries on and on,
             without end; there is no escape from it [karma].
           • This is a waste of their time because they are not getting anywhere.
           • Knowing the Guru and remembering nam is very important.
           • To have a useful life you must know the Guru

           Accept other valid points.

           Award [1] for each relevant point up to a maximum of [3].

     (b)   Explain Sikh beliefs about the sach khand (realm of truth).                                 [6]

           In explaining Sikh beliefs about the sach khand candidates may refer to the following:
           • Sach khand is the fifth of the five khands.
           • It is liberation from the cycle of birth and rebirth.
           • It is achieved by following the Guru and through meditation on the name of God
              (nam simran/nam japna).
           • One understanding of sach khand is of a spiritual state of liberation within this life.
           • This is a state of wonder and light.
           • It is difficult to describe and can be known only by personal experience.
           • A follower becomes joined together with God’s light and the truth.
           • At this point a seeker leaves the material and enters the spiritual realm.
           • A second understanding of sach khand is of a place where souls go after death.
           • This is spiritual rather than physical place, described like the rays of warm sunlight;
              a place where God lives.

           Accept other relevant answers.

           Marks should be allocated according to the markbands on page 5.

           explanations of how Shabbat is kept; keeping kosher; wearing of tefillin, etc,
           must be credited.

           In explaining Jewish observance of the commandments, candidates may refer to the
           following:
           • There are different interpretations regarding how the commandments should be
               observed between Orthodox and Progressive Jews.
           • Some Jews (Orthodox) consider all the commandments in the Torah should be kept.
           • Some Jews (Reform) consider that certain commandments should be interpreted in
               keeping with contemporary life.
           • Many Jews consider that there is a hierarchy of observation of the commandments
               but that there are two that all Jews should observe - belief in the one God and
               pikuach nefesh (saving of life).
           • Some commandments are not able to be observed eg those associated with the
               Temple which has now been destroyed.
           • Many Orthodox Jews observe the commandments (mitzvot) as their framework for
               daily life eg what to eat; what to wear; what to celebrate; attaching a mezuzah case;
               how to treat each other; etc.
           • Some Jews use the discussions of the Talmud in order to interpret how to observe
               the commandments.
           • Some Jews might say the Shema twice a day.

              In explaining Muslim beliefs about the importance of obedience to Allah’s will
              candidates may refer to the following:
              • Muslims believe that the meaning of the word “Islam” is submission to Allah's will,
                 therefore this belief should underpin all that they do.
              • Muslims believe that salvation can be attained by submission to Allah’s will.
              • Submitting to the will of Allah was revealed to the Prophet Muhammed and
                 preceding prophets.
              • Through revelations, Allah has instructed Muslims on various practices such as the
                 Five Pillars. Muslims believe that they should follow those practices out of
                 obedience to Allah.
              • Allah’s will is considered the best guidance for a righteous life.
              • Muslims believe that they are judged by Allah and sent to janna (paradise) or
                 jahannam (hell) according to how far they have followed Allah’s will.
              • It is a tradition of the Prophet that Muslims are rewarded according to their intention,
                 so they aim to follow Allah’s will as far as they are able to do so.
              • Muslims believe that Allah has predestined their fate but has also given them some
                 degree of free will as a test of their obedience.
              • Allah is considered the all-merciful so even if a Muslim commits grave sins of
                 disobedience and repents, they may be forgiven.

              Appropriate and relevant reference to the Five Pillars should be credited.

7.   “Who can wait quietly while the mud settles?
     Who can remain still until the moment of action?
     Observers of the Tao do not seek fulfilment.

     (b)    Explain Taoist teaching on living the Way.                                                  [6]

            In explaining Taoist beliefs on living the Way candidates may refer to the following:
            • Tao, the Way, is our original nature.
            • Taoists seek to realise the Tao, our original nature, in this life.
            • The importance of the fu (everything flows out of Tao and will return to Tao).
            • Nothing is evil, but things are out of balance because humans departed from
               the Way.
            • To achieve the goal of realization of the Way in our lives and society, it is necessary
               to live according to the Tao.
            • This requires living a contemplative life.
            • Non-action and non-interference are essentials of this process.
            • It also requires achieving more harmony and union with nature/going with the flow.
            • The Way of Tao also includes being virtuous, but never in a self-righteous manner.
            • Achieving balance in all things is at the heart of the Way. This refers to balance
               between yin and yang.
            • Yin is female, dark, cold, receptive, passive, submissive. Yan is male, light, hot,
               assertive, active.
            • Following the Way results in release of Ch’i, the life force.

           In explaining Jain teachings about attaining moksha (liberation), candidates may refer to the
           following:
           • Following the teachings of Mahavira. Many lay Jains practice bhakti (devotion) to one of

           • Following The Five Great Vows (non-violence, truth, non-stealing, celibacy,
               non-attachment or non-possession).
           • An important way to achieve liberation is through non-violence (ahimsa) in words,
               thoughts and actions.
           • Monks and nuns practice the Twelve Great Vows.
           • Practising asceticism.
           • Attaining kevala (a pure, omniscient consciousness).
           • Re-birth of the jiva is determined by karma (the law of cause and effect regarding our
               thoughts, intentions, actions and their consequences).
           • Negative karma is caused by ignorance, passion and attachment to material reality.
           • Jains also believe that good moral actions produce good karma and aid liberation.
           • Jains may also practice meditation to control passions (which produce karma) and
               cultivate calmness and balance.
           • Liberation may take many lifetimes to achieve.
           • Getting rid of accumulated karma through ascetism.

Bahá’í Faith

9.   “In man there are two natures; his spiritual or higher nature and his material or lower nature. In one
     he approaches God, in the other he lives for the world alone. Signs of both these natures are to be
     found in men.”

                                                                      Paris Talks, by Abdu'l-Baha, Part 1:18,

           In explaining Bahá’í beliefs about the human condition candidates may refer to the
           following:
           • Bahá’ís believe that each child is born pure and holy.
           • God created humans with immortal souls.
           • God created humans with a dual nature (animalistic and spiritual).
           • The animalistic nature has a selfish (evil) side.
           • The spiritual nature (soul) has ability to develop its divine attributes and pursue
               God’s plan for humanity.
           • The power of reason is one of the most important of these divine attributes.
           • God created all life on earth, but it is only the highest form of life, human beings,
               who have a conscience. This means that humans can think about what they are
               doing and the results of their actions.
           • Bahá’ís believe that the purpose of human life is to grow spiritually and to come
               closer to God. This starts at birth and continues after death.
           • Bahá’ís do not believe that the soul is reborn or reincarnated.
