Apply the markbands that provide the “best fit” to the responses given and award credit wherever it is
possible to do so. If an answer indicates that the demands of the question are understood and
addressed but that not all implications are considered (for example, compare or contrast; reasons
or significance; methods or success), then examiners should not be afraid of using the full range of
marks allowed for by the markscheme. Responses that offer good coverage of some of the criteria
should be rewarded accordingly.

Section 1: Monarchies in England and France (1066–1223)

1.   “Henry II’s campaigns in Europe were defensive rather than aggressive.” To what extent do you
     agree with this statement?

     The question requires that candidates consider the merits or otherwise of the view that Henry II’s
     military campaigns in Europe were defensive. Candidates may discuss the extent of Henry’s
     territory on the continent, however, the main focus should be the nature of the campaigns.
     Reasons for these campaigns varied, in some cases it was to acquire more territory (Toulouse, the
     Vexin and in Brittany where he was trying to gain territory for his son Geoffrey) therefore clearly
     offensive. At times his campaigns were arguably to clarify his relative strength in relationship to
     Louis VII so neither offensive nor defensive. Defensive campaigns could be considered to be in
     Brittany to secure his borders, to defend his inheritance from his brother Geoffrey and later, during
     the Great Revolt (the disputes with his sons), to defend his position as King. Candidates’ opinions
     or conclusions should be presented clearly and supported by appropriate evidence.


2.   Compare and contrast the changing nature of government in France and England.

     The question requires the candidates to give an account of the similarities and differences between
     government in England and France. Candidates may argue that in many areas they were very
     similar, both were feudal monarchies with the monarch reliant on the nobility to maintain stability.
     Over time, both developed a centralized bureaucratic structure to administer the state more
     effectively. Both had a centrally directed judiciary that administered the law in the localities. Both
     kingdoms relied to some extent on the support of the Church. Candidates may argue that the main
     differences lay in the relative strength of the monarchy at any one time and that this depended on
     specific factors, examples could include weak government in the reign of Stephen (the Anarchy),
     the undermining of Louis VII because of his conflicts with England. Some may discuss royal
     finances linking them to the nature of government. Candidates’ opinions or conclusions should be
     presented clearly and supported by appropriate evidence.
                                                   –5–                  M21/3/HISTX/HP3/ENG/TZ0/EU/M


Section 2: Muslims and Jews in medieval Europe (1095–1492)

3.   “The conflict between Christians and Muslims led to the loss of cultural and intellectual diversity.”
     Discuss.

     The question requires that candidates offer a considered and balanced review of the statement
     that the conflict between Christians and Muslims led to the loss of cultural and intellectual diversity.
     Candidates may refer to the abandonment of national languages, the religious conversions, the
     raids against monasteries and temples and the relocation of population as examples of the loss of
     cultural and intellectual diversity due to conflicts. Candidates may also discuss the competition
     within Christian kingdoms and the conflicts with the Byzantine Empire as causes of the loss of
     cultural and intellectual diversity. Candidates may contest the statement by considering the
     enduring diplomatic relations between Christian kingdoms and Muslim rulers, the uninterrupted
     trade between Venetian and Muslim merchants, and the circulation of Muslim and Christian
     intellectuals in different royal courts. Candidates’ opinions or conclusions will be presented clearly
     and supported by appropriate evidence.


4.   Evaluate the role of the Black Death in the persecution of Jews in medieval Europe.

     The question requires that candidates make an appraisal of the role of the Black Death in the
     persecution of Jews in Medieval Europe. Candidates may refer to the denunciations against the
     Jewish communities regarding the poisoning of wells to infect the Christians and the belief in
     biblical, magical and astrological causes for the plague. Candidates may evaluate the cases of
     expulsions and attacks against Jews that led to the loss of their properties, the prohibition to
     exercise a number of professions and activities and the relocation of many Jewish communities
     ordered by European monarchs. Other relevant factors may be addressed, for example, the
     various groups blamed for the plague like lepers, Romani, beggars, pilgrims, friars and foreigners,
     but with a focus on the issue in the question. Candidates’ opinions or conclusions will be presented
     clearly and supported by appropriate evidence.
                                                    –6–                  M21/3/HISTX/HP3/ENG/TZ0/EU/M


Section 3: Late medieval political crises (1300–1487)

5.   “Weak government was the main cause of the deposition of Edward II.” To what extent do you
     agree with this statement?

     Candidates should consider the merits or otherwise of the view that Edward II was deposed
     because of his weak rule. His weak government may be indicated by his acceptance of the
     Ordinances of 1311, forced on him by the barons and parliament. The unpopularity of his
     favourites (Gaveston and Despenser) and his failure to deal with the long famine also weakened
     his position. His failure as a military leader also undermined his position (Bannockburn and the
     failure to remove Robert the Bruce). Some candidates may argue that Edward was relatively
     successful in the Despenser War when he brought the barons under control to some extent and
     that in the short term his rift with Isabella and her relationship with Mortimer caused the final crisis.
     He lost the support of the Church and Parliament, both of which were necessary to maintain his
     rule. Candidates’ opinions or conclusions should be presented clearly and supported by
     appropriate evidence.


6.   “Louis XI successfully dealt with the challenges to his power.” To what extent do you agree with
     this statement?

     Candidates should consider the merits or otherwise of the view that Louis XI was able to overcome
     threats to his power. Challenges included the need to extend control throughout France, to improve
     government efficiency and to increase royal finances. Other challenges were the independence of
     the nobility, the threat from Ducal Burgundy (an overmighty vassal) and the threat of renewed war
     with England. Louis appointed efficient advisers (Comines and le Daim), he eliminated redundant
     posts and improved royal bureaucracy. He travelled extensively asserting royal authority in the
     localities. He established the Royal Post Roads, improving communications and control. In 1477
     he defeated Burgundy, regaining territory for France. In 1475 the Treaty of Picquigny with England
     ended the Hundred Years War. He established the foundations of the modern state but arguably
     his reliance on mercenaries (in Burgundy) and the continued independence of the nobility limited
     his power. Candidates’ opinions or conclusions should be stated clearly and supported by
     appropriate evidence.
                                                    –7–                  M21/3/HISTX/HP3/ENG/TZ0/EU/M


Section 4: The Renaissance (c1400–1600)

7.   Evaluate the contribution of social and political factors to the development of the Renaissance in
     Florence.

     The question requires that candidates make an appraisal of the contribution of social and political
     factors to the development of the Renaissance in Florence. Regarding the political factors,
     candidates may refer to the characteristics of the republic in Florence, the freedom many citizens
     enjoyed and the respect for individual rights in the city. Other relevant factors may be addressed,
     for example the wealth of many families, such as the Medicis; the patronage exercised by rich
     merchants and bankers; well-known scientists, intellectuals and artists moving to the city.
     Candidates may offer equal coverage of social and political factors, or they may prioritize their
     evaluation of one of them. However, both aspects will be a feature of the response. Candidates’
     opinions or conclusions will be presented clearly and supported by appropriate evidence.


8.   Evaluate the role of papal patronage in promoting the arts.

     The question requires that candidates make an appraisal of the role of papal patronage in
     promoting the arts. Candidates may evaluate the role of Pope Martin V as the initiator of a new
     period of papal power after moving the papal throne back to Rome and the end of the Great
     Schism, and his use of art, architecture and literature to promote Christendom. Candidates may
     also refer to the fostering of Humanist studies; the collection of antiquities; the editions of texts; and
     the construction and rebuilding of fortifications, bridges, streets, squares, etc under papal
     patronage as a sign of its power. Other relevant factors may be addressed, for example the
     involvement of different popes in promoting the arts in order to glorify themselves and their
     families, but with a focus on the issue in the question. Candidates’ opinions or conclusions will be
     presented clearly and supported by appropriate evidence.
                                                  –8–                 M21/3/HISTX/HP3/ENG/TZ0/EU/M


Section 5: The Age of Exploration and its impact (1400–1550)

9.    Examine the consequences of Portuguese exploration of the west coast of Africa for European
      states.

      The question requires that candidates consider the interrelationship between the Portuguese
      exploration of the west coast of Africa and its consequences for European states. Candidates may
      refer to the patronage of Prince Henry the Navigator and the voyages of Bartolomeu Dias and
      Vasco da Gama as the starting point for the contacts between Europe and Africa. Candidates may
      examine the impact of the creation of trading centres in Goa and Malaysia that exported new
      spices to European states, and the contacts with sub-Saharan kingdoms like Ghana, Mali, Benin,
      Songhai and Kongo that benefited the European states with a flow of gold and slaves. Other
      relevant consequences that may be considered are the new paths for subsequent explorations by
      European states opened by the Portuguese, and the facilities the explorations created to fight
      Muslim rulers. Candidates’ opinions or conclusions will be presented clearly and supported by
      appropriate evidence.


10.   “The impact of the ‘Columbian Exchange’ on Europe was positive.” To what extent do you agree
      with this statement?

      The question requires that candidates consider the merits or otherwise of the statement that the
      impact of the “Columbian Exchange” on Europe was positive. Candidates may refer to the positive
      impact that it had by bringing new crops to Europe like potato, maize, tomato, sugarcane, coffee,
      fruits and tobacco. These products allowed for a population growth, a new expansion of trade and
      the initial shift towards capitalism. Candidates may consider the introduction into Europe of metals
      from America and the impact they had on financial and commercial activities. Candidates may also
      address other relevant factors, for example the imposition of European cultural patterns, values
      and religion that empowered European states. Candidates may challenge the statement
      considering that the imported new crops disrupted European ecosystems and imposed new
      methods of labour on peasants, and by referring to the introduction of new diseases among
      European populations. Candidates’ opinions or conclusions will be presented clearly and
      supported by appropriate evidence.
                                                  –9–                  M21/3/HISTX/HP3/ENG/TZ0/EU/M


Section 6: Aspects of the Reformation (c1500–1563)

11.   Evaluate the contribution of the printing press in spreading Lutheran ideas in Germany.

      The question requires that candidates make an appraisal of the contribution of the printing press in
      spreading Lutheran ideas in Germany. Candidates may consider the importance of the printing
      press for mass distribution of Luther’s works with the new possibility of reproducing books.
      Candidates may also refer to the use of the printing press to distribute pamphlets with images and
      songs to bring Luther’s message to the common folk in vernacular languages. Candidates may
      challenge the question considering that the role of the printing press was minimal since the cost of
      printed pieces was too high, reducing its availability to small groups of monks and scholars.
      Candidates may evaluate the role of priests and local parishes as more active factors in spreading
      Lutheran ideas among the illiterate population. Candidates’ opinions or conclusions will be
      presented clearly and supported by appropriate evidence.


12.   “The response of the Catholic Church to the Reformation was successful.” Discuss.

      The question requires that candidates offer a considered and balanced review of the statement
      that the response of the Catholic Church to the Reformation was successful. Candidates may refer
      to the results of the Council of Trent, the restructuring of the Catholic Church, the implementation
      of new and stricter regulations for religious orders and the establishment of the Jesuits. Candidates
      may consider these policies as a success since they controlled the behaviour of monks and
      priests, reaffirmed papal authority and were able to ratify and expand the Catholic dogma through
      missions. Other relevant factors may be addressed, for example the creation of the Roman
      Inquisition and the List of Prohibited Books to limit the spread of Protestantism. Candidates may
      challenge the statement by considering the limited application of some of the new policies or the
      limited success of the Roman Inquisition. Candidates’ opinions or conclusions will be presented
      clearly and supported by appropriate evidence.
                                                  – 10 –              M21/3/HISTX/HP3/ENG/TZ0/EU/M


Section 7: Absolutism and Enlightenment (1650–1800)

13.   Evaluate the achievements of the Scientific Revolution during the Enlightenment.

      The question requires that candidates make an appraisal of the achievements of the Scientific
      Revolution during the Enlightenment. Candidates may consider weighing up the importance of new
      discoveries based on reason that transformed conventional thought and science. Candidates may
      evaluate examples of new achievements in the fields of optics, mathematics, natural history,
      chemistry, etc. Candidates may refer to the contribution of scientists such as Lavoisier, Guyton,
      Locke and Newton, among others. Candidates may also refer to other relevant contributions, like
      those of previous scholars like Copernicus, Kepler, Galileo and Brahe, whose discoveries were
      considered during the Enlightenment to improve the knowledge of astronomy, but with a focus on
      the issue in the question. Candidates’ opinions or conclusions will be presented clearly and
      supported by appropriate evidence.


14.   “Agricultural change in the Enlightenment era was socially and economically beneficial.” To what
      extent do you agree with this statement?

      The question requires that candidates consider the merits or otherwise of the statement that
      agricultural change was socially and economically beneficial during the Enlightenment. Candidates
      may refer to the economic impact that resulted from the introduction of new crops, the innovations
      in cultivation techniques and livestock breeding, and the consolidation of small holdings into large
      farms. They may consider the benefits or disadvantages of the enclosure process, noticeable in
      England. Candidates may also assess the contribution of individuals such as Jethro Tull, and the
      use of horses with drilling equipment. Candidates may discuss the social effects of agricultural
      change on the lives of the peasants, the open-field system of farming, and the proletarianization of
      those who lost their lands. Candidates may offer equal coverage of social and economic benefits,
      or they may prioritize their assessment of one of them. However, both aspects will be a feature of
      the response. Candidates’ opinions or conclusions will be presented clearly and supported by
      appropriate evidence.

Section 8: The French Revolution and Napoleon I (1774–1815)

15.   “Fear of foreign intervention had a great impact on the French Revolution.” Discuss with reference
      to the period between 1792 and 1794.

      The question requires that candidates offer a considered and balanced review of the statement
      that fear of foreign intervention had a great impact on the French Revolution in the period between
      1792 and 1794. Early defeats in war and the Brunswick Manifesto threatened the Revolution, the
      September Massacres were partially triggered by fear of the fall of Verdun. Republicanism grew
      because of the “flight to Varennes” and France became a republic in September 1792. Internal
      factors include the economic crisis leading to sans-culottes support for Danton and the radical
      Jacobins. Revolts in the Vendee, Brittany and the Girondin Revolts threatened the Revolution
      leading to extreme policies. Robespierre became dominant, he controlled the Committee of Public
      Safety, encouraging the Terror. Robespierre’s price controls on food gained the support of the
      sans-culottes. The fear of foreign intervention ended the constitutional monarchy but the underlying
      economic crisis and its impact on the sans-culottes contributed to the radicalization of the
      revolution. Candidates’ opinions or conclusions should be stated clearly and supported by
      appropriate evidence.


16.   “The opposition of Britain was the most significant factor in the collapse of Napoleon I’s empire.”
      Discuss.

      The question requires that candidates offer a considered and balanced review of the
      statement regarding the collapse of the Napoleonic Empire. Candidates should examine the role of
      Britain in the Napoleonic Wars, including the financing of the various coalitions and British
      diplomacy (Castlereagh and the 4th Coalition). There may be reference to British naval power
      (Trafalgar) and Britain’s role in organizing the Waterloo campaign. Other relevant factors may be
      discussed such as mistakes made by Napoleon: he alienated Alexander I by his marriage to Marie
      Louise; harsh rule in conquered territories increased support for his enemies (Prussia and
      Saxony); the Russian Campaign of 1812 could be considered as his first defeat encouraging
      nations to turn against him, leading to defeat at Leipzig. Internal discontent at the burden of war
      and the invasion of 1813 led to Talleyrand’s plots. The defection of his marshals in 1814 weakened
      Napoleon’s position further. Responses could agree or disagree with the statement. Candidates’
      opinions or conclusions should be presented clearly and supported by appropriate evidence.

Section 9: France (1815–1914)

17.   “The Second Republic collapsed because it lacked popular support.” To what extent do you agree
      with this statement?

      Candidates must consider the merits or otherwise of the statement regarding the collapse of the
      Second Republic. Some causes may predate the collapse including the fragile bourgeois/ working
      class alliance that overthrew Louis Philippe. The alliance had no clear goals and radical policies
      (National Workshops) were expensive. The closing of the workshops led to the June Days and
      Cavaignac’s repression ended the alliance, weakening the Republic. The elections of 1848
      indicated the majority wanted a moderate republic, thus agreeing with the statement. Other causes
      for its collapse could include the desire for a strong leader and the actions of Louis Napoleon as
      president. He gained the support of the peasantry, who feared high taxation and the bourgeoisie,
      who feared socialism. Support for the Pope in Rome reconciled Catholic conservatives to
      Napoleon’s rule and there was limited opposition to his 1851 coup. By 1852 the Second Empire
      was established. Arguably, Napoleon III was the key cause as he seized the opportunity presented
      by the weakness of the Republic. Candidates’ opinions or conclusions should be clearly stated and
      supported by appropriate evidence.


18.   Evaluate the reasons that led to the political stability of the Third Republic by 1877.

      The question requires that candidates make an appraisal of the factors that led to political stability
      by 1877. Causes of instability include the defeat in war, the provisional nature of Thiers’s
      government, the threat caused by the Commune and the danger of a restoration. Thiers was
      popular with moderates, the Commune was crushed and the German occupation ended. A royalist
      majority in the National Assembly was divided (Orleanists, Bonapartists and Bourbons) preventing
      a restoration by the “republic of dukes”. The refusal of Chambord to accept the Tricolour ended the
      possibility of a restoration by 1873, making the republic more secure. In 1875 the Wallon
      Amendment established the republic but there was still a threat from the right and MacMahon
      called for elections in 1877. Thiers led the republican campaign (“no enemies on the left”) and a
      firmly republican chamber was elected. Two key reasons for political stability were the weakness of
      the right and the unity of moderate and left republicans. Candidates’ opinions or conclusions
      should be clearly stated and supported by appropriate evidence.

19.   Evaluate the reasons for, and the consequences of, the electoral Reform Acts of 1884–1885.

      The question requires that candidates make an appraisal of the main reasons for the electoral
      Reform Acts of 1884–1885 and the impact of both. Reasons could include Chamberlain’s
      campaign to extend voting rights in rural areas, an extension of the 1867 Reform Act. It was an
      attempt to reduce the influence of landowners in rural areas and the power of the House of Lords.
      The Redistribution Act was to adjust for demographic change and remove anomalies in
      constituencies, for example Tiverton and Glasgow both had two MPs. The Arlington House
      Compact ensured that the Conservatives would accept these changes. Consequences were an
      increased electorate but not full democracy, two thirds of adult males were enfranchised, but plural
      voting remained and women were not enfranchised in general elections. One-member
      constituencies were established in towns under 50 000. One consequence was the more effective
      organization of political parties and the emergence of the “first-past-the-post” system in most
      constituencies. Candidates’ opinions or conclusions should be clearly stated and supported by
      appropriate evidence.


20.   To what extent was democracy in Britain and Ireland protected by the Parliament Act?

      The question requires that candidates consider the merits or otherwise of the suggestion that the
      Parliament Act protected democracy. Candidates may establish the context by discussing the
      struggle to pass the “People’s Budget” with the unelected House of Lords rejecting the budget,
      breaking the tradition of the Lords not rejecting Finance Bills. The two elections of 1910 were
      described as “Peers v People”. George V’s willingness to create Liberal peers indicated the
      monarchy’s reluctance to resist the nations’ elected representatives confirming that political power
      derived from the democratic process. Arguments supporting the view that democracy was
      extended could point out that the Lords could not amend or reject Finance Bills and could only
      delay other legislation for three years. However, it could be argued that the unelected Lords could
      still paralyse an elected government for the last two years of a five-year term. Candidates’ opinions
      or conclusions should be clearly stated and supported by appropriate evidence.

Section 11: Italy (1815–1871) and Germany (1815–1890)

21.   Examine the impact of the Congress of Vienna on Germany.

      The question requires that candidates consider the interrelationship between the terms agreed at
      the Congress of Vienna and their impact on the German region of Europe. Candidates should
      outline the territorial settlement, with the establishment of the German Confederation of 39 states
      including the German territories of Austria. The Congress clearly recognized the notion of
      “Germaness”. Austria as president of the Confederation had limited powers as member states
      could refuse to accept laws proposed by the Diet. Member states were expected to develop
      constitutions, but compliance was variable. A key impact was on Prussia, which gained territory in
      the Rhineland and Saxony becoming the strongest economy. Initially Austria was the most
      influential state especially when trying to repress nationalism (Carlsbad Decrees). Some may
      argue that the most significant impact was that it set the scene for Austro-Prussian rivalry for
      dominance in Germany. Candidates’ opinions or conclusions should be clearly stated and
      supported by appropriate evidence.


22.   “Cavour was the most significant figure in the unification of Italy by 1871.” To what extent do you
      agree with this statement?

      The question requires that candidates consider the merits or otherwise of the view that Cavour was
      the most significant figure in the process of Italian unification by 1871. To agree with the statement
      candidates may refer to Cavour’s strengthening of Piedmont: his successful diplomacy with France
      (Pact of Plombières) gaining Piedmont a strong ally. There may be mention of the plebiscites in
      Central Italy organized by Cavour. Some may argue that Cavour only wanted a strong Northern
      Italian kingdom but was forced by changing circumstance to move to greater unification. Others
      may argue that Garibaldi’s actions in 1860 and his willingness to cede his conquests to Victor
      Emmanuel in order to further unification were as important as Cavour’s contributions. Victor
      Emmanuel was also significant, he appointed Cavour, he encouraged Garibaldi and he allied with
      Prussia gaining Venetia in 1866 and Rome in 1870 consequently fully uniting Italy. Candidates’
      opinions or conclusions should be clearly stated and supported with appropriate evidence.

Section 12: Imperial Russia, revolution and the establishment of the Soviet Union (1855–1924)

23.   To what extent do you agree that Alexander II was the Tsar Liberator?

      The question requires candidates consider the merits or otherwise of the view that Alexander II
      was a liberator. The impact of the major reforms (emancipation, legal, local government, military
      and educational) should be closely considered. Some may argue that the reforms represented an
      enormous change in Russian society and politics representing a move towards democracy and a
      more liberal state and that Alexander was a liberator. However, others may consider that the
      reforms were limited, referring to the issue of Redemption Dues and the Mir system leaving
      peasants in “economic slavery”. At a regional level the Zemstva and Duma were dominated by the
      nobility and there was no national elected assembly. Judicially there were still special courts and
      the Okhrana continued to operate. It could be argued that Alexander was not a liberator and that
      Russia remained a hierarchical autocratic state and that the reforms were designed to protect
      autocracy. Candidates’ opinions or conclusions should be stated clearly and supported with
      appropriate evidence.


24.   Evaluate the reasons for the overthrow of the Provisional Government in October/November 1917.

      The question requires that candidates make an appraisal of the reasons why the Provisional
      Government (PG) collapsed. Reasons could include the issue of Dual Power and that the PG
      lacked legitimacy. Other factors could include poor decision-making, failure to address the Land
      Question or deal with the economic crisis. The decision to continue with the war and military
      failures (Kerensky Offensive) led to increasing unpopularity. Others may argue that the PG did
      survive the July Days but needed Bolshevik support against Kornilov emphasising its weakness.
      The strength of opposition should also be considered, there was increasing support for the
      Bolsheviks because of Lenin’s policies (Peace, Land and Bread), they gained majorities on the
      Petrograd and Moscow Soviets by September 1917. However, some may point out that the
      Bolshevik coup of October/November was considered to be risky by leading Bolsheviks (Kamenev
      and Zinoviev) and only succeeded because the PG was on the verge of collapse. Candidates’
      opinions or conclusions should be stated clearly and supported with appropriate evidence

Section 13: Europe and the First World War (1871–1918)

25.   Evaluate the impact of imperial expansion in Africa and Asia on European diplomacy.

      The question requires that candidates make an appraisal of the impact of imperial expansion in
      Africa and Asia on European diplomacy. Candidates may consider the competition for land,
      resources and markets; the pursuit of empire in Africa and Asia to counteract internal problems, to
      increase military power and to strengthen the country’s prestige and diplomacy. Candidates may
      refer to the division of Africa between the European powers and the different economic treaties
      they signed to ensure free trade. Candidates may also consider the impact on European diplomacy
      of conflicts like the Fashoda incident, the Second Boer War and the two Moroccan crises.
      Candidates may also evaluate the clash between European countries to gain influence in China
      and the effects of the entry of Japan as a new significant power. Candidates’ opinions or
      conclusions will be presented clearly and supported by appropriate evidence.


26.   To what extent did domestic instability in the Central Powers contribute to their defeat in 1918?

      The question requires that candidates consider the merits or otherwise of the suggestion that
      domestic instability in the Central Powers contributed to their defeat in 1918. Candidates may refer
      to the political turmoil and social unrest experienced in some countries, such as Austria-Hungary
      and the Ottoman Empire where national groups fought for their freedom. Candidates may also
      consider the economic instability caused by the war that led to inflation, destruction of capital and a
      shortage of labour in the Central Powers. There may be reference to the impact of the naval
      blockade leading to labour unrest, especially in Germany. Candidates may challenge the question
      by considering other factors that contributed to their defeat like the entry of US in the war, or the
      military and economic superiority of their enemies. There may be reference to the number of fronts
      the Central powers were fighting on and the collapse of their alliances. Candidates’ opinions or
      conclusions will be presented clearly and supported by appropriate evidence.

Section 14: Inter-war domestic developments in European states (1918–1939)

27.   Discuss the factors that allowed the Weimar Republic to survive the political and economic
      challenges it faced between 1918 and 1924.

      The question requires that candidates offer a considered and balanced review of the reasons why
      the Weimar Republic could survive the various crises it faced up to 1924. Political challenges
      include the threats from left and right (Spartacus, Kapp and Munich Putsch). Some may refer to the
      Groener-Ebert Pact and the Freikorps or that neither left nor right were strong enough to be a real
      threat. Some may argue that politically the republic was weak with no majority government,
      however, the Weimar parties combined (SPD, DDP, DVP and Centre) had a majority in the
      Reichstag and coalitions were relatively stable. President Ebert could use Article 48, for example
      supporting Stresemann’s economic policies. Economic challenges included relatively high post-war
      unemployment, inflation that was exacerbated by reparation payments and the policy of passive
      resistance in 1923 culminating in hyperinflation. The economic crisis was survived by
      Stresemann’s effective policies, calling off passive resistance, issuing the Rentenmark and
      negotiating the Dawes Plan. Candidates’ opinions or conclusions should be clearly stated and
      supported by appropriate evidence.


28.   To what extent had Mussolini established a totalitarian state before the outbreak of the Second
      World War?

      The question requires that candidates consider the merits or otherwise of the suggestion that Italy
      was a totalitarian state. Candidates may define a totalitarian state as one where there was a strong
      authoritarian leader, little or no political freedom, political coercion and state control of the economy
      and society. Arguably, Mussolini’s Italy as a one-party state led by a dictator met these criteria;
      however, it could also be argued that key institutions such as the monarchy and church were not
      under fascist control and Confino was limited. There were attempts to fascistize society via
      education, dopolavoro and thousands of fascist laws and racial laws from 1937. The corporate
      state was to control the economy and labour, but most Italians remained loyal to the Church and to
      their regions and the fascist party was unpopular (not Mussolini personally). Control of economic
      activity was also limited as industrialists had their independent organization, Confindustria.
      Candidates’ opinions or conclusions should be clearly stated and supported by appropriate
      evidence.

Section 15: Diplomacy in Europe (1919–1945)

29. Discuss the nature and impact of the treaties of St Germain and Trianon.

      The question requires that candidates offer a considered and balanced review of the two treaties
      and their consequences. In terms of nature, both treaties were confirming events that had already
      occurred with the collapse of Austria-Hungary in 1918. Both were punitive, they were imposed on
      the two new states that were treated as defeated powers. Reparations were imposed and both lost
      significant territory (Austria 60 % and Hungary 70 %). The consequences of both treaties were
      similar; both Austria and Hungary became revisionist, resenting loss of territory and arguing that
      the principle of self-determination had not been applied (Hungarians in Romania and Germans in
      the Sudetenland). Both republics were impoverished, the lost territories were economically
      important (for example Bohemia and Moravia). One significant consequence of St Germain was
      increased tensions between the Allied powers; Italy was furious at the limited territorial gains
      awarded to her by the treaty and called it the “mutilated victory”; Orlando left the peace conference.
      Candidates’ opinions or conclusions should be clearly stated and supported by appropriate
      evidence.


30.   “The Great Depression caused the collapse of collective security.” To what extent do you agree
      with this statement?

      The question requires that candidates consider the merits or otherwise of the view that the Great
      Depression was the reason for the end of collective security. Some may argue that collective
      security was undermined by the weakness of the League of Nations and the willingness of powers
      such as Britain and France to act independently of the League. Candidates could also focus on the
      impact of the Great Depression on international relations in the 1930s. Candidates may argue that
      the Depression contributed to the rise of Hitler and German nationalism. Nations increasingly
      followed economic protectionist policies and became more nationalistic. They were unwilling to act
      collectively in a crisis (Manchuria, Abyssinia) and the League lost credibility. This change can be
      linked directly to the Depression. It could also be argued that major powers such as Britain and
      France were focused on internal consequences of the Depression and were too weak financially to
      support collective action. Both Britain and France were facing major discontent within their empires
      (Egypt, India and Indo-China) and were less willing to maintain collective security. Candidates’
      opinions or conclusions should be clearly stated and supported by appropriate evidence.

Section 16: The Soviet Union and post-Soviet Russia (1924–2000)

31.   Discuss the political and economic impact of the Great Patriotic War (1941–1945) in the Soviet
      Union.

      The question requires that candidates offer a considered and balanced review of the political and
      economic impact of the Great Patriotic War in the Soviet Union. Candidates may discuss the
      immediate impact the war had on politics in reinforcing Stalin’s power and contributing to the
      escalation of terror. Candidates may refer to the use of coercion, censorship and mass
      deportations during the war years. Regarding the economic impact, candidates may refer to the
      massive losses and material damage caused by the war, the partial destruction of cities and towns,
      industrial establishments, railways, hospitals and schools. Candidates may also discuss the loss of
      livestock and problems in the agricultural system caused by the scorched earth tactics. Candidates
      may offer equal coverage of political and economic impacts, or they may prioritize their discussion
      of one of them. However, both aspects will be a feature of the response. Candidates’ opinions or
      conclusions will be presented clearly and supported by appropriate evidence.


32.   Evaluate the impact of Gorbachev’s policies on the Soviet Union.

      The question requires that candidates make an appraisal of the impact of Gorbachev’s policies on
      the Soviet Union. Candidates may refer to the restructuring of the economy (perestroika) and the
      democratization of the regime (glasnost). Candidates may consider the impact of the reduction on
      military spending, the abandonment of the arms race, the introduction of new technologies and the
      changes in the notion of market and private property. Candidates may evaluate the impact of these
      policies on the improvement or deterioration in the rate of employment, salaries, and the standard
      of living. Candidates may also evaluate the impact on the Soviet Union of Gorbachev’s new
      relations with other communist countries, the improvement in the diplomacy with US, and the
      disarmament treaties of Geneva, Reykjavik, Washington and Moscow. Candidates’ opinions or
      conclusions will be presented clearly and supported by appropriate evidence.

Section 17: Post-war western and northern Europe (1945–2000)

33.   “The major impact of the Marshall Plan was to put European countries under US control.” Discuss.

      The question requires that candidates offer a considered and balanced review of the statement
      that the major impact of the Marshall Plan was to put European countries under US control.
      Candidates may discuss the statement by referring to European dependency on food, raw
      material, credits and technology from the US. Candidates may also refer to CIA secret missions in
      European countries financed by the Marshall Plan, with the aim of controlling underground
      opposition groups and governments not aligned with the US. Candidates may also consider the
      imposition of new ways to produce and consume and the cultural “Americanization”. These all
      imply some control by the US as the Marshall plan provided funding. Candidates may challenge
      the statement by stating that the Plan only gave minimum control to the US regarding the allocation
      of the credits, and consider the creation of the Organisation for European Economic Co-operation
      (OEEC) that gave Europe power to decide the use of aid. Candidates’ opinions or conclusions will
      be presented clearly and supported by appropriate evidence.


34.   Evaluate the social and economic developments in Spain between 1982 and 2000.

      The question requires that candidates make an appraisal of the social and economic developments
      in Spain between 1982 and 2000. Candidates may evaluate reforms in the fields of education,
      public health and pension services. Regarding economic developments, candidates may refer to
      the re-addressing of the budget to new areas; the public investments in infrastructure; the
      progressive tax system applied until 1992 and the conservative economic policies implemented
      later to reduce the public deficit and to reactivate private activities. Candidates may also refer to
      Spain joining the European Economic Community and later the Euro. These must be made
      relevant to the question. Candidates may offer equal coverage of social and economic
      developments, or they may prioritize their evaluation of one of them. However, both aspects will be
      a feature of the response. Candidates’ opinions or conclusions will be presented clearly and
      supported by appropriate evidence.

Section 18: Post-war central and eastern Europe (1945–2000)

35.   Discuss the reasons for the establishment of COMECON and the Warsaw Pact.

      The question requires that candidates offer a considered and balanced review of the reasons for
      the establishment of COMECON and the Warsaw Pact. Candidates may consider the emergence
      of both as a consequence of the division between the Western and Eastern blocs. Regarding
      COMECON, candidates may discuss the need of an economic market for the socialist countries
      that were not allowed to participate in the Marshall Plan. Candidates may also refer to the need to
      strengthen the international socialist relationship; to coordinate the national economic plans; to
      improve trade relations among communist countries and to export industrial equipment and
      machinery as reasons for its creation. Regarding the Warsaw Pact, candidates may discuss its
      formation as a military answer to NATO. Candidates may also note geostrategic principles since
      the Soviet Union wanted to create a buffer zone to prevent an invasion of its territory and to
      maintain control over central and eastern Europe. Candidates’ opinions or conclusions will be
      presented clearly and supported by appropriate evidence.


36.   Compare and contrast the impact of opposition to Soviet control in two countries between 1968
      and 1989.

      The question requires that candidates give an account of the similarities and differences between
      two countries when considering the impact of opposition to Soviet control. There does not need to
      be an equal number of each. Candidates may refer to the role and ability of national leaders to
      remain in office, the consequences of the intervention of the Soviet military forces, when there
      were attempts to leave the Warsaw Pact (Czechoslovakia 1968). Candidates may consider the role
      of strong national leaders and trade union groups from industrial cities such as Solidarity in Poland.
      There may be some discussion of the extent of political reforms by national governments because
      of discontent with Soviet control. There should be a clear focus on the impact of opposition, with
      some discussion as to whether it led to more or less Soviet control. Candidates’ opinions or
      conclusions will be presented clearly and supported by appropriate evidence.
