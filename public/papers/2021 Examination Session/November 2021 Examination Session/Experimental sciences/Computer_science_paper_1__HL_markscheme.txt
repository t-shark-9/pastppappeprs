Subject details:         Computer science HL paper 1 markscheme

Mark allocation

Section A: Candidates are required to answer all questions. Total 25 marks.
Section B: Candidates are required to answer all questions. Total 75 marks.
           Maximum total = 100 marks.

General

• A markscheme often has more specific points worthy of a mark than the total allows. This is
  intentional. Do not award more than the maximum marks allowed for that part of a question.

• When deciding upon alternative answers by candidates to those given in the markscheme, consider
  the following points:

• Each statement worth one point has a separate line and the end is signified by means of a
  semi-colon (;).

• An alternative answer or wording is indicated in the markscheme by a “/”; either wording can be
  accepted.

• Words in ( … ) in the markscheme are not necessary to gain the mark.

• If the candidate’s answer has the same meaning or can be clearly interpreted as being the same as
  that in the markscheme then award the mark.

• Mark positively. Give candidates credit for what they have achieved and for what they have got
  correct, rather than penalizing them for what they have not achieved or what they have got wrong.

• Remember that many candidates are writing in a second language; be forgiving of minor linguistic
  slips. In this subject effective communication is more important than grammatical accuracy.

• Occasionally, a part of a question may require a calculation whose answer is required for subsequent
  parts. If an error is made in the first part then it should be penalized. However, if the incorrect answer
  is used correctly in subsequent parts then follow through marks should be awarded. Indicate this
  with “FT”.


General guidance

  Issue            Guidance
  Answering        • In the case of an “identify” question, read all answers and mark positively up to the
  more than          maximum marks. Disregard incorrect answers.
  the quantity     • In the case of a “describe” question, which asks for a certain number of facts
  of                 eg “describe two kinds”, mark the first two correct answers. This could include two
  responses          descriptions, one description and one identification, or two identifications.
  prescribed       • In the case of an “explain” question, which asks for a specified number of
  in the             explanations eg “explain two reasons …”, mark the first two correct answers.
  questions          This could include two full explanations, one explanation, one partial
                     explanation etc.

1.   Award [2 max]
     Primary storage is accessed by a computer's central processing unit (CPU) and secondary storage
     is not accessed directly by the CPU;
     Primary storage has lower access time / has smaller capacity/ more expensive type of memory
     than secondary storage (which is slower than primary storage, with larger capacity but it is
     cheaper);
     Primary storage is volatile (uses random-access memory (RAM), cache memory, or some other
     specialized hardware to store data while the computer is powered on/ volatile devices), whilst
     secondary storage on a computer is provided by non-volatile devices (such as SSD or HDD);
     Primary storage holds data temporarily whilst data is kept permanently/ for a long time in
     secondary storage;
     Primary storage holds currently running programs/data/operating system, secondary storage
     does not;

           A sorting algorithm is a method for reorganizing a number of items;
           into a specific order (such as alphabetical order, highest-to-lowest value);

           Sorting algorithm performs specific operations on the input list/array;
           In order to deliver ordered list/array as output;

     (b)   Award [2 max]

           Bubble sort swaps adjacent items;
           Selection sort finds the next smallest (each time it goes through the list);

           Bubble sort can exit early/ is faster if already the list is sorted;
           Selection sort will need to complete the procedure for the entire list every time;

           (The efficiency of Bubble and selection sort is different when applied on already sorted list)
           in the best-case bubble sort takes an order of N time;
           whereas selection sort consumes an order of N2 time (where N is the number of items on the
           list));

           Note: To award marks for such an answer it should be evident that the list is already sorted
           OR the term 'the best-case' should appear because the worst-case /average-case
           complexity/efficiency is same in both algorithms (O(N2)).

           Binary tree (is a tree) in which every node has (no, one or) at most two children whilst
           a non binary tree can have nodes with more than 2 children (non binary trees do not have an
           upper limit on number of children nodes);

           Each node in a binary tree can have at most two subtrees (left and right subtree), a node in a
           non binary tree can have any number of subtrees;

     Compressing a data file reduces the file size;
     The amount of time it takes to send a file over the network depends on the size of the transmitted
     file, so the amount of time needed to transmit the file is reduced /transmission of a compressed file
     takes less time than transmission of that same uncompressed file;
     Also, compression of data files before transmission reduces the financial cost of running a network/
     less equipment / bandwidth is needed to transmit the data file;

           A sub-program is a named section of code that performs a specific task (in a program) / can
           be called by name / referred by the identifier when needed;
           without knowing the details (of code and data structures) as these are wrapped / hidden
           within the sub-program;

     (b)   Award [3 max]

           different stages (of programming) (Accept examples!) run simultaneously (rather than
           consecutively);
           this decreases product development time / decreases the time to market;
           leading to improved productivity/reduces costs;
           however, it requires more resources/more software developers;

     (c)   Award [2 max]

           A message can be sent to the user (When the software is installed and registered, the user
           provides an email address / phone number);
           With a link to the update;

           notifications/alerts are sent to the computer (a cookie is placed on the user's computer which
           communicates with the software developer);
           about automatic updates;

           (when the program is run) it queries a URL the program developer has built in
           to check whether the current version matches the latest version;
           if not, notifications/alerts are sent;


8.   Award [3 max]

     OS keeps tracks of all peripheral devices (the I/O controller) / decides which process gets the
     device when and for how much time / allocates and de-allocates devices;
     OS works with device drivers and the basic input/output system (BIOS) to perform hardware tasks
      / the necessary drivers (for every peripheral) are built into the OS and/or when a new peripheral is
     added software / device driver provided by a hardware maker is installed into the operating system
     (to tell the computer's OS how to work with the peripheral/hardware) (because without a device
     driver the OS would not be able to communicate with this peripheral device);
     A device driver translates the OS's instructions into a language (analogue signals) that the device
     can understand;
     There are various types of device drivers for peripherals (such as keyboards, mice, disk drives,
     controllers, printers, graphics cards, ports, etc.);
     Device drivers run in the OS kernel space (in the part of the OS that directly interacts with the
     physical structure of the system) (and implement functions such as open, close, read, write);
     The running application/user's program can make a call to device driver functions which provide an
     interface between user space and kernel space;

     Example answer:
     An OS manages peripherals via their respective drivers;
     For example, sound card drivers;
     are necessary so the OS knows exactly how to translate the 1s and 0s (that comprise the MP3 file)
     into audio signals;
     that the sound card can output to headphones / speakers;

                  Surveys allow analysts to obtain appropriate information quickly;
                  from a large number of persons / stakeholders;

                  Standardized question formats are prepared;
                  that can provide data that can be easily quantified/allow quantitative analysis (the
                  success of a survey depends on the effectiveness of questions);

                  The use of standardized formats;
                  minimizes the risk if the analyst adding their opinion;

                  Survey is a straightforward/easy/practical way of gathering data;
                  it can be distributed using various methods (printed copies, e-mail, embedded in a
                  website, online forms)

                  Surveys allow greater anonymity for respondents;
                  which can lead to more honest responses;

           (ii)   Award [2 max]
                  Poorly designed surveys;
                  May make it difficult to analyse the data;
                  (Response may be limited/not all questions answered / not all forms will be returned;
                  Can be challenging to analyse the collected data ;)

                  Questions in the survey were not effective;
                  Can be differences in how people understand the survey questions;
                  Data gathered cannot be quantified;

            Safer transit;
            Trains are tracked and in case of emergency the location can be reached at the earliest and
            emergency services provided;

            More favourable view of transit/helps passenger to get punctuality status of the train/;
            GPS can provide worldwide three-dimensional positions (24 hours a day) (in any type of
            weather);

            Sometimes it is too difficult to ensure reliable positioning;
            Objects, such as buildings, overpasses, and other obstructions (that shield the antenna from
            a satellite) can potentially weaken a satellite's signal;

            Privacy issues;
            Knowing the absolute position of anything, anytime, anywhere;

      (b)   Award [2 max]

            The last node is identified by its next/link pointer;
            which contains the address of the node at the beginning of the list / is equal to the pointer
            “head “;

      Initialize (a temporary pointer with the head and) a variable sum with 0 (zero);
      Loop from the beginning to the end of the circular linked list / until all the nodes get
      traversed);
      Add the value (of the data field) (of the current node) to the sum;
      Change the temporary pointer so it points the next node of circular linked list;

      Note: Answers written in pseudocode are acceptable.
      For example,
      sum = 0
      curr = head
      loop
        sum = sum + curr.data
        curr = curr.next

      In an array, memory is assigned during compile time(predetermined) whilst in a linked list it is
      allocated during execution/runtime;
      Arrays are of fixed size whilst linked lists are flexible and can expand and contract its size;
      Array requires less memory (due to actual data being stored within the index in the array)
      whilst there is a need for more memory in linked list (due to storage of additional next and
      previous pointers/references);
      Elements are stored consecutively in array whereas elements are stored randomly in linked
      lists;
      Memory utilization is inefficient in the array whilst memory utilization is efficient in the linked
      list;
      Accessing an element in an array is direct (fast) while accessing an element in linked list is
      sequential/linear (slower) /to get into the nth element only the array name with index within
      the square bracket should be written whilst a linked list (to get the nth element) should be
      traversed starting from the beginning of the list, and traversing through the list until found/ ;
      Operations like insertion and deletion in arrays consume a lot of time whilst the performance
      of these operations in linked lists is fast;

      Print queues (a number of print jobs on a queue instead of waiting for each one to finish
      before specifying the next one);
      Queue is used for synchronization when data is transferred asynchronously between two
      processes (for example IO Buffers, file IO);
      Queues are used in CPU scheduling algorithms;
      Handling of interrupts in real-time systems (the interrupts are handled in the same order as
      they arrive, first come first served);
      Computer modelling of physical queues (supermarket checkouts) (call centre phone systems
      use queues to hold people calling them in an order, until a service representative is free);
