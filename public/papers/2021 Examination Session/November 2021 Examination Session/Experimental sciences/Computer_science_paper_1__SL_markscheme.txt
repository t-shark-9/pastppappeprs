Subject details:        Computer science SL paper 1 markscheme

Mark allocation

Section A: Candidates are required to answer all questions. Total 25 marks.
Section B: Candidates are required to answer all questions. Total 45 marks.
           Maximum total = 70 marks.

General

A markscheme often has more specific points worthy of a mark than the total allows. This is intentional.
Do not award more than the maximum marks allowed for that part of a question.

When deciding upon alternative answers by candidates to those given in the markscheme, consider the
following points:

• Each statement worth one point has a separate line and the end is signified by means of a
   semi-colon (;).

• An alternative answer or wording is indicated in the markscheme by a “/”; either wording can be
   accepted.

• Words in ( … ) in the markscheme are not necessary to gain the mark.

• If the candidate’s answer has the same meaning or can be clearly interpreted as being the same as
   that in the markscheme then award the mark.

• Mark positively. Give candidates credit for what they have achieved and for what they have got
   correct, rather than penalizing them for what they have not achieved or what they have got wrong.

• Remember that many candidates are writing in a second language; be forgiving of minor linguistic
   slips. In this subject effective communication is more important than grammatical accuracy.

• Occasionally, a part of a question may require a calculation whose answer is required for subsequent
   parts. If an error is made in the first part then it should be penalized. However, if the incorrect answer
   is used correctly in subsequent parts then follow through marks should be awarded. Indicate this
   with “FT”.


General guidance

 Issue            Guidance
 Answering        • In the case of an “identify” question, read all answers and mark positively up to the
 more than           maximum marks. Disregard incorrect answers.
 the quantity     • In the case of a “describe” question, which asks for a certain number of facts
 of                 eg “describe two kinds”, mark the first two correct answers. This could include two
 responses          descriptions, one description and one identification, or two identifications.
 prescribed       • In the case of an “explain” question, which asks for a specified number of
 in the             explanations eg “explain two reasons …”, mark the first two correct answers.
 questions          This could include two full explanations, one explanation, one partial
                    explanation etc.

1.   Award [2 max]
     Screen size/ larger screen;
     Easier to view large amounts of data without excessive scrolling / reduced eyestrain / more
     accessible to those with weak eyesight;

     Screen size/smaller screen;
     Difficult to accurately select the correct character on the virtual keyboard;


2.   Award [2 max]
     Primary storage is accessed by a computer's central processing unit (CPU) and secondary storage
     is not accessed directly by the CPU;
     Primary storage has lower access time / has smaller capacity/ more expensive type of memory
     than secondary storage (which is slower than primary storage, with larger capacity but it is
     cheaper);
     Primary storage is volatile (uses random-access memory (RAM), cache memory, or some other
     specialized hardware to store data while the computer is powered on/ volatile devices), whilst
     secondary storage on a computer is provided by non-volatile devices (such as SSD or HDD);
     Primary storage holds data temporarily whilst data is kept permanently/ for a long time in
     secondary storage;
     Primary storage holds currently running programs/data/operating system, secondary storage
     does not.

3.   Award [2 max]
     because the binary system uses only two digits (0 and 1);
     and computer uses bi-stable devices / devices that can be either in one of the two possible states
     (such as pulse or no pulse, on or off, 0 or 1, true or false) /;


4.   Award [3 max]

     Compressing a data file reduces the file size;
     The amount of time it takes to send a file over the network depends on the size of the transmitted
     file, so the amount of time needed to transmit the file is reduced /transmission of a compressed file
     takes less time than transmission of that same uncompressed file;
     Also, compression of data files before transmission reduces the financial cost of running a network/
     less equipment / bandwidth is needed to transmit the data file;

5.   (a)   Award [2 max]

           A sub-program is a named section of code that performs a specific task (in a program) / can
           be called by name / referred by the identifier when needed;
           without knowing the details (of code and data structures) as these are wrapped / hidden
           within the sub-program;

     (b)   Award [3 max]

           different stages (of programming) (Accept examples!) run simultaneously (rather than
           consecutively);
           this decreases product development time / decreases the time to market;
           leading to improved productivity/reduces costs;
           however, it requires more resources/more software developers;

     (c)   Award [2 max]

           A message can be sent to the user (When the software is installed and registered, the user
           provides an email address / phone number);
           With a link to the update;

           notifications/alerts are sent to the computer (a cookie is placed on the user's computer which
           communicates with the software developer);
           about automatic updates;

           (when the program is run) it queries a URL the program developer has built in
           to check whether the current version matches the latest version;
           if not, notifications/alerts are sent;

           The selection sort algorithm maintains two subarrays of a given array, the subarray which
           holds already sorted elements;
           And the subarray which is unsorted;
           In every iteration, the minimum element (considering ascending order OR maximum element
           considering descending order) from the unsorted subarray is found/selected;
           And then swapped with the item in the next position (at the appropriate place / in the last
           position) to be filled in the sorted subarray;

           OR
           The selection sort algorithm searches through the entire array for the smallest (considering
           ascending order OR the largest element considering descending order) element;
           When found, it (the smallest/largest element) is swapped with the first element of the array;
           Then searches for the smallest / largest element in the remaining array (an array without the
           first element) and swap it with the second element;
           This process repeats on the remaining items (searches for the smallest / largest element in
           the remaining array (an array without first and second elements)) and swap it with the third
           element, and so on);


     (b)   Award [2 max]

           Bubble sort swaps adjacent items;
           selection sort finds the next smallest (each time it goes through the list);

           Bubble sort can exit early/ is faster if already the list is sorted;
           selection sort will need to complete the procedure for the entire list every time;

           (The efficiency of Bubble and selection sort is different when applied on already sorted list)
           in the best-case bubble sort takes an order of N time;
           whereas selection sort consumes an order of N2 time (where N is the number of items on the
           list));

           Note: To award marks for such an answer it should be evident that the list is already sorted
           OR the term 'the best-case' should appear because the worst-case /average-case
           complexity/efficiency is same in both algorithms (O(N2)).
