10.   A company has a large networked computer system.

      Some of its data is non-sensitive data that would cause no risk to the company if accessed.

      where head is an external pointer that points to the first node in the circular linked list.

      Three operations are performed on this circular linked list in the following order:
      1 A node containing the number 30 is inserted at the beginning of the circular linked list.
      2 The last node is deleted from the circular linked list.
      3 The first node is deleted from the beginning of the circular linked list.

13.   A bus company provides services within a city. Passengers can look up the distance between
      any two bus stations on any of its routes.

      For each route, a one-dimensional string array is used to store the names of all bus stations
      on the route and a two-dimensional array is used to store the distances between the bus
      stations (in kilometres). Only the lower triangle of the two-dimensional array is used to store
      the distances.

      Figure 1 shows data about Route X, a bus route between Oppox and Dovely.

      (b)     Construct an algorithm in pseudocode that checks the elements of the array
              ROUTE_X_DISTANCES and outputs whether the array is valid or not.                                                             [5]

      (c)     Construct an algorithm in pseudocode that inputs the names of two bus stations and
              outputs the distance between them. If any of the inputted names are not found, the
              method should output an appropriate message.                                                                                 [6]

      The array ROUTE_X_TIMES (Figure 3) stores the approximate number of minutes it takes for
      a bus to travel to a bus station from the previous one. For example, ROUTE_X_TIMES [6]
      stores the number of minutes it takes for a bus to travel from Kingsley to Allapay: 7 minutes.

      (d)     Explain how this data could be used to determine the number of minutes it takes for a
              bus to travel between any two bus stations.                                                                                  [3]
