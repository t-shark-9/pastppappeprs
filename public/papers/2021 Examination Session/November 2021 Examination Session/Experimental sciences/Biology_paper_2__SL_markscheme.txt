Extended response questions - quality of construction

        Extended response questions for SLP2 carry a mark total of [16]. Of these marks, [15] are awarded for content and [1] for the quality of
         the answer.

        [1] for quality is awarded when:
             the candidate’s answers are clear enough to be understood without re-reading.
             the candidate has answered the question succinctly with little or no repetition or irrelevant material.

         Candidates that score very highly on the content marks need not necessarily automatically gain [1] for quality (and vice versa).
