Prescribed subject 1: Military leaders

1.   (a)   Why, according to Source A, was Genghis Khan a successful leader?                          [3]

              Genghis had military and political skill, and also had a reputation as a fair judge.
              He created a better way of dividing plunder among the tribes.
              Genghis used the shamans to spread tales to enhance his image.
              He had a direct connection with the common Mongol soldiers.

     The above material is an indication of what candidates may elect to write about in their
     responses. It is neither prescriptive nor exhaustive and no set answer is required.
     Award [1] for each relevant point up to a maximum of [3].


     (b)   What does Source D suggest about the military campaigns under the leadership
           of Genghis Khan?                                                                           [2]

            Genghis Khan’s many campaigns led to a significant expansion of his Empire.
            The campaigns spread out from a central base.
            Genghis Khan also conducted campaigns reaching as far as Korea in the east
             and the Russian Principalities in the west.

     The above material is an indication of what candidates may elect to write about in their
     responses. It is neither prescriptive nor exhaustive and no set answer is required.
     Award [1] for each relevant point up to a maximum of [2].

2.   With reference to its origin, purpose and content, analyse the value and limitations of
     Source C for an historian studying the leadership of Genghis Khan.                          [4]

     Value:
      It provides a 13th-century perspective from an explorer who travelled to Asia.
      As it intends to offer a description of Asia, information on Genghis Khan’s leadership
       and the Mongol Empire is expected.
      It provides information about Genghis Khan’s leadership qualities and the expansion
       of his empire.

     Limitations:
      As it was written in the late 13th century, the author had no direct experience with
       Genghis Khan and his empire.
      The author’s description of the leadership of Genghis Khan lacks balance, it is a
       very positive account.
      Because of the broad nature of the book, the treatment of Genghis Khan could
       be limited.

     The focus of the question is on the value and limitations of the source. If only value or
     limitations are discussed, award a maximum of [2]. Origin, purpose and content should
     be used as supporting evidence to make relevant comments on the value and
     limitations. For [4] there must be at least one reference to each of them in either the
     value or the limitations.

3.   Compare and contrast what Sources A and B reveal about the leadership of
     Genghis Khan.                                                                              [6]

       5–6      The response includes clear and valid points of comparison and of contrast.
       3–4      The response includes some valid points of comparison and/or of contrast,
                 although these points may lack clarity.
        1–2     The response consists of description of the content of the source(s), and/or
                 general comments about the source(s), rather than valid points of comparison
                 or of contrast.
         0      The response does not reach a standard described by the descriptors above.

     Apply the markbands that provide the “best fit” to the responses given by candidates
     and award credit wherever it is possible to do so. The following material is an
     indication of what candidates may elect to write about in their responses. It is neither
     prescriptive nor exhaustive and no set answer is required.

     Comparison:
      Both sources highlight Genghis Khan’s military and political skills as important
       factors as a powerful leader.
      Both sources state that he offered plunder to his followers.
      Both sources claim that Genghis Khan’s rule was dependent on continued success.
      Both sources highlight the role of shamans in supporting Genghis Khan’s
       leadership.

     Contrast:
      Source A highlights Genghis Khan’s supreme leadership whereas Source B states
       that nobles had direct control over their followers.
      Source A claims shamans were used to promote Genghis Khan’s leadership
       favourably whereas Source B states that shamans provided some limits to the
       chief’s authority.

     Indicative content

     Source A               Genghis Khan’s military skill reinforced his reputation as a leader
                            within the tribes. However, by changing the way plunder was
                            distributed, Genghis Khan was further able to reinforce his
                            leadership and created a direct connection with the Mongol
                            soldiers. His power base was also boosted through the use of
                            shamans.

     Source B               Genghis Khan’s military success allowed him to increase the
                            number of troops and followers. However, his followers only
                            remained loyal as long as Genghis was able to continue rewarding
                            them with benefits. His charisma and the confirmation of his
                            authority by shamans and nobles were also necessary elements.
                                             –7–                   N21/3/HISTX/BP1/ENG/TZ0/XX/M


    Source C        Genghis Khan was responsible for arming his people and leading
                    them to conquer new lands. Each conquest provided new
                    resources to continue the expansion. Together with his lordship
                    and nobility, the fact that Genghis did not cause great harm to
                    conquered lands persuaded many people to willingly submit to his
                    leadership.

    Source D        The map clearly depicts the contribution of military campaigns to
                    expanding his empire.

    Own knowledge   Candidates may refer to Genghis Khan’s campaigns to unite the
                    tribes against the Xi Xia kingdom of north-western China and the
                    Khwarezm Empire as examples of battles that allowed him to build
                    the Mongol Empire. Candidates may give further details about his
                    effective military tactics such as his preference to fight with a large
                    reserve of cavalrymen and his deployment of the strategy of false
                    withdrawal. Candidates may argue that other factors such as the
                    abolition of inherited aristocratic titles allowed Genghis to reinforce
                    his leadership and to build a successful empire. Candidates may
                    also refer to the significance of religious tolerance; the prohibition
                    of selling and kidnapping women and the enslavement of any
                    Mongol; the application of serious punishments for robbery; and
                    the adoption of a writing system and census in the building of his
                    power base.

Prescribed subject 2: Conquest and its impact

5.   (a)   What, according to Source G, were the consequences of Atahualpa’s encounter
           with Francisco Pizarro?                                                              [3]

            Atahualpa was attacked and captured by Pizarro.
            His followers offered little resistance to the Spaniards.
            Atahualpa proposed to buy his freedom and delivered gold and silver to
             the Spaniards.
            He was accused of treachery and executed.

     The above material is an indication of what candidates may elect to write about in their
     responses. It is neither prescriptive nor exhaustive and no set answer is required.
     Award [1] for each relevant point up to a maximum of [3].

     (b)   What does Source F suggest about the payment of Atahualpa’s ransom?                  [2]

            Many Incas helped to transport the massive ransom.
            The ransom consisted of large pieces of gold and valuable items.
            Armed Spaniards controlled the payment of the ransom.

     The above material is an indication of what candidates may elect to write about in their
     responses. It is neither prescriptive nor exhaustive and no set answer is required.
     Award [1] for each relevant point up to a maximum of [2].

6.   With reference to its origin, purpose and content, analyse the value and limitations of
     Source E for an historian studying the reactions to Atahualpa’s imprisonment.               [4]

     Value:
      It provides a 16th-century perspective from a Spanish conqueror.
      It shows that Atahualpa’s imprisonment gave opponents the opportunity to rise up
       against his control.
      The intention of the author is to chronicle the events of the conquest.

     Limitations:
      Since it is based on contemporary accounts it lacks the benefit of hindsight.
      It only gives the Spanish perspective on Atahualpa’s imprisonment.
      The information about Atahualpa’s capture could have been exaggerated to
       highlight the success of the Spanish conquest.

     The focus of the question is on the value and limitations of the source. If only value or
     limitations are discussed, award a maximum of [2]. Origin, purpose and content should
     be used as supporting evidence to make relevant comments on the value and
     limitations. For [4] there must be at least one reference to each of them in either the
     value or the limitations.

     conquest of Peru.                                                                               [6]

     indication of what candidates may elect to write about in their responses. It is neither
     prescriptive nor exhaustive and no set answer is required.

     Comparison:
      Both sources state that Atahualpa was attacked and captured by Pizarro during their
       meeting.
      Both sources reveal that a ransom was offered to the Spaniards to free Atahualpa.
      Both sources state that Atahualpa was executed by Pizarro.
      Both sources mention the conflict between Atahualpa and his brother Huascar, who
       was executed on Atahualpa’s orders.

     Contrast:
      Source G states that the Spaniards accused Atahualpa of treachery whereas
       Source H claims Atahualpa was charged with false accusations.
      Source G claims that after defeating Atahualpa, the Spaniards installed puppet Inca
       emperors and received local support whereas Source H states that the Incas
       continued to resist Spanish rule.

     fall to the conquest of Peru.                                                                      [9]

     Indicative content

     Source E             Atahualpa’s fall exposed divisions within the Inca Empire. Many
                          indigenous populations rose up against his rule and facilitated the
                          Spanish conquest.

     Source F             In order to gain his freedom, Atahualpa offered the payment of a
                          large ransom in objects made of precious metals. The ransom
                          enriched the Spanish conquerors.

     Source G             The Spaniards feared renewed resistance if Atahualpa was free to
                          lead his armies. After the execution of Atahualpa, the Spaniards
                          were able to continue the conquest of Peru, installing puppet
                          emperors on the Inca throne, and benefitted from the support of
                          many districts.

Source H        Despite the execution of Atahualpa, the Spaniards still
                encountered opposition to their conquest from other Inca leaders
                such as Manco Inca. Manco Inca was a constant threat to the
                Spanish.

Own knowledge   Candidates may also mention the civil war between Atahualpa and
                his brother Huascar that resulted in the execution of Huascar and
                many members of his family. This caused a power vacuum within
                the indigenous populations. The civil war also produced a division
                within the indigenous populations and many of them helped the
                Spaniards. Candidates may argue that Atahualpa was considered
                a key ruler and also heir to the hero Manco Cápac. In
                consequence, his fall left his people without any guidance.
                Candidates may also consider that Atahualpa’s fall in Cajamarca
                allowed Pizarro to quickly take control over the rest of the Inca
                Empire, and to introduce a superior army in the region.

Prescribed subject 3: The move to global war

9.   (a)   What, according to Source I, were the reasons for the signing of the
           Nazi–Soviet Pact?                                                                    [3]

            As a result of the policies of England, the relationship between Germany and
             Poland had become unbearable.
            The Germans in the border areas between Germany and Poland were being
             persecuted.
            The current policy of Poland had brought about a complete standstill in
             Danzig's economic life.
            The Soviet government was now more willing to negotiate with Germany.

     (b)   What does Source J suggest about the relationship between Hitler and Stalin?         [2]

            They are both shaking hands indicating that relations between them seem to
             be good.
            They are both hiding something behind their back, suggesting mistrust. This is
             supported by the caption “doubtful friends”.
            The map of Poland they are standing on suggests that they have agreed to
             share Poland between them.

10.   With reference to its origin, purpose and content, analyse the value and limitations of
      Source I for an historian studying the Nazi–Soviet Pact.                                    [4]

      Value:
       It is a letter by Hitler himself, Fuhrer of Germany, after the Nazi–Soviet Pact was
        signed.
       Its intention is to justify to Mussolini why the Pact was necessary and to gain
        Mussolini’s support.
       It clearly identifies the reasons why Hitler wanted an agreement between Germany
        and the USSR.

      Limitations:
       The source only gives an unofficial statement of policy while events were still
        unfolding.
       The aim behind the letter is to gain Mussolini’s support and it may be merely
        exaggerating the reality of the situation.
       It only offers a German perspective on the agreement and does not consider a
        Soviet perspective.

      The focus of the question is on the value and limitations of the source. If only value or
      limitations are discussed, award a maximum of [2]. Origin, purpose and content should
      be used as supporting evidence to make relevant comments on the value and
      limitations. For [4] there must be at least one reference to each of them in either the
      value or the limitations.

      indication of what candidates may elect to write about in their responses. It is neither
      prescriptive nor exhaustive and no set answer is required.

      Comparison:
       Both sources state that Hitler sent a personal message to Stalin to help to advance
        Ribbentrop’s visit.
       Both sources suggest the importance of the secret agreement.
       Both sources state that Britain would stand by its obligations to Poland.
       Both sources agree that Italy was unprepared to go to war.

      Contrast:
       Source K suggests that Hitler and Stalin were satisfied with the agreement whereas
        Source L states neither side seriously believed that it would last.
       Source K states that Britain wanted to pursue diplomacy with Germany whereas
        Source L suggests that Chamberlain was more belligerent.

      Indicative content

      Source I             Hitler claimed that Germans were being persecuted and that
                           Polish policy was ruining Danzig. A more aggressive policy by
                           Germany was thus needed. The Nazi–Soviet Pact also gave Hitler
                           the confidence to attack Poland in September 1939.

      Source J             Shows the new relationship between Hitler and Stalin in
                           September 1939. They have signed the Nazi–Soviet Pact;
                           guaranteeing their respective spheres of influence and opening the
                           door for a German invasion of Poland.

Source K        The Non-Aggression Pact between Germany and the USSR
                guaranteed the neutrality of either country if war broke out. The
                secret agreement ensured the establishment of both countries’
                spheres of influence. The Pact allowed Hitler to attack Poland
                without fear of interference from Stalin.

Source L        Hitler had ensured Stalin’s neutrality so he could attack Poland.
                Hitler also hoped that Britain would remain neutral and not become
                embroiled in any war between Germany and Poland so on 1
                September 1939 Germany attacked Poland.

Own knowledge   Candidates may refer to Lebensraum and Hitler’s policy of
                Ostpolitik as background detail, but the main focus should be on
                events directly leading to the outbreak of war. By the middle of
                1939, Hitler had become increasingly confident that Britain and
                France would remain neutral; due to the policy of appeasement
                and inaction, with regard to Austria, the Sudetenland and
                Czechoslovakia. Hitler wanted to achieve his long-term goal of
                reuniting East Prussia with Germany and abolishing the Polish
                Corridor.
                Some may argue that Hitler’s decision to attack Poland was
                motivated by the economic situation in Germany. Candidates may
                also argue that the German High Command had already made
                plans for the attack on Poland in the summer of 1939. The
                conclusion of the Nazi–Soviet Pact in August 1939 allowed them to
                execute their plans. Hitler intended to use Poland as a launchpad
                for a subsequent attack on the Soviet Union.

               Johnson was shocked at the brutality suffered by peaceful protesters in Selma.
               He wanted to eliminate illegal barriers to voting.
               Johnson wanted to uphold the American Constitution.
               He felt that it was deeply wrong to deny anyone the right to vote.

14.   With reference to its origin, purpose and content, analyse the value and limitations of
      Source M for an historian studying the policy of the US government in regard to

      Value:
       As the contemporary President of the US he is likely to have thorough knowledge of
        the situation.
       It suggests that the US government was aware of the need to help African
        Americans to exercise their right to vote.
       The source shows the rationale used to convince Congress to vote for the Act.

      Comparison:
       Both sources explain that the enforcement of the Civil Rights Act (1964) was weak.
       Both sources refer to the success of the Voting Rights Act in enabling more African
        Americans to vote.
       Both sources show how the Selma March in 1965 shocked President Johnson into
        enacting further legislation to enforce the Civil Rights Act (1964).
       Both sources refer to the need for Federal officials to ensure the enforcement of the
        law.

      Contrast:
       Source P states that the Civil Rights Act (1964) was a great legislative achievement
        whereas Source O is more critical.
       Source O states that the Voting Rights Act (1965) transformed political power in the
        South, whereas Source P argues that it was mainly ignored in the South.

      Indicative content

      Source M             African Americans faced huge obstacles to registration and so the
                           Voting Rights Act (1965) was needed to remove illegal barriers to
                           voting. As a result of Selma´s peaceful protest, Johnson decided to
                           act.

      Source N             Greater priority was given to the US space program than to the
                           improvement of civil rights. The civil rights movement had stalled in
                           1961, showing that further progress was required to enable African
                           Americans to vote.

Source O        The Civil Rights Act (1964) had a limited contribution in increasing
                voter registration of African Americans in the South. The source
                claims that the Voting Rights Act (1965) was needed to make a
                significant contribution to the rise in African American voter
                registration in the South.

Source P        The Civil Rights Act (1964) did not resolve the issue of voting
                rights as demonstrated by events in Selma and showed that
                further legislation was necessary because especially in the South
                many of the provisions were ignored. However, the Voting Rights
                Act (1965), with Federal intervention, contributed to a vast
                improvement in voter participation for African Americans.

Own knowledge   Candidates may refer to the positive contribution to voter
                registration brought about by the Civil Rights Act (1964). They may
                also offer further examples of how literacy tests were not abolished
                in some states and how these continued to prevent many African
                Americans from voting. Candidates may refer to specific protest
                campaigns such as the Mississippi Freedom Summer of 1964 that
                indicated a frustration with the limited contribution of the Civil
                Rights Act (1964) to voting rights.
                Although the Voting Rights Act (1965) resulted in more African
                Americans being registered to vote, the total was still only around
                35% of eligible voters. There were further attempts by the federal
                government to enforce the abolition of the poll tax. Still, candidates
                may mention that dissatisfaction remained and link this to the
                outbreak of the Watts Riots shortly after the Voting Rights Act
                (1965) was passed.

Prescribed subject 5: Conflict and intervention

17.   (a)   What, according to Source Q, were the causes of violence and conflict in Rwanda
            in 1994?                                                                             [3]

             Habyarimana had prevented Hutu and Tutsi divisions before he had been
              killed.
             The peasants believed Tutsis were responsible for the death of the president.
             The peasants said they had to defend themselves from the Tutsi enemy.
             The actions of both the Rwandan Patriotic Front (RPF) and Rwandan
              government led to violence.

      The above material is an indication of what candidates may elect to write about in their
      responses. It is neither prescriptive nor exhaustive and no set answer is required.
      Award [1] for each relevant point up to a maximum of [3].


      (b)   What does Source R suggest about the impact of the conflict in Rwanda by
            July 1994?                                                                           [2]

             The conflict had driven government soldiers into retreat.
             Large numbers of civilians were fleeing.
             There was chaos as people fled with all their belongings.

      The above material is an indication of what candidates may elect to write about in their
      responses. It is neither prescriptive nor exhaustive and no set answer is required.

18.   With reference to its origin, purpose and content, analyse the value and limitations of
      Source Q for an historian studying the conflict in Rwanda in 1994.                          [4]

      Value:
       The source offers a first-hand account from a witness of the conflict.
       The interview was given to explain the motives for participation in the violence.
       It suggests that both the RPF and the government were responsible for what
        happened in Rwanda.

      Limitations:
       The witness had confessed to killing civilians and may want to justify his actions.
       It only offers insight into a pro-government position.
       The account is vague and does not offer specific details on events in 1994.

      The focus of the question is on the value and limitations of the source. If only value or
      limitations are discussed, award a maximum of [2]. Origin, purpose and content should
      be used as supporting evidence to make relevant comments on the value and
      limitations. For [4] there must be at least one reference to each of them in either the
      value or the limitations.

        all civilians.
       Source T states that government politicians determined on a policy of genocide
        whereas Source S focuses on the role of the military in perpetrating the massacres.

      Indicative content

      Source Q             The RPF war and the assassination of Habyarimana had
                           destabilized Rwanda. The Tutsi were held responsible for the
                           death of the president. But both sides, the RPF and the
                           government, were responsible for the escalation in violence.

      Source R             The advance of the RPF had forced the government’s military into
                           retreat and this led to large numbers of civilians to flee the violent
                           situation in Rwanda.

Source S        Hutu leaders believed that the RPF were responsible as it had
                refused to negotiate with the government. However, the
                government’s military had planned to kill the Tutsi, thus increasing
                violence.

Source T        The RPF did not want a ceasefire as it was winning the war. As a
                consequence, the government decided to destroy the RPF’s Tutsi
                power base through a policy of genocide.

Own knowledge   Candidates may offer more detail on the role of the Rwandan
                Patriotic Front, the legacy of the civil war and the policies of RPF
                leader Paul Kagame. It could also be argued that the government,
                and its Hutu extremist supporters, were responsible for the
                violence. Bagosora had not supported the Arusha Accords; after
                the assassination of Habyarimana he appointed the extremist
                government. The crisis committee had the real power and, led by
                Bagosora, implemented the genocide.
                Candidates may argue that the violence against the Tutsi had
                been pre-planned. The role of the media was important, for
                example in distributing the Hutu 10 Commandments; the role of
                Kangura magazine and the incitement to violence by the Radio
                Television Libre des Mille Collines [RTLM]. Candidates may argue
                that the inaction of the international community, despite Dallaire’s
                warnings in the Genocide Cable, contributed to the escalation of
                violence.
