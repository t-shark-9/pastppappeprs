Paper 2 assessment criteria

Criterion A — Focus on the question                                                                  [2]

To understand the requirements of the question students must identify the problem or issue being raised
by the question. Students may simply identify the problem by restating the question or breaking down the
question. Students who go beyond this by explaining the problem are showing that they understand the
issues or problems.

 Marks       Level descriptor

    0        Does not reach the standard described by the descriptors below.

    1        Identifies the problem/issue raised in the question.

    2        Explains the problem/issue raised in the question.


Criterion B — Knowledge and understanding                                                            [6]

This criterion rewards students for demonstrating their knowledge and understanding of specific areas of
psychology. It is important to credit relevant knowledge and understanding that is targeted at
addressing the question and explained in sufficient detail.

 Marks       Level descriptor

    0        Does not reach the standard described by the descriptors below.

             The response demonstrates limited relevant knowledge and understanding.
  1–2
             Psychological terminology is used but with errors that hamper understanding.

             The response demonstrates relevant knowledge and understanding but lacks detail.
  3–4
             Psychological terminology is used but with errors that do not hamper understanding.

             The response demonstrates relevant, detailed knowledge and understanding.
  5–6
             Psychological terminology is used appropriately.
                                                 –4–                N21/3/PSYCH/HP2/ENG/TZ0/XX/M


Criterion C — Use of research to support answer                                                      [6]

Psychology is evidence based so it is expected that students will use their knowledge of research to
support their argument. There is no prescription as to which or how many pieces of research are
appropriate for their response. As such it becomes important that the research selected is relevant and
useful in supporting the response. One piece of research that makes the points relevant to the answer
is better than several pieces that repeat the same point over and over.

 Marks       Level descriptor

    0       Does not reach the standard described by the descriptors below.

            Limited relevant psychological research is used in the response.
  1–2
            Research selected serves to repeat points already made.

            Relevant psychological research is used in support of the response and is
  3–4       partly explained.
            Research selected partially develops the argument.

            Relevant psychological research is used in support of the response and is
  5–6       thoroughly explained.
            Research selected is effectively used to develop the argument.
                                                    –5–                 N21/3/PSYCH/HP2/ENG/TZ0/XX/M


Criterion D — Critical thinking                                                                            [6]

This criterion credits students who demonstrate an inquiring and reflective attitude to their understanding
of psychology. There are a number of areas where students may demonstrate critical thinking about the
knowledge and understanding used in their responses and the research used to support that knowledge
and understanding. The areas of critical thinking are:
• research design and methodologies
• triangulation
• assumptions and biases
• contradictory evidence or alternative theories or explanations
• areas of uncertainty.

These areas are not hierarchical and not all areas will be relevant in a response. In addition, students
could demonstrate a very limited critique of methodologies, for example, and a well-developed
evaluation of areas of uncertainty in the same response. As a result a holistic judgement of their
achievement in this criterion should be made when awarding marks.

 Marks       Level descriptor

    0        Does not reach the standard described by the descriptors below.

             There is limited critical thinking and the response is mainly descriptive.
  1–2
             Evaluation or discussion, if present, is superficial.

             The response contains critical thinking, but lacks development.
  3–4
             Evaluation or discussion of most relevant areas is attempted but is not developed.

             The response consistently demonstrates well-developed critical thinking.
  5–6
             Evaluation or discussion of relevant areas is consistently well developed.


Criterion E — Clarity and organization                                                                     [2]

This criterion credits students for presenting their response in a clear and organized manner. A good
response would require no re-reading to understand the points made or the train of thought underpinning
the argument.

 Marks       Level descriptor

    0        Does not reach the standard described by the descriptors below.

             The answer demonstrates some organization and clarity, but this is not sustained
    1
             throughout the response.

    2        The answer demonstrates organization and clarity throughout the response.
                                                    –6–                N21/3/PSYCH/HP2/ENG/TZ0/XX/M


Abnormal psychology

1.   Discuss validity and/or reliability of diagnosis.                                            [22]

     Refer to the paper 2 assessment criteria when awarding marks.

     The command term “discuss” requires candidates to offer a considered review that
     addresses various aspects of validity and/or reliability of diagnosis.

     Relevant classification systems in the discussion of validity and reliability of diagnosis
     include, but are not limited to:
     • Diagnostic Statistical Manual (DSM)
     • Chinese Classification of Mental Disorders (CCMD)
     • International Classification of Diseases (ICD).

     Examples of research that could be used include, but are not limited to:
     • Nicholls et al.’s (2000) studies of inter-rater reliability
     • Seeman’s (2007) literature review on the reliability of diagnosis
     • Wakefield et al.’s (2007) study on the validity of diagnosis

        diagnosis
     • cultural, gender and/or ethical considerations related to research into validity and/or
        reliability of diagnosis
     • biases related to diagnosis
     • how the findings of the research have been interpreted and applied
     • implications of the findings.
                                                   –7–                   N21/3/PSYCH/HP2/ENG/TZ0/XX/M


2.   Evaluate one or more explanations for one psychological disorder.                            [22]

     Refer to the paper 2 assessment criteria when awarding marks.

     The command term “evaluate” requires the candidate to make an appraisal by weighing
     up the strengths and limitations of one or more explanations for one psychological
     disorder. Although a discussion of both strengths and limitations is required, it does not
     have to be evenly balanced to gain high marks.

     The disorder chosen is likely to come from the list in the guide:
     • anxiety disorders
     • depressive disorders
     • obsessive compulsive disorders
     • trauma and stress related disorders
     • eating disorders.

     Explanations for psychological disorders may include, but are not limited to:
     • Biological explanations, such as neurological/neurochemical explanations for
       depression, the role of genes, or the role of brain abnormalities
     • Cognitive explanations, such as Beck’s theory of depression
     • Sociocultural explanations, such as Brown and Harris’s social vulnerability model.

     Relevant studies may include, but are not limited to:
     • Brown and Harris’s (1978) study on vulnerability to depression
     • Caspi et al.’s (2003) study on genes and depression
     • Gilbertson et al.’s (2002) study on the hippocampus and PTSD in veterans
     • Hitchcock et al.’s (2015) study on cognitive appraisal in post-traumatic stress.

     Evaluation of the selected research may include, but is not limited to:
     • methodological and ethical considerations related to research into psychological
       disorders
     • the accuracy and clarity of the concepts
     • cultural and gender considerations
     • supporting and/or contradictory findings
     • contrasting explanations
     • the productivity of the explanation in generating psychological research
     • implications of findings
     • the applications of the empirical findings.

     If the candidate addresses only strengths or only limitations, the response should be
     awarded up to a maximum of [3] for criterion D: critical thinking. All remaining criteria
     should be awarded marks according to the best fit approach.
                                                   –8–                   N21/3/PSYCH/HP2/ENG/TZ0/XX/M


3.   Evaluate one or more studies related to the treatment of one or more
     psychological disorders.                                                                           [22]

     Refer to the paper 2 assessment criteria when awarding marks.

     The command term “evaluate” requires the candidate to make an appraisal by weighing up
     the strengths and limitations of one or more studies related to the treatment of one or more
     psychological disorders. The focus of the evaluation should be upon the study/studies, not
     the treatment of psychological disorders. Although a discussion of both strengths and
     limitations is required, it does not have to be evenly balanced to gain high marks.

     The disorder chosen is likely to come from the list in the guide:
     • anxiety disorders
     • depressive disorders
     • obsessive compulsive disorders
     • trauma and stress related disorders
     • eating disorders.

     Relevant studies may include, but are not limited to:
     • Rossello and Bernal’s (1999) study adapting cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) and
       interpersonal psychotherapy (IPT) for Puerto Rican adolescents
     • Mason and Hargreaves’ (2001) qualitative interviews regarding effectiveness of
       mindfulness-based cognitive therapy (MBCT)
     • McLay et al.’s (2011) assessment of the effectiveness of virtual reality exposure therapy
       (VRET) for post-traumatic stress disorder
     • Kuyken et al.’s (2008) randomized control trial of MBCT and anti-depressive medication
     • Caspi et al.’s (2003) study on treatment of depression
     • Luty et al.’s (2007) randomized control trial of IPT and CBT
     • Elkin et al.’s (1989) controlled outcome study on treatment of depression.

     If the candidate provides studies on causes of disorder (rather than treatment of disorder) the
     response needs to make a clear link between the underlying cause and how it can be approached
     in treatment for the responses to gain credit.

     Evaluation of the selected research may include, but is not limited to:
     • methodological and ethical considerations
     • cultural and gender considerations
     • supporting and/or contradictory findings
     • how the findings have been interpreted and applied.

     If the candidate addresses only strengths or only limitations, the response should be
     awarded up to a maximum of [3] for criterion D: critical thinking. All remaining criteria should
     be awarded marks according to the best fit approach.

     In questions that ask for evaluation of studies, marks awarded for criterion B should refer to
     definitions of terms and concepts. Overall this could include some knowledge of topic but more
     specifically knowledge and understanding related to research methods and ethics of chosen
     studies.

     Marks awarded for criterion C assess the quality of the description of as study/studies and assess
     how well the student linked the findings of the study to the question – this does not need to be very
     sophisticated or long for these questions but still the aim or the conclusion should be linked to the
     topic of the specific question.

     Criterion D assesses how well the student is explaining strengths and limitations of the
     study/studies.
                                                  –9–                  N21/3/PSYCH/HP2/ENG/TZ0/XX/M


Developmental psychology

4.   To what extent do sociocultural factors influence the development of identity?                      [22]

     Refer to the paper 2 assessment criteria when awarding marks.

     The command term "to what extent" requires candidates to consider the contribution of
     sociocultural factors in the development of identity. It is appropriate and useful for candidates
     to address the influence of biological and cognitive factors in the development of identity in
     order to respond to the command term "to what extent".

     Sociocultural factors influencing identity development may include, but are not limited to:
     • family influences on identity development
     • the role of culture in identity development
     • the ethnic aspect of identity development
     • gender and identity development
     • social class and identity development
     • social identity and identity development.

     Research studies may include, but are not limited to:
     • Marcia (1980) family influences on identity development in adolescence
     • Erikson’s (1968) research on culture, race, ethnicity and identity
     • Phinney’s (1989) study on ethnic identities of minority groups
     • Gilligan (1990) study on gender and identity development
     • Tajfel and Turner (1979) research on social identity and identity development
     • Gee and Crawford, (1998) research on language, social class and identity

     Candidates may address a small number of sociocultural factors influencing identity
     development in order to demonstrate depth of knowledge, or may address a larger number of
     sociocultural factors influencing identity development in order to demonstrate breadth of
     knowledge. Both approaches are equally acceptable.

5.   Evaluate one or more theories of cognitive development.                                            [22]

     Refer to the paper 2 assessment criteria when awarding marks.

     The command term “evaluate” requires candidates to make an appraisal by weighing up the
     strengths and limitations of one or more theories of cognitive development. Although a
     discussion of both strengths and limitations is required, it does not have to be evenly
     balanced to gain high marks.

     Theories may include, but are not limited to:
     • Piaget's theory of cognitive development
     • Vygotsky's theory of sociocultural cognition
     • Kohlberg's theory of moral development
     • Bruner's theory suggesting that thinking is the result of cognitive development
     • the information-processing approach to cognitive development

     • Saxe et al.'s (1987) study on the zone of proximal development
     • Wood et al.'s (1976) study on the role of tutoring in problem solving.

     Evaluation may include, but is not limited to:
     • methodological and ethical considerations related to the research into
       cognitive development
     • stages versus continuous process
     • how the findings of research have been interpreted
     • assumptions and biases
     • areas of uncertainty
     • supporting and/or contradictory evidence
     • alternative theories/explanations
     • the accuracy and clarity of the concepts
     • practical applications.

     If the candidate addresses only strengths or only limitations, the response should be
     awarded up to a maximum of [3] for criterion D: critical thinking. All remaining criteria should
     be awarded marks according to the best fit approach.

6.   Discuss the role of peers and/or play in cognitive development and/or social development.           [22]

     Refer to the paper 2 assessment criteria when awarding marks.

     The command term "discuss" requires candidates to offer a considered review of the role of
     peers and/or play in cognitive and/or social development.

     Relevant topics may include, but are not limited to:
     • the influence of different categories of play on cognitive and/or social development
     • the therapeutic value of play
     • Piaget's and Vygotsky's theories related to play and cognitive development

        reducing adolescent's drug use
     • Kupersmidt and Coie's (1990) studies on peer rejection as predictor of externalizing
        problems in adolescence.

     Discussion may include, but is not limited to:
     • methodological and ethical considerations related to the research into the role of peers
        and play in cognitive and/or social development
     • how the findings of research have been interpreted and applied (eg designing physical
        education courses for different ages of children)
     • implications of the findings
     • assumptions and biases
     • areas of uncertainty
     • supporting and/or contradictory evidence
     • alternative explanations addressing cognitive and/or social development.

     Candidates may discuss one aspect of the role of peers and/or play in cognitive and/or social
     development in order to demonstrate depth of knowledge, or may discuss a larger number of
     aspects of the role of peers and/or play in cognitive and/or social development in order to
     demonstrate breadth of knowledge. Both approaches are equally acceptable.

Health psychology

7.   Evaluate one or more studies related to health promotion.         [22]

     Refer to the paper 2 assessment criteria when awarding marks.

     The command term “evaluate” requires candidates to make an appraisal of one or more
     studies related to health promotion by weighing up strengths and limitations of the studies.
     The focus of the evaluation should be upon the study/studies and not on health promotion in
     general. Although both strengths and limitations should be addressed, the discussion does
     not have to be evenly balanced to gain high marks.

     Relevant studies related to health promotion may include, but are not limited to:
     • Rosenstock et al.’s (1988) study related to the Health Belief Model
     • Prochaska and Di Clemente’s (1983) processes of change study related to the
       Transtheoretical Model
     • Marlatt and Gordon’s (1985) study related to the Relapse-Prevention Model
     • Weinstein’s (1987) study on unrealistic optimism hindering health promotion.

     Evaluation of the selected studies may include, but is not limited to:
     • methodological and ethical considerations
     • cultural and gender considerations
     • supporting and/or contradictory findings
     • the applications of the empirical findings
     • how the findings of research have been interpreted
     • implications of the findings.

     If the candidate addresses only strengths or only limitations, the response should be
     awarded up to a maximum of [3] for criterion D: critical thinking. All remaining criteria should
     be awarded marks according to the best fit approach.

     In questions that ask for evaluation of studies, marks awarded for criterion B should refer to
     definitions of terms and concepts. Overall this could include some knowledge of topic but more
     specifically knowledge and understanding related to research methods and ethics of chosen
     studies.

     sophisticated or long for these questions but still the aim or the conclusion should be linked to the
     topic of the specific question.

     Criterion D assesses how well the student is explaining strengths and limitations of the
     study/studies.

     Refer to the paper 2 assessment criteria when awarding marks.

     The command term “discuss” requires candidates to offer a considered review of how risk
     and/or protective factors affect health. Candidates may choose to discuss health in general
     or might refer to a specific health problem. Either approach is acceptable.

     Aspects of health likely to be addressed are:
     • stress
     • addiction
     • obesity
     • chronic pain
     • sexual health.

     Risk/protective factors may include, but are not limited to:
     • socioeconomic factors
     • level of peer support
     • family factors
     • health beliefs
     • resiliency traits.

     Relevant studies may include, but are not limited to:
     • Unger and Chen’s (1999) study in risk and protective factors related to adolescent
       smoking initiation
     • Haines, Neumark-Sztainer, Wall, and Story’s (2012) study of risk and protective factors of
       adolescent weight gain
     • Yi, Poudel, and Yasouka’s (2010) study of the role of risk and protective factors in risky
       sexual behaviours in Cambodian high school students.

     Discussion may include, but is not limited to:
     • methodological and ethical considerations related to the research into risk and/or
        protective factors of health
     • how the findings of research have been interpreted and applied
     • theoretical issues
     • assumptions and biases
     • areas of uncertainty
     • supporting and/or contradictory evidence
     • cultural and gender considerations.

     Candidates may discuss a small number of risk/protective factors in order to demonstrate
     depth of knowledge, or may discuss a larger number of risk/protective factors in order to
     demonstrate breadth of knowledge. Both approaches are equally acceptable.

9.   Evaluate one or more explanations of health problems.                                             [22]
     Refer to the paper 2 assessment criteria when awarding marks.
     The command term “evaluate” requires candidates to make an appraisal by weighing up
     strengths and limitations of one or more explanations of health problems. Although both
     strengths and limitations should be addressed, the discussion does not have to be evenly
     balanced to gain high marks.
     Candidates may evaluate one or more explanations of specific health problems (for example,
     stress, addiction, obesity, chronic pain, sexual health), or evaluate one or more explanations
     of health problems in general. Both approaches are equally acceptable.
     Explanations of health problems may include, but are not limited to:
     • brain's reward pathway explanation of addiction
     • genetic vulnerability to addiction
     • theory of planned behavior addressing the role of decision making in addiction
     • sociocultural explanations of obesity
     • General Adaptation Syndrome model as explanation of stress

     Relevant research may include, but is not limited to:
     • Newton and De La Graza (2009) study in theory of addiction
     • Hammer, Dingle, Ostergren and Partridge (2013) study challenging the biomedical model
       of addiction
     • Reed et al.’s (1999) study of pessimism within AIDS patients
     • Kamen and Seligman’s (1987) study of attributional style and health level
     • Stunkard et al.’s (1990) study of genetic factors in obesity.

     Evaluation may include, but is not limited to:
     • methodological and ethical considerations in research related to investigating the
       explanations
     • cultural factors and gender considerations in research related to investigating the
       explanations
     • supporting or contradictory empirical evidence
     • alternative explanations
     • accuracy and clarity of the concepts
     • the application of the empirical findings
     • the productivity of the explanation in generating psychological research.

     If the candidate addresses only strengths or only limitations, the response should be
     awarded up to a maximum of [3] marks for criterion D: critical thinking. All remaining criteria
     should be awarded marks according to the best fit approach.

11.   Evaluate one or more studies investigating origins of conflict and/or conflict resolution.           [22]

      Refer to the paper 2 assessment criteria when awarding marks.

      The command term “evaluate” requires candidates to make an appraisal of one or more studies
      investigating origins of conflict and/or conflict resolution by weighing up the strengths and
      limitations. The focus of the evaluation should be upon the study/studies and not on the origin of
      conflict and/or conflict resolution. Although a discussion of both strengths and limitations is
      required, it does not have to be evenly balanced to gain high marks.

      Topics investigating origins of conflict and/or conflict resolution may include, but are not limited to:
      • Realistic group conflict theory
      • Social identity theory
      • Group polarization
      • Intergroup contact theory
      • Social cognitive theory and Sabido method
      • Jigsaw classroom example of cooperative learning

      Relevant studies may include, but are not limited to:
      • Sherif et al.’s (1961) field experiment on competition and conflict resolution
        between groups
      • Chambers and De Dreu’s (2014) study on conflict and negotiation
      • Sternberg and Dobson’s (1987) study on resolution of interpersonal conflicts
      • Sternberg and Soriano’s (1984) study on styles of conflict resolution.

      Evaluation of the selected studies may include, but is not limited to:
      • methodological and ethical considerations
      • cultural and gender considerations
      • supporting and/or contradictory findings
      • the applications of the empirical findings
      • how the findings of research have been interpreted
      • implications of the findings.

      If the candidate addresses only strengths or only limitations, the response should be
      awarded up to a maximum of [3] for criterion D: critical thinking. All remaining criteria
      should be awarded marks according to the best fit approach.

      In questions that ask for evaluation of studies, marks awarded for criterion B should refer to
      definitions of terms and concepts. Overall this could include some knowledge of topic but
      more specifically knowledge and understanding related to research methods and ethics of
      chosen studies.

      Marks awarded for criterion C assess the quality of the description of as study/studies and
      assess how well the student linked the findings of the study to the question – this does not
      need to be very sophisticated or long for these questions but still the aim or the conclusion
      should be linked to the topic of the specific question.

      Criterion D assesses how well the student is explaining strengths and limitations of the
      study/studies.

      of the evaluation should be upon the study/studies and not on social responsibility. Although
      a discussion of both strengths and limitations is required, it does not have to be evenly
      balanced to gain high marks.
      The topic of social responsibility may include, but is not limited to:
      • prosocial behavior
      • atruistic behavior
      • bystanderism
      • strategies of promoting prosocial behaviour.

      Relevant studies may include, but are not limited to:
