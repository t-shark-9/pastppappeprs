                                        Section A

1.   (a)   Describe one disadvantage of using the reducing/declining balance method of
           depreciation.                                                                          [2]

           The main disadvantage of the reducing balance method is the choice of an
           accurate/realistic percentage with which to depreciate the assets.

           Secondly, the value of the asset with reducing balance is never fully written off by
           the business.

           Award [1] for stating an appropriate disadvantage and [1] for an appropriate
           description (application not required), up to a maximum of [2].

     (b)   (i)   Using the reducing/declining balance method of depreciation, calculate
                 PB Ltd’s annual depreciation of fixed assets for 2019 and 2020. Use 5 % as
                 the depreciation rate (show all your working).                                   [3]

                 depreciation for each year– max 2marks.Working is shown or clear. It is not
                 necessary to show net fixed assets.

                 Subtract [1] for any omission or for a mistake in the method or the actual
                 calculation or if the working (for one or both years) is not presented.

Allow OFR.

The presentation of the B/S can be done in one column.

Award [0] if the B/S does not reach a standard described below.

Award [1] if the B/S is not accurately constructed, and/or the calculations
within and between the various components are not presented or largely
incorrect. However, there is limited evidence of a general understanding
of the format. More than four mistakes/ omissions are evident.

Deduct 1 mark for each irrelevant addition of figures/irrelevant
heading/ omission which can includes the overall heading.

Award [5] if the B/S is accurately constructed in the expected IBO format.
All the relevant headings of each component/ parts are used and correctly
classified.

Do not penalise for internal order of classification. All and only the relevant
figures are presented. No extra irrelevant figures that belong to the P/L are
included. The calculations under each part/ component of the B/S are
correct and well presented.

To get full marks the candidate has to present the format in full as
presented in the IB programme. For example, the presentation, calculation
of working capital, the subtraction of LTL to arrive at Net Assets.

For full marks candidates must use the depreciation to arrive at net fixed
asset. Ignoring the net fixed assets/depreciation should be rated as 1
mistake as the account will not balance for another deduction.

N.B. If the candidate does not follow the IBO format award up to [2] marks.

Deduct 1 mark for each irrelevant addition of figures/irrelevant
heading/ omission.

N.B The values in table 1 assume that Phoebe has included the
depreciation in the P/L which leads to the calculation of given retained
profit. If a student does not make this assumption but tries to recalculate
retained profit do NOT penalize but apply OFR to the extent possible. The
BS will not balance (minus 1 mark) Mark all other calculations and
headings as normal.

If candidates start the B/S with Fixed assets of 19000 (because they have
already deducted the depreciation for 2019) and then proceed to deduct
just 2020 depreciation then allow this.

Accept Capital Employed as an alternative definition of Total Assets minus
Current Liabilities heading.

2.   (a)   State two methods of primary market research.                                         [2]

           Methods of primary market research include:
            Focus groups
            Observations
            Interviews
            Surveys/questionnaires

           Accept any other correct form of market research. Award [1] for each method
           identified up to a maximum of [2].

     (b)   Using the selected financial data in Table 2, calculate for SP for 2020:

           (i)     the break-even level of output (show all your working);                       [2]

                   $9.00 minus $4.00 = $5.00 = contribution

                   $60 000 [fixed costs]
                                          12 000 units
                          $5.00

                   12 000 units is the break-even level of output. Do NOT penalize if missing
                   word, units.

                   Award [1] for correct method and [1] for correct answer, for a maximum
                   award of [2].
                   If a candidate uses a correct alternate method, accept. If a candidate only
                   lists the answer but shows no workings, award [1].
                   If candidate calculates contribution but gives wrong break-even level of
                   output award [1].

           (ii)    the margin of safety - MoS (show all your working – however labelling of
                   figures is not required);                                                     [2]

                   15000 [total sales in units] – 12000 [break-even level of output] = 3 000
                   units or pairs of socks.
                   3000 units or pairs of socks is the margin of safety.

                   Award [1] for correct method and [1] for correct answer, for a maximum
                   award of [2]. Apply OFR if candidate uses incorrect answer from b(i).
                   N.B. deduct one mark in b(i) and b(ii) for use of inappropriate units e.g $

           (iii)   net profit for 2020 (show all your working).                                  [2]

                   Actual profit (year 2020)
                   $9.00  15 000 = $135 000 in sales revenue
                   $50 000  $10 000 = $60 000 in fixed costs (FC)
                   $4.00  15 000 = $60 000 in variable costs (VC)
                   Net profit = $135 000 – $60 000 – $60 000 = $15 000

                   Alternative methods
                   Net profit = total contribution minus FC (15 000  $5) – $60 000 = $15 000.
                   or
                   Net profit = MoS X contribution per unit = (18000 - 15000) X ($9 -$4) =
                   3000 X $5 = $15000
                                             –8–                  N21/3/BUSMT/HP2/ENG/TZ0/XX/M


           Award [1] for correct method and [1] for correct answer, for a maximum
           award of [2].
           N.B. A break-even chart is not required to be drawn and will gain no marks
           if presented without the above calculations.



(c)   Explain how the impact of the increase in rent and the forecast increase in sales
      in 2021 could affect SP’s profitability.                                                [2]

          SP’s profitability will probably increase. The increase in rent will add $14 000
          to fixed costs. However, if the forecast sales are accurate and prices and
          costs do not change, then Pam can expect an additional 3000 x $5 in sales
          revenue ($15 000).
          N.B. the actual increase in profit is not required.

          Award [1] if the candidates has shown some understanding that profitability
          is likely to increase Award an additional mark if in their explanation, they
          demonstrate some application by using figures from the case study.

          N.B. Award [1] if the candidate explains increasing profitability without
          referring to both rent and sales forecast increases.

          N.B. If candidates interpret “profitability” to mean ratios then do not penalize.
          The explanation would be that profitability decreases from 11.1% to 9.88%.
          For full marks some reference to the figures is necessary.
                                                   –9–                  N21/3/BUSMT/HP2/ENG/TZ0/XX/M



                                         Section B
3.   (a)   Define the term public sector.                                                            [2]

           A public sector is a sector where organisations are owned and controlled by the
           government on behalf of its citizens to provide essential and affordable goods or
           services for its citizens that otherwise might not have been produced/provided.
           The government controls many aspects of the product or service such as the
           price.

           Award [1] for a basic definition that conveys partial knowledge and understanding
           similar to the above answer. The first mark would typically come from awareness
           that there is government ownership.
           N.B. Do not accept references to run, managed, operated, controlled unless
           accompanied by some reference to ownership.

           Award [2] for a full, clear definition that conveys knowledge and understanding
           similar to the answer above.

           Do not credit an example.

     (b)   Explain one benefit and one limitation for GP resulting from the implementation
           of the shamrock organization structure for HN.                                            [4]

           Candidates can explain the Shamrock structure and may refer to the three types
           of functions within the structure.

           Benefits:
           If GP management restructure HN using the shamrock organization structure, the
           new structure will accommodate some of their specified plans/enable GP
           management to achieve its objectives increasing efficiency, flexibility and
           productivity.

           The scientists are the core employees with full benefits, job security, training and
           a clear career path. The manufacturing department is to be outsourced.

           Periphery employees- extra employees to be employed when needed and
           possibly also include support staff are the flexible internal part of the organisation.

           The scientists will become the core employees within the R&D department as the
           core function. The management values the R&D department and regard it as
           core activity as they have many manufacturing facilities around the world.
           Keeping the scientists as core employees, providing them with appraisal and
           training to improve performance etc, will enable GP to cut costs by reducing the
           number of employees, improving productivity (which will also cut costs)

           At the same time, GP is planning to outsource the production parts. This will
           clearly reduce costs significantly.

           One assumes that some peripheral workers will still be employed to support the
           scientists. Those employees, possibly including highly qualified scientists might
           come to support the core workers when needed. Costs can be reduced due to
           the temporary nature of the contract and payments will be made when needed.

           Accept any other relevant benefit explained.

      Limitations:
      The impact on the core employees/ scientists may be negative. Getting support
      staff on a short- term basis and when needed can put extra pressure on the core
      employees especially if they are expected to innovate and the core employees
      are subject to appraisal for rewards.

      Peripheral/non-core employees, some of whom may be highly qualified could
      suffer from a lack of job security. The impact on their motivation/ the quality of
      support to the scientists in the R&D department could be negatively affected.

      Possible cultural clashes between HN employees and employees from the
      outsourced manufacturer. There could be miscommunication issues, quality
      issues affecting the production of medicines resulting in a negative impact on HN
      and GP’s image too.

      N.B. do not credit answers which merely describe “Shamrock” without mention of
      benefits and limitations.

      Accept any other relevant limitation explained.

      Accept any other relevant benefit / limitation.

      Award [1] for each benefit / limitation identified and an additional [1] for
      development with application to GM. Award a maximum of [2] per benefit /
      limitation.

      [2] cannot be awarded per role if the response lacks either explanation and / or
      application.

      For example:
      For an identification or an explanation of and benefit / limitation with or without
      application [1].

      For explanation of relevant benefit / limitation with no application [1].

      For explanation of a relevant benefit / limitation and application [2].

(c)   Explain one advantage and one disadvantage for GP resulting from the
      introduction of cognitive training for HN’s scientists.                              [4]

      Cognitive training for the scientists will enable the development of mental skills/to
      develop, enhance the brain ability to learn and think for the scientists to improve
      on their current performance. Senior management made all of the decisions and
      set targets, scientists never developed decision-making skills, which slowed
      down the development of new medicines. GP management clearly want to
      enable the scientists in the R&D department to improve on current deficiencies
      and become more competitive by speeding up the development of new medicine
      and feel confident to make their own decisions.

      However, developing cognitive skills can be very expensive when undertaken by
      an external provider. GP wants to cut costs. The cognitive training will take time
      to deliver the benefits and cost savings which GP is hoping to experience.

      Accept any other relevant advantage / disadvantage.

      Award [1] for each advantage / disadvantage identified and an additional [1] for
      development with application to GP. Award a maximum of [2] per
      advantage/disadvantage. [2] cannot be awarded per advantage / disadvantage if
      the response lacks either explanation and / or application.

      For example:
      For an identification or a description of an advantage/ disadvantage with or
      without application [1].

      For explanation of relevant advantage/ disadvantage with no application [1].

      For explanation of a relevant advantage/ disadvantage and application [2].

(d)   Discuss two human resource strategies that GP could use to reduce the
      scientists’ resistance to the changes.                                                [10]

      In terms of application and evaluation, while the reasons for fear and resistance
      to change are clear given the stimuli, it is expected that candidates show
      awareness/ understanding that the current employees of HN especially the
      scientists have been unproductive. They were protected by the government for a
      while and were largely inefficient. Now a profit maximising organisation is in
      control and there will be inevitable changes and tension. So while the resistance
      can somewhat be understood, evaluation should be centered around the points
      above- power and necessity of change. The fact that a government owned
      organisation is to be sold to a profit maximising organisation is the key issue for
      candidates to incorporate in their evaluation.

      The question refers to the scientists. Hence a full discussion of the management
      of the employees in the manufacturing department is not relevant.

      Candidates should show awareness that GP wants to keep the scientists and has
      got no interest in making the scientists redundant. They are to become core
      employees. Hence GP’s bargaining power is strong but not without limit so some
      discussion and compromise might have to be reached.

      Possible HR strategies:
       Education and communication
       Participation and involvement
       Facilitation and support
       Negotiation and agreement
       Manipulation and co-option
       Explicit and implicit coercion
       Application of motivation techniques
       Change of organization structure and leadership styles

      The candidates do not have to use the exact terminology above and can evaluate
      any general HR strategies.

      One may argue that GP’s management can implement the proposed changes
      radically and quickly given their profit maximising objective and the losses/long
      term contract etc. The scientists and the remaining employees will have to accept
      the changes but can still express fear. GP has the bargaining power to use more
      extreme methods such as threats to facilitate its changes.

      Negotiation and agreement - GP’s management is to discuss the proposed
      change- communicate clearly, explain the reason, invite discussion and possibly
                                      – 12 –              N21/3/BUSMT/HP2/ENG/TZ0/XX/M


some negotiation, ask for feedback, emphasize the positive outcome in the
longer term but not hide the negative immediate outcome of massive
redundancies. To reduce fear and resistance, the scientists should be made
aware that they are unlikely to lose their jobs. Perhaps GP should be willing to
amend some of the changes but again, GP has the bargaining power.
Training is already offered for the core employees to enhance performance and
to reduce fear of the unknown and any lack of competencies.

GP’s management may appoint a change champion among the scientists. This
strategy could possibly be seen as manipulation.

N.B. do not reward generic suggestions (max 3 marks) that do not link to the
stimulus material.

4.   (a)   Define the term cost-plus (mark-up) pricing strategy.                                 [2]

           Cost plus pricing is a pricing method where the total cost of producing is
           calculated which includes variable costs (direct costs) and a fixed cost
           component (or part of the overhead). Then a profit margin per unit is added to
           obtain the selling price.

           Award 1 mark for a partial definition where the candidate has mentioned costs
           and a small profit margin being added to achieve the selling price

           Award 2 marks for a full clearer definition which includes reference to both
           variable and fixed costs being calculated with a profit margin being added to
           achieve the selling price.

     (b)   Explain two benefits for SF of using social media marketing.                          [4]

           Social media marketing allows accurate targeting through social media. Below
           the line could allow targeting to families who have a strong interest in purchasing
           Diabetic meals though Facebook or Reddit groups

           Cheap and quick to set up and very wide reach. Evidence that SF has grown fast
           indicating that below the line promotion has exceeded expectations

           The speed of response of social media may be instant. Charles' quick response
           on social media managed to reduce the impact of the negative publicity after the
           quality issue.

           Below the line promotion allows SF to create customer loyalty programmes which
           can be managed online and have continued direct links to current and potential
           customers looking for diabetic meals.

           Award [1] for a benefit of social media marketing with an additional [1] for
           application to SF.

           Mark as [2+2]

     (c)   Explain one benefit and one cost to SF of using a flow production method.             [4]

           The benefits of a flow production method to SF could include:
                It is likely to lead to SF meeting the growing demand for its meals quickly
                  and in the process reducing the unit costs of production.
                This may allow SF to reduce the price of its meals as they use cost plus
                  pricing.
                The benefits of flow production imply that SF will be true to its mission
                  statement.
                Enables SF to control quality more effectively and avoid the mis-labelling
                  issues.

           The costs allude to an increase in complexity of the business and the stimulus
           indicates that some problems are emerging. Hence some costs could include:
                Charles’ management style will also come under increased pressure as
                   he does not have experience of transitioning to and using this new
                   technology.
                Communication and coordination issues may arise leading to higher unit
                   costs effectively a diseconomy of scale.

            Investment in flow production involves high capital costs resulting in
             possible borrowing and higher gearing.
            Pausing production e.g. for changing recipes, can be expensive.
            If flow production creates too many additional meals even with growing
             demand, SF could be left with meals it cannot sell.


      Award [1] for a benefit of flow production with an additional [1] for application to
      SF.

      Mark as [2+2]

(d)   Discuss whether Charles should accept GF’s offer of a takeover.                        [10]

      SF is clearly a successful business although struggling to maintain control. The
      offer of a takeover comes at a critical time.

      There are a number of arguments against the takeover:
          The move to flow production has reduced costs and prices and this factor
             may lead to even higher sales and by assumption profits.
          Although Charles has limited experience of using flow production the
             future growth of SF could be considerable.
          The company will thrive, and they possibly do not wish to accept the offer.
             By not accepting the offer Charles will eliminate the possibility of a rival
             company as the remaining shareholders will not create one.
          This will cause great resentment among the shareholders and given that
             SF has already survived one episode of poor publicity through the quality
             control issue, Charles can ill afford any more. There is evidence from the
             stimulus that this negative publicity could grow considerably.
          The creation of a direct competitor run by the remaining shareholders
             under albeit a new brand could confuse their loyal customers.

      However, there are a number of arguments for takeover:
         The distribution channels offered by the supermarket will boost SF’s
           profile further and allow them to work with a business with greater levels
           of experience in the same area.
         The takeover will also allow SF to develop its mission and expand the
           range of meals offered given that there is finance for research and
           development into new nutritional meals.
         Finally, after the success of diabetic meals how long will it be before other
           large supermarket chains come up with their own branded diabetic meals.
           SF could be outmaneuvered and undercut by future competition. SF’s
           market value would appear to be high but will this be the case in 2–3
           years?

      The decision is difficult. The other shareholders do not want this move and can ill
      afford the additional negative publicity. A conflict carried out on social media
      could become damaging to the brand which relies on positive social media word
      of mouth. The offer is tempting but SF is in fair financial shape despite the higher
      gearing ratio. Charles has limited experience and perhaps needs more time. It
      might be sensible for Charles to wait and discuss further with the other
      shareholders since a majority agreement is required to sell.

      Marks to be awarded using the generic mark bands and the following is to be
      noted

            attract new customers

            improve brand loyalty

           Award [1] for each objective identified up to a maximum award of [2].

     (b)   With reference to OS, explain one advantage and one disadvantage of operating
           as a private limited company.                                                            [4]

           Advantages of operating as a private limited company include:

                     Compared to sole traders and partnerships, private limited companies
                      typically can raise more capital.
                     Control of the company cannot be lost to outsiders.
                     Members of the board of directors, many/most of whom are major
                      shareholders in the company, can make decisions with fewer concerns
                      about shareholder and/or market reaction.
                     Owners have limited liability.
                     Private limited companies do not have to disclose fully their financial
                      information.
                     The business continues if one of the owners dies.

           For OS, one advantage to operating as a private limited company is that OS
           could make changes in dividend policy without affecting perceptions of the
           company in the marketplace. When OS realized that it needed to preserve cash,
           it suspended dividend payments for one year and said it possibly would for a
           second year. When a publicly traded company lowers or eliminates dividend
           payments to preserve cash, the share price typically falls, sometimes
           significantly, which can make capital sufficiency issues even worse.

           Disadvantages of operating as a privately limited company include:

                      If a shareholder wants to sell their shares, finding a suitable buyer
                       may take time. Also, other shareholders must agree to the sale and
                       some are opposed.
                      Private limited companies cannot sell shares to the public, thus
                       limiting the amount of capital than be raised. OS may need to raise
                       capital to invest in new marketing strategies.
                      Often (though not always) private limited companies are relatively
                       small organizations which possesses lesser expertise than large,
                       publicly traded companies Nevertheless OS is currently facing a
                       difficult moment, as its industry is changing, a situation that has led to
                       a decline in sales and a contraction of margins. As a private limited

                  company, OS may not have the expertise to face this situation even
                  though OS has been operating for 40 years so presumably has a lot
                  of experience of the industry. Currently, the company has no real
                  marketing strategy and may not have the marketing expertise to
                  make appropriate adjustments most specifically in areas like e-
                  commerce or possible diversification.

      Additionally, many potential adjustments OS may make will require capital, which,
      as a private limited company, OS has less access to than if it were public.

      Maximum award: [4].

(c)   With reference to OS, explain the difference between capital expenditure and
      revenue expenditure.                                                                  [4]

      Capital expenditure refers to any expenditure for assets with a life of more than
      one year. The stimulus refers to three instances of capital expenditure in the
      company’s history: each time OS purchased a building location.

      Revenue expenditure refers to those expenses that will be accounted for fully in
      the year in which the expense occurs. In the case of OS, revenue expenditures
      mention in the case are expenditures for inventory.

      Mark as [2 + 2].

      Award [1] for an explanation of capital expenditure and an additional [1] for an
      explanation with application to the stimulus.

      Award [1] for an explanation of revenue expenditure and an additional [1] for an
      explanation with application to the stimulus.

(d)   Discuss possible changes to any two elements of OS’s marketing mix.                  [10]

      Ways that OS could modify its marketing mix to match and compete with the new
      competitors.
       Product: Changing its product range (either contracting or expanding its
        product range).
       Price: Adopting a different pricing strategy.
       Place: Modifying its distribution strategy to include e-commerce.
       Promotion: Initiate a more aggressive promotion strategy.

      For each of the four Ps, OS could make modifications. Modifying each has
      advantages and disadvantages. For example, contracting its product range could
      give the organization more focus and require lesser investment in stock. On the
      other hand, assuming that OS process its products properly, each inventory item
      makes some contribution to fixed costs. Further, any termination of a product line
      means that customers for that product, however few, will have to go to a
      competitor for that product.

OS could modify its prices, particularly try being more aggressive with its pricing.
Whereas that may attract more customers (advantage), margins will be thinner.

An ecommerce shift with a door-to-door aspect will change OS’ supply chain
considerably. Time and resources will need to be devoted to this task

There is a sense that OS is a traditional business and new aggressive forms of
pricing and promotion will be required. Will they know how to do the latter? Do
they need to introduce a social media campaign backed up with a membership or
loyalty programme?

Given that OS is a retailer, candidates may choose to use the extended
marketing mix:
People -whilst little is known of the employees many of the owners are likely to
be of the older generation. Having retail staff conversant with trends in the market
such as social media and new workplace technology such as automated stock
control systems would be an important aspect of a new marketing strategy.

Process – it is known that new competitors are already using e-commerce
techniques, potentially giving them a cost and hence competitive advantage.
However, investment in such platforms and training staff accordingly may be
expensive in the short term.

Physical Evidence
Some stores are potentially 40 years old and hence may be showing their age.
Investing in upgrading stores in the way they look and feel to customers could
pay dividends e.g. IKEA. However, this could also be expensive and may not be
wise if it is perceived that the market is moving away from the physical store
concept.
Candidates are expected to provide a conclusion with a substantiated judgment.

Grade according to the mark bands found on page 3.

For one relevant modification to the marketing mix that is one-sided, award a
maximum of [3].

For two relevant modifications, but the discussion of both is one-sided, award a
maximum of [4].

For two relevant modifications, one treated in a balanced way and another in an
unbalanced way, award a maximum of [5].

For two relevant modifications, both treated in balanced ways, but no real
conclusion, award a maximum of [6]. Conclusions must be more than nominal
(for example, when a candidate opens a final paragraph with “In conclusion . . . “
but then has no real conclusion), award a maximum of [6].
