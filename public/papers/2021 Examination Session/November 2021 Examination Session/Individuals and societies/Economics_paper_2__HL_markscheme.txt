           (ii)   Define the term current account surplus indicated in bold in the text
                  (paragraph 7).                                                                  [2]

(b)   Using an exchange rate diagram, explain how a decrease in the interest rate
      might influence the value of the Thai baht (paragraph 6).                               [4]

       Level                                                                          Marks

                right, with a decrease in value/price of Thai baht.
                OR
                For an explanation that a reduction in the interest rate will cause
                Thai citizens to move financial/portfolio investments abroad
                This will lead to an increase in supply of the baht, resulting in a
                depreciation/decrease in its value/price.
       2        There is a correct diagram AND an accurate written response.          3–4

                For an explanation that a reduction in the interest rate will cause
                Thai citizens to move financial/portfolio investments abroad
                This will lead to an increase in supply of the baht, resulting in a
                depreciation/decrease in its value/price.

      NB Candidates may show a decrease in demand for the Thai baht resulting
      from the decreased attractiveness of /financial/ portfolio investments
      This will lead to a decrease in demand and result in a depreciation/decrease in
      the value/price. This approach should be fully rewarded.

      Candidates who incorrectly label diagrams can be awarded a maximum of [3].
      For an exchange rate diagram, the vertical axis may be exchange rate, price of
      (Thai) baht in other currency, (Thai) baht in other currency, or other currency per
      THB, or OTHER CURRENCY/THB. The horizontal axis may be quantity, Q, or
      quantity of (Thai) baht.

(c)   Using a production possibilities curve (PPC) diagram, explain how the importing
      of “new technology and capital equipment” might affect Thailand’s production
      possibilities (paragraph 3).                                                            [4]

               outward shift of the PPC
               OR
               For explaining that technology/capital equipment increases the
               quantity and/or quality/efficiency/productivity of resources/factors
               which will lead to outward shift the curve, therefore increasing
               potential output / production possibilities.
       2       There is a correct diagram AND an accurate written response.           3–4

               potential output / production possibilities.

      Candidates who incorrectly label diagrams can be awarded a maximum of [3].

      For a PPC diagram, there must be two goods or groups of goods competing for
      the same resources on the axes. Good X and Good Y are appropriate, but simply
      X and Y are not sufficient.

      Command term
      “Evaluate” requires candidates to make an appraisal by weighing up the
      strengths and limitations. Opinions and conclusions should be presented clearly
      and supported with appropriate evidence and sound argument.

      Answers may include:
      • Definition of appreciation.

      Economic analysis may include:
      • AD/AS
      • Marshall Lerner
      • J-curve
      • Elasticities
      • PPC
      • Terms of Trade.

      Implications of strong Thai baht on inflation rate may include:
      • Imported factors of production cheaper, which results in an increase in SRAS
        and less inflationary pressure (paragraph 3).
      • Makes exports less competitive and may result in a decrease in AD
        (paragraph 4), which results in less inflationary pressure (could be a problem
        as inflation rate is under target (paragraph 2)).
      • The inflation rate is at 0.3% (Table 1), which is lower than target rate any
        increases in AS or decreases in AD may make it more difficult for the central
        bank to reach its inflation target (paragraph 2).
      • Increase in SRAS and decrease AD may lead to deflation concerns, as
        inflation is very low at 0.3% (Table 1).

Implications of strong Thai baht on economic growth may include:
• Export-orientated country, exports become more expensive (paragraph 4). AD
  decreases. may restrict/hinder economic growth, which is down to 3% from
  4.1% (paragraph 4).
• Long-term impact of lower domestic investment if government reduces
  controls on capital outflow to curb the appreciation, may decrease investment
  leading to a decrease in AD and real GDP (paragraph 5).
• Producers can afford new technology and capital equipment, improves
  productivity, quality and quantity of resources, leads to positive impact on
  SRAS/LRAS/PPC/RGPD/Economic growth (paragraph 3).
• Foreign debt is easier to pay off, businesses may have less costs leading to
  SRAS increases leading to increased output (paragraph 3).

Implications of strong Thai baht on employment may include:
• Increased unemployment due to lower exports, particularly in tourism which
  makes up 16% of employment (paragraph 4), but lower unemployment rates
  of 1% (Table 1) give less significance to this argument (paragraph 2).

Implications of strong Thai baht on balance of payments may include:
• Current account surplus (Table 1) may decrease as exports, become more
  expensive for foreigners and imports cheaper for Thai citizens (paragraph 4).
• The effect on net exports depends on the price elasticity of demand for both
  export and imports.
• Appreciation may help with trade relationship with the US. Thailand wants to
  avoid being labelled a currency manipulator and its current account surplus is
  close to the US threshold and the appreciation may help reduce this surplus
  (paragraph 7).
• Improve terms of trade (paragraph 3).
• Helps with foreign debt repayment (paragraph 3).
• Marshall-Lerner and J-curve discussion.

Any reasonable evaluation.

To reach level 3, students must make reference to the extract/context, not just
present a discussion on the implications in general.

      Answers may include:
      • definition of free trade agreement.

      • economies of scale diagram
      • PPC
      • market failure
      • trade creation / trade diversion.

Positive economic effects may include:
• Larger market, increased output, leads to economies of scale (paragraph 3).
• More exports increases aggregate demand which increases real GDP, which
  may help the unemployment rate of 12 % (paragraph 2).
• Increased FDI, increases AD, increases real GDP (paragraph 1).
• The EU wants to help Indonesia and has offered grants (17 million) help improve
  trade conditions and capacity, this could lead to improved quality and quantity of
  resources (paragraph 8).
• Relationship could help with development of legal and sustainable palm oil
  production, decreasing market failure (paragraph 8), allow for long term growth
  and development.
• To be competitive, as other main competitors already have an agreement
  (paragraph 3). Indonesia may risk losing export customers if they do not establish
  an FTA.
• Comparative advantage gains (paragraph 2), better allocation of resources.
• Buffers problems with trade war between US and China (paragraph 3).
• Already the two countries appear to be engaging in the trade war. An agreement
  might help with relations.
• To avoid trade protection (paragraph 1).
• Trade creation.
• Lower prices, more variety for Indonesian consumers.
• Allows Indonesia to get foreign exchange.
• Access better/cheaper technology.

Negative economic effects may include:
• The trade might be restricted by the EU’s stance on biofuel from palm oil
  (paragraph 5). This may restrict benefits from the trade agreement as it is a large
  part of Indonesia’s economy.
• The areas of predicted growth from the agreement are industries that face low
  wages and poor working conditions, this may be further exploited (paragraph 2).
• FDI associated problems (paragraph 1).
• Could be a problematic negotiation (time consuming and costly), considering the
  trade war that appears to be occurring with the countries (paragraph 5 and 6).
• Trade diversion.
• Infant industry argument.

Any reasonable discussion.

      Answers may include:
      • Definition of economic development, foreign aid.

      Economic analysis, focusing on economic development, may include:
      • AD/AS.
      • Poverty cycle.
      • PPC.
      • Lorenz curve.

      Effectiveness of foreign aid in achieving economic development may include:
      • Aid could be essential to help with transition to a higher developing country
         status (paragraph 3).
      • Aid spending on Education:
         • Higher skilled labour leads to high incomes – breaking poverty
            cycle/helping with the poverty gap (paragraph 2).
         • Higher level of skill may allow people to move from the informal sector to
            formal sector with better working conditions (paragraph 2).
         • Could help increase participation of women in the workplace (paragraph 4).
         • Aid spending on health care:
         • Workforce more productive – higher incomes – break poverty cycle
            (paragraph 5).
      • Aid spending on Infrastructure:
         • Access to export markets – increases real GDP, increased output –
            increase employment opportunities – increasing incomes and lowering
            poverty (paragraph 6).

  • Isolated island nation, more shipping ports/airports may lower costs
    (paragraph 1).
  • Shipping ports/airports – larger markets – access economies of scale
    (paragraph 5).
  • PPC or AD/AS – increases quality and quantity of resources (paragraph 5).
  • Infrastructure spending could include improving access to water and
    electricity (paragraph 2 and 4).
  • Infrastructure may help decrease the poverty gap/decrease pressure on
    cities (paragraph 2).
  • Allow for export industry grow and government may be able to remove
    subsidies and spend on other areas for economic development (paragraph
    6).
  • Aid spending may help with decreasing the natural disaster vulnerability
    (paragraph 1).

Lack of effectiveness of foreign aid in achieving economic development may include:
• Lacks the capacity to deliver the quality education and healthcare needed
  (paragraph 5).
• Institutions are lacking to support redistribution of benefits from potential export
  growth (paragraph 5).
• Infrastructure spending mentioned is targeted on export growth (paragraph 6)
  and may not be in areas that directly improve standards of living such as access
  to electricity and water (paragraph 3).
• Problems with misuse of funds (paragraph 6).
• Over-reliance on aid is seen as a potential issue (paragraph 7).
• Intentions of donors, China is focusing on infrastructure – but this may not benefit
  the very poor (paragraph 4).
• Concession loans may cause repayment issues in the future (paragraph 4).
• The new UN developing country status may allow Vanuatu to access funds from
  other areas and therefore aid might not be needed (paragraph 3).
• Vanuatu’s most vulnerable status and climate change does not appear to be part
  of the aid strategy and this could be more important than the targeted sectors
  (paragraph 1).

Any reasonable discussion.

      For a business cycle diagram, the vertical axis should be (Real) GDP, (Real)
      GDP growth/%, level of economic activity, (Real) output. The horizontal axis
      should be time and show dates from 2010–19. A title is not necessary.

      If a student labels growth and shows a recession as positive the student can not
      be awarded full marks.

      Command term
      “Evaluate” requires candidates to make an appraisal by weighing up the
      strengths and limitations. Opinions and conclusions should be presented clearly
      and supported with appropriate evidence and sound argument.

      Answers may include:
      • Definitions of:
        • Economic development.
        • Market-orientated policies.

      Economic analysis, focusing on economic development, may include:
      • AD/AS analysis.
      • Poverty cycle.
      • Lorenz curve.
      • Externalities.

       Positive outcomes on economic development may include:
      • Labour reforms (raising retirement age), may increase the size of the labour force, which
         may increase LRAS as quantity of labour has increased. This may increase LRAS,
         leading to increased real GDP/potential output, which may increase job opportunities and
         increase income, for low income earners and encourage economic development
         (paragraph 6).
       • Lowering business costs through labour reforms, making the hiring and firing of
         employees easier, may increase AS, leading to increased real GDP and a
         possibility of more employment opportunities for low income earners.
       • Privatization may decrease public debt and government can redirect spending
         into economic development (paragraph 5).
       • More multinationals/foreign investment – may lead to more jobs (paragraph 4).
       • Trade liberalization may lead to lower prices for consumers, more choice
         (paragraph 5).

• May promote diversification and move away from commodities (paragraph 1).
• Encouraging more competition from MNCs may promote more efficiency
  (paragraph 5).

Negative outcomes on economic development may include:
• Spending on education in the past has been ineffective (paragraph 3).
• Labour reforms decreasing standard of living through lower job security
  (paragraph 4).
• Privatization may increase prices of goods and services / cause unemployment
  as private firms aim for efficiency and profit maximization (paragraph 5).
• Multinationals repatriate profits and may not employ local people (paragraph 5).
• Some industries may suffer from increased competition due to trade liberalization
  (paragraph 3).
• Concern of environment destruction and externalities (paragraph 7).
• Increasing the retirement age may decrease standards of living (paragraph 6).
• Inequalities may occur through market-orientated policies.
• Dual economy can develop as a result of market-orientated policies.

Any reasonable evaluation.
