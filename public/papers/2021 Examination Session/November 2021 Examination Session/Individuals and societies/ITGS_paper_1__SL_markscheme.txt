Critical Thinking – explanation, analysis and evaluation

These trigger words often signal critical thinking. The bold words are the key terms in the various
criteria.
Explanation – Because, as a result of, due to, therefore, consequently, for example
Analysis – Furthermore, additionally, however, but, conversely, likewise, in addition, on the other hand,
whereas
Evaluation ‫ –ؘ‬My opinion, overall, although, despite, on balance, weighing up

Examiners should be aware that in some cases, candidates may take a different approach, which if
appropriate should be rewarded. If in doubt, check with your team leader.

In the case of an “identify” question read all answers and mark positively up to the maximum marks.
Disregard incorrect answers. In all other cases where a question asks for a certain number of facts
eg “describe two kinds”, mark the first two correct answers. This could include two descriptions,
one description and one identification, or two identifications.

It should be recognized that, given time constraints, answers for part (c) questions are likely to
include a much narrower range of issues and concepts than identified in the markband. There is
no “correct” answer. Examiners must be prepared to award full marks to answers which
synthesize and evaluate even if they do not examine all the stimulus material.

1.   Accessing online media

     (a)   (i)     Identify two hardware devices that Rajesh could use to view his internet
                   protocol television (IPTV) channels.                                           [2]

                   Answers may include:
                   ● Smart TV.
                   ● Mobile phone/cellphone.
                   ● Tablets.
                   ● PC/laptop.
                   ● IPTV box (such as an Amazon Fire stick, Apple TV, etc).

                   Award [1] for identifying each hardware device Rajesh could use to view
                   his IPTV channels, up to a maximum of [2].

                   Do not accept monitor or television.

           (ii)    Identify two characteristics of an IP address.                                 [2]

                   Answers may include:
                   ● An address assigned to a computer/device (it must be implicit or explicit
                     in the answer that the device is connected to a network/the Internet).
                   ● Identifies a device.
                   ● It can be used to identify a physical location.
                   ● It is either 32 bits or 128 bits (IP v4 or IP v6).
                   ● It can be static or dynamic, may be changed.

                   Award [1] for each characteristic of an IP address identified, up to a
                   maximum of [2].

           (iii)   Rajesh is downloading a film for offline viewing. The download speed is
                   80 mbps.

                   Calculate the amount of data, in megabytes (MB), that will be downloaded
                   in 10 minutes.                                                                 [2]

                   Answers may include:
                   ● Convert 80 mbps to MB/s = 80/8 = 10 MB/s
                   ● Calculation of 10 MB x 60 (sec) x 10 (min) = 6000 MB

                   Award [1] for conversion from megabit to megabyte.
                   Award [2] for correct answer (if the conversion/calculation process is not
                   shown, award it only if with correct unit).
                                               –5–                  N21/3/ITGSX/SP1/ENG/TZ0/XX/M


(b)    (i)    Explain why Rajesh downloaded the films rather than streaming them when
              he was travelling.                                                             [4]

              Answers may include:
              ● Films can be played offline / no internet connection is needed to play
                downloaded films / device connects to the source file and downloads to
                the hard drive.
              ● The downloaded files can be transferred to other devices.
              ● The film quality is intact.
              ● The downloaded files can be viewed in countries with restricted internet
                access.
              ● Streaming depends on the internet bandwidth, which may fluctuate.
              ● There may be film pauses due to buffering, especially with slow internet
                connections when streaming.

      Marks     Level descriptor
      [0]       No knowledge or understanding of ITGS issues and concepts. No use of
                appropriate ITGS terminology.
      [1–2]     A limited response that indicates very little understanding of the
                reasons why downloading a video would be preferable to
                streaming it. Uses little or no appropriate ITGS terminology.
      [3–4]     An explanation of the reasons why downloading a video would be
                preferable to streaming it. There is the appropriate use ITGS terminology.

       (ii)   Rajesh has been told that subscribing to an internet protocol television
              (IPTV) service may compromise his anonymity.

              Distinguish between anonymity and privacy.                                     [2]

              Answers may include:
              ● Anonymity is knowing what activities are being carried out but not
                knowing who is carrying them out.
              ● Privacy is knowing who the person carrying out the activities may be but
                not knowing what these activities are.

              Award [1] for each appropriate statement that distinguishes anonymity from
              privacy, up to a maximum of [2].
                                              –6–                  N21/3/ITGSX/SP1/ENG/TZ0/XX/M


(c)   To what extent is it acceptable for Rajesh to use services like a virtual private
      network (VPN) to access content that may be blocked in the country he is
      visiting?                                                                             [8]

      Answers may include:

      Reasons why Rajesh could use services like a VPN:
      ● The service is legitimate and cannot be accessed by any other means.
      ● Rajesh may believe that the blocking of the service is unlawful / inappropriate /
        the degree of censorship is draconian.
      ● There may be technical advantages of using a service like a VPN.
      ● Through a VPN, Rajesh can browse the web in complete anonymity.
      ● Rajesh may find media access through a VPN more economical compared
        with subscribing to the same services in a different country.

      Reasons why Rajesh should not use services like a VPN:
      ● Rajesh should abide by the laws of the country and by circumventing the laws
        may place himself at risk.
      ● The content may be deemed to be inappropriate in the host country and has
        been blocked for religious / security / political reasons.
      ● The use of a VPN may reduce the speed of downloading or streaming.
      ● Rajesh may not be able to download or stream films despite having a
        subscription to a VPN because a few broadcasting apps use anti-VPN
        technology to restrict content outside a specific region.

      In part (c) of this question it is expected there will be a balance in the ITGS
      terminology between IT technical terminology and the terminology related to
      social and ethical impacts.

2.   Singapore shipping

     (a)   (i)     Identify two reasons why a spreadsheet would be used to store the
                   information in Figure 2.                                                      [2]

                   Answers may include:
                   ● A spreadsheet may require minimal training / is easier to setup.
                   ● Inbuilt functions and formulae can be applied on data, it can perform
                     calculations.
                   ● Data can be arranged in a specific order, eg in ascending order of
                     Shipment_Date.
                   ● Graphs/charts can be created to summarize large amounts of data.
                   ● Users may use dropdown menus for an item from the list, eg Destination
                     column.
                   ● To organize data in a clear manner.

                   Award [1] for identifying each reason why a spreadsheet has been used to
                   store this information, up to a maximum of [2].

           (ii)    State the formula to calculate the total number of containers used in
                   Column C.                                                                     [1]

                   Answers may include:
                   ● =SUM(C2:C15)
                   ● =SUMA(C2:C15)
                   ● =ADD(C2:C15)
                   ● =C2 + C3 + C4 + ……+C15

                   Award [1] for any one of the above.

                   N.B. Do not accept responses without =.

                   Accept the range starting from B1, eg =SUM(C1:C15).

           (iii)   State the data type for the column headed Shipment_Date (column B).           [1]

                   Answers may include:
                   ● Date / Long Date / Short Date.

           (iv)    Outline one reason why SingShip would use mail merge when producing
                   letters for customers to advise them about their shipments.                   [2]

                   Answers may include:
                   ● Mail merge combines the functionality of word-processing software with
                     that of a spreadsheet…
                   ● …which is a far more efficient process than individually creating a
                     document for each recipient.
                   ● There is less chance of error if the data is stored once and then merged.
                   ● ShipSing can use mail merge to create personalized letters for
                     customers by adding spreadsheet data to the template.
                   ● The customized letters can be generated at once for printing / emailing,
                     saving time and effort.

                   Award [1] for identifying a reason why SingShip would use mail merge
                   when producing letters for customers and [1] for a development of that
                   reason, up to a maximum of [2].
                                              –8–                   N21/3/ITGSX/SP1/ENG/TZ0/XX/M



(b)   (i)     Distinguish between data validation and data verification.                      [2]

              Answers may include:
              ● Data validation is about checking the input data to ensure it conforms
                with the data requirements of the system to avoid data errors. Data
                validation rules (or check routines) are used to ensure the validity
                (mostly correctness and meaningfulness) of data.
              ● Data verification is a way of ensuring the user types what they intend, to
                ensure they do not make a mistake when inputting data, eg double data
                entry.

              Award [1] for each reason that clearly differentiates between data validation
              and data verification, up to a maximum of [2].

      The product development life cycle (PDLC) was used to develop the database for
      SingShip.

      (ii)    Explain one advantage for SingShip of using a development methodology,
              such as the product development life cycle (PDLC).                              [2]

              Answers may include:
              ● Uses a recognized development process.
              ● Has a series of predefined stages.
              ● These stages can be allocated to different teams.
              ● Allows for concurrent working / agile or waterfall methodologies if
                appropriate.
              ● Clear roles and responsibilities among analysts, project managers,
                designers, developers and business analysts.
              ● Clearly defined inputs and outputs from one step to the next.

              Award [1] for identifying a reason why SingShip would use a development
              methodology such as the product development life cycle (PDLC) and [1] for
              a development of that reason, up to a maximum of [2].

      (iii)   Explain one disadvantage for SingShip of using a development
              methodology, such as the product development life cycle (PDLC).                 [2]

              Answers may include:
              ● May be too rigid.
              ● …which may lead to an increased development time.
              ● It may add a lot of overheads and costs.
              ● It may be difficult sometimes to define everything before seeing it /
                requirements may change frequently.

              Award [1] for identifying a reason why SingShip would not use a
              development methodology such as the product development life cycle
              (PDLC) and [1] for a development of that reason, up to a maximum of [2].
                                             –9–                  N21/3/ITGSX/SP1/ENG/TZ0/XX/M


(c)   The head of IT at SingShip has recommended that all the information stored by
      the company in various spreadsheets should be integrated into a single relational
      database.

      Evaluate this decision.                                                              [8]

      Advantages of using a relational database:
      ● Data will only need to be entered once, so problems linked to data redundancy
        and update anomalies can be removed.
      ● Use of the database will reduce the amount of time SingShip will spend
        managing or updating data.
      ● Using a database allows reports to be produced, modified and used more
        easily than in a spreadsheet.
      ● Database applications can be shared among many users simultaneously.
      ● The database administrator may configure different access permissions for
        different users ensuring security of data.
      ● Cost efficiency – Despite the initial setup cost, the use of the database may
        save time in the long run, resulting in a more cost-effective solution.

      Disadvantages of using a relational database:
      ● Substantial hardware and software may require SingShip additional start-up
         costs.
      ● More expense to hire IT experts to set up and manage the database.
      ● Data migration from legacy system/spreadsheet to database may not be
         straightforward, as these systems may not be fully compatible.
      ● The database may be more complex for employees to understand compared
         to spreadsheets.
      ● Employees may require training to use it.
      ● Database doesn’t provide direct ways to generate graphs/charts in the way a
         spreadsheet does.

      In part (c) of this question it is expected there will be a balance in the ITGS
      terminology between IT technical terminology and the terminology related to
      social and ethical impacts.

                   Answers may include:
                   ● A short-range communication technology to connect to devices.
                   ● Allows wireless connections between devices.

(b)   (i)     Explain one advantage of using lossless compression to send the data to
              the university.                                                                [2]

              Answers may include:
              ● Lossless compression will not result in the loss of quality of the data
                sent, so the receiver can reconstruct the original data.
              ● This will ensure that any vital information is not lost or compromised.

              Award [1] for identifying a reason why lossless compression would be used
              to send the information and [1] for a development of that reason, up to a
              maximum of [2].

      (ii)    Explain one disadvantage of using lossless compression to send the data
              to the university.                                                             [2]

              Answers may include:
              ● Lossless compression will take longer to be sent due to large file size –
                this compression technique cannot achieve high level of compression
                like lossy compression.
              ● In countries / situations where there is inadequate bandwidth, this will
                slow down the transmission of the data.

              Award [1] for identifying a disadvantage of the data being sent using
              lossless compression and [1] for a development of that reason, up to a
              maximum of [2].

      (iii)   Explain why protocols are used when data is sent from one computer to
              another.                                                                       [2]

              Answers may include:
              ● Agreed set of rules.
              ● This allows each device to communicate.
              ● Enables secure communication.

(c)   The scientists who developed the app have received many complaints from
      farmers who have been unable to use it. They are considering two options:
      ● Making the existing system more user friendly.
      ● Educating the farmers to use the existing system.

      Evaluate these two options.                                                            [8]

      Answers may include:

      Advantages of making the system more user friendly:
      ● May reduce development costs, as the work can be carried out at the
        university.
      ● May only require minimal adjustments to the interface.
      ● Can probably be done in the short term, so will have a more immediate
        impact.
      ● Will require little or no training of farmers, so cheaper than providing training,
        which may involve the development of online training sites or require farmers
        to travel to a college.
      ● May require less testing before the improved interface is introduced.
      ● Famers may wish to use it.

      Disadvantages of making the system more user friendly:
      ● Farmers may not like the change.
      ● It could be costly.

      Advantages of educating the farmers to use the existing system:
      ● Will provide a longer-term solution that will be beneficial over a longer period.
      ● May provide other benefits, as farmers become more tech savvy.
      ● May give farmers a greater ownership of the initiative.

      Disadvantages of educating the farmers to use the existing system:
      ● Farmers may not like the process of training.
      ● Farmers may have difficult in learning.

      In part (c) of this question it is expected there will be a balance in the ITGS
      terminology between IT technical terminology and the terminology related to
      social and ethical impacts.

4.   Human genome research

     (a)   (i)     State the role of a primary key in a relational database table.                 [1]

                   Answers may include:
                   ● A primary key provides a unique identifier for each record in a table.

                   Award [1] for correctly stating the role of a primary key.

           (ii)    State the role of a foreign key in a relational database.                       [1]

                   Answers may include:
                   ● A foreign key acts as a reference between two tables / creates a link
                     between them.

                   Award [1] for correctly stating the role of a Foreign Key.

                   database, is used to store the data for MediResearch.                           [2]

                   Answers may include:
                   ● Removes update anomalies / updates are easier, as data is only stored
                     once.
                   ● Removes the risk of data redundancy.
                   ● Reduces storage requirements.

                   Award [1] for identifying each reason why a relational database is used to
                   store the data for MediResearch, up to a maximum of [2].

           (iv)    Identify two features of data mining.                                           [2]

                   Answers may include:
                   ● The practice of interrogating (large) databases.
                   ● To uncover patterns in the data that would not normally be apparent.

                   Award [1] for each characteristic of data mining identified, up to a maximum
                   of [2].

(b)   MediResearch is looking to expand access to the genome data it holds by
      sharing it with other companies.

      Explain three strategies that MediResearch could use to ensure the security of
      the genome data.                                                                     [6]

      Answers may include:
      • Using additional authentication processes, such as a PIN or a text/SMS…
      • …which will mean a second device is required for authentication to take place.

      • Setting different levels of access so only specified employees have access to
        the most sensitive data…
      • …meaning less likelihood of this sensitive data being accessed.

      • Designing the database so that the most sensitive data is placed in a table
        that only specified employees have access to…
      • …reducing the likelihood of this sensitive data being accessed.

      • Encryption on the stored data....
      • … will ensure only users or devices who are authorised can access the stored
        data.

      • VPN/Encryption when transferring the data to other companies...
      • … ensure that if data is intercepted it is not compromised.

      • Creating policies/agreements between parties…
      • … which will dictate the way the data can be shared and used.

      Award [1] for identifying each policy and [1] for a development of the policy
      identified, up to a maximum of [3].

      Mark as [2] + [2] + [2].

(c)   The chief executive officer of MediResearch is considering using cloud-based
      storage to store the genome data.

      Discuss whether MediResearch should move to cloud-based storage.                     [8]

      Answers may include:

      Advantages of cloud-based storage:
      ● No need for them to invest in storage infrastructure on site.
      ● Data security will be provided by the company responsible for the cloud-based
        storage.
      ● Data back-up facilities will be provided by the company responsible for the
        cloud-based storage.
      ● Collaborating and sharing genome data with other data companies or external
        scientists will be more convenient.
      ● Accessibility: Having the data on the cloud will enable the MediResearch
        scientists to work remotely using an internet connection.
      ● Scalability: MediResearch can expand or reduce storage capacity subscription
        on a needs basis.

      Disadvantages of cloud-based storage:
      ● The data may be managed by a third party, which could cause issues linked to
         its use.
      ● MediResearch may feel that data security may be more easily compromised.
      ● The company will have to ensure that they have enough internet bandwidth for
         data accessibility.
      ● Storing data in the cloud may sometimes be difficult – MediResearch’s
         existing data management may not integrate well with the cloud vendor’s
         system.
      ● Considering the nature and sensitivity of the genome data held by
         MediResearch, the government policies of the country where the cloud
         storage unit is placed may influence the way data is stored/used or shared.

      In part (c) of this question it is expected there will be a balance in the ITGS
      terminology between IT technical terminology and the terminology related to
      social and ethical impacts.
