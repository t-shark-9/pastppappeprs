Examiners should be aware that in some cases, candidates may take a different approach, which if
appropriate should be rewarded. If in doubt, check with your Team Leader.

If candidates answer more than the prescribed number of questions:

• In the case of an “identify” question read all answers and mark positively up to the maximum marks.
  Disregard incorrect answers.

• In the case of a “describe” question, which asks for a certain number of facts eg “describe two kinds”,
  mark the first two correct answers. This could include two descriptions, one description and
  one identification, or two identifications.

• In the case of an “explain” question, which asks for a specified number of explanations eg “explain
  two reasons”, mark the first two correct answers. This could include two full explanations,
  one explanation, one partial explanation etc.

2.   (a)   While Laura is working in Asia, she is trying to view the same online content as
           her brother Hugo.

           Explain one reason why Laura and Hugo may not have access to the same
           online content on the same social media platform.                                        [3]

           Answers may include:
           • Technological control:
             o The use of content filters on internet gateways…
             o …such as content filtering on a home/school/country level.
             o ...VPNs can help mitigate the problem
             o Permissions may be set differently for Laura and Hugo…
             o …which may lead to sites being available on one device and not on others.
           • Government and country controls:
             o Government policy to ban or limit access to certain social media…
             o …meaning that certain sites are not available
             o …reason is cultural/beliefs.
           • Security:
             o Permissions may be set differently for Laura and Hugo…
             o …which may lead to sites being available on one device and not on others.
           • Bandwidth:
             o Laura may not have access to sufficient bandwidth to access a video that
                Hugo is watching…
             o …meaning certain videos would not be streamed effectively.
           • Algorithms:
             o Algorithms will create Filter bubble” based on Hugo or Laura previous       online
               behaviour (search history, likes, shares and shopping habits)
             o ...meaning that different content will be seen on their social media feeds.

           Award [1] for identifying why Laura and Hugo have a different level of access to a
           social media platform and [1] for each development of that reason and [1] for
           linking back to the different levels of access, up to a maximum of [3].

(b)   Explain the relationship between bandwidth and net neutrality.                         [3]

      Answers may include:
      • Net neutrality is dependent on an internet service provider’s ability to provide
        the infrastructure to allow the same internet coverage to all of its paying
        customers.
      • Net neutrality is dependent on an internet service provider’s pricing and data
        plans to allow the same bandwidth to all of its paying customers.
      • Net neutrality is dependent on the internet service provider’s policy to provide
        equal access (bandwidth) to all web servers.
      • Net neutrality is dependent on the country legislation that the internet service
        provider is operating on and how this impacts their ability to provide equal
        access (bandwidth) to all websites.

      Bandwidth describes the maximum data transfer rate of an internet connection. It
      measures how much data can be sent over a specific connection at one time, eg
      25 mbps.
      Note to examiners: Bandwidth is not the same as Internet speed (do not accept).

      Net neutrality is the principle that internet service providers should enable access
      to all content and applications regardless of the source, and without favouring or
      blocking particular websites.
      Both net neutrality and bandwidth are controlled by the ISP.


      Award [1] for correct definition of bandwidth.

3.   Universities are requesting access to Hugo’s social media accounts. Discuss whether
     this is acceptable.                                                                         [8]

     Answers may include:

     Reasons why it is acceptable:
     • Allows a university admissions officer to match the suitability of students with the
       university, giving them access to information to help filter a large number of
       applicants to the limited places.
     • The university can verify parts of the student’s application with social media posts,
       eg hobbies and interests.
     • Allows a student to showcase their characteristics and skills beyond their
       application.
     • Ensures that future students are not associated with undesirable groups/friends that
       could damage the reputation of the university.
     • The university has asked permission from Hugo and the person accessing the
       accounts is the admissions officer. There would need to be a policy in place
       regarding the privacy of Hugo’s data.
     • Hugo was aware that this permission would be requested. He has realized the
       importance of managing his digital footprint/wants to showcase his stories for the
       school magazine.

     Reasons why it is not acceptable:
     • Students may not have control over what others post on their social media accounts.
     • Historical posts on social media may not truly represent the student as they are now.
     • Posts are of a social nature and were not intended for the university.
     • The university is not a friend.
     • Allowing universities to have access may make accounts less private than the
       student wishes.
     • Access to social media may give access to more information than required for a
       student’s application.


     Note for examiners: For a ‘Proficient’ response it must explicitly relate to Hugo.

4.   To what extent are social media companies responsible for ensuring the ethical use of
     their platforms?                                                                                [12]

     The response to question 4 must include evidence of independent research linked to
     the Our social media lives case study.

     Answers may include:

     Social media companies are responsible for ensuring the ethical use of their
     platforms:
     • They have control over the technical developments of the platform, which include:
        o algorithms that impact the adverts users see and the news that is read
        o they can develop with ethical design to promote ethical online behaviour, eg pop-
           ups to prompt users to take a break
        o they can develop the platform, allowing users to customize how they want to
           interact with the platform.
     • They have tools to monitor the use of the platform by the users, such as:
        o tools to authenticate users, so there are fewer under-age users and users
           misrepresenting themselves
        o tools to monitor inappropriate content.
        o tools for monitoring time spent on social networks. For example, on IG
     • They can develop reporting tools to facilitate users reporting unethical uses of the
        platform, e.g. trolling.
     • They can write acceptable use policies for users to agree to.
     • They are responsible for the security of the data stored on the platform.
     • They are responsible for the third-party access to the platform.
     • Alert/disable explicit content, e.g., sexual exploitation, pederasty, recruitment of
        youth and adults for terrorist groups, among others.

     Social media companies are not responsible for ensuring the ethical use of their
     platforms:
     • Even with ethical design, users can still misuse the platform.
     • Users intent on unethical use will develop ways to bypass measures put in place by
        the social media companies.
     • More emphasis on monitoring may mean social media companies will be required to
        develop more IA or employ more staff to monitor, which may not be effective.
     • Social media may need to block more content, which reduces freedom of speech.
     • Ultimately, users must be responsible for their own behaviour.
     • Users may not read and follow policies put in place.


     Notes for examiners:
     Use of Independent research and how it is applied to the mark bands
     Adequate: Implicit research for example referring to a named social media platform
     e.g., on Facebook...this may be common knowledge
     Competent: Explicit research could include more detail of the workings of the platform
     or details of a specific scenario in the news, beyond common knowledge
     Proficient: Explicit research with details of the scenario including the source e.g. The BBC News
     reported in 2020....
