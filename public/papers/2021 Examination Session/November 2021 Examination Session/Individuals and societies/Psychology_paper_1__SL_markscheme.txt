                                          Section A
Biological approach to understanding behaviour

1.   Outline neural pruning with reference to one relevant study.                                     [9]

     Refer to the paper 1 section A markbands when awarding marks.

     The command term “outline” requires candidates to give a brief account of neural pruning
     with reference to one relevant study.

     Relevant studies may include, but are not limited to:
     • Draganski et al.’s (2004) study investigating the effects of learning juggling on the brain
       after training and after a period of latency
     • Bremner et al.’s (2003) study investigating hippocampal atrophy in PTSD
     • Maguire et al.’s (2000) study suggesting pruning in the anterior hippocampus of
       experienced taxi drivers
     • Squeglia et al.’s (2013) study suggesting a negative correlation between cortical thickness in the
       frontal lobe and age.

     An outline of the concept of neural pruning may include:
     • the role of long-term potentiation
     • the development of children’s brains
     • a decrease in dendritic branching leading to a decrease in synaptic connections
     • neuronal cell death.

     If a candidate refers to more than one study, credit should only be given to the first study.

     If a candidate outlines neural pruning without making reference to a study, up to a maximum
     of [5] should be awarded.

     If a candidate only describes an appropriate study without outlining neural pruning, up to a
     maximum of [4] should be awarded.

     The response must make a link between neural pruning and the chosen study; however, a
     link between the study and human behaviour is not required.

Section B assessment criteria

A — Focus on the question

To understand the requirements of the question students must identify the problem or issue being raised
by the question. Students may simply identify the problem by restating the question or breaking down the
question. Students who go beyond this by explaining the problem are showing that they understand the
issues or problems.

 Marks     Level descriptor

    0      Does not reach the standard described by the descriptors below.

    1      Identifies the problem/issue raised in the question.

    2      Explains the problem/issue raised in the question.

B — Knowledge and understanding

This criterion rewards students for demonstrating their knowledge and understanding of specific areas of
psychology. It is important to credit relevant knowledge and understanding that is targeted at
addressing the question and explained in sufficient detail.

 Marks    Level descriptor

    0     Does not reach the standard described by the descriptors below.

          The response demonstrates limited relevant knowledge and understanding.
   1–2
          Psychological terminology is used but with errors that hamper understanding.

          The response demonstrates relevant knowledge and understanding but lacks detail.
   3–4
          Psychological terminology is used but with errors that do not hamper understanding.

          The response demonstrates relevant, detailed knowledge and understanding.
   5–6
          Psychological terminology is used appropriately
                                                   –8–                 N21/3/PSYCH/SP1/ENG/TZ0/XX/M


C — Use of research to support answer

Psychology is evidence based so it is expected that students will use their knowledge of research to
support their argument. There is no prescription as to which or how many pieces of research are
appropriate for their response. As such it becomes important that the research selected is relevant and
useful in supporting the response. One piece of research that makes the points relevant to the answer
is better than several pieces that repeat the same point over and over.

 Marks    Level descriptor

    0     Does not reach the standard described by the descriptors below.

          Limited relevant psychological research is used in the response. Research selected serves
   1–2
          to repeat points already made.

          Relevant psychological research is used in support of the response, and is partly explained.
   3–4
          Research selected partially develops the argument.

          Relevant psychological research is used in support of the response and is thoroughly
   5–6
          explained. Research selected is effectively used to develop the argument.

D — Critical thinking

This criterion credits students who demonstrate an inquiring and reflective attitude to their understanding
of psychology. There are a number of areas where students may demonstrate critical thinking about the
knowledge and understanding used in their responses and the research used to support that knowledge
and understanding.

The areas of critical thinking are:
• research design and methodologies
• triangulation
• assumptions and biases
• contradictory evidence or alternative theories or explanations
• areas of uncertainty.

These areas are not hierarchical and not all areas will be relevant in a response. In addition, students
could demonstrate a very limited critique of methodologies, for example, and a well-developed
evaluation of areas of uncertainty in the same response. As a result, a holistic judgement of their
achievement in this criterion should be made when awarding marks.
                                                  –9–                  N21/3/PSYCH/SP1/ENG/TZ0/XX/M



 Marks    Level descriptor

    0     Does not reach the standard described by the descriptors below.

          There is limited critical thinking and the response is mainly descriptive. Evaluation or
  1–2
          discussion, if present, is superficial.

          The response contains critical thinking, but lacks development. Evaluation or discussion of
  3–4
          most relevant areas is attempted but is not developed.

          The response consistently demonstrates well developed critical thinking. Evaluation
  5–6
          and/or discussion of relevant areas is consistently well developed.

E — Clarity and organisation

This criterion credits students for presenting their response in a clear and organized manner. A good
response would require no re-reading to understand the points made or the train of thought underpinning
the argument.

 Marks    Level descriptor

    0     Does not reach the standard described by the descriptors below.

          The answer demonstrates some organization and clarity, but this is not sustained throughout
    1
          the response.

    2     The answer demonstrates organization and clarity throughout the response.

                                             Section B
4.   Discuss how one or more hormones and/or one or more pheromones affect
     human behaviour.                                                                            [22]

     Refer to the paper 1 section B assessment criteria when awarding marks.

     The command term “discuss” requires candidates to offer a considered review of how one
     or more hormones and/or one or more pheromones affect behaviour.

     The effect of hormones/pheromones may be discussed in relation to any type of
     behaviour such as, but not limited to:
     • attraction
     • aggression
     • trust
     • emotional response
     • attachment.

     Relevant studies may include, but are not limited to:
     • Lundstrom and Olsson’s (2005) study on effects of androstadienone on women's
        attraction to men
     • Wedekind et al. (1995) investigating mate preference based on genetic makeup in
        relation to immune system functioning
     • Doucet's et al.’s (2009) study on maternal behaviour.
     • Saxton et al.’s (2008) study on how androstadienone modulates women's
        attributions of men's attractiveness.
     • Radke et al.’s (2015) study investigating the effects of testosterone on women’s
        responses to angry faces
     • Wagels et al.’s (2017) study showing that testosterone reduced desired personal
        distance from aggressive humans
     • Albert et al’s.(1986) Testosterone and aggression in mice
     • Baumgartner et al.’s (2008) study on the role of oxytocin on trust in economic
        behaviour.
     • McGaugh and Cahill’s study on adrenaline and flashbulb memory

     Critical discussion may include, but is not limited to:
     • methodological and/or ethical considerations related to research investigating how hormones
        and/or pheromones affect human behaviour including the ambiguity of research evidence.
     • to what extent pheromones have an effect on human behaviour
     • how the findings of the research have been interpreted and applied
     • implications of the findings
     • supporting and/or contradictory evidence
     • the value of animal research.

     Animal research may be used to describe the effect of pheromones and hormones, but the
     response must then be linked to human behaviour. If there is no explicit link to human
     behaviour the response should be awarded up to a maximum of [3] for criterion D.

     Refer to the paper 1 section B assessment criteria when awarding marks.

     The command term “discuss” requires the candidate to offer a considered review of one cognitive
     process.

     Cognitive processes may include:
     • attention
     • language
     • memory
     • perception
     • thinking and decision-making

     • reliability of a cognitive process
     • effects of culture
     • effects of biological factors
     • effects of environmental factors and stress
     • methodological and ethical considerations related to the research into the cognitive
        process.


     If a candidate discusses more than one cognitive process, credit should be given only to the
     first cognitive process discussed.
