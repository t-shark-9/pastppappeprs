Examiners are reminded of the need to apply the markbands that provide the “best fit” to the responses
given by candidates and to award credit wherever it is possible to do so. If an answer indicates that
the demands of the question are understood and addressed but that not all implications are
considered (for example, compare or contrast; reasons or significance; methods or success),
then examiners should not be afraid of using the full range of marks allowed for by the markscheme:
as such, responses that offer good coverage of some of the criteria should be rewarded accordingly.

For the attention of all examiners: if you are uncertain about the content/accuracy of a
candidate’s work please contact your team leader.

Topic 1: Society and economy (750–1400)

1.   Evaluate the impact of different types of taxation on two societies.

     The question requires that candidates make an appraisal of the impact of different types of taxation
     upon two societies that may or may not be from the same region. Candidates may refer to
     examples such as the imposition of the “geld tax” in Norman England that, along with the taxes
     levied in accordance with land holdings recorded in the Domesday Book, had a significant impact
     upon society. There may be an evaluation of the impact of numerous forms of taxation imposed
     during the period of the Yuan dynasty in China, or the impact of taxes upon non-Muslim
     populations within the ‘Abbasid Empire. In addressing the question, candidates may evaluate the
     risk of rebellion where taxes were onerous; the use of income derived from taxes to maintain social
     hierarchies; advantages accruing to ruling dynasties if taxation were used to advance social and
     economic change. Candidates’ opinions or conclusions will be presented clearly and supported by
     appropriate evidence.


2.   Examine the economic impact of religious persecution on two societies.

     The question requires that candidates consider the interrelationship between religious persecution
     and the economies of two societies that may or may not be chosen from the same region.
     Candidates may examine the impact upon the economy of the persecution of non-Muslims in the
     empire of Tamerlane (Timur) in Central Asia. Among societies in Europe, the persecution of Jews
     during the Crusades may be examined as this contributed to migration resulting in the loss of
     wealth and skills as well as having an impact upon trade. Similarly, the large-scale religious
     sacrifice of enemy captives during the religious wars between the Toltecs and the followers of
     Quetzalquoatl may be viewed as economically damaging. Candidates may also examine the
     negative impact of religious persecution upon economic growth. Candidates’ opinions or
     conclusions will be presented clearly and supported by appropriate evidence.
                                                  –5–                 N21/3/HISTX/BP2/ENG/TZ0/XX/M


Topic 2: Causes and effects of wars (750–1500)

3.   Discuss the importance of religion in causing the outbreak of two wars, each chosen from a
     different region.

     The question requires that candidates offer a considered and balanced review of the importance of
     religion in causing the outbreak of two wars in the period. The two wars must be from different
     regions. The causes discussed may predate the timeframe, but they must be clearly linked to the
     importance of religion in causing the outbreak of wars between 750–1500. Candidates may
     discuss the attempts to forcibly impose religion on others or attempts at conversion as a cause of
     war. They may discuss the importance of religion in driving the conquest of distant territories and
     religious conflict during expansion and conquest, for example in the Crusades. Candidates may
     also discuss religious conflicts or tensions emerging from neighbouring regions/states, for example
     in reference to the origins of the Byzantine–Seljuq Wars (1048–1308). Efforts to defend religious
     practices and beliefs may also be discussed as a cause of war, for example the resistance to the
     Crusades under the leadership of Nur al-Din. Candidates’ opinions or conclusions will be
     presented clearly and supported by appropriate evidence.


4.   “Boundary changes were the most significant effect of wars in the period 750–1500.” Discuss with
     reference to two wars.

     The question requires that candidates offer a considered and balanced review of the statement
     that boundary changes were the most significant effect of wars in the period 750–1500. The two
     wars may or may not be from the same region. Depending on the perspective taken, candidates
     may discuss the conquest of territory and subsequent border changes resulting in enlarged states
     or the loss of territory and the subsequent impact of this, for example following the Norman
     Campaigns, the Hundred Years War or the Mongol Invasions. Candidates may discuss the
     economic gain (including access to resources or key strategic trading locations) which came from
     victory and the conquest of new territories. Other relevant factors may be discussed, for example
     wars which resulted in a change to the line of succession or ruling party or civil wars which did not
     result in significant boundary change. Candidates’ opinions or conclusions will be presented clearly
     and supported by appropriate evidence.
                                                 –6–                  N21/3/HISTX/BP2/ENG/TZ0/XX/M


Topic 3: Dynasties and rulers (750–1500)

5.   Examine the importance of invasion and settlement for the expansion of two dynasties/kingdoms.

     The question requires that candidates consider the interrelationship between invasion and
     settlement and the expansion of two dynasties/kingdoms, which may or may not be chosen from
     different regions. Candidates may examine the expansion of territory controlled by the Vikings, who
     raided and subsequently settled areas of Britain, France and Greenland. Reference may also be
     made to the establishment of trading centres along the Volga with the focus less on settlement
     than economic gain. The expansion of Berber dynasties along the northern coast of Africa and that
     of the ‘Abbasids into Spain may be examined. Other examples such as the expansion of the
     Mongol Empire under Genghis Khan, when invasion did not necessarily lead to settlement by
     these nomadic tribes, may be examined. Candidates’ opinions conclusions will be presented
     clearly and supported by appropriate evidence.


6.   Compare and contrast the methods used by two rulers to deal with challenges to their reign, each
     chosen from a different region.

     The question requires that candidates give an account of the similarities and differences between
     the methods used by two rulers to deal with challenges to their reign, referring to both throughout.
     There does not need to be an equal number of each. The two rulers chosen must be from different
     regions. Rivalry between the Lancastrian and Yorkist dynasties in England, for example, led to the
     Wars of the Roses and this may be contrasted with the Ottoman Empire where the challenges to
     dynastic succession were usually met by the timely assassination of possible rivals. When
     challenged by enemy invasion, Emperor Gaozong of the Southern Song dynasty resorted to
     appeasement through ceding territory. Similarly, Moctezuma II offered gifts and hospitality to the
     Spanish conquistadores although this proved ineffective. A comparison or contrast may be made
     with Mansa Musa, the ruler of Mali who, arguably, successfully anticipated any challenges by
     displays of his immense wealth.
                                                 –7–                  N21/3/HISTX/BP2/ENG/TZ0/XX/M


Topic 4: Societies in transition (1400–1700)

7.   “Population expansion was a significant cause of social and economic change.” With reference to
     two societies, to what extent do you agree with this statement?

     The question requires that candidates consider the merits or otherwise of the statement that
     population expansion was a significant cause of social and economic change. The two societies
     chosen may or may not be from the same region. Candidates may offer equal coverage of social
     and economic change, or they may prioritize their discussion of one of these. However, both
     aspects will be a feature of the response. Social changes may include rising tensions resulting
     from population expansion, including pressures on housing, food or land. Candidates may refer to
     economic benefits, including increased economic development, growth in trade, opportunities for
     increased tax revenue or economic problems, including lack of access to resources or increased
     competition for employment. Candidates may also refer to relevant domestic or international
     population movements. The population growth in England throughout the 16th century and the
     subsequent problems arising from and impacting immigration to the colonies is a viable example;
     as is the significant population growth experienced during the Ming dynasty, which resulted in
     internal migration and heavily impacted agriculture. Candidates’ opinions or conclusions will be
     presented clearly and supported by appropriate evidence.


8.   Evaluate the impact of religious expansion and conversion on two societies in transition.

     The question requires that candidates make an appraisal of the impact of religious expansion and
     conversion on two societies in transition. Candidates may evaluate the impact of forced conversion
     on societies, for example the treatment of indigenous peoples in the Americas or the enforcement
     of religion during the Spanish Inquisition. Candidates may evaluate the impact of religious
     expansion and conversion on art, culture and science within their chosen societies; or the role of
     religious expansion and conversion in sparking conflict. The Reformation and Catholic Reformation
     (Counter-Reformation) and the subsequent impacts throughout society, including immigration to
     the New World, will likely be popular examples. Similarly, the expansion of Islam into West Africa
     during this period, specifically as evidenced by the decision of Musa I to make Islam the state
     religion of Mali, offers another example. Candidates’ opinions or conclusions will be presented
     clearly and supported by appropriate evidence.
                                                 –8–                  N21/3/HISTX/BP2/ENG/TZ0/XX/M


Topic 5: Early Modern states (1450–1789)

9.    Compare and contrast the treatment of subjects in two Early Modern states.

      The question requires that candidates give an account of the similarities and differences in the
      treatment of subjects in two Early Modern states that may or may not be chosen from the same
      region, referring to both throughout. There does not need to be an equal number of each.
      Candidates may refer to states within Europe where serfdom was practiced to reward nobles and
      to organize peasant communities. This may be compared and/or contrasted with similar practices
      employed by the Tokugawa shogunate in Japan to reward samurai and organize peasant
      populations. Candidates may also draw upon comparisons and contrasts to be made with the
      encomienda system in the Americas, used to organize subject populations. The contrasting
      treatment of Muslim and of Christian populations in different states within the Ottoman Empire may
      also be considered. With reference to the treatment of subjects, candidates may choose to
      compare and contrast issues such as taxation; legal rights and judicial systems; responses to
      different religious beliefs.


10.   “The race to establish colonial rule was driven mostly by economic competition.” Discuss with
      reference to two colonial states.

      The question requires that candidates offer a considered and balanced review of the statement
      that the race to establish colonial rule was driven mostly by economic competition. The two states
      may or may not be chosen from the same region. Candidates may support the statement by
      discussing the competition between the Spanish and Portuguese empires in the Americas and
      Africa, which was motivated mainly by economic gain. However, the statement may also be
      challenged by emphasizing the importance of proselytization. Candidates may challenge the
      statement by referring to competition between the British and French colonies in North America as
      being motivated not only by economic gain but also by Great Power rivalry and the acquisition of
      territory. Reference may be made to Portuguese, French and British rivalry over trade in India as a
      precursor to colonial rule. Candidates’ opinions or conclusions will be presented clearly and
      supported by appropriate evidence.
                                                   –9–                   N21/3/HISTX/BP2/ENG/TZ0/XX/M


Topic 6: Causes and effects of Early Modern wars (1500–1750)

11.   “The main cause of Early Modern wars was the competition for resources.” Discuss with reference
      to two wars.

      The question requires that candidates offer a considered and balanced review of the statement
      that the main cause of Early Modern wars was the competition for resources. Candidates may
      discuss competition for resources in reference to land for agricultural purposes or in reference to
      trade, trade routes, ports, key trading cities. The Moroccan invasion of the Songhai Empire, the
      Beaver Wars and the Portuguese–Mamluk Naval War are all viable examples of such conflicts.
      Candidates may also discuss competition in relation to natural or human resources. The European
      conquest of the New World may be discussed and provides numerous examples of conflicts driven
      by competition for natural, human and land resources. Similarly, the conflicts resulting from
      Ottoman expansion under the reign of Selim I and Suleiman may be popular examples. Other
      relevant factors may be addressed, for example, candidates may discuss the importance of
      ideological, political, religious or territorial causes of Early Modern wars. Candidates’ opinions or
      conclusions will be presented clearly and supported by appropriate evidence.


12.   “Leaders were the most significant factor in determining the outcome of Early Modern wars.”
      Discuss with reference to two wars, each from a different region.

      The question requires that candidates offer a considered and balanced review of the statement
      that leaders were the most significant factor in determining the outcome of Early Modern wars. The
      two wars must be from different regions. Candidates may discuss leadership as being key in terms
      of military organization and/or strategy or the role of political leadership in determining the outcome
      of wars. Suleiman may be discussed as a leader whose state experienced significant military
      success under his rule. Candidates may discuss the role of leaders in impacting morale and
      inspiring troops, for example the role of Popé in the Pueblo Revolt. Responses may also consider
      the failures of leaders or examples of poor leadership as playing a key role in the outcome of Early
      Modern wars. Other relevant factors may be addressed, for example technology and troops, both
      in reference to quality and/or quantity, geographic factors, including terrain and weather, or supply
      issues. Candidates’ opinions or conclusions will be presented clearly and supported by appropriate
      evidence.
                                                   – 10 –                 N21/3/HISTX/BP2/ENG/TZ0/XX/M


Topic 7: Origins, development and impact of industrialization (1750–2005)

13.   Discuss the importance of developments in energy and power for industrialization in two countries,
      each chosen from a different region.

      The question requires that candidates offer a considered and balanced review of the importance of
      developments in energy and power for industrialization in two countries, from different regions.
      Candidates may discuss technological innovations that resulted in increased energy/power
      production, for example: the combustion engine; steam power/the steam engine; gas lighting;
      generation of electricity; nuclear power. Candidates may discuss developments related to
      accessing natural energy sources, for example the expansion of coal mining during Britain’s
      industrial revolution, the expansion of the oil industry in the 19th century in the United States or the
      development and regulation of the oil industry in Brazil in the 20th century. Developments in efforts
      to harness natural resources, including water, wind and solar power, are relevant, for example
      John Smeaton’s work on windmills in the 18th century. Candidates may discuss the role of key
      individuals in developments related to energy and power, for example Thomas Newcomen and
      James Watt. Candidates’ opinions or conclusions will be presented clearly and supported by
      appropriate evidence.


14.   “Changes to leisure were the most significant social impact of industrialization.” With reference to
      two countries, to what extent do you agree with this statement?

      The question requires that candidates consider the merits or otherwise of the statement that
      changes to leisure were the most significant social impact of industrialization. Candidates may
      discuss the significance of developments in transportation, such as railway lines created expressly
      for tourism. Candidates may discuss the significance of resorts catering to the industrial working
      class and the impact of industrialization on tourism as evidenced by the founding of Thomas Cook
      & Son in 1872. Other changes in leisure that may be linked to industrialization include themes in
      literature, theatrical entertainment and the widespread popularity of sports that led to the formation
      of the Football Association in 1863. In Japan, the influence of Western customs and fashions on
      leisure during industrialization also provides a wide range of examples. Candidates may also make
      connections between the regulation of working hours and the subsequent impact on leisure time,
      such as the 1871 Bank Holiday Act in the UK. Other relevant factors may be addressed, for
      example the social impact of urbanization, changing standards of living, issues relating to health,
      disease and life expectancy, but with a focus on the issue in the question. Candidates’ opinions or
      conclusions will be presented clearly and supported by appropriate evidence.
                                                 – 11 –                N21/3/HISTX/BP2/ENG/TZ0/XX/M


Topic 8: Independence movements (1800–2000)

15.   “Other factors were more important than leadership in the success of independence movements.”
      Discuss with reference to two independence movements.

      The question requires that candidates offer a considered and balanced review of the statement
      that other factors were more important than leadership in the success of two independence
      movements that may or may not be chosen from a different region. Candidates may discuss the
      campaign waged against the Unilateral Declaration of Independence in Rhodesia/Zimbabwe and
      argue that sustained guerrilla warfare was of more importance for success than the leadership of
      Mugabe. In Indochina, the military leadership of Giap and the political leadership of Ho Chi Minh
      may be seen as paramount against both the French and/or the US. The impact of the Second
      World War on independence movements in Francophone Africa or in British colonies in Asia may
      be considered and weighed against the importance of charismatic leaders or nascent demands for
      freedom and democracy. In Latin America, the importance of Bolívar, for example, may be
      weighed against weakening Spanish control in one or more of its colonies. Candidates’ opinions or
      conclusions will be presented clearly and supported by appropriate evidence.


16.   Evaluate the effectiveness of responses to economic challenges in the first ten years of
      independence in two states, each chosen from a different region.

      The question requires that candidates make an appraisal of the effectiveness of responses to
      economic challenges in the first ten years of independence in two states, each of which must be
      chosen from a different region. Candidates may evaluate the effectiveness of responses to
      challenges faced by Brazil when regionalism obstructed economic development and a slump in
      coffee prices posed problems. In Vietnam, candidates may evaluate the effectiveness of responses
      to economic challenges either solely in North Vietnam after 1945 or in a united Vietnam after 1976,
      when the expansion of a planned economy into the South met with mixed success. In India,
      Nehru’s economic policies may be evaluated for their effectiveness along with his embrace of the
      policy of Non-Alignment as being key to the receipt of aid from both the USSR and the US. In
      Africa, candidates may evaluate the effectiveness of Nkrumah’s planned economy in newly
      independent Ghana or Nyerere’s policy of ujama in Tanzania that met with mixed results in both
      states. Candidates’ opinions or conclusions will be presented clearly and supported by appropriate
      evidence.

Topic 9: Emergence and development of democratic states (1848–2000)

17.   Compare and contrast the role of leadership in the emergence of two democratic states, each
      chosen from a different region.

      The question requires that candidates give an account of the similarities and differences between
      the role of leadership in terms of the emergence of two democratic states, from different regions,
      referring to both states throughout. Candidates may refer to the role of positive leadership that was
      influential in the creation of the democratic states or may contrast this with the failures or problems
      of previous leaders. The different roles of Kaiser Wilhelm II and Ebert in the formation of the
      Weimar Republic in Germany offer one such example. Candidates may refer to the role of military
      leadership in the formation of democratic states, for example the role of Garibaldi in the wars of
      unification prior to the creation of Liberal Italy. The impact of foreign leadership may be viewed as
      having played a role, for example the role of leaders from the US in influencing Japan post-Second
      World War and this may be compared to the role of Konrad Adenauer in the emergence of West
      Germany. Candidates may identify other factors as being more influential, such as the aftermath of
      war and/or political upheaval; political, social and economic factors or external influences.


18.   Evaluate the impact of changing social and economic policies on the population of one democratic
      state.

      The question requires that candidates make an appraisal of the impact of changing social and
      economic policies on the population of one democratic state by weighing up the strengths and
      limitations of those changes. Social policies evaluated may include education, social welfare,
      policies towards women and minorities, the arts and media, policies relating to health. Economic
      policies evaluated may include the distribution of wealth, taxation, employment regulation,
      unemployment benefits, industry regulation, infrastructure development. For example, the
      significant impact of India’s Five-Year plans could be evaluated along with the impact in Japan of
      the Labour Union Law (1945) and agricultural reform post-Second World War. Candidates may
      evaluate the positive benefits of changing policies including, for example, increased access to
      goods and services; more equality; increased standards of living. Or the negative impacts of
      changes to policies may be evaluated including loss of access to goods and services, lack of
      equity, reduction in standards of living. The extensive social welfare reforms enacted by the
      Weimar government in Germany offer a rich example. Candidates’ opinions or conclusions will be
      presented clearly and supported by appropriate evidence.

Topic 10: Authoritarian states (20th century)

19.   “Propaganda was the key factor in the emergence of authoritarian states.” Discuss with reference
      to two states, each from a different region.

      The question requires that candidates offer a considered and balanced review of the statement
      that propaganda was the key factor in the emergence of authoritarian states. The two states must
      be chosen from a different region. Candidates may discuss how propaganda was a tool to gain
      support or contrastingly that attacked either the existing regime or rival political groups. Hitler’s use
      of propaganda to gain support from the German population as well as to attack opposition parties
      such as the KPD is a viable example. Similarly, the Red Army’s use of propaganda to vilify their
      White opponents during the Russian Civil War may be used. Candidates may also discuss different
      types of propaganda including the use of visual, auditory or physical propaganda. The conduct of
      the PLA as compared to the KMT during the Chinese Civil War, 1945–1949, is one such example.
      Other relevant factors may be discussed; candidates may argue that conditions such as economic
      crises or methods such as widespread intimidation were the key factors in the emergence of
      authoritarian states. Candidates’ opinions or conclusions will be presented clearly and supported
      by appropriate evidence.


20.   Evaluate the effectiveness of methods used to control opposition in two authoritarian states, each
      chosen from a different region.

      The question requires that candidates make an appraisal of the effectiveness of methods used to
      control opposition, weighing up the strengths and limitations of these methods. The two
      authoritarian states must be from different regions. Candidates may evaluate the effectiveness of
      repressive methods including the use of police, secret police, violence and terror. The role of the
      SS-Gestapo, NKVD, Cheka and OVRA are viable examples. Peron’s control of the media in
      Argentina is another example of suppressive methods. Candidates may evaluate the effectiveness
      of political methods including changes to the legal system such as The Law for the Restoration of
      the Professional Civil Service in Germany. Other methods that may be evaluated include the
      mobilization of education, arts, culture, youth policies, family life, or economic methods such as
      employment regulation and taxation. In addition to the role of state agents, candidates may
      evaluate the effectiveness of the mobilization of the population as a tool to control opposition, as
      occurred during the Cultural Revolution in China. Candidates may also evaluate methods used to
      control opposition within the ruling party. Candidates’ opinions or conclusions will be presented
      clearly and supported by appropriate evidence.

Topic 11: Causes and effects of 20th century wars

21.   Evaluate the importance of foreign influence to the outcome of two civil wars.

      The question requires that candidates make an appraisal of the importance of foreign influence to
      the outcome of two civil wars that may or may not be chosen from the same region. The
      importance of aid provided to both sides may be evaluated, as well as the influence of the Non-
      Intervention Agreement on the outcome of the Spanish Civil War. For the Chinese Civil War,
      candidates may evaluate the importance of foreign aid, limited or otherwise, from both the US and
      the USSR. Other appropriate examples would include the involvement of international
      organizations and/or neighbouring states upon the outcome of the Congo Civil War of 1960–64 or
      that of 1996–2000. The influence of the US on the outcome of the Nicaraguan Civil War of 1926–
      27; the 1979 Revolution and/or the subsequent conflict against the Contras may be evaluated.
      Candidates may consider foreign influence to include the provision of advisors and/or fighting
      troops; supplies of arms; financial support; political or diplomatic involvement. Candidates’ opinions
      or conclusions will be presented clearly and supported by appropriate evidence.


22.   “Political change was the most significant short-term effect of war.” Discuss with reference to
      two wars.

      The question requires that candidates offer a considered and balanced review of the statement
      that political change was the most significant short-term effect of two wars that may or may not be
      chosen from the same region. Candidates may agree with the statement by discussing the October
      Revolution as a short-term effect of the First World War. The political change brought about by the
      victors of the Spanish and Chinese civil wars may be discussed. A discussion of the political
      change brought about in Argentina after its defeat in the Malvinas/Falklands War would be
      appropriate. Links may be made between the Second World War, French colonies and the policy
      decisions made at the Brazzaville Conference of 1944. Candidates may challenge the statement
      by arguing that such short-term effects as economic crises or population transfer were of greater
      significance than political change. Candidates’ opinions or conclusions will be presented clearly
      and supported by appropriate evidence.

Topic 12: The Cold War: Superpower tensions and rivalries (20th century)

23.   “The arms race made the greatest contribution to the ending of the Cold War.” Discuss with
      reference to the period between 1980 and 1991.

      The question requires that candidates offer a considered and balanced review of the statement
      that the arms race made the greatest contribution to ending the Cold War, with reference to the
      period between 1980 and 1991. Candidates may discuss the impact of Reagan reigniting the arms
      race during his first term as president and how this contributed to further economic pressure on a
      USSR already struggling to maintain nuclear parity. Economic problems that plagued the USSR
      and were deepened by the burden of the Soviet-Afghan War may be discussed, as these meant
      that the USSR could no longer afford to compete with US spending on arms. Candidates may also
      argue that the USSR lagged behind US advances in computer-controlled weaponry and this, along
      with apprehension about the Strategic Defense Initiative, made it open to arms limitation and a
      further reduction in Cold War tension. Candidates may challenge the statement by arguing that
      other factors were of greater importance in ending the Cold War. These may include Gorbachev’s
      glasnost and democratic reform policies that led to warmer relations with Europe and the US; the
      breaking away of the satellite states; the breaking up of the USSR. Candidates’ opinions or
      conclusions will be presented clearly and supported by appropriate evidence.


24.   Examine the influence of two leaders, each chosen from a different region, on the development of
      the Cold War.

      The question requires that candidates examine the interrelationships between the influence of two
      chosen leaders and the development of the Cold War. The two leaders may or may not be
      contemporaries, but they must be from different regions. Candidates may examine the influence of
      Stalin and Truman, for example, upon the early years of the Cold War attributing its origins either
      to one or to both. Other appropriate examples of superpower leaders would be Nixon and Mao or
      Reagan and Gorbachev whose relationship did much to change the trajectory of the Cold War. The
      influence of Non-Aligned leaders such as Sukarno and Nasser may be examined, and links made
      to how they were able to impact the Cold War policies of the US and/or the USSR. Similarly, the
      influence of Castro or Ho Chi Minh may be examined to demonstrate how the leaders of client
      states were able to impact the development of the Cold War. Candidates’ opinions or conclusions
      will be presented clearly and supported by appropriate evidence.
