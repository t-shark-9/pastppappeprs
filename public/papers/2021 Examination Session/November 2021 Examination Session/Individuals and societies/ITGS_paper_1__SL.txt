Answer two questions. Each question is worth [20 marks].

1.   Accessing online media

     Rajesh frequently travels for his job and has found that he is unable to watch his favorite
     films and TV channels when abroad (see Figure 1). He has been informed that he can
     subscribe to an internet protocol television (IPTV) service or use a virtual private network
     (VPN) to stream or download this content.

                                Figure 1: An example of blocked content




                                      THIS TV CHANNEL OR FILM IS
                                        NOT AVAILABLE IN YOUR
                                          CURRENT LOCATION




     (a)   (i)     Identify two hardware devices that Rajesh could use to view his internet protocol
                   television (IPTV) channels.                                                               [2]

           (ii)    Identify two characteristics of an IP address.                                            [2]

           (iii)   Rajesh is downloading a film for offline viewing. The download speed is 80 mbps.

                   Calculate the amount of data, in megabytes (MB), that will be downloaded in
                   10 minutes.                                                                               [2]

     (b)   (i)     Explain why Rajesh downloaded the films rather than streaming them when he
                   was travelling.                                                                           [4]

           (ii)    Rajesh has been told that subscribing to an internet protocol television (IPTV)
                   service may compromise his anonymity.

                   Distinguish between anonymity and privacy.                                                [2]

     (c)   To what extent is it acceptable for Rajesh to use services like a virtual private network
           (VPN) to access content that may be blocked in the country he is visiting?                        [8]




                                                                                                    Turn over

2.   Singapore shipping

     SingShip is a cargo shipping company based in Singapore. It transports goods between ports
     in Southeast Asia. The company is planning to expand its services to 10 more destinations.

     In SingShip’s head office, staff use a range of software, such as word processing, databases
     and spreadsheets (see Figure 2).

     (a)        (i)     Identify two reasons why a spreadsheet would be used to store the information
                        in Figure 2.                                                                         [2]

                (ii)    State the formula to calculate the total number of containers used in Column C.      [1]

                (iii)   State the data type for the column headed Shipment_Date (column B).                  [1]

                (iv)    Outline one reason why SingShip would use mail merge when producing letters
                        for customers to advise them about their shipments.                                  [2]

(This question continues on the following page)

(Question 2 continued)

     (b)   (i)     Distinguish between data validation and data verification.                         [2]

           The product development life cycle (PDLC) was used to develop the database
           for SingShip.

           (ii)    Explain one advantage for SingShip of using a development methodology, such
                   as the product development life cycle (PDLC).                                      [2]

           (iii)   Explain one disadvantage for SingShip of using a development methodology,
                   such as the product development life cycle (PDLC).                                 [2]

     (c)   The head of IT at SingShip has recommended that all the information stored by
           the company in various spreadsheets should be integrated into a single
           relational database.

           Evaluate this decision.                                                                    [8]

3.     Smart farming

       A government in East Africa is using the expertise of scientists at a university in the region to
       promote the culture of smart farming and increase the productivity of farmers (see Figure 3).

                             Figure 3: An example of farming in East Africa




       The new smart farming system uses a mobile app1 that connects to a data logger2 using
       Bluetooth technology (see Figure 4).

                                    Figure 4: Example of a data logger




       The data collected by the app is sent to the university by lossless compression.

     other electronic device
2

(Question 3 continued)

     (a)   (i)     Identify two zip file formats.                                                      [2]

           (ii)    Identify two characteristics of Bluetooth.                                          [2]

           (iii)   Identify two types of data collected by the sensors in the data logger.             [2]

     (b)   (i)	Explain one advantage of using lossless compression to send the data to
                the university.                                                                        [2]

           (ii)    Explain one disadvantage of using lossless compression to send the data to
                   the university.                                                                     [2]

           (iii)   Explain why protocols are used when data is sent from one computer to another.      [2]

     (c)   The scientists who developed the app have received many complaints from farmers
           who have been unable to use it. They are considering two options:
           y Making the existing system more user friendly.
           y Educating the farmers to use the existing system.

           Evaluate these two options.                                                                 [8]




                                                                                                Turn over

4.    Human genome research

      MediResearch, a US-based DNA testing company, has a relational database of human
      genome information. An individual’s genome data represents private information about their
      past, their present and, potentially, their future. This information is stored in a relational database.

      The senior managers at MediResearch are considering using data mining but are concerned
      this may compromise the anonymity of the individuals who have provided their DNA.

      (a)     (i)     State the role of a primary key in a relational database table.                                  [1]

              (ii)    State the role of a foreign key in a relational database.                                        [1]

              (iii)   Identify two reasons why a relational database, rather than a flat-file database,
                      is used to store the data for MediResearch.[2]

              (iv)    Identify two features of data mining.                                                            [2]

      (b)     MediResearch is looking to expand access to the genome data it holds by sharing it
              with other companies.

              Explain three strategies that MediResearch could use to ensure the security of the
              genome data.                                                                                             [6]

      (c)     The chief executive officer of MediResearch is considering using cloud-based storage
              to store the genome data.

              Discuss whether MediResearch should move to cloud-based storage.                                         [8]
