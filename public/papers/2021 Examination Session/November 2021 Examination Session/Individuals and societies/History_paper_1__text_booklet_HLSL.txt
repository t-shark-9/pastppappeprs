Prescribed subject 1: Military leaders

Read sources A to D and answer questions 1 to 4. The sources and questions relate to case
study 1: Genghis Khan (c1200–1227) — Leadership: Importance of Genghis Khan’s leadership to
Mongol success.

Source A                Paul Lococo Jr, an historian specializing in Chinese military history, writing in the
                        academic book Genghis Khan: History’s Greatest Empire Builder (2008).

As we have seen already, alliances on the steppes were almost always fragile, as leaders wanted
to gain benefits for themselves and their clans, as well as protection from other Mongol alliances.
Over the years, Chinggis [Genghis Khan] demonstrated military and political skill, and he also
acquired a reputation as a fair judge. His image was greatly enhanced through the use of shamans
[spiritual leaders] who spread tales of omens favourable to Chinggis. The tribes often conducted
successful raids, and Chinggis changed the way in which the rewards of the raids were divided.
Traditionally, the various tribe and clan leaders divided the goods they had taken. Chinggis required
that all plunder be placed in a common pile, and he then distributed it between the leaders, who in turn
rewarded their followers. In this way, Chinggis not only created a better means of dividing the rewards of
war, but he also emphasized his own supreme leadership. All rewards were granted by Chinggis, thus
reinforcing his role as leader and his direct connection with the common Mongol soldier.


Source B                George Lane, a professor of the history of the Middle East and Central Asia,
                        writing in the academic book Genghis Khan and Mongol Rule (2004).

As head of the tribe, the chief was concerned mainly with the allocation of pastures, the planning of
migration times and routes, and decisive leadership. The shaman and the other nobles, effectively
a tribal council, both confirmed and provided limits to the chief’s authority. The tribe operated on two
administrative levels. At the higher level was the tribal chief, who had direct control over the tribal nobles.
At the lower level, these individual nobles controlled their own followers. It was sometimes in the tribe’s
interest to form alliances or to seek the protection of a stronger tribe …

As a chief, Chinggis Khan built his power base and his tribal empire through battle, and with each victory
he added more men to his army and more people to his following. However, those independent-minded
tribal chiefs remained with him not from fear but from choice. Chinggis Khan offered his followers
rewards and plenty of plunder. The tribes responded to his call and surrendered their independence
because they believed that they would gain and prosper in his service. If he had not delivered, his
support would have soon dissolved. Both his authority and the tribes’ continued support depended on his
victories and political and military success. The charisma of the leader was crucial.

Source C                  Marco Polo, an Italian merchant and explorer, recounting his travels to Asia
                          between 1271–1295 in the 13th-century work The Description of the World.

In the year 1187, the Mongols made a king called Chinggis Khan. He was a man of great bravery, great
intelligence, and great ability. This Chinggis Khan held the lordship nobly and well. Such a multitude of
Mongols came to him; and when Chinggis Khan saw that he had so many people, he equipped them
with bows and armor and went conquering through those other lands. They conquered eight provinces
but did them no harm, nor did he strip them of their things. But he took them with him to conquer
other peoples. In this way, he conquered this great multitude of peoples, as you have heard. When
these peoples saw this lord’s good lordship and great nobility, they went with him quite willingly. When
Chinggis Khan had amassed such a great multitude of people, he said that he wanted to conquer a great
part of the world.

Prescribed subject 2: Conquest and its impact

Read sources E to H and answer questions 5 to 8. The sources and questions relate to case study 2:
The conquest of Mexico and Peru (1519–1551) — Key events and actors: Key actors: Diego de Almagro,
Malinche, Atahualpa, Moctezuma II; Bartolomé de las Casas; Juan Gines Sepúlveda.

Note: In Source E, the word “Indians” is used to reflect the place and time of the original source.
This term is used with reference to the indigenous populations.

Source E                Pedro Cieza de León, a Spanish conquistador writing in his chronicle
                        The Discovery and Conquest of Peru. Chronicles of the New World
                        Encounter (c1553).

The Indians made great complaints when they heard that Atahualpa was imprisoned. They did not
dare to rise up in arms against the Christians because [Atahualpa] had ordered that they should not
do it. When the news spread that he was imprisoned, it caused great wonder. Many rejoiced; others
wept, sighing from the sorrow they felt. They were astonished at how easily 160 men were able to do it.
Chalcuchima was the captain who showed the most resentment. He complained about his gods because
they had allowed such a thing. He delegated the guarding of Huascar to the appropriate captains and
went to the Jauja valley to calm uprisings. When the news of Atahualpa’s capture reached Cuzco, many
people rejoiced. They took such an event for a miracle. They believed that their god sent his children
from heaven to liberate Huascar and to restore him on the throne.


Source F                Theodor de Bry, an engraver, depicts the ransom of gold paid to the Spaniards
                        for the rescue of Atahualpa in a detail from America. Part VI (1596).

Source G                David P Werlich, a professor of Latin American history, writing in the academic
                        book Peru: A Short History (1978).

On 16 November 1532, Atahualpa accepted an invitation to dine with Francisco Pizarro. Entering the
central plaza with a force of 5000 lightly armed men, Atahualpa was boldly attacked and captured by
Pizarro and a team of 20 attackers. While the monarch remained in the hands of the Europeans, the
emperor’s followers offered little resistance. Atahualpa proposed to buy his freedom with enough gold
and silver to fill two rooms. The Spaniards accepted. When the emperor complied with his part of the
bargain, however, his captors faced a dilemma. Once free, Atahualpa probably would have commanded
his armies to destroy the invaders. Yet, if he remained a prisoner, it seemed likely that his people would
attempt a rescue of their god-king. In July 1533, after receiving dubious information that a large Inca
force was preparing to attack Cajamarca, the Spaniards accused Atahualpa of treacherously ordering the
assault and executed him. While still a prisoner, Atahualpa had ordered the execution of his half-brother
Huascar and other claimants to the Inca throne so that they could not profit from the monarch’s distress.
At the same time, Atahualpa’s Ecuadorian armies continued to ravage many towns that had supported
Huascar. The Spaniards exploited this internal conflict. Posing as champions of the vanquished Cuzco
faction, they installed the first of a series of puppet emperors and received the support of many districts.


Source H                Hanns J Prem, an historian specializing in pre-Columbian studies, writing
                        in the academic book The Ancient Americas. A Brief History and Guide to
                        Research (1997).

The war between the two Inca brothers had just ended when Francisco Pizarro landed in 1532 with 180
Spaniards. Pizarro and Atahualpa met in Cajamarca, where the Spaniard took the Inca ruler captive in a
surprise attack. In order to avoid Huascar’s accession to rule, Atahualpa had his half-brother killed while
he was on the way to Cajamarca as a captive. Despite a famous final effort by the empire to fill a room
up to the ceiling with gold as ransom, Atahualpa did not gain his freedom, but was sentenced to death
in a trial based on false accusations. In order to use the authority of an Inca for his own ends, Pizarro
crowned Manco Inca as the new ruler. The Spaniards held Manco Inca in Cuzco under humiliating
conditions. Finally, he escaped, started a rebellion, laid siege to Cuzco from April 1536 to August 1537,
and established an independent state that posed a constant threat to Spanish towns and roads.

Prescribed subject 3: The move to global war

Read sources I to L and answer questions 9 to 12. The sources and questions relate to case study 2:
German and Italian expansion (1933–1940) — Events: German expansion (1938–1939); Pact of Steel,
Nazi–Soviet Pact and the outbreak of war.

Source I               Adolf Hitler, Führer of Germany, writing in a letter to Benito Mussolini, Il Duce of
                       Italy (25 August 1939).

The relationship of Germany to Poland, as a result of the policies of England, has become more
unsatisfactory since spring and in the last few weeks the position has become simply unbearable. The
reports about the persecution of the Germans in the border areas are not invented press reports but
represent only a fraction of the terrible truth. The current policy of Poland has brought about a complete
standstill in Danzig’s entire economic life for the past several weeks and would, if it were continued,
destroy the city.

The readiness on the part of the Soviet government to negotiate with Germany has made it possible for
me to send my Foreign Minister to Moscow for the conclusion of a treaty which is the most extensive
non-aggression pact in existence and whose text will be made public.


Source J               Bernard Partridge, a political cartoonist, depicts Hitler and Joseph Stalin
                       [Soviet Leader] after the signing of the Nazi–Soviet Pact in the cartoon
                       “Doubtful Friends” for the British magazine Punch (27 September 1939).

Source K                   Keith Eubank, a professor of history, writing in the academic book The Origins of
                           World War II (2004).

[German Foreign Minister] Ribbentrop wanted to come to Moscow immediately but [Soviet Foreign
Minister] Molotov insisted that the visit to complete the pact should come a week later. Hitler had to resort
to a personal message to Stalin in order to extract an invitation for Ribbentrop to come to Moscow sooner.
Ribbentrop met Molotov and Stalin in the Kremlin. They rapidly agreed on a non-aggression pact. If one
partner went to war, the other promised to remain neutral.

A secret agreement dividing Poland convinced Stalin. Hitler could now be certain that Stalin would not
interfere with his plans in the east when he attacked Poland and then turned his attention to Britain and
France. Stalin not only had peace but a promise of spheres of influence that Britain and France had
denied him …

In a letter to Hitler, [British Prime Minister] Chamberlain vowed that, despite the Nazi–Soviet Pact, Britain
would not step down from its obligations to Poland. Chamberlain pointed out to Hitler that war between
Britain and Germany would be a disaster and that there was nothing between Poland and Germany that
could not be settled peacefully. Chamberlain recommended a truce on both sides …

Hitler telephoned Mussolini to tell him that an attack on Poland was imminent and that he needed the
help that Mussolini had promised in the Pact of Steel. Mussolini had to admit that Italy could not go to
war unless it received urgently needed supplies …

Prescribed subject 4: Rights and protest

Read sources M to P and answer questions 13 to 16. The sources and questions relate to case study 1:
Civil rights movement in the United States (1954–1965) — Protests and action: Legislative changes:
Civil Rights Act (1964); Voting Rights Act (1965).

Note: In Source M, the word “Negro” is used to reflect the place and time of the original source. Today, in
many countries, the word is no longer in common usage.

Source M               Lyndon B Johnson, President of the United States (US), making a speech to the
                       US Congress on voting rights (15 March 1965).

In Selma, Alabama, long-suffering men and women peacefully protested against the denial of their rights
as Americans. Many were brutally assaulted. One good man, a man of God [a religious leader], was
killed … Every American citizen must have an equal right to vote … Yet the harsh fact is that in many
places in this country men and women are kept from voting simply because they are Negroes … The
Constitution says that no person shall be kept from voting because of his race or his color. We have all
sworn an oath before God to support and to defend that Constitution. We must now act in obedience
to that oath … I will send to Congress a law designed to eliminate illegal barriers to the right to vote …
This proposed Act will remove restrictions to voting in all elections—Federal, State and local—which
have been used to deny Negroes the right to vote … It is wrong—deadly wrong—to deny any of your
fellow Americans the right to vote in this country.

                        television channel History (9 November 2009).

The Civil Rights Act of 1964, which banned discrimination on the basis of race, color, religion, sex or
national origin, is considered one of the greatest legislative achievements of the civil rights movement
… [However] voting rights activists in the South were subjected to various forms of violence. One
such event occurred on March 7, 1965, when peaceful participants in a Selma to Montgomery march
for voting rights were met by Alabama state troopers who attacked them … Some protesters were
severely beaten and bloodied … In the wake of the shocking incident, President Johnson called for
comprehensive voting rights legislation …

Blacks attempting to vote were often told by election officials that they possessed insufficient literacy
skills or that they had filled out an application incorrectly …

Johnson signed the Voting Rights Act on August 6, 1965 … The act banned the use of literacy tests, and
provided for federal oversight [supervision] of voter registration in areas where less than 50 percent of
the non-white population had registered to vote.

Although the Voting Rights Act passed, state enforcement of the law was weak, and it often was ignored
outright, mainly in the South and in areas where the proportion of blacks in the population was high …

Still, the Voting Rights Act gave African-American voters the legal means to challenge voting restrictions
and vastly improved voter participation.

Prescribed subject 5: Conflict and intervention

Read sources Q to T and answer questions 17 to 20. The sources and questions relate to case study 1:
Rwanda (1990–1998) — Course and interventions: Actions of the Rwandan Patriotic Front (RPF) and
Rwandan government.

Source Q              Scott Straus, a professor of political science, interviewing a former supporter of
                      Hutu extremists who had also confessed to killing civilians, in the collection of
                      accounts Intimate Enemy. Images and Voices of the Rwandan Genocide (2006).

[President] Habyarimana was the parent of Rwanda. Habyarimana did nothing bad to Tutsis … No
person in Rwanda thought “I am Hutu. You are Tutsi.” Habyarimana prevented all that. We intermarried.
All that was disturbed by the Rwandan Patriotic Front (RPF) war …

We, the peasants, believed that the person who had killed the president was an enemy … they were
Tutsis, so we believed the solution was to kill the Tutsi… We said we were defending ourselves against
the enemy… All the things that happened in Rwanda were caused by the war between the RPF and the
Rwandan government, and the people who are dead and the things that were destroyed, it was the RPF
and the government in place that must answer for that.

Source S                 Linda Melvern, a British journalist, writing in the book Conspiracy to Murder: The
                         Rwandan Genocide (2004).

The United Nations Assistance Mission for Rwanda (UNAMIR) Commander Dallaire met the Rwandan
government, hoping to obtain permission to evacuate refugees in Kigali, [but] the government did not
seem to be concerned by the horrendous ethnic killing.

On 23 April, Dallaire travelled to see the RPF leader Kagame … The RPF was disappointed that the
“international community” had not stated its disgust with the violent destruction of the opposition political
parties and the total survival of the government and its leaders.

Dallaire and Colonel Bagosora [Hutu extremist leader] then met on 28 April … Bagosora told Dallaire
that the RPF was intending to conquer the whole country. His side had never refused to share power
with the RPF. It was all the fault of the RPF for refusing to negotiate with the government …

The swift military success of the RPF in the country created an atmosphere of fear among the
[government’s] army … Some officers were planning to massacre all the people in Kigali who were
sheltering in hotels and churches, the vast majority of them Tutsi … On 28 April, Oxfam [an international
charity] issued a press release stating that the pattern of systematic killing of the Tutsi amounted to
genocide … But another story now dominated the headlines: with thousands of people from eastern
Rwanda fleeing the RPF advance, this was the fastest exodus [mass movement] of people the world
had seen.

                         From War to Genocide. Criminal Politics in Rwanda, 1990–1994 (2017).

[Even the] Rwandan government’s … most eager defenders doubted that the war against the RPF could
be won … If defeat at the hands of the RPF could not be avoided, none of [the] Tutsi … should be left
to profit from their victory … Their primary objective was to exterminate the potential political base for
the RPF and its allies … From 12 April onward, government politicians linked their political futures to a
conclusion of the war through genocide and the elimination of Tutsi … For its part, the RPF’s repeated
refusals to negotiate fell in line with the government’s murderous strategy.

When the RPF finally agreed to engage in discussions between 22 April and 14 May 1994, it refused to
negotiate with the government’s representative. But there was no longer anything for the two sides to
negotiate, the RPF did not want to hear anything more about a ceasefire. This is exactly what Dallaire
confirmed in his message to the UN on 24 April, which summarized his conversation with Paul Kagame:
“He did not appear interested in a ceasefire. His forces were winning the war and were going to continue
fighting as long as they were winning.”
