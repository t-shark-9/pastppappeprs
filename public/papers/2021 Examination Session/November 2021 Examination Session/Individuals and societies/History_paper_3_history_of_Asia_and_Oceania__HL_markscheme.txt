Apply the markbands that provide the “best fit” to the responses given and award credit wherever it is
possible to do so. If an answer indicates that the demands of the question are understood and
addressed but that not all implications are considered (for example, compare or contrast; reasons
or significance; methods or success), then examiners should not be afraid of using the full range of
marks allowed for by the markscheme. Responses that offer good coverage of some of the criteria
should be rewarded accordingly.

Section 1: Trade and exchange: The Silk Road in the medieval world (750–1500)

1.   To what extent do you agree that merchants were more important than explorers in connecting
     West and East?

     The question requires that candidates consider the merits or otherwise of the statement that
     merchants were more important than explorers in connecting West and East. Candidates may offer
     equal coverage of the impact of explorers and merchants, or they may prioritize their assessment
     of one. However, both aspects will be a feature of the response. Candidates may refer to the
     extensive role of the merchants and the ways in which they took on the role of interpreters,
     craftsmen and horse breeders. They did not just trade goods, they were also the transmitters of
     religion, ideas and culture. Explorers used the Silk Road as a means to better understand the
     geography and culture of the East. The writings of explorers such as Marco Polo gave Europeans
     a better understanding of trade and commerce in the East, which encouraged more merchants to
     travel. Candidates may argue that although the merchants expanded the impact of the Silk Road, it
     was the explorers that initiated and then globalized the Silk Road. Candidates’ opinions or
     conclusions will be presented clearly and supported by appropriate evidence.


2.   “Environmental problems were the main cause of the decline of the Silk Road in the 15th century.”
     Discuss.

     The question requires that candidates offer a considered and balanced review of the statement
     that environmental problems were the main cause of the decline of the Silk Road in the 15th
     century. Candidates may discuss how environmental changes led to changes in the climate in East
     Asia. Dryer weather led to a loss of freshwater and vegetation and large areas of land along the
     Silk Road became infertile. These climatic changes prevented the merchants from travelling. Other
     relevant factors may be addressed but with a focus on the issue in the question. These could
     include the opening up of sea transportation, with the option to carry more goods cheaply and with
     less risk. Candidates may also discuss how the breaking up of the Mongol Empire loosened the
     political and cultural unity of the Silk Road. The impact of the Black Death may also be considered.
     Candidates’ opinions or conclusions will be presented clearly and supported by appropriate
     evidence.

Section 2: Japan in the Age of the Samurai (1180–1333)

3.   Discuss the reasons for the samurai’s increasing political influence under Minamoto.

     The question requires that candidates offer a considered and balanced review of the reasons for
     the samurai’s increasing political influence. Reasons may predate the timeframe, as candidates
     may argue that power was already shifting away from the emperor, but points made must be
     clearly linked to the question. Candidates may refer to Minamoto’s victory in the Gempei War and
     the establishment of the Kamakura Shogunate. The Shogunate was a hereditary military
     dictatorship and effectively gave all real power to the samurai. The power of the Minamoto clan
     depended on the samurai and consequently their social and political influence increased. Other
     relevant factors may be addressed, for example the growing influence of Buddhism in Japanese
     society. Buddhism, with its focus on honour and code also strengthened the status of the samurai.
     Candidates’ opinions or conclusions will be presented clearly and supported by appropriate
     evidence.


4.   Evaluate the impact on Japan of the invasions by the Yuan dynasty in the late 13th century.

     The question requires that candidates make an appraisal of the impact on Japan of the invasions
     by the Yuan dynasty. The impact on Japan may extend beyond the timeframe but must be clearly
     linked to the issue raised in the question. Candidates may refer to how the attacks initially
     demonstrated Japanese military weaknesses which forced the Japanese to increase their armies,
     develop new tactics and weaponry. It also led to the construction of large forts. Essentially, the
     Japanese government became more militaristic as the need to be able to defend themselves from
     outsiders became more apparent. Japan maintained its independence and this enabled them to
     dominate trade within the region. It also established a belief that they could never be beaten, a
     belief that would remain deeply embedded in Japanese culture. Candidates’ opinions or
     conclusions will be presented clearly and supported by appropriate evidence.

Section 3: Exploration, trade and interaction in East Asia and South-East Asia (1405–1700)

5.   Evaluate the impact of European exploration and early settlements on the region.

     The question requires that candidates make an appraisal of the impact of European exploration
     and early settlements on the region, weighing up the importance or otherwise of the impact.
     Candidates may refer to developments made in the region in areas such as transportation,
     communications, trade, medicine and education. Candidates may also evaluate the ways
     missionaries imposed their values and religion on the indigenous people of the region. European
     culture, behaviour and language was forced onto local populations. Natural resources were
     exploited and high taxation was often imposed on already poor communities. Localized resistance
     to the early European settlements began to grow and would eventually lead to the growth of the
     ideas of independence and nationalism. Candidates’ opinions or conclusions will be presented
     clearly and supported by appropriate evidence.


6.   “The adoption of isolationist policies had a negative impact on China.” Discuss.

     The question requires that candidates offer a considered and balanced review of the statement
     that the adoption of isolationist policies had a negative impact on China. The consequences of
     isolationism may extend beyond the timeframe, but they must be clearly linked to the issue raised
     in the question. Candidates may discuss the fact that Chinese military developments remained
     very limited and this would make them vulnerable to attacks in the future. China also made little
     advancement in areas of trade, industry and technology and their society remained feudal and
     agricultural. Traders, merchants and bankers were all seen as parasites. More positive effects of
     isolationism include Chinese culture and ideas being protected from outside influence, and China
     also experienced a long period of relative peace. Candidates’ opinions or conclusions will be
     presented clearly and supported by appropriate evidence.

Section 4: The rise and fall of the Mughal Empire (1526–1712)

7.   “Babur’s contribution to the rise of Mughal power was more important than Humayun’s.” To what
     extent do you agree with this statement?

     The question requires that candidates consider the merits or otherwise of the suggestion that
     Babur’s contribution to the rise of the Mughal Empire was more important than Humayun’s.
     Candidates may offer equal coverage of Babur and Humayun or they may prioritize their
     assessment of one of their contributions. However, both rulers will be discussed in the response.
     Candidates may refer to Babur’s military policies and successes in battles against Indian rulers
     with the use of artillery and gunpowder, his economic policies including taxation, which helped
     build the empire, as well as his political policies including his relationship with Indian rulers. The
     empire may not have existed but for his efforts. Humayun too laid the foundations for the new
     capital at Delhi. He had some initial military successes at Kalinjar and against Bahadur Shah of
     Gujarat but then was defeated by the Afghans under Sher Shah and lost his empire but eventually
     managed to regain it. Candidates’ opinions or conclusions will be presented clearly and supported
     by appropriate evidence.


8.   To what extent were Akbar’s social policies the most significant achievement of his rule?

     The question requires that candidates consider the merits or otherwise of the suggestion that
     Akbar’s social policies were the most significant achievement of his rule. Candidates may refer to
     Akbar’s non-discriminatory policy towards religious groups, including the removal of the jizya and
     other taxes. Scholars from many faiths were invited to the court. Many high-ranking officials in his
     court were non-Muslims. All subjects including women were treated equally. Art and literature were
     patronized and Sanskrit scientific works were translated into Persian. However, his creation of a
     new religion, Din-i-Ilahi, came under criticism. Other relevant factors may be addressed, for
     example Akbar’s political and economic policies, which helped unify the empire, but with a focus on
     the issue in the question. Candidates’ opinions or conclusions will be presented clearly and
     supported by appropriate evidence.

Section 5: Colonialism and the development of nationalism in South-East Asia (c1750–1914)

9.    Evaluate the reasons for the decline of the Dutch East India Company (VOC).

      The question requires that candidates make an appraisal of the reasons for the decline of the
      Dutch East India Company (VOC). Candidates may refer to how the VOC, from its creation in
      1602, was required to protect itself against native rulers who were held in economic bondage. The
      maintenance of a large army, a vast bureaucracy to administer and policing their possessions
      became a prime reason for the Company’s decline. Smuggling and private trade was being carried
      out from the most junior clerk to the governor-general. Rampant corruption led to declining profits
      and deficits. Other relevant factors may be evaluated, for example, the outdated mode of
      commercial operations and financial irregularities brought the company to bankruptcy. Competition
      in the spice trade came from the English and French and the Dutch even suffered a military defeat
      at the hands of the English in 1784. Candidates’ opinions or conclusions will be presented clearly
      and supported by appropriate evidence.


10.   “The main cause of the Philippine Revolution (1896) was the nature of Spanish rule.” Discuss.

      The question requires that candidates offer a considered and balanced review of the statement
      that the main cause of the Philippine Revolution (1896) was the nature of Spanish rule. Candidates
      may discuss the despotic and tyrannical rule by the Spanish colonial government, including their
      policies of divide and rule and the harsh suffering of the population due to commercial exploitation
      by the Spanish nobility. The clergy opposed Spanish dominance of the Filipino Catholic Church
      and expressed dismay at Spanish repression following the Cavite Revolt (1872), during which
      three priests became martyrs. Rizal campaigned extensively against corruption and oppression by
      Spanish officials. Spanish colonization brought uniformity, reformed educational policies, the
      printing press and modern means of communication. Candidates may argue that this led to a
      national awakening and liberalism. Candidates’ opinions or conclusions will be presented clearly
      and supported by appropriate evidence.

Section 6: India, Afghanistan and Burma (1750–1919)

11.   “The British had limited social and cultural impact in India up to 1857.” To what extent do you agree
      with this statement?

      The question requires that candidates consider the merits or otherwise of the statement that the
      British had limited social and cultural impact in India up to 1857. Both social and cultural impacts
      will be a feature of the response. Candidates may refer to how the British initially demonstrated
      social aloofness and racial arrogance towards the local populations, but after 1813, they began to
      transform Indian society. They promoted Western-style education and encouraged the printing
      press largely to help missionaries spread Christianity. After 1835, English was made the language
      of instruction. The Charter Acts of 1813 and 1833 introduced some limited social reforms by
      removing restrictions based on birth and religion. Under Lord Bentinck in the 1830s, the abolition of
      social customs such as sati and thugee were carried out, but overall, the impact remained limited.
      Modernization, when it was carried out, was largely to promote colonialism. Candidates’ opinions
      or conclusions will be presented clearly and supported by appropriate evidence.


12.   Evaluate the economic and social effects of the British colonial system in Burma.

      The question requires that candidates make an appraisal of the economic and social effects of the
      British colonial system on Burma. Candidates may offer equal coverage of social and economic
      effects, or they may prioritize their evaluation of one of them. However, both aspects will be a
      feature of the response. Candidates may argue that the colonial period was a time of relative civil
      order during which the Burmese economy and infrastructure developed rapidly. Agriculture, and in
      particular rice production, increased dramatically. Railways and roads were also built. There was
      industrial development with the expansion of ruby mines and extraction of petroleum. However,
      candidates may argue that these developments only benefited the British, especially as cheap
      Indian labour was often used to replace Burmese farmers and workers. Candidates may evaluate
      the impact of colonialism on the structures within Burmese society. The Burmese monarchy was
      dismantled in 1885 and King Thibaw was sent into exile. The demise of the monarchy also led to a
      decline in the role and influence of Buddhist monks within Burmese society. This was particularly
      visible in the educational system which now became secular and controlled by the missionaries.
      Candidates’ opinions or conclusions will be presented clearly and supported by appropriate
      evidence.

Section 7: Challenges to traditional East Asian societies (1700–1868)

13.   Discuss the causes and effects of the White Lotus Rebellion.

      The question requires that candidates offer a considered and balanced review of the causes and
      effects of the White Lotus Rebellion. Candidates may discuss the nature of the White Lotus
      Society. It began as a secret religious society that opposed the rule of the Manchus, whom they
      regarded as outsiders. When the Qing eventually put down the rebellion, they claimed that the
      movement had merely been a response to corrupt local officials rather than an anti-Qing
      movement. The main causes of the White Lotus Rebellion were economic, famine, overcrowded
      conditions and heavy taxation being the main reasons. The movement promised the people that
      Buddha would return and bring an end to their suffering. The rebellion lasted nine years, with Qing
      officials struggling to put down the rebels due to their inability to detect them. The rebels effectively
      used guerrilla tactics, but this led to harsh reprisals towards the Chinese people. Eventually, the
      rebellion was put down, but it highlighted the weakness of the Qing dynasty and, in particular, their
      military strength. Candidates may argue that the exposure of this weakness contributed to the
      outbreak of future rebellions. Candidates’ opinions or conclusions will be presented clearly and
      supported by appropriate evidence.


14.   To what extent were economic factors the main reason for discontent with the Tokugawa
      Shogunate’s rule in Japan?

      The question requires that candidates consider the merits or otherwise of the suggestion that
      economic factors were the main reason for discontent with the Tokugawa Shogunate’s rule in
      Japan. Candidates may refer to economic hardships the people faced, as the Shoguns had
      reimposed centralized feudalism with peasants paying high taxes. The merchants were at the
      bottom of the social ladder; their wealth failing to get them political rights. Daimyo and samurai,
      who stood at the top of Japan's social hierarchy, were financially strained because they relied on
      land for wealth. Other relevant factors may be addressed, for example the forced opening of Japan
      following US Commodore Matthew Perry's arrival in 1853 and political corruption which also
      contributed to the collapse of the Tokugawa rule, but the focus should be on the issue in the
      question. Candidates’ opinions or conclusions will be presented clearly and supported by
      appropriate evidence.

Section 8: British colonialism and emerging national identities in Oceania (1788–1919)

15.   “The Treaty of Waitangi (1840) successfully resolved all issues between the settlers and the
      indigenous peoples.” Discuss.

      The question requires that candidates offer a considered and balanced review of the statement
      that the Treaty of Waitangi successfully resolved all issues between the settlers and the indigenous
      peoples. Candidates may discuss the ways in which the treaty appeared to protect Maori rights
      with regards to land. Maori land and property were recognized and land had to be bought officially
      by the crown. However, as Maori communities became more aware of their legal rights regarding
      the purchase of land, they became more reluctant to sell, which in turn led to the methods used to
      acquire Maori land becoming more aggressive. Candidates may also argue that the treaty only
      addressed issues of land and did not consider other issues between settlers and indigenous
      peoples, such as political representation. Other relevant factors may be discussed, for example
      that different interpretations of the treaty made it difficult to determine its impact. Candidates’
      opinions or conclusions will be presented clearly and supported by appropriate evidence.


16.   To what extent do you agree that the gold rushes had a positive impact on the development of
      either Australia or New Zealand?

      The question requires that candidates consider the merits or otherwise of the suggestion that the
      gold rushes had a positive impact on the development of either Australia or New Zealand.
      Candidates may refer to the ways in which the gold rushes led to increased migration to
      Australia/New Zealand by Asians, Europeans and Americans. This in turn led to the rapid
      development of towns throughout both countries. The creation of towns led to developments in
      infrastructure such as transportation and communication. The creation of these communities also
      saw the beginnings of a shared identity. More negative aspects of the gold rushes may include a
      discussion of the increase in racial tensions and rising crime rates. The negative impact of the gold
      rushes and creation of towns on the indigenous populations may also be addressed. Candidates’
      opinions or conclusions will be presented clearly and supported by appropriate evidence.

Section 9: Early modernization and imperial decline in East Asia (1860–1912)

17.   “Social developments were more significant than economic developments in Meiji Japan.” Discuss.

      The question requires that candidates offer a considered and balanced review of the statement
      that social developments were more significant than economic developments in Meiji Japan.
      Candidates may offer equal coverage of social and economic developments, or they may prioritize
      their discussion of one of them. Candidates may discuss significant changes such as the loss of
      class privileges for feudal lords and samurai. Having lost their status in society, many established
      major corporate conglomerates and these zaibatsu had significant control over Japan’s economy.
      Candidates may therefore argue that this social change was not as significant as it initially
      appeared, as lords and samurai continued to hold power and prestige in Meiji Japan. Candidates
      may discuss the changes in education. Universal education was introduced in 1872, which was
      influenced by Western ideas and theories. However, in 1890, Meiji issued the Imperial Rescript on
      Education, which reinforced the ideas of Confucianism and Shintoism, demonstrating that the initial
      developments in education were not particularly significant. Economic developments, such as the
      development of transportation and communication systems, led to the rapid industrialization of
      Japan. Candidates may argue that social developments were often rather superficial and that
      fundamentally Japan’s society did not change. However, its economic developments led to the
      emergence of a powerful modern nation and this contributed to the rise of nationalism and
      militarism as Japan would seek to establish its own empire.


18.   “Peasant discontent was the main cause of the Tonghak Rebellion.” To what extent do you agree
      with this statement?

      The question requires that candidates consider the merits or otherwise of the statement that
      peasant discontent was the main cause of the Tonghak Rebellion. Candidates may refer to the
      social and economic conditions faced by the peasantry. The peasants were angry about the harsh
      taxation they endured and the high levels of corruption amongst officials. The conduct of Jo
      Byeonggap was an immediate cause of the rebellion. He had implemented a series of oppressive
      laws against the peasantry and forced them to build reservoirs and settle in unowned lands in
      order to get rich from taxes. A growing Japanese influence in Korea also angered the peasants.
      Cheap Japanese food products threatened their traditional farming economy and loans from
      Japanese farmers left many peasants in a desperate state. The followers of Tonghak wanted to
      improve peasants’ conditions by reducing taxes, punishing corrupt officials and promoting
      education and social justice. Candidates may challenge the assumption in the question and
      suggest it was in fact a religious and political movement. While the majority of the rebel army were
      peasants, the leaders of the movement were not. The leaders were followers of Tonghak, which
      was a mix of Buddhism, Confucianism, Taoism and Christianity. This religion (Cheondoism)
      promoted human equality, which threatened Korea’s feudal system. The leaders wanted an end to
      all foreign influence in Korea and they intended to dispose of Queen Min and her family.
      Candidates’ opinions or conclusions will be presented clearly and supported by appropriate
      evidence.

Section 10: Nationalism and independence in India (1919–1964)

19.   To what extent was the Simon Commission (1928) the most significant factor in the development of
      Indian nationalism between 1919 and 1935?

      The question requires that candidates consider the merits or otherwise of the statement that the
      Simon Commission was the most significant factor in the development of Indian nationalism
      between 1919 and 1935. The Simon Commission was established to report on the workings of the
      Indian constitution established by the 1919 Government of India Act. The commission was initially
      welcomed as it was perceived as the next step to self-governance, but the exclusion of Indians
      from the commission led to protests in every city that the commission visited. Candidates may
      argue that this protest against the commission helped to develop Indian nationalism, as it was later
      acknowledged by the British that Indian opinions would be included in any future discussions. The
      Simon Commission proposed provincial autonomy and its key outcome was the Government of
      India Act 1935. Candidates may argue that this both helped and hindered Indian nationalism, as it
      advocated representative government at provincial level but not nationally. Other relevant factors
      may be discussed, for example the impact of the First World War, the Amritsar Massacre or the
      Round Table Conferences. Candidates’ opinions or conclusions will be presented clearly and
      supported by appropriate evidence.


20.   “The Second World War was the main reason for the weakening of British power in India.” Discuss
      with reference to the period from 1939 to 1947.

      The question requires that candidates offer a considered and balanced review of the statement
      that the Second World War was the main reason for the weakening of British power in India. Post
      war there was a strong consensus that the time of empires was over and that countries must be
      given their independence. This was demonstrated in the signing of the Atlantic Charter, which
      made decolonization a goal at the end of the Second World War. Candidates may also discuss
      economic factors, in particular high inflation which had been caused by the British protecting their
      own currency during the war at the expense of India’s. Candidates may also argue that the war
      had weakened Britain and she was no longer in a position to maintain a large empire. Candidates
      may challenge the question and suggest that there were other more significant factors. They may
      discuss Gandhi’s effective leadership of the Quit India campaign. This campaign, combined with
      the formation of Indian-led provincial governments, had led to a growing belief amongst Indians
      that they could rule themselves. Candidates’ opinions or conclusions will be presented clearly and
      supported by appropriate evidence.

Section 11: Japan (1912–1990)

21.   “Taisho democracy had more successes than failures.” Discuss with reference to the period from
      1912 to 1926.

      The question requires that candidates offer a considered and balanced review of the statement
      that Taisho democracy had more successes than failures. Discussion may extend beyond the time
      frame as the legacy of Taisho can be seen up to 1929, but points made must be clearly linked to
      the question. Candidates may discuss successes such as the introduction of male suffrage in 1925
      and the appointment of Hara Takashi (a commoner) as Prime Minister. Japan’s involvement in
      international agreements and involvement in the League of Nations suggest that Japan was in a
      more democratic phase. Cultural developments in Japan throughout the 1920s demonstrated the
      growth of liberalism, although candidates may argue that this was mainly limited to the urban
      middle classes. Candidates may discuss more negative aspects such as the 21 Demands and the
      Siberian Expedition as evidence that Japan was already pursuing a militarism as early as 1915.
      Other failures may include the introduction of the Peace Preservation Law and the establishment of
      the tokko (the thought police) which closely monitored, and restricted, the activities of socialists
      and communists. The assassination of Prime Minister Hara in 1921 is further evidence that anti-
      democratic forces were present in Japan. Candidates’ opinions or conclusions will be presented
      clearly and supported by appropriate evidence.


22.   To what extent do you agree that the US embargo was the main factor that led to Japan’s decision
      to attack Pearl Harbor?

      The question requires that candidates consider the merits or otherwise of the suggestion that the
      US embargo was the main factor that led to Japan’s decision to attack Pearl Harbor. Candidates
      may refer to the impact of the US embargo on Japan. It led to drastic oil shortages for Japan and
      they would be forced to retreat from China if unable to find new sources of oil. The embargo also
      demonstrated that the US was Japan’s greatest threat in the Pacific and that they would need to
      eliminate this threat to implement their military plans. Other relevant factors may be addressed, for
      example Japan’s announcement of the Great East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere in 1940 which made
      clear Japan’s plans for its dominance of the region. Other factors may include the military problems
      facing Japan in China, long-term resentment towards the US for their immigration policies and the
      Washington Treaties. Candidates may also argue that Japan had been getting more militaristic
      throughout the 1930s with military coups, assassinations, events in Manchuria and alliances with
      Nazi Germany and Fascist Italy. Candidates’ opinions or conclusions will be presented clearly and
      supported by appropriate evidence.

Section 12: China and Korea (1910–1950)

23.   Discuss the impact of Yuan Shikai’s actions on the rise of national identity in China.

      The question requires that candidates offer a considered and balanced review of the impact of
      Yuan Shikai’s actions on the rise of national identity in China. Candidates may discuss the ways in
      which the nature of Yuan’s leadership ended all hopes of democratic government. Yuan dismissed
      the Guomindang, closed the national assembly and tried to recreate a monarchy. Yuan’s style of
      leadership was corrupt, inept and brutal. Yuan had opponents killed and his government became
      more militaristic. In response to this oppressive regime the New Culture Movement was formed in
      1915 which promoted modernization and nationalism. The New Culture Movement evolved into the
      May Fourth Movement from 1919, which saw mass patriotic demonstrations and boycotts on
      foreign goods and services. Yuan’s death led to a period of warlordism, which saw more
      factionalism in China but would also be the motivation for the creation of the First United Front and
      the Northern Expedition, which saw China finally united. Candidates’ opinions or conclusions will
      be presented clearly and supported by appropriate evidence.


24.   Evaluate the impact of the Sino-Japanese War on the Guomindang (GMD) and the Chinese
      Communist Party (CCP).

      The question requires that candidates make an appraisal of the impact of the Sino-Japanese War
      on the GMD and the CCP. Candidates may offer equal coverage of the GMD and the CCP, or they
      may prioritize their evaluation of one. However, both aspects will be a feature of the response.
      Candidates may refer to the truce and the formation of the Second United Front, which candidates
      may evaluate gave the CCP some breathing space and enabled their survival. The fact that it was
      the CCP that had demanded the truce also led to them being perceived by the Chinese people as
      the true nationalists. Jiang Jieshi and the GMD also became allies of the West and received vast
      sums of money from the US, which continued into the civil war years. In military terms, the GMD
      faced the brunt of the fighting in the war and faced much higher casualties. In contrast, the CCP
      adopted guerrilla tactics so had far fewer casualties which left the CCP in a stronger position to
      take on the GMD in 1945. Military tactics adopted by the GMD during the conflict, such as “trading
      space for time” were perceived as an abandonment of the people by the GMD. Candidates’
      opinions or conclusions will be presented clearly and supported by appropriate evidence.

Section 13: Impact of the Second World War on South-East Asia

25.   Discuss the reasons for the initial Japanese victories in South-East Asia (1940–1942).

      The question requires that candidates offer a considered and balanced review of the reasons for
      the initial Japanese victories in South-East Asia (1940–1942). Candidates may discuss the nature
      and scale of the Japanese military. Its size, high levels of discipline, modern technologies and
      experience gained in the war with China put Japan in a strong position. Japan’s military plans, the
      “Southern Plan” and the “Eastern Plan” show that the Japanese military had clear strategic
      objectives. Japan also benefited from its alliance with Germany. The Tripartite Pact essentially
      handed control of French and Dutch colonies in South-East Asia to Japan. Candidates may argue
      that local populations initially saw the Japanese as a means of gaining independence and Japan’s
      slogan “Asia for the Asians” made many believe that Japanese rule would be preferential to
      European. Candidates may also discuss the weaknesses of the Allied powers in the region and the
      fact that they were preoccupied with events in Europe. Candidates’ opinions or conclusions will be
      presented clearly and supported by appropriate evidence.


26.   “Ho Chi Minh’s resistance against Japanese occupation was the main reason for the emergence of
      an effective Vietnamese independence movement.” Discuss.

      The question requires that candidates offer a considered and balanced review of the statement
      that Ho Chi Minh’s resistance against Japanese occupation was the main reason for the
      emergence of an effective independence movement. Candidates may refer to Ho Chi Minh’s
      creation of an independence/nationalist movement that had gained some limited support after the
      First World War. Candidates may argue that it was the repressive and cruel nature of Japanese
      occupation of Vietnam which led to increased support for this independence movement. In 1941,
      Ho Chi Minh returned to Vietnam and his guerrilla force of 10 000 led many successful attacks
      against Vichy French and Japanese authorities. Ho Chi Minh was even given money from the US
      to build up his movement. Other relevant factors may be addressed, for example long term
      resentment towards French colonial rule or the disappointment felt that the Treaty of Versailles
      concept of self-determination had not included them. Candidates may also argue that Ho Chi
      Minh’s promise of a fairer society and land redistribution appealed to the Vietnamese peasantry.
      Candidates’ opinions or conclusions will be presented clearly and supported by appropriate
      evidence.

Section 14: The People’s Republic of China (1949–2005)

27.   To what extent had Mao Zedong consolidated his rule in China by 1961?

      The question requires that candidates consider the merits or otherwise of the suggestion that Mao
      Zedong consolidated his rule in China by 1961. This is a broad question and candidates may
      choose from a wide variety of social, political and economic factors as supporting evidence.
      Candidates may refer to the political campaigns which enabled Mao to silence his opponents.
      These could include the Speak Bitterness, the Four Antis and the Hundred Flowers Campaign.
      They may also argue that Mao increased his political control by centralizing power, bringing
      autonomous regions directly under his control and using the PLA to achieve this. Candidates may
      also argue that his social and economic policies, including the Marriage Law, Land Reform and the
      First Five Year Plan, consolidated his control by increasing support for himself and the party.
      Candidates may challenge the assumption in the question that Mao had consolidated his power
      and argue that the Hundred Flowers Campaign and the aftermath of the Great Leap Forward are
      evidence of how vulnerable his position still was within the party. Tibetan and Islam insurgencies in
      the 1950s also demonstrated Mao did not have full control. Candidates’ opinions or conclusions
      will be presented clearly and supported by appropriate evidence.


28.   “The economic policies of Deng Xiaoping were mainly successful.” To what extent do you agree
      with this statement?

      The question requires that candidates consider the merits or otherwise of the statement that he
      economic policies of Deng Xiaoping were mainly successful. Points made may predate the
      timeframe, but they must be clearly linked to the issue raised in the question. Candidates may refer
      to the successes of the Four Modernizations and argue that Deng was responsible for an industrial
      revolution in China. Candidates may argue that Deng’s reforms were a complete reversal from the
      Maoist policy of self-reliance to increasing foreign trade. He did this through the creation of the
      Special Economic Zones, which saw increased foreign investment and rapid economic growth.
      Deng’s reforms also shifted the focus from heavy industry (under Mao) to light industry and export-
      led growth. Candidates may argue that there were also elements of failure. High levels of
      unemployment continued to be a major issue in many parts of China and living and working
      conditions remained low. The devastating environmental impacts of these economic developments
      may also be discussed. Candidates’ opinions or conclusions will be presented clearly and
      supported by appropriate evidence.

Section 15: Cold War conflicts in Asia

29.   Evaluate the political and economic impact of the Vietnam War on Vietnam after 1975.

      The question requires that candidates make an appraisal of the political and economic impact of
      the Vietnam War on Vietnam after 1975, weighing up the importance or otherwise of the impacts.
      Candidates may identify the scale of the impact of this war on Vietnam and the fact that war did not
      bring peace or guaranteed independence to Vietnam. After fighting the Americans, the Vietnamese
      then had to fight wars against the Khmer Rouge (1978) and China (1979) before their
      independence was secured. The main political impact of the Vietnam War was the political
      unification of the country under communist rule. This led to the mass migration in 1975 of 140 000
      South Vietnamese political leaders, army officers and skilled professionals who feared reprisals for
      supporting the US during the war. Hundreds of thousands of South Vietnamese were put into
      camps by the new regime and many were not released until the late 1980s. The economic effects
      of the Vietnam War were devastating and Vietnam would take decades to recover. Most of its
      population were unemployed, two million had died and millions were displaced. Vietnam’s
      infrastructure was destroyed, making transportation and communication difficult; Vietnam also
      faced embargos for decades as a result of the war. Candidates may also discuss the impact of
      chemical warfare on Vietnam. Vast areas of land, particularly in central Vietnam, were left
      uninhabitable and thousands of people were left unable to work and to provide for themselves due
      to war injuries.


30.   Evaluate the impact of the withdrawal of Soviet troops on Afghanistan.

      The question requires that candidates make an appraisal of the impact of the withdrawal of Soviet
      troops on Afghanistan, weighing up the strengths and limitations of the impact. Though the Soviet
      troop presence in Afghanistan ended in February 1989, large-scale Soviet military and economic
      assistance to its Marxist proteges there continued enabling an unpopular regime under Najibullah
      to remain in power in Afghanistan for over three years. Participation of all political parties in
      government was permitted, and Afghanistan's Islamic identity was reaffirmed. The Afghan Marxist
      regime collapsed in 1992, largely due to the actions of the Pakistani-backed Pushtun mujahideen.
      Candidates may evaluate how Afghanistan was plunged into a civil war causing great destruction.
      Disagreements and infighting between Massoud and Hekmatyar set the stage for the eventual rise
      of the Taliban. Candidates’ opinions or conclusions will be presented clearly and supported by
      appropriate evidence.

Section 16: Developments and challenges in South Asia after 1947

31.   Compare and contrast the domestic policies of Indira Gandhi and Rajiv Gandhi.

      The question requires that candidates give an account of the similarities and differences between
      the domestic policies of Indira Gandhi and Rajiv Gandhi, referring to both throughout. There does
      not need to be an equal number of points on each. Candidates may refer to the economic policies
      where both followed five-year plans, but Indira Gandhi’s socialist economy contrasted with Rajiv
      Gandhi’s effort to liberalize the economy and to cut down wealth taxes. He introduced measures to
      significantly reduce the Licence Raj after 1990. They both faced problems from Punjab. Indira
      tended to use forceful methods such as forced sterilization and the declaration of an emergency,
      whereas Rajiv attempted to work through more peaceful means such as the signing of the Assam
      accord. Candidates’ opinions or conclusions will be presented clearly and supported by appropriate
      evidence.


32.   “Political inequality was the main reason for tension between East and West Pakistan.” To what
      extent do you agree with this statement?

      The question requires that candidates consider the merits or otherwise of the statement that
      political inequality was the main reason for tension between East and West Pakistan. Candidates
      may refer to the weakness of parliamentary democracy with elections being a farce and very few
      Bengalis represented in the parliament or the military. Even in their own province, all the key posts
      in administration were held by West Pakistanis. The “one man one vote” demand of the Awami
      league led by Sheikh Mujib was not accepted. Other relevant factors may be addressed, for
      example economic colonization and exploitation of East Pakistan by West Pakistan with jute and
      other raw materials being bought at cheap prices. The per capita income was much higher in East
      Pakistan. There were cultural differences also, for example Bengali not Urdu being the main
      language in East Pakistan. Candidates’ opinions or conclusions will be presented clearly and
      supported by appropriate evidence.

Section 17: Developments in Oceania after the Second World War (1945–2005)

33.   To what extent was the changing role of women the most significant social development in either
      Australia or New Zealand between 1945 and 2005?

      The question requires that candidates consider the merits or otherwise of the suggestion that the
      changing role of women was the most significant social development in either Australia or New
      Zealand. Candidates may refer to the increased number of women involved in politics, in New
      Zealand for example, two female Prime Ministers have served in this time period and in Australia
      the Women’s Electoral Lobby was established. Candidates may also discuss women’s
      employment opportunities. Both Australia (1969) and New Zealand (1972) passed Equal Pay Acts
      to protect women’s rights in the workplace. A feminist movement also grew in both countries that
      challenged the traditional view of a woman’s role in society. Candidates may also challenge the
      assumption in the question and suggest that other factors, such as indigenous rights and
      immigration, were a greater significant development. However, the changing role of women must
      remain a key part of the response. Candidates’ opinions or conclusions will be presented clearly
      and supported by appropriate evidence.


34.   “The Bolger government was a complete failure.” Discuss.

      The question requires that candidates offer a considered and balanced review of the statement
      that the Bolger government was more of a failure than a success. Candidates may discuss the
      economic problems experienced by New Zealand at the time Bolger came to power. The Bolger
      government had to bail out the Bank of New Zealand by borrowing nearly a billion dollars. To
      stabilize the economy, Bolger dramatically cut public spending in the areas of education, welfare
      and hospitals. Candidates may argue these cuts were essential due to the economic situation. The
      Employment Contracts Act (ECA) made union membership voluntary, which led to significantly
      reduced union membership. The Building Act of 1991, which led to more self-regulations in the
      building trade, is often regarded as the cause of the Leaky Homes Crisis which cost the New
      Zealand government billions of dollars. At this time there were discussions of New Zealand
      becoming a republic. Some ties with the British crown were broken, for example ending the
      honours system. Candidates’ opinions or conclusions will be presented clearly and supported by
      appropriate evidence.

Section 18: Social, cultural and economic developments in Asia (excluding China, Japan
            and India) (1980–2005)

35.   “Technology had transformed society by 2005.” Discuss with reference to two Asian countries
      (excluding China, Japan and India).

      The question requires that candidates offer a considered and balanced review of the statement
      that technology had transformed society by 2005, with reference to two countries. Candidates may
      refer to computing and communication technologies significantly transforming most countries in the
      region. A key development was the mass production and widespread use of computers and
      cellular phones. Without the World Wide Web, globalization would not have occurred to the extent
      it has, transforming the way individuals and companies interact with each other. The ability to
      share information on a global scale has also had political consequences as it presented new
      opportunities for communication and information sharing in countries where this had previously
      been difficult. Technology had transformed education, medicine, sport and the arts. While many of
      the results identified are likely to be positive in nature, candidates may also consider the problems
      brought about by these new technologies, such as addiction, isolation from society, cyber-bullying
      and the lack of exercise amongst children. Candidates’ opinions or conclusions will be presented
      clearly and supported by appropriate evidence.


36.   Evaluate the responses to terrorism in two Asian countries (excluding China, Japan and India).

      The question requires that candidates make an appraisal of the responses to terrorism in two
      Asian countries (excluding China, Japan and India) weighing up the strengths and limitations of the
      responses. Responses may extend beyond the timeframe, but they must be clearly linked to the
      issue raised in the question. Candidates may offer equal coverage of two countries or they may
      prioritize their evaluation of one of them. However, both countries will be a feature of the response.
      Candidates may evaluate the support from Western nations to combat terrorist threats, direct
      confrontation with groups which may have resulted in ceasefire agreements between governments
      and terrorist groups. Both offensive and defensive responses offer some benefits to those
      subjected to terrorism but could pose risks to the populace too. Counter-terrorism measures,
      unilateral and collective action may also be evaluated. Candidates’ opinions or conclusions will be
      presented clearly and supported by appropriate evidence.
