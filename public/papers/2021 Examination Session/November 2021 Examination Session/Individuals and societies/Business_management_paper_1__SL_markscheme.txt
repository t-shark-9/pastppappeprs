                                              Section A

1.   (a)       With reference to MM, describe two features of a merger (lines 20–22).                    [4]

               Answers could include:
                Two or more businesses join together (Chilmin and MM in this case)
                The result is another single business, in this case retaining the name Megamin
                 Mining
                The Directors made up of people from both businesses (in this case the two
                 great grandchildren and three Chilean shareholders and two workers’
                 representatives
                Generally mergers are friendly (in this case it was by agreement)
                This type of expansion occurs when two businesses become integrated by
                 joining together and forming a bigger combined business. The owners of two
                 businesses agree to join their firms together to make one business
                They can take advantage of synergies.

               Accept any other reasonable description
               Award [1] for each feature up to a total of [2]
               Award [1] for putting the feature into context up to a total of [2]

     (b)       Explain the strategies used by MM to achieve sustainability.                              [6]


               Sustainability has three dimensions: environmental (ecological) sustainability,
               social sustainability and economic sustainability.

               Environmental sustainability

               Most of MM’s strategies are concerned with environmental sustainability and
               include:
                Carbon offsetting
                Supporting research to reduce use of harmful emissions
                Reviewing MM’s own practices to get more energy efficient production
                  methods
                Improved targets
                New environmental policies
                Switching to lithium for electric cars

               Social sustainability

                    “MM is reducing its operations in Alberta in response to Canadian concerns
                     about the impact of the industry on First Nations (indigenous) peoples” (lines
                     60-61)
                    Fairness of working conditions and other employment practices in different
                     countries (incl. safety and pay issues in Egypt): no clear strategy in place,
                     however “MM ’s board is concerned”

     Economic sustainability

                  To achieve economic sustainability, MM diversified a lot over the years (e.g. when they
                   invested and expanded into property esp. the hotel division)
                  Regarding the current problems with the hotel division (which does not seem economically
                   sustainable) MM is “conducting primary market research to help identify methods to
                   increase hotel bookings” (line 81).
                                          –6–                N21/3/BUSMT/SP1/ENG/TZ0/XX/M


    Regarding the Egyptian mine (which is operating at a loss, which is not economically
     sustainable) MM does not have any strategy in place yet, but “is exploring ways in which it
     could reduce its costs” (line 107).




    Accept any other reasonable point about MM’s sustainability strategies.
    Explanation/analysis should come from discussing these in relation to the
    situation that MM is in.

    Marks should be awarded according to the mark bands on page 3.
    Award maximum 2 marks for only explaining one strategy.
    Award maximum 3 marks for a theoretical answer or an answer that describes
    two (or more) strategies without explaining them.
    Award maximum 5 marks if the explanation of two strategies or more is mainly
    descriptive but in context.
                                                  –7–                N21/3/BUSMT/SP1/ENG/TZ0/XX/M


2.   (a)   Describe one advantage and one disadvantage for MM of decentralization
           (lines 44–45).                                                                       [4]

           Decentralization: Some decision making is delegated to lower level managers –
           in this case to subsidiary businesses

           Advantages
            Decision making delegated to the mines (operations, wages, contracts) and
             hotels (prices and menus)
            Not all decisions will be decentralized (in this case strategic decisions remain
             with the Board).
            Better focus on core activities
            Better understanding of local issues (hotels are in Europe which might face
             completely different problems from mines in Africa).

           Disadvantages
            Decision-making is not necessarily strategic as hotel managers and managers
              at mines are not part of higher- level decision-making process at board level
            More difficult to ensure consistent practices and policies across different
              locations. Hotel customers may prefer consistency.
            More difficult to achieve financial control if individual managers have more
              budgetary autonomy
            As contexts and needs are different, some conflicts may arise or may lead to
              inter-divisional rivalry if divisions compare each other, when making decisions
              on budgets, wages, employment, contracts, etc. (i.e. wages in Canada vs. in
              Africa)

           Accept any other reasonable advantage/disadvantage
           Award [1] for each advantage and one mark for each disadvantage up to a total
           of [2]
           Award [1] for putting each advantage and [1] for putting each disadvantage into
           context up to a total of [2]

     (b)   Explain how MM could reduce stakeholder conflict in relation to its gold mine in
           Egypt. (lines 103–107)                                                               [6]

           Stakeholder issues can include:
            Managers: Technical problems, safety issues, risk of flooding. These will be
              difficult to manage, and will have conflict with which employees who are
              threatening strikes. Costs will then have an impact on shareholders through
              lower prices.
            Employees: Threatening strikes over pay and other issues with the way mines
              are managed. Will want spending conflicts with owners/managers
            Shareholders: Will want dividends maintained but mine producing below
              breakeven and this affects profits. Will want costs reduced, profit increased.
              Will not want safety issues to get out of hand – bad publicity and impact on
              share price. High dividends may prevent investments, may put pressure on
              wages. Conflict with managers/employees.
            Other stakeholders may include government (taxes, licenses), the general
              public, pressure groups but these do not feature much in gold mines so are
              non-contextual.
            Resolution of conflict: Safety is important to all – should be resolved with
              managed costs
            Strikes are damaging to shareholders. Employees will lose pay. So
              communicate and work towards a solution
            Managers need to create a less combative environment and find satisfactory
              ways of reducing costs and solving problems without upsetting employees.
                                       –8–                  N21/3/BUSMT/SP1/ENG/TZ0/XX/M


Some possible solutions could be:
 Identify technical problems in advance and improve processes;
 think of a maintenance plan to prevent production outages;
 invest more in industrial safety (but this will increase costs – possible conflict
  managers vs. shareholders?);
 improve employees´ motivation and job satisfaction, focusing on employees´
  needs or maybe adopting a reward programme and/or health insurance (this
  will increase costs: will shareholders be happy with that?);
 find a way to improve sales (look for new markets, segments, etc.), reduce
  costs or/and add value to their products in order to increase profits.

The use of stakeholders might be implied especially when referring to ‘conflict
with the business’. In this case the ‘business’ might mean managers,
shareholders or owners if the candidate makes this clear without using any of
those terms.

Accept any other reasonable explanation/application of stakeholder conflict
Marks should be awarded according to the mark bands on page 4.

3.   (a)   Describe two differences for MM between marketing its minerals (a product) and
           marketing its hotels (a service).                                                     [4]

           Marketing minerals
            B2B so advertising may not be necessary
            Role of promotion unclear
            Based on contracts
            Based on market prices
            Targeted at other industries
            Long-term contracts

           Marketing hotels:
            B2C so essential to promote
            Some promotion has not worked (ads in travel mags, price promotion)
            Customers are general public
            Market competitive but relatively stable. Fierce competition from Homehol/Airbnb.

           Accept any other reasonable difference
           Award [1] for each difference up to a total of [2]
           Award [1] for putting the difference into context up to a total of [2]

     (b)   Explain strategies MM could use to improve cash flow in its palladium mine in
           South Africa. (Table 1)                                                               [6]

            Delay spending on major improvements – one month delay will improve Q2
             cash flow but will make Q3 worse
            Reduce credit terms on sales. These are on 2 months credit which is quite a
             long time. What is industry norm
            Get a short-term loan – however this impacts on the profits/liquidity/gearing
             and does not solve the problem
            Wages are not suitable for change, nor, probably are other costs
            Investigate ways to spread out maintenance costs or reduce them. Different
             credit terms?
            Incentivize early invoice payment;
            Renegotiate credit options if possible and delay vendor payments as long as
             possible; (e.g. credit terms are currently 60 days—could be reduced to 30
             days)
            Consider invoice factoring;

           Explanation should come from how relevant the strategies are.

           Marks should be awarded according to the mark bands on page 3.

           Award maximum 2 marks for only explaining one strategy.
           Award maximum 3 marks for a theoretical answer or an answer that describes.
           two (or more) strategies without explaining them.
           Award maximum 5 marks if the answer is mainly descriptive but in context.

     (c)   Explain one advantage and one disadvantage for MM of using convenience
           sampling for its market research.                                                              [4]

           Advantage:
            Easy to identify: hotel guests, who know about the hotel and its problems
                                            – 11 –              N21/3/BUSMT/SP1/ENG/TZ0/XX/M


       Does not involve people not interested in MM’s hotels
       Cheap to administer
       It can be used to intervene to satisfy dissatisfied customers

      Disadvantage
       Does not sample potential hotel customers
       Not random so there could be bias– existing customers may have different
         views than the general population

      Award [1] for each advantage/disadvantage up to a total of [2]
      Award [1] for putting each advantage/disadvantage into context up to a total of
      [2]

(d)   Using the case study and additional information from Section B, recommend
      whether MM should choose Option 1 or Option 2.                                    [10]

      Arguments for Option 1
       Australian government is keen – license might be straightforward
       Higher ARR
       Cost spread over several years
       MM in complete control – make all the decisions
       Net returns suggest more after year 5. How long does the mine last?
       Chinese have trade deals with Australia for minerals
       Organic (internal) growth, so safer and less risky than external growth

      Arguments for Option 2
       Lower investment ($40m, total cost $80m versus $100m)
       Equal ownership so equal say – not dominated by CL. Joint management –
         CL will have expertise
       Existing mine so problems sorted
       CL will benefit so chances of a symbiotic relationship
       But: Lower ARR, opposition
       Less time to complete/develop (6 months compared to 3 years)
       External growth, so faster than internal growth

      Recommendation needed. But rewardable only if supported by analysis.
      Accept reasonable alternative answers
      Marks should be allocated according to the mark bands on page 4
      Award a maximum of [4] for a purely theoretical answer or with no effective use
      of case (eg only repeating case material without development.)
      Award a maximum of [5] if only one option is considered.
      Award a maximum of [8] if both options are considered and there is good use of
      data but there are no significant judgements.
