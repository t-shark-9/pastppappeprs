Microeconomics

1.   (a)       Explain why merit goods tend to be under-provided in a free market.               [10]

               Answers may include:
               • definitions of market, merit goods
               • diagram showing positive externalities in the consumption of a merit good
               • an explanation that consumers do not take external benefits into account
                 when deciding how much to demand, resulting in producers allocating
                 insufficient resources to the production of merit goods in a free market
               • examples of merit goods.

4.   (a)       Explain how a better trained and educated labour force might affect
               economic growth.                                                                  [10]

               Answers may include:
               • definition of economic growth, labour (force)
               • AD/AS diagram with LRAS shifting to the right or PPC diagram with the
                 production possibilities curve shifting to the right
               • an explanation of how improved education and training might lead to
                 increasing productivity and hence economic growth
               • examples of countries where improved education and training have possibly
                 affected economic growth.

(b)   Discuss the view that economic growth always leads to rising living standards.    [15]

      Answers may include:
      • definition of economic growth
      • AD/AS diagram showing increasing real GDP, negative externality diagram, PPC
        diagram, poverty cycle diagram or Lorenz curve diagram
      • an explanation of the impacts economic growth might have on living standards
        through changes in employment, tax revenue used to finance government
        spending, sustainability in resource use and the distribution of income
      • examples of cases where economic growth has led to changes in the standard of
        living
      • synthesis or evaluation (discuss).

      Discussion may include: the advantages and disadvantages of economic growth,
      the extent to which economic growth affects different stakeholders and material
      and non-material aspects of the standard of living, consideration of the word
      “always”.

      NB It should be noted that definitions, diagrams, theory and examples that have
      already been given in part (a), and then referred to in part (b), should be
      rewarded.

      Examiners should be aware that candidates may take a different approach which,
      if appropriate, should be rewarded.
