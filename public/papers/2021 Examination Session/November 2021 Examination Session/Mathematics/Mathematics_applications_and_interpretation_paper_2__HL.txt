Answer all questions in the answer booklet provided. Please start each question on a new page.
Full marks are not necessarily awarded for a correct answer with no working. Answers must be
supported by working and/or explanations. Solutions found from a graphic display calculator should
be supported by suitable working. For example, if graphs are used to find a solution, you should sketch
these as part of your answer. Where an answer is incorrect, some marks may be given for a correct
method, provided this is shown by written working. You are therefore advised to show all working.

     A wind turbine is designed so that the rotation of the blades generates electricity. The turbine
     is built on horizontal ground and is made up of a vertical tower and three blades.

     The point A is on the base of the tower directly below point B at the top of the tower. The height
     of the tower, AB, is 90 m. The blades of the turbine are centred at B and are each of length 40 m.
     This is shown in the following diagram.

                                                                              diagram not to scale

     The end of one of the blades of the turbine is represented by point C on the diagram. Let h
     be the height of C above the ground, measured in metres, where h varies as the blade rotates.

     (a)   Find the

           (i)    maximum value of h .

           (ii)   minimum value of h .                                                                   [2]

     The blades of the turbine complete 12 rotations per minute under normal conditions, moving at
     a constant rate.

     (b)   (i)	Find the time, in seconds, it takes for the blade [BC] to make one complete
                rotation under these conditions.

           (ii)   Calculate the angle, in degrees, that the blade [BC] turns through in one second.      [3]

(Question 2 continued)

     The height, h, of point C can be modelled by the following function. Time, t , is measured
     from the instant when the blade [BC] first passes [AB] and is measured in seconds.

                                        ​h(t) = 90 − 40 cos (72​t​∘​)​ ,  ​t ≥ 0​

     (c)   (i)	Write down the amplitude of the function.

           (ii)   Find the period of the function.                                                            [2]

           and minimum points.                                                                                [3]

     (e)   (i)	Find the height of C above the ground when  ​t = 2​  .

           (ii)   Find the time, in seconds, that point C is above a height of 100 m, during each
                  complete rotation.                                                                          [5]

     The wind speed increases and the blades rotate faster, but still at a constant rate.

     (f)   Given that point C is now higher than 110 m for 1 second during each complete rotation,
           find the time for one complete rotation.                                                           [5]

     normal distribution with mean 10 cm and standard deviation 3 cm.

     (a)   Find the probability that

           (i)     a dart lands less than 13 cm from O.

           (ii)    a dart lands more than 15 cm from O.[3]

     A shock absorber on a car contains a spring surrounded by a fluid. When the car travels over
     uneven ground the spring is compressed and then returns to an equilibrium position.

                                                                                        x=0

     The displacement,  ​x​ , of the spring is measured, in centimetres, from the equilibrium position
     of  ​x = 0​ . The value of  ​x​  can be modelled by the following second order differential equation,
     where t is the time, measured in seconds, after the initial displacement.

                                                   ​x¨​+ 3​x˙​+ 1.25x = 0​

      Loreto is a manager at the Da Vinci health centre. If the mean rate of patients arriving at the
      health centre exceeds 1.5 per minute then Loreto will employ extra staff. It is assumed that
      the number of patients arriving in any given time period follows a Poisson distribution.

      Loreto performs a hypothesis test to determine whether she should employ extra staff.
      She finds that 320 patients arrived during a randomly selected 3-hour clinic.

      (a)     (i)	Write down null and alternative hypotheses for Loreto’s test.

              (ii)   Using the data from Loreto’s sample, perform the hypothesis test at a 5 %
                     significance level to determine if Loreto should employ extra staff.                 [7]

      Loreto is also concerned about the average waiting time for patients to see a nurse. The
      health centre aims for at least 95 % of patients to see a nurse in under 20 minutes.

      Loreto assumes that the waiting times for patients are independent of each other and
      decides to perform a hypothesis test at a 10 % significance level to determine whether the
      health centre is meeting its target.

      Loreto surveys 150 patients and finds that 11 of them waited more than 20 minutes.

      (b)     (i)	Write down null and alternative hypotheses for this test.

              (ii)   Perform the test, clearly stating the conclusion in context.                         [7]
