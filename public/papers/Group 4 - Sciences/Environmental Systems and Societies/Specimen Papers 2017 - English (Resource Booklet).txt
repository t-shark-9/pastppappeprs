Figure 2: Fact file on Mongolia

• Mongolia covers 1.5 million sq km. Only 1% of this is used for settlements and farming
• It is a land of natural contrasts made up of large areas of flat, unforested grassland (steppe),
  mountains in the west, and the Gobi Desert in the south
• 80 % of the country lies 1000m above sea level
• The population is 2.7 million, 40 % of whom live in the capital city, Ulan Bator
• The rest of the population is spread over large, often inaccessible areas. Many are nomadic herders
  living in yurts
• Mongolia is one of the poorest countries in Asia
• In the Human Development Index Mongolia is ranked 108 out of 187 countries
• 13 % of land area is protected.

Figure 5a: Nomadic herders fact file

About 30 % of Mongolians live as nomadic herders on sparsely populated grasslands. The herders’
cattle, sheep and goats represent their wealth. They use them to pay for everything from food to
medicine and schooling for their children.

These grasslands develop rich fertile soils that have supported nomadic pastoralists for centuries, but
they are also highly vulnerable to degradation due to wind erosion and over grazing. Changes in climate
can cause further degradation of these soil systems.

Harsh conditions can make life very hard. In a recent survey over 97% of the herders interviewed
believed climate change to be a problem in their area.

The environmental conditions they described were:
• frequent drought followed by Dzud (severe winter) events with heavy snowfall
• drying up of rivers and springs and reduction in drinking water
• reduction of feeding value of pasture land and hay making yield
• increased sand movement and desertification
• decrease in animal body weight leading to decrease in the production of meat, milk, wool
  and cashmere.

Figure 7a: Changes in pastoralism in Mongolia

Nomadic pastoralism is when livestock (groups of animals) are moved to find fresh grazing pastures.
The movement can be anywhere at any given time with no set path or pattern.

Settled pastoralism is when the animals are kept in the same place for the whole year, or at least most
of it. A permanent place to keep the animals is needed, such as a barn.

There has been a recent trend for nomadic pastoralists to settle near Ulan Bator. This is because of
the higher price of meat in these areas and the harsh conditions on the steppe. The Government has
encouraged nomads to settle as this is seen as being more developed.

Roads in the steppe are often no more than sandy tracks. Drivers overtaking or passing other vehicles
can go off the track and cause damage to the vegetation. Over time tracks become recolonized with
vegetation.

An ecological study was undertaken to compare three tracks in the steppe. Two abandoned tracks were
selected (Track B and Track C), which were in parallel next to the current track (Track A), to investigate
the recovery of vegetation.

Each investigated track extended over 500m and was 2–3m in width. An additional site (D) was also
investigated.

Figure 10: Snow Leopard Trust

Snow leopard population:
• 500–1,000 (2nd largest population in the world).

Threats to snow leopards:
• poaching for trade in hides or bones
• revenge killing for livestock loss
• mining in snow leopard habitat.

Mission and conservation philosophy
The Snow Leopard Trust started working in Mongolia in 1992. It builds community partnerships by using
science to determine priorities for protecting the endangered snow leopard:
• understanding snow leopard behavior and habitat
• listening to the community to identify needs
• seeking resources for sustaining long-term programs.

Conservation methods:
• Snow leopard businesses (local women sell handmade snow leopard dolls to increase incomes)
• Livestock Insurance (financial compensation given to herders who lose an animal to snow leopard
  predation)
• Research center set up to study ecosystem
• Cameras, satellite tracking, GPS tracking collars
• Genetic research.

Landscape Focus Area: one landscape area (approximately 4000 km2) where conservation and research
efforts are focused.
