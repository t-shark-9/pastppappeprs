Answer all questions. Write your answers in the boxes provided.

1.       GPR120 is a trans-membrane protein that functions as a receptor for long-chain unsaturated
         fatty acids. When fatty acids outside the cell bind to the receptor, the receptor changes shape
         and as a result a signal is passed to the interior of the cell. This causes an increase in the
         intracellular calcium concentration (Ca2+ ), which has a wide range of effects on cell activity.

         A strain of mice was developed that did not produce GPR120 protein. Groups of these
         GPR120 deficient mice were fed from the age of 5 weeks until they were 16 weeks old either
         on a high fat diet containing 60 % fat or on a normal diet containing 13 % fat. Control groups
         of mice that did produce GPR120 protein were fed on the same diets. The bar chart shows the
         mean body mass of each group when the mice were 16 weeks old.

(Question 1 continued)

      The gene for GPR120 protein is located on Chromosome 10. The alleles for GPR120 protein
      from 312 extremely obese adults and children were base sequenced. Six alleles were discovered
      that differed by one base from the wild-type allele. They are likely to have been produced
      by a base substitution mutation. Two of the mutations cause a change in the amino acid sequence
      of the GPR120 protein (missense mutation) but the other four do not (synonymous mutation).
      The table gives details of the six mutant alleles.

(Question 1 continued)

     A clone of human cells that contained the wild type allele for GPR120 was genetically
     modified by inserting either another wild-type allele (WT) or one of two mutant alleles
     (R67C and R270H). The intracellular concentration of calcium was measured in these cells
     at varying levels of linolenic acid. Linolenic acid is a long-chain unsaturated fatty acid.
     The graph shows the results. The scale on the x-axis is logarithmic.

Subject Details: Biology HL Paper 2 Markscheme

Mark Allocation

Candidates are required to answer ALL questions in Section A and TWO out of THREE questions in Section B. Maximum total = [72 marks].

1.    Each row in the “Question” column relates to the smallest subpart of the question.

2.    The maximum mark for each question subpart is indicated in the “Total” column.

3.    Each marking point in the “Answers” column is shown by means of a tick () at the end of the marking point.

4.    A question subpart may have more marking points than the total allows. This will be indicated by “max” written after the mark in the “Total” column.
      The related rubric, if necessary, will be outlined in the “Notes” column.

5.    An alternative wording is indicated in the “Answers” column by a slash (/). Either wording can be accepted.

6.    An alternative answer is indicated in the “Answers” column by “OR” on the line between the alternatives. Either answer can be accepted.

7.    Words in angled brackets ‹ › in the “Answers” column are not necessary to gain the mark.

8.    Words that are underlined are essential for the mark.

9.    The order of marking points does not have to be as in the “Answers” column, unless stated otherwise in the “Notes” column.

10.   If the candidate’s answer has the same “meaning” or can be clearly interpreted as being of equivalent significance, detail and validity as that in
      the “Answers” column then award the mark. Where this point is considered to be particularly relevant in a question it is emphasized by OWTTE
      (or words to that effect) in the “Notes” column.

11.   Remember that many candidates are writing in a second language. Effective communication is more important than grammatical accuracy.
                                                                               –4–                                        SPEC/4/BIOLO/HP2/ENG/TZ0/XX/M


12.   Occasionally, a part of a question may require an answer that is required for subsequent marking points. If an error is made in the first marking point
      then it should be penalized. However, if the incorrect answer is used correctly in subsequent marking points then follow through marks should be
      awarded.
      When marking, indicate this by adding ECF (error carried forward) on the script. “ECF acceptable” will be displayed in the “Notes” column.

13.   Do not penalize candidates for errors in units or significant figures, unless it is specifically referred to in the “Notes” column.


                                                                        Section B
Extended response questions - quality mark

       Extended response questions for HLP2 each carry a mark total of [16]. Of these marks, [15] are awarded for content and [1] for the quality of the
        answer.

       [1] quality mark is to be awarded when:

             the candidate’s answers are clear enough to be understood without re-reading

             the candidate has answered the question succinctly with little or no repetition or irrelevant material.

       It is important to judge this on the overall answer, taking into account the answers to all parts of the question. Although, the part with the largest
        number of marks is likely to provide the most evidence.

         Candidates that score very highly on the content marks need not necessarily automatically gain [1] mark for quality (and vice versa).

                             Arguments for both factors having an effect:
                     a       ‹all› mice on a high fat diet had higher body mass than on a normal
                             diet 

                             fat diet 
                     c       high fat diet will give high blood concentrations of linolenic acid 
                     d       responses in WT humans are mediated via an increase in intracellular
                             Ca2+                                                                                                            3 max
                     e       less Ca2+ release with mutant alleles so less response 

                             Argument for diet having more effect:
                         f   more of mass increase on the high fat diet was due to diet than to the
                             genetic difference 

                             Argument for genes not being the only factor:
                     g       there are differences in allele frequency between obese and non-obese
                             groups 

3.   Samples of the alga, Ectocarpus siliculosus, were taken from three sites.  Two samples came
     from the underside of ships that had been painted with a copper-containing paint.  The other
     sample came from a nearby unpolluted environment at Rhosneigr, north Wales (UK).

     The samples of algae were cultured at different copper concentrations and the changes in the
     number of algae were monitored.  The results are shown in the bar charts.   Positive values
     indicate an increase in numbers of algae and negative values indicate a decrease.

6.                 The sounds that birds produce can be categorized into two distinct classes: calls and songs.  
                   A song tends to be a long and complex vocalization produced during a breeding season.  
                   Songs are organized into several phrases (or motifs) which consist of a series of syllables.

                   The sonogram shows the birdsong of ten different male, white-crowned sparrows.   Five are
                   from Westport and five are from Friday Harbor in the Pacific Northwest coast of North America.

13.     Phenylketonuria (PKU) is a recessive genetic disease in which the affected individual lacks
        functional phenylalanine hydroxylase.  As a consequence, affected individuals cannot convert
        dietary phenylalanine (an amino acid) to the amino acid tyrosine and phenylalanine (PHE)
        builds up in the blood.  The graph shows the levels of phenylalanine in the blood of a newborn
        baby with PKU until the age of 15 months.  The baby was fed a modified diet to control blood
        phenylalanine.  The target maximum blood PHE is 363 µmol l–1.

Subject Details: Biology HL Paper 3 Markscheme

Mark Allocation

Candidates are required to answer ALL questions in Section A and ONE out of FOUR questions in Section B. Maximum total = [72 marks].

1.    Each row in the “Question” column relates to the smallest subpart of the question.

2.    The maximum mark for each question subpart is indicated in the “Total” column.

3.    Each marking point in the “Answers” column is shown by means of a tick () at the end of the marking point.

4.    A question subpart may have more marking points than the total allows. This will be indicated by “max” written after the mark in the “Total” column.
      The related rubric, if necessary, will be outlined in the “Notes” column.

5.    An alternative wording is indicated in the “Answers” column by a slash (/). Either wording can be accepted.

6.    An alternative answer is indicated in the “Answers” column by “OR” on the line between the alternatives. Either answer can be accepted.

7.    Words in angled brackets ‹ › in the “Answers” column are not necessary to gain the mark.

8.    Words that are underlined are essential for the mark.

9.    The order of marking points does not have to be as in the “Answers” column, unless stated otherwise in the “Notes” column.

10.   If the candidate’s answer has the same “meaning” or can be clearly interpreted as being of equivalent significance, detail and validity as that in
      the “Answers” column then award the mark. Where this point is considered to be particularly relevant in a question it is emphasized by OWTTE
      (or words to that effect) in the “Notes” column.

11.   Remember that many candidates are writing in a second language. Effective communication is more important than grammatical accuracy.
                                                                               –4–                                        SPEC/4/BIOLO/HP3/ENG/TZ0/XX/M


12.   Occasionally, a part of a question may require an answer that is required for subsequent marking points. If an error is made in the first marking point
      then it should be penalized. However, if the incorrect answer is used correctly in subsequent marking points then follow through marks should be
      awarded.
      When marking, indicate this by adding ECF (error carried forward) on the script. “ECF acceptable” will be displayed in the “Notes” column.

13.   Do not penalize candidates for errors in units or significant figures, unless it is specifically referred to in the “Notes” column.

Answer all questions. Write your answers in the boxes provided.

1.    Large areas in northern Indiana (USA) are used for the cultivation of corn (Zea mays).
      Headwater streams are water bodies that drain the land and merge to form larger rivers.

      Ecologists asked questions after the introduction of genetically modified Bt corn varieties:
        • does organic debris from fields of genetically modified corn enter headwater streams?
        • are there any effects on stream life?

      To try to answer these questions, a group of researchers took measurements from twelve
      headwater streams in Indiana and carried out laboratory experiments. Corn crops were
      growing on both sides of each of the streams.

      After the corn was harvested, traps were used to measure the amount of corn leaves, cobs
      and pollen entering the streams. The results are shown in the table.

(Question 1 continued)

     Larvae of caddis flies were observed in parts of the headwater streams where organic debris
     from corn crops had accumulated.  Laboratory experiments were performed to try to find out
     if these larvae could be affected by consuming debris from Bt corn.

     Lepidostoma liba is a caddis fly that feeds by shredding dead plant matter.   The growth
     rate of L. liba was measured when it was fed on leaves from Bt corn and non-Bt corn.
     Helicopsyche borealis is a caddis fly that feeds by scraping algae surfaces.  The mortality rate
     of H. borealis was measured when it fed on biofilms of algae containing Bt pollen or
     non-Bt pollen.

     Two concentrations of pollen were tested. One concentration ( 0.055 g m–2 ) was based on
     the maximum observed daily pollen input rate to streams. The other concentration was
     50 times higher ( 2.75 g m–2 ).

     The results are shown in the bar charts.   Statistically significant differences between
     non-Bt pollen and Bt pollen in each bar chart are indicated by different letters on error bars.

                                                                                 0.055 g m–2 pollen            2.75 g m–2 pollen

     The research described in this question was strongly criticized soon after it was published
     by some other biologists and by the company that produced Bt varieties of crop plants.
     In particular there were objections to a statement in the research paper that “Widespread
     planting of Bt crops has unexpected ecosystem-scale consequences”.

     (g)   Discuss whether this statement in the research paper was justified, based on the methods
           used in the research and the data obtained.                                                                                                      [3]

Subject Details: Biology SL Paper 2 Markscheme
Mark Allocation

Candidates are required to answer ALL questions in Section A and ONE out of TWO questions in Section B. Maximum total = [50 marks].

1.    Each row in the “Question” column relates to the smallest subpart of the question.

2.    The maximum mark for each question subpart is indicated in the “Total” column.

3.    Each marking point in the “Answers” column is shown by means of a tick () at the end of the marking point.

4.    A question subpart may have more marking points than the total allows. This will be indicated by “max” written after the mark in the “Total” column.
      The related rubric, if necessary, will be outlined in the “Notes” column.

5.    An alternative wording is indicated in the “Answers” column by a slash (/). Either wording can be accepted.

6.    An alternative answer is indicated in the “Answers” column by “OR” on the line between the alternatives. Either answer can be accepted.

7.    Words in angled brackets ‹ › in the “Answers” column are not necessary to gain the mark.

8.    Words that are underlined are essential for the mark.

9.    The order of marking points does not have to be as in the “Answers” column, unless stated otherwise in the “Notes” column.

10.   If the candidate’s answer has the same “meaning” or can be clearly interpreted as being of equivalent significance, detail and validity as that in
      the “Answers” column then award the mark. Where this point is considered to be particularly relevant in a question it is emphasized by OWTTE
      (or words to that effect) in the “Notes” column.

11.   Remember that many candidates are writing in a second language. Effective communication is more important than grammatical accuracy.
                                                                               –4–                                         SPEC/4/BIOLO/SP2/ENG/TZ0/XX/M


12.   Occasionally, a part of a question may require an answer that is required for subsequent marking points. If an error is made in the first marking point
      then it should be penalized. However, if the incorrect answer is used correctly in subsequent marking points then follow through marks should be
      awarded.
      When marking, indicate this by adding ECF (error carried forward) on the script. “ECF acceptable” will be displayed in the “Notes” column.

13.   Do not penalize candidates for errors in units or significant figures, unless it is specifically referred to in the “Notes” column.


                                                                           Section B
Extended response questions - quality of construction

         Extended response questions for SLP2 carry a mark total of [16]. Of these marks, [15] are awarded for content and [1] for the quality of
          the answer.

         [1] quality mark is to be awarded when:

               the candidate’s answers are clear enough to be understood without re-reading

               the candidate has answered the question succinctly with little or no repetition or irrelevant material.

       It is important to judge this on the overall answer, taking into account the answers to all parts of the question. Although, the part with the
        largest number of marks is likely to provide the most evidence.

         Candidates that score very highly on the content marks need not necessarily automatically gain [1] mark for quality (and vice versa).

4.   A study was undertaken to evaluate the effectiveness of cochlear implants and hearing aids at
     improving the understanding of 100 abstract words such as “hope” and “trust” in pre-school
     children. The study involved ten deaf children with cochlear implantation, ten deaf children
     with hearing aids and ten children with normal hearing (control). The table shows the level of
     understanding of the 100 words expressed as a percentage. The initial understanding of abstract
     words by the deaf children was minimal.

12.   In a study examining the ecological role of keystone species, the sea star, Pisaster, was
      removed from a study area. The sea star is a top carnivore. After an extended period of time,
      researchers returned to analyse changes in the species diversity in the area. The bar chart
      shows the species diversity before and after the removal from the habitat.

Subject Details: Biology SL Paper 3 Markscheme

Mark Allocation

Candidates are required to answer ALL questions in Section A and ONE out of FOUR questions in Section B. Maximum total = [35 marks].

1.    Each row in the “Question” column relates to the smallest subpart of the question.

2.    The maximum mark for each question subpart is indicated in the “Total” column.

3.    Each marking point in the “Answers” column is shown by means of a tick () at the end of the marking point.

4.    A question subpart may have more marking points than the total allows. This will be indicated by “max” written after the mark in the “Total” column.
      The related rubric, if necessary, will be outlined in the “Notes” column.

5.    An alternative wording is indicated in the “Answers” column by a slash (/). Either wording can be accepted.

6.    An alternative answer is indicated in the “Answers” column by “OR” on the line between the alternatives. Either answer can be accepted.

7.    Words in angled brackets ‹ › in the “Answers” column are not necessary to gain the mark.

8.    Words that are underlined are essential for the mark.

9.    The order of marking points does not have to be as in the “Answers” column, unless stated otherwise in the “Notes” column.

10.   If the candidate’s answer has the same “meaning” or can be clearly interpreted as being of equivalent significance, detail and validity as that in
      the “Answers” column then award the mark. Where this point is considered to be particularly relevant in a question it is emphasized by OWTTE
      (or words to that effect) in the “Notes” column.

11.   Remember that many candidates are writing in a second language. Effective communication is more important than grammatical accuracy.
                                                                               –4–                                         SPEC/4/BIOLO/SP3/ENG/TZ0/XX/M


12.   Occasionally, a part of a question may require an answer that is required for subsequent marking points. If an error is made in the first marking point
      then it should be penalized. However, if the incorrect answer is used correctly in subsequent marking points then follow through marks should be
      awarded.
      When marking, indicate this by adding ECF (error carried forward) on the script. “ECF acceptable” will be displayed in the “Notes” column.

13.   Do not penalize candidates for errors in units or significant figures, unless it is specifically referred to in the “Notes” column.
