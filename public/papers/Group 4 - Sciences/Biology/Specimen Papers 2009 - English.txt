32.   When a plant is transpiring, water rises up in the xylem vessels from the roots to the leaves. This flow
      of water is called the transpiration stream. What property of water is essential for the transpiration
      stream to happen?

      A.     When water evaporates it removes heat and therefore causes cooling.

      B.     Water is a good solvent so inorganic particles can be carried up in the transpiration stream.

      C.     Water has a high specific heat capacity.

      D.     Water molecules are cohesive and therefore can be pulled up.

Answer all the questions in the spaces provided.

1.                Antibiotic peptides occur naturally on the surface of human skin. One of these peptides, called
                  LL-37, and three other similar synthetic peptides were investigated to assess both their antibiotic
                  properties and effect on human cells.

                  The graphs show the antibiotic effect of the peptides against two microbes, S. aureus and
                  C. albicans. The technique involves measuring the inhibition of growth of the microbes.

(Question 1 continued)

      There is concern that the peptides could damage living human cells. One form of damage
      is fragmentation of DNA. Human cells were incubated for 16 hours with each peptide at
      varying concentrations. The amount of DNA fragmentation was measured.

      The shape of the secondary structure of a peptide can be predicted from its amino acid
      composition. The figure shows the theoretical likelihood of the peptide LL-37 forming an
      α-helix, based on the properties and position of its 37 amino acids.

Option D — Evolution

D1. The cladogram below shows how closely related a group of species of spiders are on the
    Hawaiian island group. Two of the species have not been given a scientific name. Three pairs
    of the spiders spin very similar webs. These are shown on the diagram. The island on which
    the spider lives is also indicated.

Option E — Neurobiology and behaviour

E1. Circadian rhythms are daily cycles in physiology and behaviours. Cryptochromes are proteins
    that are thought to be involved in circadian rhythm in mammals.

      Two groups of mice were identified. Group A could produce cryptochrome, Group B could
      not. The behaviour of the mice was assessed by monitoring wheel running activity over a
      28 day period. For the first seven days the animals were given alternating 12 hour periods of
      light and dark. Between day 8 and day 28 they were kept in continuous darkness.

      The rotation of the running wheel is plotted as a dark area within the boxes, the time of day is
      plotted on the x-axis. The band on top indicates the dark and light periods in the first 7 days.

Option G — Ecology and conservation

G1. The timing of breeding in tree swallows (Tachycineta bicolor) was studied in the United
    States and Canada from 1959 to 1991. Figure A represents the mean egg laying date
    for each year. The date is indicated as number of days after January 1st. Figure B shows
    the correlation between mean May temperature (°C) and mean laying date over the
    same period.

H1. In North America normal diets are traditionally low in fibre. Scientists have proposed the
    hypothesis that people with diabetes benefit from a high fibre diet. The diagrams show the
    effect on blood glucose and blood insulin concentrations of a group of diabetic patients fed on a
    high fibre diet compared to a group of diabetic patients fed on a normal diet. The bars indicate
    standard error.

Option D — Evolution

D1. (a)   on Maui T.stelarobusta and T. eurychasma are closely related based on the
          cladogram (but they produce different webs);
          distantly related spiders, e.g. T. hawaiensis and T. stelarobusta produce similar
          webs but are on different islands;
          suggesting island is better indicator for relatedness than webs;
          data inconclusive / more studies needed;                                               [2 max]

    (b)   (mt) DNA is isolated from organism/species;
          (mt) DNA is sequenced/order of bases determined;
          (mt) DNA sequence is compared between organisms/species;
          more similarities between sequences signify more closely related/
          recent divergence;
          fewer similarities between sequences signify less relatedness/more
          distant divergence;
          cladograms are calculated by software that depicts the cladogram with the fewest
          number of branches;
          for rooting the cladogram an outgroup/distantly related species is used;               [3 max]

    (c)   (i)    Award [2] max
                 Definition of convergent evolution: independent evolution of similar traits
                 in response to similar environments;
                 Evidence for: T. stelarobusta (Maui) and T. hawaiensis (Hawai’i) produce
                 the same type of web;
                 T.filiciphilia (Maui) and “eurylike” (O’ahu) also produce similar webs;

          (ii)   Definition of adaptive evolution: rapid speciation to fill ecological niches;
                 Evidence for: on Maui, all three T. species present produce three different
                 kinds of webs;                                                                  [3 max]


D2. (a)   autocatalytic/can function as an enzyme;
          can function as genetic material;
          can (self)replicate;                                                                   [2 max]

    (b)   Award [1] for any two of the following:
          CH4 / H2 / NH3 / H2O                                                                   [1 max]
          Accept symbol chemical formulae or words.

    (c)   describes the origin of eukaryotic cells;
          endosymbionts live within larger host cells;
          eukaryotic cells contain mitochondria and/or chloroplasts;
          mitochondria and chloroplasts have evolved from independent free living
          organisms (bacteria);
          these organisms were taken into a larger heterotrophic cell by endocytosis;
          not digested but cells were kept alive and continued to carry out aerobic
          respiration and photosynthesis;                                                        [4 max]

D3. (a)   tool making first associated with H. habilis;
          requires larger brain;
          brain requires vast amounts of energy / consumes 40% of energy intake;
          so larger brain size had an effect on diet requirements / created a demand for
          changes in diet;
          food scarcity may lead to decrease in brain size;
          change to higher calorific diet may allow increase in brain size;
          more complex tool making/human society/language development required larger
          brain size;
          larger brain/better cognitive skills allowed for better hunting and gathering;
          led to greater calorific intake;
          about 2.5 MYBP (million years before present) animal foods began to occupy an
          increasingly prominent place in diet;
          animal tissues can provide the necessary structural lipid for human brain
          expansion;
          changes in the dental fossil record are indirect evidence for such a change in diet;   [5 max]

E1. (a)   (i)    dark                                                                               [1]

          (ii)   because they are nocturnal / to avoid predation by being active at night           [1]

    (b)   group A is able to maintain a rhythm while group B is not;
          group B is active more frequently than group A;
          group B is active for a shorter period than group A;                                      [3]

    (c)   (before constant darkness) group B had a rhythm suggesting cytochromes are not
          necessary;
           (after constant darkness) group B were unable to re-establish a rhythm suggesting
           cytochromes are necessary;
           cytochromes involved along with other variables;                                     [2 max]

          Award [2] for 4 correct answers, [1] for three correct answers, [0] for two or one
          correct answer(s)

    (b)   (a stimulus is) a change in the environment (internal or external) that is detected
          by a receptor and elicits a response                                                      [1]

    (c)   the sympathetic and parasympathetic systems are part of the ANS;
          the sympathetic and parasympathetic systems are antagonistic;
          the sympathetic system accelerates the heart rate and stimulates glucose release
          (from the liver);
          more blood is pumped to the muscles and the intestines;
          the sympathetic system (mostly) uses norepinephrine (noradrenaline);
          the parasympathetic system slows down heart rate and stimulates the stomach and
          the intestines;

E3. altruistic behaviour may be harmful to the animal itself but beneficial to other animals;
    occurs in social animals;
    usually occur in the same species;
    need not happen between genetically related animals from one population;
    altruistic behaviour often occurs in animals which are genetically closely related;
    altruistic behaviour may increase the survival rate of the group and thus the species;
    helping close relatives or siblings increases the chances of passing on genes to the
    next generation;
    due to natural selection;
    this is called inclusive fitness;
    enhancing reproductive success of relatives is called kin selection;
    if altruism was a negative trait it would/may have disappeared;
    altruistic species do just as well as non altruistic species belonging to the same order;   [6 max]

           (ii)   earlier egg laying date means that parents may compete for food/nesting
                  materials/nesting sites with other species or any example of how change
                  may cause niche to overlap;

          are density independent;
          environment should have ample supply of energy;
          many offspring are produced so habitat should be able to support that;
          early maturity so climate should favour this, e.g. short spring season in the
          artic regions;
          short life expectancy so offspring also has a chance of survival;                        [4 max]

Answer all the questions in the spaces provided.

1.                                Methane produced by anaerobic bacteria contributes substantially to atmospheric
                                  methane concentration. These bacteria are found in a variety of habitats. Some live inside
                                  the cytoplasm of larger unicellular organisms and are known as endosymbionts. In marine
                                  sediments, endosymbionts living in the cytoplasm of a group of unicellular organisms, known
                                  as ciliates, can contribute up to 90% of methane production.

                                  To see if endosymbionts in freshwater sediments had the same effect on methane production
                                  a one-year study was carried out in Holland. The graph below shows the rate of methane
                                  production by untreated sediment samples and sediment samples treated to kill the ciliates
                                  containing endosymbionts. The standard deviations are indicated by bars. The total number of
                                  ciliates is also indicated by circles.

      Models predict global warming will cause sea temperatures to rise by approximately
      2 oC by 2100. An investigation was carried out to study the effect of slight increases
      in temperature on the ability of Antarctic marine molluscs to carry out basic activities
      essential for survival.


      The graph below shows the effect of temperature on the percentage of limpets (Nacella
      concinna) able to right themselves after being turned over.

     (c)   production by treated and untreated samples is almost the same;
           production by untreated samples is usually slightly higher than treated samples;
           except November, January when the treated samples have a slightly higher
           methane production;                                                                   [2 max]

     (d)   endosymbionts do not seem to be responsible for methane production;

Option B — Physiology of exercise

B1. As intensity of exercise increases, humans respond to the increased need for gas exchange in
    two ways: varying ventilation rate and varying tidal volume. Experimental data for a runner
    on a treadmill are shown below.

C1. Inflammation of human tissues often causes pain. Cyclooxygenases (COX) are a group of
    enzymes that play a role in causing inflammation. Analgesics are drugs that can reduce pain.
    The graph below shows how increasing concentrations of the analgesic drug dipyrone, affects
    the activity of three different cyclooxygenases, COX-1, COX-2 and COX-3.

D1. The tree diagram (cladogram) below shows how closely related a group of species of spiders
    are on the Hawaiian island group. Two of the species have not been given a scientific name.
    Three pairs of the spiders spin very similar webs. These are shown on the diagram. The island
    on which the spider lives is also indicated.

Option E — Neurobiology and behaviour

E1. Circadian rhythms are daily cycles in physiology and behaviours. Cryptochromes are proteins
    that are thought to be involved in circadian rhythm in mammals.

      Two groups of mice were identified. Group A could produce cryptochrome, Group B
      could not. The behaviour of the mice was assessed by monitoring wheel running activity over
      a 28-day period. For the first seven days the animals were given alternating 12-hour periods of
      light and dark. Between days 8 and 28 they were kept in continuous darkness.

      The rotation of the running wheel is plotted as a dark area within the boxes, the time of day
      is plotted on the x-axis. The band on top indicates the dark and light periods in the first
      seven days.

Option G — Ecology and conservation

G1. The timing of breeding in tree swallows (Tachycineta bicolor) was studied in the United
    States and Canada from 1959 to 1991. Figure A represents the mean egg laying date for
    each year. The date is indicated as number of days after January 1st. Figure B shows
    the correlation between mean May temperature (°C) and mean laying date over the same
    period.

    (c)   both showed an increase in energy consumption;
          USA showed a greater relative increase in the proportion of dietary energy from
          plant origin;
          USA overtook the 15 European nations group in daily dietary
          energy consumption;                                                                [2 max]

    (d)   increase in dietary energy intake / energy intake in all countries exceeds
          recommended daily intake;
          likely consequence is obesity;
          animal source of energy linked to intake of saturated fat;
          some countries have shown an increased consumption of animal source energy;
          pattern for increase in animal source energy is less uniform coupled with
          decrease in exercise/manual labour;                                                [3 max]


A2. (a)   minerals are usually elements whereas vitamins are compounds;

    (b)   iodine deficiency can lead to goitre/mental retardation;
          iodine is necessary for thryoxine production;
          dietary supplementation usually through iodized salt;
          cost to supplement is minimal but cost of deficiency is high;
          few foods rich in iodine / lack of marine food in diet can lead to deficiency;     [3 max]


A3. (a)   protein and carbohydrate have similar energy content per gram / both have
          approximately 1700 kJ per 100g;
          100 g of fat has more than twice the energy content of 100 g of carbohydrate or
          100 g of protein;                                                                      [2]

    (b)   causes [2 max]:
          genetic component / high-risk ethnic group (Aboriginal, Asian, Pacific Islander,
          Hispanic, Pima);
          obesity (BMI > 27 kg/m2) / diets high in fat/sugar;

          symptoms [2 max]:
          poor ability to clear glucose from the blood is used to diagnose / high
          blood glucose;
          frequent urination / thirst / tiredness;
          glucose detected in urine;                                                         [4 max]

Option B — Physiology of exercise

B1. (a)    (i)    as treadmill speed increases, tidal volume increases                                 [1]

           (ii)   at high treadmill speeds, tidal volume begins to level off / rate of
                  increase slows                                                                       [1]

     (b)   ventilation rate continues to increase while tidal volume decreases/levels off              [1]

     (c)   ventilation rate x tidal volume;
           116 L ± 4 L;                                                                                [2]

     (d)   ventilation rate would increase (until a physical limit was reached);
           tidal volume would level off/decrease / physical limit would be reached;                    [2]


B2. (a)    synovial fluid: lubricates joints (to reduce friction);
           joint capsule: seals the joint / encloses the synovial fluid;                               [2]

     (b)   tendon                                                                                      [1]
