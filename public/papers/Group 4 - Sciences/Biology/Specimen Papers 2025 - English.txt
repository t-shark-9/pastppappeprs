1.   Beetroot (Beta vulgaris) tissue was cut into pieces of similar size and shape. The masses
     of the individual pieces were measured. Three pieces of beetroot were placed in each of six
     sucrose solutions of different concentrations.

     After three hours, the pieces of beetroot were removed from the solutions, surface dried
     and their masses recorded. The mean percentage change in mass of the beetroot in each
     solution was calculated and displayed in the graph.

3.   Rhizobium is a genus of bacteria that live in the roots of flowering plants in the family
     Fabaceae. The plants form nodules surrounding a population of Rhizobium. The bacteria
     fix nitrogen from the air into nitrogen compounds, especially ammonium, which are made
     available to the host plant.

     enriched environment and a control group grown in a nitrate-free environment.

4.   Before the structure of DNA was known, researchers analysed the ratios of the DNA bases
     found in cells of different species. The tetranucleotide hypothesis, formulated in 1910,
     proposed that DNA was made up of equal amounts of adenine, guanine, cytosine and thymine.

     This hypothesis was revised following the publication of Chargaff’s paper in 1951, from which
     data is shown in the table.

General Marking Instructions


     Assistant Examiners (AEs) will be contacted by their team leader (TL) through RM™ Assessor, by e-mail or telephone – if through RM™ Assessor
     or by e-mail, please reply to confirm that you have downloaded the markscheme from IBIS. The purpose of this initial contact is to allow AEs to raise
     any queries they have regarding the markscheme and its interpretation. AEs should contact their team leader through RM™ Assessor or by e-mail
     at any time if they have any problems/queries regarding marking. For any queries regarding the use of RM™ Assessor, please contact
     emarking@ibo.org.


1.     Follow the markscheme provided, award only whole marks and mark only in RED.

2.     Make sure that the question you are about to mark is highlighted in the mark panel on the right-hand side of the screen.

3.     Where a mark is awarded, a tick/check (ü) must be placed in the text at the precise point where it becomes clear that the candidate deserves
       the mark. One tick to be shown for each mark awarded.

4.     Sometimes, careful consideration is required to decide whether or not to award a mark. In these cases use RM™ Assessor annotations to support
       your decision. You are encouraged to write comments where it helps clarity, especially for re-marking purposes. Use a text box for these additional
       comments. It should be remembered that the script may be returned to the candidate.

5.     Personal codes/notations are unacceptable.

6.     Where an answer to a part question is worth no marks but the candidate has attempted the part question, use the “ZERO” annotation to
       award zero marks. Where a candidate has not attempted the part question, use the “SEEN” annotation to show you have looked at the question.
       RM™ Assessor will apply “NR” once you click complete.

7.     If a candidate has attempted more than the required number of questions within a paper or section of a paper, mark all the answers. RM™ Assessor
       will only award the highest mark or marks in line with the rubric.

8.     Ensure that you have viewed every page including any additional sheets. Please ensure that you stamp “SEEN” on any additional pages that are
       blank or where the candidate has crossed out his/her work.

9.     Mark positively. Give candidates credit for what they have achieved and for what they have got correct, rather than penalizing them for what they
       have got wrong. However, a mark should not be awarded where there is contradiction within an answer. Make a comment to this effect using a
       text box or the “CON” stamp.

Subject Details: Biology HL Paper 1B Markscheme

Candidates are required to answer all questions in Paper 1B. Maximum total = 35 marks.

1.    Each row in the “Question” column relates to the smallest subpart of the question.

2.    The maximum mark for each question subpart is indicated in the “Total” column.

3.    Each marking point in the “Answers” column is shown by means of a semicolon (;) at the end of the marking point.

4.    A question subpart may have more marking points than the total allows. This will be indicated by “max” written after the mark in the “Total” column.
      The related rubric, if necessary, will be outlined in the “Notes” column.

5.    An alternative word is indicated in the “Answers” column by a slash (/). Either word can be accepted.

6.    An alternative answer is indicated in the “Answers” column by “OR”. Either answer can be accepted.

7.    An alternative markscheme is indicated in the “Answers” column under heading ALTERNATIVE 1 etc. Either alternative can be accepted.

8.    Words inside brackets ( ) in the “Answers” column are not necessary to gain the mark.

9.    Words that are underlined are essential for the mark.

10.   The order of marking points does not have to be as in the “Answers” column, unless stated otherwise in the “Notes” column.

11.   If the candidate’s answer has the same “meaning” or can be clearly interpreted as being of equivalent significance, detail and validity as
      that in the “Answers” column then award the mark. Where this point is considered to be particularly relevant in a question it is emphasized
      by OWTTE (or words to that effect) in the “Notes” column.

12.   Remember that many candidates are writing in a second language. Effective communication is more important than grammatical accuracy.

13.   Occasionally, a part of a question may require an answer that is required for subsequent marking points. If an error is made in the first marking point
      then it should be penalized. However, if the incorrect answer is used correctly in subsequent marking points then follow through marks should be
      awarded. When marking, indicate this by adding ECF (error carried forward) on the script.

14.   Do not penalize candidates for errors in units or significant figures, unless it is specifically referred to in the “Notes” column.

Answer all questions. Answers must be written within the answer boxes provided.

1.   Squirrels (small mammals) have evolved several defences against predators. One method
     adopted by California ground squirrels (Otospermophilus beecheyi) against rattlesnakes
     (Crotalus oreganus) is to chew moulted rattlesnake skins, then lick their own fur so they take
     on the scent of a rattlesnake.

     An experiment tested the amount of time rattlesnakes spent studying and flicking their tongue
     at filter papers soaked in different liquids. The snakes were released from chamber C into
     foraging area F and observed for 30 minutes. There were two filter papers in area F. One
     was a control paper soaked in distilled water. The other was soaked in one of three types of scent:

     •     squirrel scent
     •     a mixture of squirrel and rattlesnake scent
     •     rattlesnake scent.

                    at each trial)

     The researchers observed that when squirrels saw a rattlesnake, they waved their tail from
     side-to-side so that they were more visible to the rattlesnakes (tail-flagging). The graph
     shows the probability of a snake strike at different distances on tail-flagging and non-tail-
     flagging squirrels.

(Question 1 continued)

      When played a recording of the call of a red-tailed hawk (Buteo jamaicensis), foraging grey
      squirrels (Sciurus carolinensis) in the wild became more vigilant and looked up from their
      feeding more often. In the habitat of the squirrels, there are also sounds made by songbirds
      which chatter to each other when there is no imminent threat. The charts show the response
      of the squirrels in the 30 seconds immediately after the scare of hearing hawk sounds and
      after 3 minutes, both with and without bird chatter playing.

7.   Two alleles of a gene influence body colour in Drosophila. The dominant allele B results in a
     brown body colour while the recessive allele b codes for black body. In addition, two alleles of
     another gene determine wing shape; normal wings (V) are dominant over vestigial wings (v).

     In a dihybrid cross between a double heterozygote for body colour and wing shape (BbVv)
     and a homozygous recessive for both traits (bbvv), the following offspring were obtained:
     •     brown body, normal wings: 29
     •     brown body, vestigial wings: 8
     •     black body, normal wings: 10

General Marking Instructions


     Assistant Examiners (AEs) will be contacted by their team leader (TL) through RM™ Assessor, by e-mail or telephone – if through RM™ Assessor
     or by e-mail, please reply to confirm that you have downloaded the markscheme from IBIS. The purpose of this initial contact is to allow AEs to raise
     any queries they have regarding the markscheme and its interpretation. AEs should contact their team leader through RM™ Assessor or by e-mail
     at any time if they have any problems/queries regarding marking. For any queries regarding the use of RM™ Assessor, please contact
     emarking@ibo.org.


1.     Follow the markscheme provided, award only whole marks and mark only in RED.

2.     Make sure that the question you are about to mark is highlighted in the mark panel on the right-hand side of the screen.

3.     Where a mark is awarded, a tick/check (ü) must be placed in the text at the precise point where it becomes clear that the candidate deserves
       the mark. One tick to be shown for each mark awarded.

4.     Sometimes, careful consideration is required to decide whether or not to award a mark. In these cases use RM™ Assessor annotations to support
       your decision. You are encouraged to write comments where it helps clarity, especially for re-marking purposes. Use a text box for these additional
       comments. It should be remembered that the script may be returned to the candidate.

5.     Personal codes/notations are unacceptable.

6.     Where an answer to a part question is worth no marks but the candidate has attempted the part question, use the “ZERO” annotation to
       award zero marks. Where a candidate has not attempted the part question, use the “SEEN” annotation to show you have looked at the question.
       RM™ Assessor will apply “NR” once you click complete.

7.     If a candidate has attempted more than the required number of questions within a paper or section of a paper, mark all the answers. RM™ Assessor
       will only award the highest mark or marks in line with the rubric.

8.     Ensure that you have viewed every page including any additional sheets. Please ensure that you stamp “SEEN” on any additional pages that are
       blank or where the candidate has crossed out his/her work.

9.     Mark positively. Give candidates credit for what they have achieved and for what they have got correct, rather than penalizing them for what they
       have got wrong. However, a mark should not be awarded where there is contradiction within an answer. Make a comment to this effect using a
       text box or the “CON” stamp.

Subject Details: Biology HL Paper 2 Markscheme

Candidates are required to answer all questions in Section A and two out of three questions in Section B. Maximum total = 80 marks.

1.    Each row in the “Question” column relates to the smallest subpart of the question.

2.    The maximum mark for each question subpart is indicated in the “Total” column.

3.    Each marking point in the “Answers” column is shown by means of a semicolon (;) at the end of the marking point.

4.    A question subpart may have more marking points than the total allows. This will be indicated by “max” written after the mark in the “Total” column.
      The related rubric, if necessary, will be outlined in the “Notes” column.

5.    An alternative word is indicated in the “Answers” column by a slash (/). Either word can be accepted.

6.    An alternative answer is indicated in the “Answers” column by “OR”. Either answer can be accepted.

7.    An alternative markscheme is indicated in the “Answers” column under heading ALTERNATIVE 1 etc. Either alternative can be accepted.

8.    Words inside brackets ( ) in the “Answers” column are not necessary to gain the mark.

9.    Words that are underlined are essential for the mark.

10.   The order of marking points does not have to be as in the “Answers” column, unless stated otherwise in the “Notes” column.

11.   If the candidate’s answer has the same “meaning” or can be clearly interpreted as being of equivalent significance, detail and validity as
      that in the “Answers” column then award the mark. Where this point is considered to be particularly relevant in a question it is emphasized
      by OWTTE (or words to that effect) in the “Notes” column.

12.   Remember that many candidates are writing in a second language. Effective communication is more important than grammatical accuracy.

13.   Occasionally, a part of a question may require an answer that is required for subsequent marking points. If an error is made in the first marking point
      then it should be penalized. However, if the incorrect answer is used correctly in subsequent marking points then follow through marks should be
      awarded. When marking, indicate this by adding ECF (error carried forward) on the script.

14.   Do not penalize candidates for errors in units or significant figures, unless it is specifically referred to in the “Notes” column.

Extended response questions – quality mark

     w   Extended response questions for HLP2 each carry a mark total of [16]. Of these marks, [15] are awarded for content and [1] for the quality
         of the answer.

     w   [1] for quality is to be awarded when:
          w    the candidate’s answers are clear enough to be understood without re-reading.
          w    the candidate has answered the question succinctly with little or no repetition or irrelevant material.

     •   It is important to judge this on the overall answer, taking into account the answers to all parts of the question. Although, the part with the
         largest number of marks is likely to provide the most evidence.

     w   Candidates that score very highly on the content marks need not necessarily automatically gain [1] for quality (and vice versa).

Answer all questions. Answers must be written within the answer boxes provided.

1.   The addition of some forms of nitrogen fertilizer to soil can lead to acidification. As a strategy
     to combat this, farmers will often undertake ‘liming’ to combat acidification. This involves
     adding lime to return the pH to neutral.

3.   Duckweed (Lemna minor) is a small flowering plant that floats on water. Duckweed can
     reproduce rapidly using asexual reproduction, giving rise to dense populations.




                                                                                                     2 mm


     A group of students investigated the effect of temperature on the rate of population growth
     of duckweed. They set up three culture dishes using 500ml of filtered pond water with a pH

General Marking Instructions


     Assistant Examiners (AEs) will be contacted by their team leader (TL) through RM™ Assessor, by e-mail or telephone – if through RM™ Assessor
     or by e-mail, please reply to confirm that you have downloaded the markscheme from IBIS. The purpose of this initial contact is to allow AEs to raise
     any queries they have regarding the markscheme and its interpretation. AEs should contact their team leader through RM™ Assessor or by e-mail
     at any time if they have any problems/queries regarding marking. For any queries regarding the use of RM™ Assessor, please contact
     emarking@ibo.org.


1.     Follow the markscheme provided, award only whole marks and mark only in RED.

2.     Make sure that the question you are about to mark is highlighted in the mark panel on the right-hand side of the screen.

3.     Where a mark is awarded, a tick/check (ü) must be placed in the text at the precise point where it becomes clear that the candidate deserves
       the mark. One tick to be shown for each mark awarded.

4.     Sometimes, careful consideration is required to decide whether or not to award a mark. In these cases use RM™ Assessor annotations to support
       your decision. You are encouraged to write comments where it helps clarity, especially for re-marking purposes. Use a text box for these additional
       comments. It should be remembered that the script may be returned to the candidate.

5.     Personal codes/notations are unacceptable.

6.     Where an answer to a part question is worth no marks but the candidate has attempted the part question, use the “ZERO” annotation to
       award zero marks. Where a candidate has not attempted the part question, use the “SEEN” annotation to show you have looked at the question.
       RM™ Assessor will apply “NR” once you click complete.

7.     If a candidate has attempted more than the required number of questions within a paper or section of a paper, mark all the answers. RM™ Assessor
       will only award the highest mark or marks in line with the rubric.

8.     Ensure that you have viewed every page including any additional sheets. Please ensure that you stamp “SEEN” on any additional pages that are
       blank or where the candidate has crossed out his/her work.

9.     Mark positively. Give candidates credit for what they have achieved and for what they have got correct, rather than penalizing them for what they

Subject Details: Biology SL Paper 1B Markscheme

Candidates are required to answer all questions in Paper 1B. Maximum total = 25 marks.

1.    Each row in the “Question” column relates to the smallest subpart of the question.

2.    The maximum mark for each question subpart is indicated in the “Total” column.

3.    Each marking point in the “Answers” column is shown by means of a semicolon (;) at the end of the marking point.

4.    A question subpart may have more marking points than the total allows. This will be indicated by “max” written after the mark in the “Total” column.
      The related rubric, if necessary, will be outlined in the “Notes” column.

5.    An alternative word is indicated in the “Answers” column by a slash (/). Either word can be accepted.

6.    An alternative answer is indicated in the “Answers” column by “OR”. Either answer can be accepted.

7.    An alternative markscheme is indicated in the “Answers” column under heading ALTERNATIVE 1 etc. Either alternative can be accepted.

8.    Words inside brackets ( ) in the “Answers” column are not necessary to gain the mark.

9.    Words that are underlined are essential for the mark.

10.   The order of marking points does not have to be as in the “Answers” column, unless stated otherwise in the “Notes” column.

11.   If the candidate’s answer has the same “meaning” or can be clearly interpreted as being of equivalent significance, detail and validity as
      that in the “Answers” column then award the mark. Where this point is considered to be particularly relevant in a question it is emphasized
      by OWTTE (or words to that effect) in the “Notes” column.

12.   Remember that many candidates are writing in a second language. Effective communication is more important than grammatical accuracy.

13.   Occasionally, a part of a question may require an answer that is required for subsequent marking points. If an error is made in the first marking point
      then it should be penalized. However, if the incorrect answer is used correctly in subsequent marking points then follow through marks should be
      awarded. When marking, indicate this by adding ECF (error carried forward) on the script.

14.   Do not penalize candidates for errors in units or significant figures, unless it is specifically referred to in the “Notes” column.

1.   A long-term study looked at the effect of diets with differing fibre content in 543 children
     between the ages of 8 months and 9 years. The children were divided into groups according
     to the amount of fibre in their diet. The chart shows the sources of fibre for the 9-year-olds as
     a percentage of the total fibre intake.

General Marking Instructions


     Assistant Examiners (AEs) will be contacted by their team leader (TL) through RM™ Assessor, by e-mail or telephone – if through RM™ Assessor
     or by e-mail, please reply to confirm that you have downloaded the markscheme from IBIS. The purpose of this initial contact is to allow AEs to raise
     any queries they have regarding the markscheme and its interpretation. AEs should contact their team leader through RM™ Assessor or by e-mail
     at any time if they have any problems/queries regarding marking. For any queries regarding the use of RM™ Assessor, please contact
     emarking@ibo.org.



1.     Follow the markscheme provided, award only whole marks and mark only in RED.

2.     Make sure that the question you are about to mark is highlighted in the mark panel on the right-hand side of the screen.

3.     Where a mark is awarded, a tick/check (ü) must be placed in the text at the precise point where it becomes clear that the candidate deserves
       the mark. One tick to be shown for each mark awarded.

4.     Sometimes, careful consideration is required to decide whether or not to award a mark. In these cases use RM™ Assessor annotations to support
       your decision. You are encouraged to write comments where it helps clarity, especially for re-marking purposes. Use a text box for these
       additional comments. It should be remembered that the script may be returned to the candidate.

5.     Personal codes/notations are unacceptable.

6.     Where an answer to a part question is worth no marks but the candidate has attempted the part question, use the “ZERO” annotation to award
       zero marks. Where a candidate has not attempted the part question, use the “SEEN” annotation to show you have looked at the question.
       RM™ Assessor will apply “NR” once you click complete.

7.     If a candidate has attempted more than the required number of questions within a paper or section of a paper, mark all the answers. RM™ Assessor
       will only award the highest mark or marks in line with the rubric.

8.     Ensure that you have viewed every page including any additional sheets. Please ensure that you stamp “SEEN” on any additional pages that are
       blank or where the candidate has crossed out his/her work.

9.     Mark positively. Give candidates credit for what they have achieved and for what they have got correct, rather than penalizing them for what they
       have got wrong. However, a mark should not be awarded where there is contradiction within an answer. Make a comment to this effect using a
       text box or the “CON” stamp.

Subject Details: Biology SL Paper 2 Markscheme

Candidates are required to answer all questions in Section A and one out of two questions in Section B. Maximum total = 50 marks.

1.    Each row in the “Question” column relates to the smallest subpart of the question.

2.    The maximum mark for each question subpart is indicated in the “Total” column.

3.    Each marking point in the “Answers” column is shown by means of a semicolon (;) at the end of the marking point.

4.    A question subpart may have more marking points than the total allows. This will be indicated by “max” written after the mark in the “Total” column.
      The related rubric, if necessary, will be outlined in the “Notes” column.

5.    An alternative word is indicated in the “Answers” column by a slash (/). Either word can be accepted.

6.    An alternative answer is indicated in the “Answers” column by “OR”. Either answer can be accepted.

7.    An alternative markscheme is indicated in the “Answers” column under heading ALTERNATIVE 1 etc. Either alternative can be accepted.

8.    Words inside brackets ( ) in the “Answers” column are not necessary to gain the mark.

9.    Words that are underlined are essential for the mark.

10.   The order of marking points does not have to be as in the “Answers” column, unless stated otherwise in the “Notes” column.

11.   If the candidate’s answer has the same “meaning” or can be clearly interpreted as being of equivalent significance, detail and validity as
      that in the “Answers” column then award the mark. Where this point is considered to be particularly relevant in a question it is emphasized
      by OWTTE (or words to that effect) in the “Notes” column.

12.   Remember that many candidates are writing in a second language. Effective communication is more important than grammatical accuracy.

13.   Occasionally, a part of a question may require an answer that is required for subsequent marking points. If an error is made in the first marking point
      then it should be penalized. However, if the incorrect answer is used correctly in subsequent marking points then follow through marks should be
      awarded. When marking, indicate this by adding ECF (error carried forward) on the script.

14.   Do not penalize candidates for errors in units or significant figures, unless it is specifically referred to in the “Notes” column.

Extended response questions - quality of construction

     w   Extended response questions for SLP2 carry a mark total of [16]. Of these marks, [15] are awarded for content and [1] for the quality of
         the answer.

     w   [1] for quality is to be awarded when:
          w    the candidate’s answers are clear enough to be understood without re-reading.
          w    the candidate has answered the question succinctly with little or no repetition or irrelevant material.

     w   It is important to judge this on the overall answer, taking into account the answers to all parts of the question. Although, the part with the
         largest number of marks is likely to provide the most evidence.

     w   Candidates that score very highly on the content marks need not necessarily automatically gain [1] for quality (and vice versa).
