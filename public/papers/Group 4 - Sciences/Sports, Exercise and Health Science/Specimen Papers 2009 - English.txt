Answer all the questions in the spaces provided.

1.   In 1966, 5 healthy, 20 year-old men were studied extensively at baseline, after 3 weeks of bed rest,
     and after 8 weeks of intensive dynamic exercise training. The results of this original investigation
     as well as data from a 30 year follow up of the baseline evaluation of these same 5 men have been
     published. The 1996 study was designed to investigate the cardiovascular adaptations to exercise
     training in these 5 middle aged men. This investigation sought to assess the degree to which the
     age-associated decline in aerobic power was attributable to physical inactivity and deconditioning
     and to gain insight into the specific mechanisms contributing to any observed recovery of
     aerobic power.

     The table below shows the results obtained from a maximal treadmill exercise test.
