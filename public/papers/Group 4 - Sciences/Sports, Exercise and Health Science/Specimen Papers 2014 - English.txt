           (ii)   net zero impulse                                                                       [1]

           (iii) net negative impulse                                                                    [1]

     (c)   in the early stage Powell is accelerating/there is positive acceleration, in the final

           (ii)   (glycogen is formed) by linking together large numbers of glucose
                  molecules;
                  glycogen is formed by a condensation reaction with glucose molecules /
                  polysaccharides form through a process known as condensation;
                  condensation may occur many times to yield polysaccharides;                   [2 max]

     (b)   glucagon is a hormone released by the pancreas;
           glucagon increases the blood glucose level when it falls below normal levels;
           glucagon accelerates the conversion of glycogen in the liver into glucose /
           glycogenolysis;
           glucagon is released during exercise/after fasting;                                  [2 max]

           Award [1] for each correct row.

     (d)   during the initial minutes of recovery from the 100 m sprint oxygen demand
           remains elevated temporarily;
           oxygen consumption immediately after the 100 m sprint exceeds resting oxygen
           consumption / EPOC is in addition to the oxygen normally consumed at rest;
           after several minutes of recovery from the 100 m sprint breathing rate will return
           to resting values;
           during the initial stage of the 100 m sprint some oxygen is borrowed from the
           oxygen stores (hemoglobin and myoglobin) and the oxygen must be replenished;
           breathing/respiratory rate remains temporarily elevated following the 100 m sprint
           in an effort to clear CO2 that has accumulated in the tissues (as a by-product of
           metabolism);
           body temperature is elevated from participation in the 100 m sprint, keeping
           (metabolic and) breathing/respiratory rates temporarily high (requiring more
           oxygen);
           higher arousal from participation in the 100 m sprint elevates adrenaline levels
           and this contributes to elevated (metabolism and) breathing/respiratory rates
           (requiring more oxygen);
           EPOC helps rebuild ATP and PCr and clear lactate produced by anaerobic
           metabolism during the 100 m sprint;                                                  [3 max]

5.   (a)   Award [1 max] for a correct method and a correct description.

           brevity e.g. giving a learner a small amount of information at a time to avoid
           overload;

           clarity e.g. avoid trying to learn or teach two similar but distinct items in the same
           session, as the memory of one may interfere with the memory of the other;

           chunking e.g. learners can hold more in the short-term memory if the information
           is “chunked”, instead of being presented as individual items;

           organization e.g. we remember more easily if we organize the way in which we
           are to learn and ensure that the information is meaningful / coaches often use
           imagery to aid organization / OWTTE;

           association e.g. good coaches and teachers always ensure that new learning is
           linked to what players already know;

           practice e.g. no skill is learned without practice / practice shuttles the image of the
           skill backwards and forwards between the short-term and long-term memory and
           in doing so establishes what is known as a “memory trace”/pathway;

           rehearsal e.g. processed mentally or physically;

           coding e.g. name/label sets of information;                                               [2 max]

(c)   (i)    fine and gross:
             this is concerned with the precision of accuracy of movement / involvement
             of muscle mass;
             gross motor skills involve large muscle movements e.g. running/jumping;
             fine motor skills involve more intricate movements using small muscle
             groups e.g. rifle shooting / finger action across the seam of cricket ball;       [3]

      (ii)   externally and internally paced skill:
             this refers to the timing of the movements / the extent to which the
             performer has control over the timing of the movement;
             external paced skills are sailing/windsurfing/receiving a serve;
             internal paced skills are javelin throw/gymnastics routine;                       [3]

(e)   open loop: [3 max]

      Award [1 max] for a suitable sporting example.
      e.g. hitting a moving tennis ball during a game of tennis / catching a tennis ball
      during a match / a motor skill that involves a non-stable, unpredictable
      environment where an object/environmental context is in motion and determines
      when to begin the action;

      discussion: [2 max]
      this theory suggests that when a skill is being learned an overall plan/programme
      of that skill is built up in long-term memory;
      skills are built up in a hierarchical or schematic way i.e. the executive programme
      is made up of a number of (sub) routines, which consist of small routine units;
      the programme is ordered sequentially / it is able to tell the muscles in what order
      to produce the appropriate subroutines e.g. learning a skill means practising the
      skill so that the subroutines are properly sequenced and coordinated and also
      become increasingly automated and subconscious;
      once this skill is learned, open loop theory suggests that it can be put into action
      without feedback being used to control the movement;
      knowledge of results is used only at the end of the movement to give the learner
      feedback on the outcome;

      closed loop: [3 max]

      Award [1 max] for a suitable sporting example.
      e.g. shooting an arrow at a stationery target / hitting a golf ball off a tee / a motor
      skill performed in a stationery environment where the performer determines when
      to begin the action;

      discussion: [2 max]
      motor programme is structured in the same way (as open loop) but its commands
      can be countermanded/reversed by the need to correct errors;
      kinaesthetic/internal feedback is used;
      closed loop movement control is more effective with skills requiring slower limb
      movements or movements taking place over longer periods of time;
      it is suggested that performers are continually moving between open and closed
      loop control;
      short-term memory compares with the long-term memory, if the match is good the
      movement continues;
      short-term memory compares with the long-term memory, if there is a mismatch
      the learner tries to correct the error;                                                   [6 max]

6.   (a)   a test is reliable when you undertake a retest under the same conditions as the
           original and a similar result is obtained;
           a test needs to be consistent to show the effect of changes in the variables;
           reliability in any kind of testing questions the accuracy of test results;            [2 max]

     (b)   a correlation is used to describe/measure the relationship/relatedness between
           variables;
           correlation does not imply a causal relationship;
           correlation indicates the magnitude/amount of relationship / a degree of linear
           association between the two variables;
           the correlation coefficient can be a positive or negative value;
           a value of zero suggests no relationship;
           correlations can, in some cases, help predict outcomes;                               [2 max]

     (c)   Advantages: [2 max]
           less stressful on individuals / minimize risk of injury;
           can perform repeats/other tests within a shorter time frame;
           they generally have a good correlation to VO2 max (80 % – 90 %) / can be
           extrapolated to estimate VO2 max ;
           minimal equipment needed for some examples e.g. Harvard Step Test,
           12 Minute Run, Astrand test;

           Disadvantages: [2 max]
           hard to set the intensity level accurately;
           pacing is needed (for 12 Minute Run) which is difficult;
           the correlation between test results and cardiovascular respiratory fitness is not
           perfect;
           VO2 max is an estimation as opposed to an actual measure;
           level of motivation required;                                                         [4 max]

     (d)   (i)    e.g. ruler drop test / reaction time sticks;

                  best result from three trials is recorded (ensuring recovery time between
                  each trial);                                                                   [2 max]

B1. A study was conducted into achievement goal orientation in youth sport. Achievement goal
    orientation for a high task versus a high outcome group was assessed on several variables;
    performance satisfaction, conflict with team-mates, sports enjoyment and friendship.
    Higher scores are associated with a stronger correlation between variable and group.
    The results are shown in the table below.

D1. A study investigated the relationship between cardio-respiratory fitness levels and body
    composition in Irish boys aged 7 and 10 years. Body mass index (BMI) was used to divide the
    boys into three groups based on body composition; normal weight (NW), overweight (OW)
    and obese (O). The 20 m multistage running test was used to estimate cardio-respiratory fitness
    (VO2 max). The graph below shows the relationship between body composition and VO2 max
    reported in the study.

Option A — Optimizing physiological performance

A1. (a)    (i)    interval running with different work-to-rest ratios;
                  continuous / long, slow distance running;                                        [2]

           (ii)   all nearly identical/equal/similar/(approximately) 680 seconds                   [1]
                  Award [1] only if all three groups are referred to.

           (iii) (group) 1                                                                         [1]

           (iv) the 1:3 work-to-rest ratio allowed for too much recovery time between work
                bouts;
                the 1:1 work-to-rest ratio provides a greater aerobic stress/overload / OWTTE;
                the group 1 programme resulted in an improved anaerobic threshold compared
                to group 3;
                the intense group 1 programme provided greater training stimulus;
                group 2 recovery time was too long for a maximum training effect;              [1 max]

           (v)    fartlek training / speed play;
                  cross-training / circuit training with a high aerobic component;
                  uphill running;
                  high-altitude training;                                                     [1 max]

     (b)   training: [2 max]
           is performing exercise in an organized manner on a regular basis with a specific
           goal in mind;
           there needs to be a balance between training, competition and rest/recovery;
           the principles of progressive overload, specificity and reversibility govern the
           nature and extent of physiological and metabolic adaptations to training;

           over-training:
           is when an athlete attempts to do more training than he/she is able to tolerate
           physically and/or mentally / exceeds more than they can cope with;
           is a condition in which underperformance is experienced despite continued or even
           increased training;                                                               [3 max]

A2. (a)   humans require energy to produce heat in order to maintain the internal body
          temperature at around 37 °C;
          humans require energy to perform mechanical work, which includes exercise;
          the body utilizes oxygen and food to produce energy;
          during biochemical reactions heat energy (enthalpy) becomes available;
          ATP is the only form of chemical energy that can be converted into other forms of
          energy used by living cells;
          during exercise there is a net increase in ATP production;
          typically 60 % to 70 % of the total energy expended by the human body is degraded
          to heat / all biochemical reactions are inefficient, which means that not all the
          energy released can be conserved or used to do work, therefore some energy is
          always lost as heat / OWTTE;
          when metabolism increases, additional heat is produced / when metabolism
          decreases, less heat is produced;
          constant rate of heat production at rest if within a stable thermoneutral
          environment;                                                                      [2 max]

    (b)   sweating is the body’s major way of getting rid of excess body heat, which is
          produced by metabolism and working muscles;
          the amount of sweat produced depends upon air temperature and the level of
          physical activity;
          the thermoregulatory centre is sensitive to the temperature of the blood / elevated
          blood temperature results in nerve signals being sent to the sweat glands;
          sweat is formed by the secretory portion of the sweat glands / sweating is an active
          secretory process from sweat glands;
          sweat secretion over a given region of skin is dependent on the density of the sweat
          glands (i.e. number / cm2)/on the amount of sweat secreted per gland;
          sweating provides moisture which evaporates from the skin surface to try to
          maintain homeostasis;
          sweat is formed through the filtration of plasma;
          sweat is mostly water with some sodium and chloride and a low concentration of
          potassium;
          during exercise in hot, dry environments there is likely to be increased peripheral
          blood flow;                                                                          [2 max]

    (c)   acclimatize in similar temperature and/or humidity to the competition environment
          prior to the sports competition;
          wear lightweight, loose-fitting clothing during competition;
          avoid lengthy warm-up periods on the day of the competition;
          know his/her sweat rate and the amount of fluid that he/she should drink/ingest;
          ensure that acclimatization training allows for frequent hydration;
          hydrate to ensure that his/her body weight is within 1 % of his/her normal body
          weight during the day of the competition;
          learn how to monitor his/her urine colour with reference to hydration status;
          exercise in an environmental chamber;
          tapering;                                                                         [2 max]

     (d)   the body surface area is directly related to the heat exchange between the body and
           the environment;
           individuals with a greater body surface area relative to mass should speed
           up/expedite heat dispersion;
           heat transfer between the body and the environment is related to the exposed
           surface area;
           the processes of sweat evaporation and convection eliminate body heat at the skin
           surface;
           when the air/ambient temperature is lower than skin temperature, individuals with a
           greater body surface area relative to mass should reduce heat
           storage/thermoregulate more effectively during exercise;
           when the air/ambient temperature is higher than skin temperature a higher body
           surface area-to-body mass ratio acts disadvantageously to absorb body heat from
           the environment;                                                                    [3 max]

Option B — Psychology of sport

B1. (a)    (i)    high outcome group                                                                    [1]

           (ii)   sports enjoyment                                                                      [1]

           (iii) high outcome group                                                                     [1]

     (b)   outcome goal-oriented: [2 max]
           judges success by how they compare to others;
           emotionally fragile when they perceive they may be evaluated negatively;
           is more likely to reduce their efforts/cease trying/make excuses;
           is more likely to select tasks in which they are guaranteed success;
           is associated with higher levels of competitive state anxiety;

           task goal-oriented: [2 max]
           has a strong work ethic / good at maintaining effort without immediate reward;
           does not fear failure;
           is protected from disappointment/frustration / less prone to emotional changes as a
           result of negative outcomes;
           is protected from having a lack of motivation when the performance of others is
           superior;
           selects realistic tasks and challenges;
           associated with intrinsic motivation/effort/persistence/enjoyment;                  [3 max]



B2. (a)    internal imagery:
           is predominately visual / is visualizing participation in the event, what it feels like
           to compete;
           a suitable sporting example of the use of internal imagery;

           external imagery:
           is visualizing yourself from the outside, as if on video;
           a suitable sporting example of the use of external imagery;                                  [4]

     (b)   before and after practice e.g. to focus concentration / to review skills and strategies;
           before and after competition e.g. part of a pre-event routine or after competition, to
           replay success and increase self-confidence;
           during breaks in the action e.g. to correct an error in the execution of a skill;
           during personal time e.g. to develop routines of deep breathing and positive
           self-talk whilst imagining a successful penalty in football/hockey;
           when recovering from injury e.g. to reduce anxiety about the injury / to rehearse the
           emotions they anticipate experiencing upon return to competition;                        [3 max]
                                                       –6–                SPEC/4/SPEXS/SP3/ENG/TZ0/XX/M


B3.   (a)   when measuring personality we should consider both situations and psychological
            traits to understand and predict behaviour;
            sport-specific measures of personality predict behaviour in sport settings better than
            general personality tests do;
            CSAI-2;
            Cattell developed a personality inventory with 16 independent personality factors
            (16 PF) that he believed describe a person who is participating in sport / OWTTE;
            all psychological tests contain a degree of measurement error/use caution in
            interpreting their results;
            benefits and limitations of questionnaires and amounts of data;
            benefits and limitations of observation and ecological validity;
            benefits and limitations of interviews and complex/“rich” information;
            individuals need special training in psychological assessment to be qualified to
            interpret results from personality tests;
            using personality inventories alone to select athletes for a team/to cut them from a
            team is an abuse of testing (that should not be tolerated);
            no specific personality profile has been found that consistently distinguishes
            athletes from non-athletes;                                                                    [4 max]

      (b)   SCAT:
            is a useful predictor from a practical perspective because it is not always feasible to test
            athletes immediately before competition to assess how anxious they feel at that moment;
            there are important implications for sports coaches, because athletes who have high
            competitive trait anxiety are more sensitive to criticism, failure, and making mistakes
            (i.e. positive reinforcement, encouragement and support are crucial to helping such
            athletes improve their performance);
            a weak prediction of an athlete’s likely state anxiety;

            is considered to be a reliable and valid self-report questionnaire;
            is easy to administer;
            can be used with both small and large groups;
            cannot be administered during competition;

     (c)   e.g. “I have no one to walk with” decreased post-walking scheme;
           due to forming friendships with other participants / gaining confidence / increased
           enjoyment;

           e.g. “I worry about my personal safety” decreased post-walking scheme;
           due to walking with other participants / gaining confidence / safety in numbers;      [2 max]
           Accept other reasonable responses.

     (d)   environmental – prompts/contracting/perceived choice;
           reinforcement approaches – rewards for attendance and participation / external
           feedback / self-monitoring;
           goal setting and cognitive approaches – associative versus dissociative focus during
           exercise;
           social support approaches – role of significant others (spouse/family/friends) /
           joining in/adjusting routines/transportation/providing equipment;
           relapse prevention;
           motivational strategies;                                                             [3 max]


C2. (a)    (i)    (a stroke is) caused by a lack of blood flow/oxygen to the brain;
                  a condition in which blood supply to some part of the brain is impaired (due
                  to a blocked/burst artery);                                                  [1 max]

           (ii)   decreased bone mineral content that causes increased bone porosity;
                  osteoporosis means bone (osteo) that is porous (porosis);
                  loss of bone mineral density;
                  accelerated bone loss;
                  a disease that causes bones to weaken/become brittle/break more easily;        [1 max]

     (b)   energy balance is the state at which the number of calories eaten equals the number
           of calories used / energy/caloric balance is the main factor that affects body
           weight control;
           a positive energy balance means that you consume more calories than you expend,
           i.e. you will gain body weight;
           energy balance can be unbalanced to cause weight loss by reducing caloric intake
           below the daily energy requirements/maintaining caloric intake and increasing
           energy expenditure (physical activity)/combining reduced caloric intake with
           increased energy expenditure (physical activity) / OWTTE;
           metabolic rates affect energy/caloric balance;
           basal Metabolic Rate (BMR) indicates the energy/calories you expend simply by
           being alive/resting Metabolic Rate (RMR) is the energy/calories resulting from rest
           plus BMR;
           increased muscle mass from physical activity results in increased BMR / reduced
           muscle mass from physical inactivity results in decreased BMR;
           energy balance is affected by genetics/body size/body composition/level of
           physical activity;                                                                  [4 max]

          to reduce the need for medication;
          to reduce the risk of disease reoccurrence / to limit deterioration of hypokinetic
          disease/possible cognitive decline;
          to help overcome social problems and psychological distress;
          to increase energy levels;                                                         [2 max]

Option D — Nutrition for sport, exercise and health

D1. (a)    54.5 ml kg–1min–1                                                                        [1]
           Accept answers in the range 54 – 55 ml kg–1min–1.
     (b)   body composition is inversely related/negatively correlated to cardio-respiratory
           fitness/VO2 max / OWTTE;
           VO2 max/cardio-respiratory fitness reduces by 4 ml kg–1min–1 between NW
           and OW;
           VO2 max/cardio-respiratory fitness reduces by 4 ml kg–1min–1 between OW and O;
           VO2 max/cardio-respiratory fitness reduces by 8 ml kg–1min–1 between NW and O; [3 max]

     (c)   Body Mass Index/BMI fails to consider the body’s proportional
           composition / factors other than excess body fat (bone, muscle mass, increased
           plasma volume due to training) affect the numerator of the BMI equation;
           a high BMI could lead to an incorrect interpretation of over-fatness in lean
           individuals with excessive muscle mass due to training;
           there is a possibility of misclassifying an individual as overweight or obese using
           BMI standards with large sized athletes (e.g. field athletes / bodybuilders/rugby
           players);
           racial differences i.e. BMI is derived mainly from caucasian populations – but there
           is evidence that other racial groups may differ from caucasians in their levels of
           total body fat at a given BMI;
           some countries use different cut-off points, with an emphasis on health risks
           (e.g. heart disease/diabetes) instead of weight;
           BMI assumes an average degree of maturation, but adolescents can go through
           puberty early or late;
           BMI can underestimate fatness on those with a less lean body mass (e.g. the
           elderly);                                                                            [3 max]

(d)   water intake helps to maintain hydration/avoid dehydration;
      water intake helps to maintain body temperature/thermoregulation;
      water intake helps to maintain plasma volume;
      water loss during prolonged exercise may lead to a decline in athletic performance;
      water loss during prolonged exercise may lead to serious medical problems
      (e.g. heat exhaustion or heat stroke);
      water loss during prolonged exercise may result in stress on the cardiovascular
      system;
      water loss during prolonged exercise may result in inadequate heat transfer to the
      skin and environment;
      water loss during prolonged exercise is associated with increased plasma
      osmolality;
      water loss during prolonged exercise is associated with decreased plasma volume;
      water loss during prolonged exercise may affect the intracellular and extracellular
      electrolyte balance;                                                                [4 max]
