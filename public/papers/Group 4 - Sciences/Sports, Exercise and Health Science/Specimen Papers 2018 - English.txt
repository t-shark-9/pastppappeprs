1.   A study investigated the changes in heart rate and core temperature for pit crew during
     car racing.

     The pit crew are athletes who possess speed, power and agility. For safety reasons they
     wear a helmet and a heavy fire-retardant suit.

     Two groups of three people (Team 1 and Team 2) were monitored before, during and at the
     end of the race. Core temperatures and heart rates were measured at fixed time intervals,
     and the mean values were calculated for each team.

     Core temperature data for a control individual who was not part of the crew were also
     recorded.

     The error bars in the charts below show the range of values obtained for the measurements
     of each team.

1.    Follow the markscheme provided, award only whole marks and mark only in RED.

2.    Make sure that the question you are about to mark is highlighted in the mark panel on the right-hand side of the screen.

3.    Where a mark is awarded, a tick/check () must be placed in the text at the precise point where it becomes clear that the candidate
      deserves the mark. One tick to be shown for each mark awarded.

4.    Sometimes, careful consideration is required to decide whether or not to award a mark. In these cases use RM™ Assessor annotations to
      support your decision. You are encouraged to write comments where it helps clarity, especially for re-marking purposes. Use a text box for
      these additional comments. It should be remembered that the script may be returned to the candidate.

5.    Personal codes/notations are unacceptable.

6.    Where an answer to a part question is worth no marks but the candidate has attempted the part question, use the “zero” annotation to
      award zero marks. Where a candidate has not attempted the part question, use the “SEEN” annotation to show you have looked at the
      question. RM™ Assessor will apply NR once you click complete.

7.    If a candidate has attempted more than the required number of questions within a paper or section of a paper, mark all the answers.
      RM™ Assessor will only award the highest mark or marks in line with the rubric.

8.    Ensure that you have viewed every page including any additional sheets. Please ensure that you stamp “SEEN” on any additional pages
      that are blank or where the candidate has crossed out his/her work.

9.    There is no need to stamp an annotation when a candidate has not chosen an optional question in Section B. RM™ Assessor will apply
      NR once you click complete.

10.   Mark positively. Give candidates credit for what they have achieved and for what they have got correct, rather than penalizing them for
      what they have got wrong. However, a mark should not be awarded where there is contradiction within an answer. Make a comment to
      this effect using a text box or the “CON” stamp.

Mark Allocation

Candidates are required to answer ALL questions in Section A [50 marks] and TWO questions in Section B [40 marks].
Maximum total = [90 marks].

1.    Each row in the “Question” column relates to the smallest subpart of the question.
2.    The maximum mark for each question subpart is indicated in the “Total” column.
3.    Each marking point in the “Answers” column is shown by means of a tick () at the end of the marking point.
4.    A question subpart may have more marking points than the total allows. This will be indicated by “max” written after the mark in the
      “Total” column. The related rubric, if necessary, will be outlined in the “Notes” column.
5.    An alternative wording is indicated in the “Answers” column by a slash (/). Either wording can be accepted.
6.    An alternative answer is indicated in the “Answers” column by “OR” on the line between the alternatives. Either answer can be accepted.

7.    Words in angled brackets ‹ › in the “Answers” column are not necessary to gain the mark.

8.    Words that are underlined are essential for the mark.
9.    The order of marking points does not have to be as in the “Answers” column, unless stated otherwise in the “Notes” column.
10.   If the candidate’s answer has the same “meaning” or can be clearly interpreted as being of equivalent significance, detail and validity as
      that in the “Answers” column then award the mark. Where this point is considered to be particularly relevant in a question it is emphasized
      by OWTTE (or words to that effect).
11.   Remember that many candidates are writing in a second language. Effective communication is more important than grammatical accuracy.
12.   Occasionally, a part of a question may require an answer that is required for subsequent marking points. If an error is made in the first
      marking point then it should be penalized. However, if the incorrect answer is used correctly in subsequent marking points then follow
      through marks should be awarded. When marking, indicate this by adding ECF (error carried forward) on the script. “ECF acceptable”
      will be displayed in the “Notes” column.
13.   Do not penalize candidates for errors in units or significant figures, unless it is specifically referred to in the “Notes” column.

           (fight-or-flight response) OWTTE 
           effects of adrenaline/epinephrine include increased heart rate 
  f        error bars on the graphs show a large variation in core temperatures 

           are not significant 
  g        there is a rise in heart rate during the race, but there is no evidence of a
           significant change in core temperature 
           the increase in heart rate might be linked to an increase in rate of respiration 

             The three main functions are:
             sensory, receives sensory impulses, player sees the ball flight/hears the impact of the strike 
             association, interprets information and storing input and initiates a response ‹forms a motor
             programme›, players assess spin/speed of ball, compares to previous motor patterns and
             plans a response 
             motor, effector mechanism, transmits impulses to effectors, players response eg ‹topspin›

5.   A study examined achievement goal orientation (high task group versus high outcome group)
     in Spanish male football players aged between 9 and 12 years. Achievement goal orientation
     profile differences were assessed on the following variables: positive friendship; conflict with
     teammates; football enjoyment and satisfaction (with own or team performance). Higher
     scores are associated with a stronger correlation between variable and group. The profile
     differences are shown in the table below.

16.   A study investigated the relationship between cardio-respiratory fitness levels and body
      composition in Irish girls aged 7 and 10 years. Body mass index (BMI) was used to
      divide the girls into three groups based on body composition; normal weight (NW),
      overweight (OW) and obese (O). The 20 m multistage running test was used to estimate
      cardio-respiratory fitness (VO2 max). The graph below shows the relationship between body
      composition and VO2 max reported in the study.

1.    Follow the markscheme provided, award only whole marks and mark only in RED.

2.    Make sure that the question you are about to mark is highlighted in the mark panel on the right-hand side of the screen.

3.    Where a mark is awarded, a tick/check () must be placed in the text at the precise point where it becomes clear that the candidate
      deserves the mark. One tick to be shown for each mark awarded.

4.    Sometimes, careful consideration is required to decide whether or not to award a mark. In these cases use RM™ Assessor annotations to
      support your decision. You are encouraged to write comments where it helps clarity, especially for re-marking purposes. Use a text box for
      these additional comments. It should be remembered that the script may be returned to the candidate.

5.    Personal codes/notations are unacceptable.

6.    Where an answer to a part question is worth no marks but the candidate has attempted the part question, use the “zero” annotation to
      award zero marks. Where a candidate has not attempted the part question, use the “SEEN” annotation to show you have looked at the
      question. RM™ Assessor will apply NR once you click complete.

7.    If a candidate has attempted more than the required number of questions within a paper or section of a paper, mark all the answers.
      RM™ Assessor will only award the highest mark or marks in line with the rubric.

8.    Ensure that you have viewed every page including any additional sheets. Please ensure that you stamp “SEEN” on any additional pages
      that are blank or where the candidate has crossed out his/her work.

9.    There is no need to stamp an annotation when a candidate has not chosen an optional question in Section B. RM™ Assessor will apply
      NR once you click complete.

10.   Mark positively. Give candidates credit for what they have achieved and for what they have got correct, rather than penalizing them for
      what they have got wrong. However, a mark should not be awarded where there is contradiction within an answer. Make a comment to
      this effect using a text box or the “CON” stamp.

Mark Allocation

Candidates are required to answer questions from TWO of the Options [2×30 marks]. Maximum total = [60 marks].

1.    Each row in the “Question” column relates to the smallest subpart of the question.

2.    The maximum mark for each question subpart is indicated in the “Total” column.

3.    Each marking point in the “Answers” column is shown by means of a tick ( ) at the end of the marking point.

4.    A question subpart may have more marking points than the total allows. This will be indicated by “max” written after the mark in the “Total”
      column. The related rubric, if necessary, will be outlined in the “Notes” column.

5.    An alternative wording is indicated in the “Answers” column by a slash (/). Either wording can be accepted.

6.    An alternative answer is indicated in the “Answers” column by “OR” on the line between the alternatives. Either answer can be accepted.

7.    Words in angled brackets ‹ › in the “Answers” column are not necessary to gain the mark.

8.    Words that are underlined are essential for the mark.

9.    The order of marking points does not have to be as in the “Answers” column, unless stated otherwise in the “Notes” column.

10.   If the candidate’s answer has the same “meaning” or can be clearly interpreted as being of equivalent significance, detail and validity as
      that in the “Answers” column then award the mark. Where this point is considered to be particularly relevant in a question it is emphasized
      by OWTTE (or words to that effect).

11.   Remember that many candidates are writing in a second language. Effective communication is more important than grammatical accuracy.

12.   Occasionally, a part of a question may require an answer that is required for subsequent marking points. If an error is made in the first
      marking point then it should be penalized. However, if the incorrect answer is used correctly in subsequent marking points then follow
      through marks should be awarded. When marking, indicate this by adding ECF (error carried forward) on the script. “ECF acceptable” will
      be displayed in the “Notes” column.

13.   Do not penalize candidates for errors in units or significant figures, unless it is specifically referred to in the “Notes” column.
