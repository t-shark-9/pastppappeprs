1.   The data below is from an experiment used to measure the enthalpy change for the combustion of
     1 mole of sucrose (common table sugar), C12 H 22 O11 (s). The time-temperature data was taken from a
     data-logging software programme.

     (d)   A hypothesis is suggested that TNT, 2-methyl-1,3,5-trinitrobenzene, is a powerful
           explosive because it has:

		         • a large enthalpy of combustion
		         • a high reaction rate
		         • a large volume of gas generated upon combustion

           Use your answer in part (c)(i) and the following data to evaluate this hypothesis.
