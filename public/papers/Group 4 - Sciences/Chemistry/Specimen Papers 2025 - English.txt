2.   A student investigates the effect of exposure to the air on the ascorbic acid (vitamin C)
     concentration in a specific orange juice. Equal volumes of orange juice are sealed into
     identical flasks and placed in a refrigerator for two weeks. The samples in the refrigerator are
     exposed to the air by removing the stopper for a different number of hours each day as shown.

                                                                         Stopper

     (b)      The concentration of ascorbic acid is determined by titration with a standard iodine
              solution. Every few days, 10.00 cm3 of orange juice is removed from each sample,
              diluted to 100.0 cm3, and titrated.

              (i)      Suggest why the juice is diluted before titration.                                                                                  [1]

                       exposed for zero hours.                                                                                                             [1]

              Emission spectra of one-electron systems can be explained using a model with
              the electron attracted to the nucleus by an electrostatic force.

              This model predicts that the electron occupies discrete energy levels. Some energy
              levels for the He+ ion are shown.

4.   Hydrochloric acid is an important chemical reactant and industrial chemical.

     (a)      A pH probe is placed in a small volume of 0.10 mol dm-3 solution of hydrochloric acid.

2.   A student investigates the effect of exposure to the air on the ascorbic acid (vitamin C)
     concentration in a specific orange juice. Equal volumes of orange juice are sealed into
     identical flasks and placed in a refrigerator for two weeks. The samples in the refrigerator are
     exposed to the air by removing the stopper for a different number of hours each day as shown.

                                                                         Stopper

     (b)      The concentration of ascorbic acid is determined by titration with a standard iodine
              solution. Every few days, 10.00 cm3 of orange juice is removed from each sample,
              diluted to 100.0 cm3, and titrated.

              (i)      Suggest why the juice is diluted before titration.                                                                                  [1]

                       exposed for zero hours.                                                                                                             [1]

2.   Scientific models are used to explain the structure of matter.

     (a)   An α-particle is a helium-4 nucleus. In an experiment, α-particles are accelerated
           towards a thin sheet of gold and their resulting paths are detected, giving evidence of
           the positive charge of the nucleus.
