     The container moves under the influence of gravity and eventually falls back to the bottom
     of the tower.  Most of the air is removed from the tower so that air resistance is negligible.  
     While in flight, the container and its contents are in free-fall.

     (a)   The container is fired vertically upwards with initial speed 48 m s–1. Determine the time
           that the container is in flight.                                                                                                                 [2]

1.     Each row in the “Question” column relates to the smallest subpart of the question.
2.     The maximum mark for each question subpart is indicated in the “Total” column.
3.     Each marking point in the “Answers” column is shown by means of a tick () at the end of the marking point.
4.     A question subpart may have more marking points than the total allows. This will be indicated by “max” written after the mark in the “Total” column.
       The related rubric, if necessary, will be outlined in the “Notes” column.
5.     An alternative wording is indicated in the “Answers” column by a slash (/). Either wording can be accepted.
6.     An alternative answer is indicated in the “Answers” column by “OR” on the line between the alternatives. Either answer can be accepted.
7.     Words in angled brackets ‹   › in the “Answers” column are not necessary to gain the mark.
8.     Words that are underlined are essential for the mark.

9.     The order of marking points does not have to be as in the “Answers” column, unless stated otherwise in the “Notes” column.

10.    If the candidate’s answer has the same “meaning” or can be clearly interpreted as being of equivalent significance, detail and validity as that in the
       “Answers” column then award the mark. Where this point is considered to be particularly relevant in a question it is emphasized by OWTTE
       (or words to that effect) in the “Notes” column.

11.    Remember that many candidates are writing in a second language. Effective communication is more important than grammatical accuracy.

12.   Occasionally, a part of a question may require an answer that is required for subsequent marking points. If an error is made in the first marking point then it
      should be penalized. However, if the incorrect answer is used correctly in subsequent marking points then follow through marks should be awarded.
      When marking, indicate this by adding ECF (error carried forward) on the script. “ECF acceptable” will be displayed in the “Notes” column.

13.   Do not penalize candidates for errors in units or significant figures, unless it is specifically referred to in the “Notes” column.

3.   In an experiment to measure the specific heat capacity of a metal, a piece of metal is placed
                                            100°C. The metal is then transferred into a calorimeter
     inside a container of boiling water at 100
     containing water at a temperature of100
                                          10 °C. The final equilibrium temperature of the water was
     measured. One source of error in this experiment is that a small mass of boiling water will be
     transferred to the calorimeter along with the metal.

                    are in opposite directions 

1.     Each row in the “Question” column relates to the smallest subpart of the question.
2.     The maximum mark for each question subpart is indicated in the “Total” column.
3.     Each marking point in the “Answers” column is shown by means of a tick () at the end of the marking point.
4.     A question subpart may have more marking points than the total allows. This will be indicated by “max” written after the mark in the “Total” column. The related
       rubric, if necessary, will be outlined in the “Notes” column.
5.     An alternative wording is indicated in the “Answers” column by a slash (/). Either wording can be accepted.
6.     An alternative answer is indicated in the “Answers” column by “OR” on the line between the alternatives. Either answer can be accepted.

7.     Words in angled brackets   ‹ › in the “Answers” column are not necessary to gain the mark.
8.     Words that are underlined are essential for the mark.
9.     The order of marking points does not have to be as in the “Answers” column, unless stated otherwise in the “Notes” column.

10.    If the candidate’s answer has the same “meaning” or can be clearly interpreted as being of equivalent significance, detail and validity as that in the
       “Answers”’ column then award the mark. Where this point is considered to be particularly relevant in a question it is emphasized by OWTTE
       (or words to that effect) in the “Notes” column.

11.    Remember that many candidates are writing in a second language. Effective communication is more important than grammatical accuracy.
                                                                                       –3–                                            SPEC/4/PHYSI/HP3/ENG/TZ0/XX/M

12.   Occasionally, a part of a question may require an answer that is required for subsequent marking points. If an error is made in the first marking point then it should
      be penalized. However, if the incorrect answer is used correctly in subsequent marking points then follow through marks should be awarded. When marking,
      indicate this by adding ECF (error carried forward) on the script. “ECF acceptable” will be displayed in the “Notes” column.

13.   Do not penalize candidates for errors in units or significant figures, unless it is specifically referred to in the “Notes” column.

1.   In the drop tower shown, containers with experiments inside of them are fired upwards inside a
     vertical tower.


                                                                                drop tower

                                 of container

                                                                                container

     The container moves under the influence of gravity and eventually falls back to the bottom
     of the tower.  Most of the air is removed from the tower so that air resistance is negligible.  
     While in flight, the container and its contents are in free-fall.

     (a)   The container is fired vertically upwards with initial speed 48 m s–1. Determine the time
           that the container is in flight.                                                                                                                 [2]

     (b)   At the end of the flight, the container of total mass 480 kg falls into a tank of expanded
           Styrofoam (polystyrene) spheres to slow it.  The container stops after moving a distance  
           of 8.0 m in the Styrofoam.  Calculate the average force that acts on the container due to
           the spheres.                                                                               [3]

                                                                                                                                                      2
                    are in opposite directions 

1.     Each row in the “Question” column relates to the smallest subpart of the question.
2.     The maximum mark for each question subpart is indicated in the “Total” column.
3.     Each marking point in the “Answers” column is shown by means of a tick () at the end of the marking point.
4.     A question subpart may have more marking points than the total allows. This will be indicated by “max” written after the mark in the “Total” column.
       The related rubric, if necessary, will be outlined in the “Notes” column.
5.     An alternative wording is indicated in the “Answers” column by a slash (/). Either wording can be accepted.
6.     An alternative answer is indicated in the “Answers” column by “OR” on the line between the alternatives. Either answer can be accepted.
7.     Words in angled brackets ‹   › in the “Answers” column are not necessary to gain the mark.
8.     Words that are underlined are essential for the mark.

9.     The order of marking points does not have to be as in the “Answers” column, unless stated otherwise in the “Notes” column.

10.    If the candidate’s answer has the same “meaning” or can be clearly interpreted as being of equivalent significance, detail and validity as that in the
       “Answers” column then award the mark. Where this point is considered to be particularly relevant in a question it is emphasized by OWTTE
       (or words to that effect) in the “Notes” column.

11.    Remember that many candidates are writing in a second language. Effective communication is more important than grammatical accuracy.
                                                                                   –3–                                           SPEC/4/PHYSI/SP2/ENG/TZ0/XX/M


12.   Occasionally, a part of a question may require an answer that is required for subsequent marking points. If an error is made in the first marking point then it
      should be penalized. However, if the incorrect answer is used correctly in subsequent marking points then follow through marks should be awarded.
      When marking, indicate this by adding ECF (error carried forward) on the script. “ECF acceptable” will be displayed in the “Notes” column.

13.   Do not penalize candidates for errors in units or significant figures, unless it is specifically referred to in the “Notes” column.

3.   In an experiment to measure the specific heat capacity of a metal, a piece of metal is placed
                                            100°C. The metal is then transferred into a calorimeter
     inside a container of boiling water at 100
     containing water at a temperature of100
                                          10 °C. The final equilibrium temperature of the water was
     measured. One source of error in this experiment is that a small mass of boiling water will be
     transferred to the calorimeter along with the metal.

     (a)   Suggest the effect of the error on the measured value of the specific heat capacity of
           the metal.                                                                                                                                       [2]

1.    Each row in the “Question” column relates to the smallest subpart of the question.
2.    The maximum mark for each question subpart is indicated in the “Total” column.
3.    Each marking point in the “Answers” column is shown by means of a tick () at the end of the marking point.
4.    A question subpart may have more marking points than the total allows. This will be indicated by “max” written after the mark in the “Total” column. The related
      rubric, if necessary, will be outlined in the “Notes” column.
5.    An alternative wording is indicated in the “Answers” column by a slash (/). Either wording can be accepted.
6.    An alternative answer is indicated in the “Answers” column by “OR” on the line between the alternatives. Either answer can be accepted.

7.    Words in angled brackets   ‹ › in the “Answers” column are not necessary to gain the mark.
8.    Words that are underlined are essential for the mark.

9.    The order of marking points does not have to be as in the “Answers” column, unless stated otherwise in the “Notes” column.

10.   If the candidate’s answer has the same “meaning” or can be clearly interpreted as being of equivalent significance, detail and validity as that in the “Answers”
      column then award the mark. Where this point is considered to be particularly relevant in a question it is emphasized by OWTTE (or words to that effect) in
      the “Notes” column.

11.   Remember that many candidates are writing in a second language. Effective communication is more important than grammatical accuracy.

12.   Occasionally, a part of a question may require an answer that is required for subsequent marking points. If an error is made in the first marking point then it should
      be penalized. However, if the incorrect answer is used correctly in subsequent marking points then follow through marks should be awarded. When marking,
      indicate this by adding ECF (error carried forward) on the script. “ECF acceptable” will be displayed in the “Notes” column.

13.   Do not penalize candidates for errors in units or significant figures, unless it is specifically referred to in the “Notes” column.
