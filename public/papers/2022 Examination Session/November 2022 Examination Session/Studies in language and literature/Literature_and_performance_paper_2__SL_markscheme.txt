                                          Assessment criteria

These notes to examiners are intended only as guidelines to assist marking and as a supplement to the
published external assessment criteria for written paper 2. They are not offered as an exhaustive and
fixed set of responses or approaches to which all answers must rigidly adhere. Good ideas or angles not
offered here should be acknowledged and rewarded as appropriate. Similarly, answers which do not
include all the ideas or approaches suggested here should not be so heavily penalized as to distort
appreciation of individuality.

With reference to criterion C, the better answers will contain examples that show an adequate sense of
stylistic features with some awareness of their effects, using critical analysis and pertinent detail.

The best answers will show a strong sense of the stylistic and comparable features of the works, as well
as the effects of these features.

Of course, some of the points listed below will appear in weaker papers but are unlikely to be
developed.

These apply to all answers below.

A maximum of [5 marks] may be awarded for each of the five criteria.

Criteria A and B

The danger of rewarding or penalizing the use of illustration/references/quotations twice in both these
categories should be avoided.

Criterion B

“Personal response” and “independence of thought” appear as the levels of the descriptors increase.
What is sought is an engaged and individual treatment of the chosen topic. Engaged and individual
essays will usually make themselves clear by showing insight into the implications of the question and
the quality and interest of the details cited in support.

The first-person singular does not automatically constitute a personal response and conversely an
impersonal academic style does not necessarily indicate a lack of personal response.

Criterion C

It is expected that every question set will provide candidates with ample opportunities to demonstrate
their awareness of the demands of this criterion. However, where a question does not explicitly offer
such opportunities, examiners should interpret criterion C broadly, to ensure that candidates are not
unfairly disadvantaged. In such cases it would be sufficient for candidates to show, as appropriate to the
question, an awareness of how elements such as plot, character, setting, structure, voice, etc, are used
by writers to meet their purposes. No matter how the question is phrased, candidates must also address
related matters of style and technique.

“Awareness” and “appreciation” of literary features are the key elements under this criterion. The mere
labelling, without appreciation, of literary features will not score the highest marks. On the other hand,
the candidate who is attentive to literary features and deals with them in a meaningful way, but who does
not consistently use the vocabulary of literary criticism, can still be awarded the higher achievement
levels.

Reminder: the term “literary features” is broad and includes elements as basic as plot, character etc,
attention to which is valid and must be rewarded as appropriate.
                                                    –4–                  N22/1/TEXTP/SP2/ENG/TZ0/XX/M


Criterion D

Any form of structuring to the essay will be rewarded if it is effective and appropriate.
Different conventions are in operation and therefore all approaches are acceptable and will be judged on
the basis of their effectiveness. Examiners should remember that structure does not exist by itself,
but any structure must be measured by appropriate reference to the terms of the question and by its
capacity to integrate these towards the development of an organized and coherent essay.

Reminder: in this criterion, supporting examples must be evaluated in terms of how fluently they are
incorporated/integrated to shape/advance the argument, not in terms of their appropriateness
or accuracy.

Criterion E

If you have reservations about awarding a 4, you should ensure that these are well founded before
awarding a 3. The broadness of achievement in level three sometimes makes examiners reluctant to
award 4.

Judgment needs to be used when dealing with lapses in grammar, spelling and punctuation; therefore,
do not unduly penalize.

Mechanical accuracy is only part of this criterion. Ensure that all the other elements are considered.

Examiners should be careful to avoid being prejudiced in their application of this criterion by
achievement levels in other criteria. It is possible to score highly on this criterion even if candidates have
scored in the lower levels on other criteria, and vice versa.

1.   An adequate to good answer will:
     • identify examples of symbolic language in each poet’s work and define the key ideas
     • attempt to keep symbolic language and the key ideas explored as the focus of consideration for
       both poets’ work
     • demonstrate sound knowledge and understanding of the selected texts through the lens of the
       focus of the question
     • provide plausible and relevant ideas that are mostly grounded in the texts
     • ensure the literary features of each poet’s work are identified, some plausible interpretation is
       provided and some comparative analysis of how those features are used to create meaning
     • provide structure and some coherency for the ideas presented with some evidence of
       successful integration of supporting examples
     • use language that is clear and coherent with only a few lapses in grammar, spelling and
       sentence structure. Some relevant literary terminology will be used with a register that is mostly
       appropriate.

     A good to excellent answer may also:
     • judiciously identify and thoughtfully explore symbolic language and its use with purpose and
       clarity
     • maintain the key ideas as the central focus of consideration for both poets’ work
     • demonstrate strong knowledge and a perceptive understanding of the selected texts through the
       lens of the focus of the question
     • systematically ground the analysis in the chosen texts while integrating evidence seamlessly
       into the body of the response
     • present perceptive and insightful ideas that are well substantiated with some possible evidence
       of independent and creative thought beyond the mechanics, including ideas such as tone, motif,
       and point of view
     • produce a pointed comparative literary analysis that considers effect, specifically to reflect the
       poets’ commentary on the key ideas
     • provide a coherent structure for the response
     • use clear, varied and precise language with very minor to no lapses in grammar, spelling and
       sentence structure. Literary terminology will be used correctly and effectively throughout with an
       appropriate register.

       successful integration of supporting examples
     • use language that is clear and coherent with only a few lapses in grammar, spelling and
       sentence structure. Some relevant literary terminology will be used with a register that is mostly
       appropriate.

       poets’ creation of a message through literary devices
     • provide a coherent structure for the response
