Notes for examiners:

1. Use the question-specific markscheme together with the markbands. Award up to the
maximum marks as indicated.

2. Whenever relevant, carry over marks must be awarded. If a candidate makes an error in
calculation, but then uses the incorrect figure appropriately and accurately in later question
parts, then the candidate may be fully rewarded. This is the “own-figure rule” and you should put
OFR on the script where you are rewarding this.

3. A candidate may be penalized for not rounding correctly, failing to give answers correct to 2
dp or, in some cases, for not including the appropriate units. However, a candidate may only be
penalized ONCE for each type of error across all subparts of (b) questions.

                                        = 4.22% OR 0.04 [1]

              An answer of 4.22% or 0.04 without working is sufficient for [1].

              For full marks to be awarded, the response must provide valid working and
              include correct units.

      (ii)    Using information from Table 1, calculate the price of this shirt in US$
              in 2019.                                                                    [2]

              For a correct demand and supply diagram with appropriate
              labelling, showing the demand curve shifting left and with the
              change in revenue shown OR for an explanation that a reduction
              in demand will lower the price and the quantity, leading to lower
              revenue.
      2       There is a correct diagram AND an accurate written response.        3–4
              For a correct demand and supply diagram with appropriate
              labelling, showing the demand curve shifting left and with the
              change in revenue shown AND for an explanation that a
              reduction in demand will lower the price and the quantity,
              leading to lower revenue.

      Candidates who incorrectly label diagrams can be awarded a maximum of [3].

      For a demand and supply diagram, the vertical axis should be price or P. The
      horizontal axis should be quantity or Q. A title is not necessary.

      Candidates may indicate the decrease in (total) revenue with shaded areas or
      numbers/letters in the diagram (eg a loss of total revenue of P1Q1-P2Q2 on the
      diagram below).

(d)   Using an international trade diagram for the US market, explain how the
      imposition of a 15 % tariff on imported garments from Bangladesh would affect
      the revenue earned by Bangladeshi producers (Text B, paragraph 2).                    [4]

            For a correct tariff diagram with appropriate labelling, showing a
            shift upwards of the world supply curve (world price line) and a fall
            in imports to the US, and showing a fall in revenue earned by
            Bangladeshi producers OR for providing an explanation that the
            tariff causes (higher prices for imports and therefore) imports to
            decrease, leading to lower revenue for the Bangladeshi producers.
      2     There is a correct diagram AND an accurate written response.            3–4
            For a correct tariff diagram with appropriate labelling, showing a
            shift upwards of the world supply curve (world price line) and a fall
            in imports to the US, and showing a fall in revenue earned by
            Bangladeshi producers AND for providing an explanation that the
            tariff causes (higher prices for imports and therefore) imports to
            decrease, leading to lower revenue for the Bangladeshi producers.

      Candidates who incorrectly label diagrams can be awarded a maximum of [3].
      The use of P and Q on the axes is sufficient for an international trade diagram.
      The world supply curve must be labelled Sw, or Sworld or SBangladesh, Pworld
      Pw or PBangladesh or any similar label indicating the horizontal line is the world
      (Bangadesh) price/supply. A title is not necessary.

      Candidates may indicate the fall in revenue through either:
      ● a reference to the revenue dropping from ABQdQs to CDQd2Qs2
      OR
      ● a reference to imports (exports) decreasing from QsQd to Qs2Qd2

(e)   Using an exchange rate diagram, explain how the change in imports of goods
      and services from 2010 to 2019 is likely to have affected the exchange rate of the
      Bangladeshi taka (Table 1).                                                              [4]

              showing the supply curve shifting right and the equilibrium
              exchange rate falling OR for an explanation that increasing
              imports leads to a higher supply of the Bangladeshi taka, as
              importers need to sell Bangladeshi taka and buy foreign
              currencies, which causes a depreciation of the exchange rate.
      2       There is a correct diagram AND an accurate written response.           3–4
              For a correct exchange rate diagram with appropriate labelling,

              imports leads to a higher supply of the Bangladeshi taka, as
              importers need to sell Bangladeshi taka and buy foreign
              currencies, which causes a depreciation of the exchange rate.

      Candidates who incorrectly label diagrams can be awarded a maximum of [3].

      For an exchange rate diagram, the vertical axis may be exchange rate, price (or
      P) of taka in other currencies, other currency/taka or other currency per taka. The
      horizontal axis should be quantity or Q or quantity of taka. A title is not necessary.

(f)   Using a Lorenz curve diagram, explain what happened to the distribution of
      income in Bangladesh between 2010 and 2019 (Table 2).                                 [4]

              with 2 curves showing a shift away from the line of
              (perfect/absolute) equality OR an explanation that an increase in
              the Gini coefficient implies that the distribution of income has
              become more unequal.
      2       There is a correct diagram AND an accurate written response.          3–4

              with 2 curves showing a shift away from the line of
              (perfect/absolute) equality AND an explanation that an increase
              in the Gini coefficient implies that the distribution of income has
              become more unequal.

      Candidates who incorrectly label diagrams can be awarded a maximum of [3].

      For the vertical axis, the label may be cumulative percentage of income or
      percentage of income (GDP and GNI are valid alternatives to income, but wealth
      is not acceptable). For the horizontal axis, the label may be cumulative
      percentage of population/people/households or percentage of
      population/people/households. The diagonal line need not be labelled. A title is
      not necessary.

      The shift of the Lorenz curve can be shown by labelling each curve (e.g. ‘2010’
      and ‘2019) or by an arrow.

  (g)   Using information from the text/data and your knowledge of economics, discuss
        the extent to which the ready-made garments (RMG) sector in Bangladesh
        contributes to achieving the Sustainable Development Goal: “Promote sustained,
        inclusive, and sustainable economic growth, full and productive employment, and
        decent work for all”.                                                                 [15]

        Examiners should be aware that candidates may take a different approach which,
        if appropriate, should be rewarded.

Command term
“Discuss” requires candidates to offer a considered and balanced review that
includes a range of arguments, factors or hypotheses. Opinions or conclusions
should be presented clearly and supported by appropriate evidence.

Answers may include:
● Definition of sustainable economic growth
● Definition of full (and productive) employment
● An explanation of the links between growth and inclusivity/equality
● Diagrams (e.g AD/AS, poverty cycle…)

Positive consequences of the RGM sector towards achieving SDG #8 may include:
• Provides opportunities for women to get employment (Text A, paragraph 2;
  Table 2)
• Reduces the wage gap between men and women (Text A, paragraph 2)
• Both the above will lead to more equality and result in better health and
  education for families (Text A, paragraph 1; Table 2)
• Facilitates the movement of the economy towards the manufacturing sector,
  which promotes growth and reduces poverty (Text A, paragraph 2; Table 2)
• Despite high GDP growth and rising GNI per capita, unemployment is
  increasing due to the rising labour force (which is rising faster than the
  population). Therefore, the sector is needed to provide jobs (Table 1)
• Can take advantage of preferential trade agreements because Bangladesh is
  a designated Economically Least Developed Country (ELDC) (Text B,
  paragraph 2)
• Rising exports will increase AD and real GDP (Text B, paragraphs 1 and 2;
  Table 1)
• As wages in China increase, there is the possibility that exports, providing
  revenue and foreign exchange, will increase significantly (Text B, paragraph 1)
• Could attract FDI from China, which will provide funds, possibly helping to
  break the poverty cycle (Text C, paragraph 2)
• FDI will provide foreign exchange to buy imports, which exceed exports and
  are growing faster than exports. Imports (eg of capital and raw materials) are
  essential for growth (Text C, paragraph 3; Table 1)
• As more “green” firms are established, they will improve the environment and
  promote more exports (Text A, paragraph 6)
• If the sector can market itself more effectively (eg with more branding) and
  diversify, it can compete better globally (Text C, paragraph 2).

Negative consequences of the RGM sector towards achieving SDG #8
may include:
• Workers are sometimes exploited and work in unsafe conditions (Text A,
  paragraph 3)
• Job security is low and the need to reduce costs may make it lower (Text A,
  paragraph 5)
• The bigger firms (possibly MNCs) and stricter safety regulations are driving
  out the smaller firms which may lead to reduced competition as large firms
  may dominate the market. This may result in higher profits for the larger firms
  (and thus lead to inequality) and labour being exploited (Text A, paragraph 3)
• Exports are too specialized, which raises risks if demand or supply conditions
  change. Therefore, need to diversify to keep growth sustained (Text A,
  paragraph 5; Text B, paragraph 1; Text C, paragraph 2)
• There is a lot of competition from other countries, which puts pressure on firms
  (Text A, paragraph 4; Text C, paragraph 1)
• When Bangladesh is no longer eligible for preferential trade agreements as an
  ELDC, export earnings may decrease (Text B, paragraph 2) and therefore
  growth may not be sustained
• More FDI may lead to more worker exploitation and/or damage to the
  environment (Text C, paragraph 2)
• More manufacturing leads to increasing urbanization, which may cause
  negative externalities of production, such as congestion and pollution (Table
  2) and therefore growth may be unsustainable.

demand (or an increase in supply). The depreciation is then reversed by the
demand curve shifting right. If appropriately explained, this can be fully rewarded.

Command term
“Evaluate” requires candidates to make an appraisal by weighing up the
strengths and limitations. Opinions and conclusions should be presented clearly
and supported with appropriate evidence and sound argument.

Answers may include:
● Definition of development
● Definition of growth
● An explanation of the links between growth and development
● Definition of supply-side policies
● Definition of fiscal policy
● Definition of monetary policy
● Diagram(s) (e.g. AD/AS, poverty cycle, PPC…).

Supply-side policies: strengths may include:
• Interventionist supply-side policies can be used to increase spending on
  infrastructure and on education (Text D, paragraph 4)
• Can increase competition and efficiency in state-owned enterprises (or maybe
  privatize them) to lower prices (Text D, paragraph 5)
• Can make the labour market more flexible and able to supply labour to new and
  growing sectors (Text D, paragraph 6)
• Can attract more FDI (Text D, paragraph 7)
• By promoting certain sectors, can diversify exports (Text F, paragraph 2)
• Surplus on trade balance has increased significantly maybe due to supply-side
  policies (Table 4)

Supply-side policies: limitations may include:
• Market-based policies (such as the abolition of the minimum wage and
  reductions in unemployment benefits) may increase inequality and poverty if
  labour market is deregulated (Text D, paragraph 6)
• Time lags before they are effective
• May damage the environment

Fiscal policies: strengths may include:
• Used to redistribute income by progressive taxes and transfer payments which
   promote equality, lowering the Gini coefficient (Text D, paragraph 2; Table 5)
• Used to subsidise education and health care which has raised the HDI (Text
   D, paragraph 1; Text E, Table 5)

Fiscal policies: limitations may include:
• Growth rate has fallen and unemployment has risen (despite growing budget
   deficits) (Table 4)
• Budget deficits mean that government has had to borrow funds, which raises
   debt (Text D, paragraph 3)
• New budget guidelines require the government to raise taxes and/or reduce
   spending which will have a negative impact on growth (Text D, paragraph 3)
• Some of the spending (for example on higher education) has benefitted the
   rich more than the poor (Text D, paragraph 2)

Synthesis: limited effectiveness on growth but can be targeted at development.

Monetary policies: strengths may include:
• Have kept inflation at a reasonably low level (Table 4)
• Have been able to set a target rate of inflation and plans to lower it (Text D,
  paragraph 3)
• Have been able to lower interest rates which should expand AD through
  increased investment/consumption (Table 4)

Monetary policies: limitations may include:
• The reduction in interest rates so far does not seem to have expanded growth,
  implying limited effects on investment (Table 4)
• Further reductions in interest rates, if expansionary policies are needed, will
  become more difficult as interest rates are now already relatively low (Table 4).

Trade policies: strengths may include:
• Increase in exports due to greater diversification (Text F. paragraph 2)
• Increase in exports due to greater market access based EU/Mercosur tariff reduction
    agreement (Text F, paragraph 2)
● Cheaper imports due to lower tariffs will reduce consumer prices (maybe aiding the
   poor) (Text F, paragraph 2)
● Central Bank exchange rate policies aimed at appreciation will make importing capital
   goods/technology cheaper (Text F, paragraph 3}
● Rising surplus on balance of trade will add to growth through increasing AD (Table 4)

Trade policies: limitations may include:
● Increase in imports due to EU/Mercosur tariff reduction agreement, which could harm
   development in rural areas (Text F, paragraph 2)
● Central Bank exchange rate policies aimed at appreciation could harm export
   competitiveness (Text F, paragraph 3}
● Over-reliance on the export of agricultural goods may lead to unpredictable growth
   outcomes (Text F, paragraph 1)
