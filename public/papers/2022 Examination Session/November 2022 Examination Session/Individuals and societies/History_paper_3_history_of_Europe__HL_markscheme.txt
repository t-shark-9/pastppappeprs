Apply the markbands that provide the “best fit” to the responses given and award credit wherever it is
possible to do so. If an answer indicates that the demands of the question are understood and
addressed but that not all implications are considered (for example, compare or contrast; reasons
or significance; methods or success), then examiners should not be afraid of using the full range of
marks allowed for by the markscheme. Responses that offer good coverage of some of the criteria
should be rewarded accordingly. If you are uncertain about the content/accuracy of a candidate’s
work please contact your team leader.

Section 1: Monarchies in England and France (1066–1223)

1.   Discuss the social and political impact of the Norman invasion on England.

     The question requires that candidates offer a considered and balanced review of the social
     and political impact of the Norman invasion. Candidates may argue that the invasion amounted to
     colonialism. Others may point out that the political impact was not extensive. The Norman
     government was based on the counties and Hundreds of Anglo-Saxon England and was
     centralized as it had been under Edward the Confessor, so the invasion had little impact. The
     greatest change was that the earls were on the whole Norman, and that castles were built to
     control the population. Feudalism was not a particularly new idea. There may be some discussion
     as to the extent to which land was redistributed to the Norman barons, arguably the lower-level
     gentry were left in possession of their land but had to pay more for it. Some may discuss that the
     social impact was limited on the whole with peasant society remaining largely untouched but that
     French merchants settled in some towns and cities. The Church remained the same with some
     loss of land. The greatest social impact was the “harrying of the North” that led to famine and
     destitution in the area for 9 to 10 years. Candidates’ opinions or conclusions will be presented
     clearly and supported by appropriate evidence.


2.   “Henry I (1100–1135) was a successful medieval monarch.” To what extent do you agree with this
     statement?

     The question requires that the candidates consider the merits or otherwise of the view that Henry I
     was a successful monarch. There may be some definition of successful kingship being defined as
     a strong ruler providing stability and peace, not making excessive financial demands and who was
     successful militarily. Henry dealt effectively with competing claims to the throne, defeating Robert
     at Tinchebray. He strengthened royal power over the Barons by establishing the justices in eyres,
     which weakened baronial influence in the localities and therefore provided stability. Royal finances
     were stabilised under Robert of Salisbury’s control. Henry appointed his own supporters to
     sheriffdoms as they were no longer hereditary, he had good relations with the Church and his rule
     was generally regarded as effective. However, it could be argued that despite his Coronation
     Charter on land rights there were many disputed claims with resulting baronial discontent. After the
     White Ship he failed to clarify the succession, leaving Matilda and Stephen of Blois as potential
     claimants and therefore he failed in one key area. Candidates' opinions or conclusions will be
     clearly presented and supported by appropriate evidence.

Section 2: Muslims and Jews in medieval Europe (1095–1492)

3.   “The loss of cultural and intellectual diversity was the most significant result of the conflict between
     Christian-ruled and Muslim-ruled states in Spain.” Discuss.

     The question requires that candidates offer a considered and balanced review of the statement
     that the loss of cultural and intellectual diversity was the most significant result of the conflict
     between Christian-ruled and Muslim-ruled states in Spain. Candidates may refer to the wars,
     relocation of population, compulsory conversions and attacks on centres like monasteries or
     madrassas that provoked the loss of intellectual diversity. Other relevant factors may be discussed,
     for example, the loss of customs, daily habits and languages. Candidates may challenge the
     question by arguing that there was a continuous traffic of objects and people, and by referring to
     the diplomatic relations between Christian and Muslim states. They may also refer to the long-term
     presence of minorities and/or discuss other causes for the loss of cultural and intellectual diversity
     like domestic conflicts, or the influence of the Church to convert the population. Candidates’
     opinions or conclusions will be presented clearly and supported by appropriate evidence.


4.   Examine the role played by official anti-Semitism in the persecution of the Jews.

     The question requires that candidates consider the interrelationship between official anti- Semitism
     and the persecution of the Jews. Candidates may examine different periods during the Middle
     Ages when Jews were objects of official persecution, like during the First Crusade. They may also
     examine the alliance between a number of Christian rulers and the church. Candidates may also
     consider specific policies like the denial of citizenship, the prohibition on holding posts in
     government, and the exclusion of Jews from guilds. They may also examine the role played by
     official courts, decrees and laws in the persecution of Jews. Candidates may also examine the
     effectiveness of the policies since many were not carried out. As examples, candidates may
     consider the situation of the Jews in England, France, Germany and Spain. Candidates’ opinions
     or conclusions will be presented clearly and supported by appropriate evidence.
                                                   –6–                  N22/3/HISTX/HP3/ENG/TZ0/EU/M


Section 3: Late medieval political crises (1300–1487)

5.   Examine the impact of the War of the Public Weal on the authority of Louis XI.

     The question requires that candidates consider the impact of the War of the Public Weal on the
     rule of Louis XI. Louis’ authority was initially weakened as it was unclear who had won the Battle of
     Montlhéry, and he made some concessions in the peace negotiations. Candidates may argue that
     this was only temporary, and the war had limited impact. By 1466 he had reasserted his authority
     and punished some of the leaders (Charles de Melun and the Amboise family). He expanded royal
     authority by replacing the nobles on the section of the Royal council that administered justice and
     making Paris the centre of power. He established a messenger system to ensure he was aware of
     what was happening throughout the kingdom. He travelled frequently through France to display his
     authority. He controlled the appointment of Bishops and was able to raise taxes to support his rule.
     However, candidates may argue that it was not until the death of Charles the Bold in 1477 and the
     reversion of Burgundian territory that French nobles fully accepted the authority of Louis XI.
     Candidates' opinions or conclusions will be presented clearly and supported by appropriate
     evidence.


6.   “The weak kingship of Henry VI was the main cause of the Wars of the Roses.” Discuss.

     The questions requires that candidates offer a considered and balanced review of the causes of
     the Wars of the Roses. There may be a definition of “kingship”, this could include strong military
     leadership, effective domestic rule and the ability to choose wise counsellors. Henry lost territory in
     France because of his poor choice of military leaders and by 1453 only Calais remained. He was
     dominated by his wife Margaret of Anjou and his favourites: the Dukes of Suffolk and Somerset.
     His ill health meant that there was often no effective government. Royal finances were in disarray,
     Henry was very generous with patronage, enhancing the view of him as a weak king. Underlying
     tensions had existed since Henry IV seized the throne, some considered that the Yorkist claim to
     the throne was stronger and the weak rule of Henry increased these tensions. The growth of
     factions was a key cause of war, as York and Somerset struggled to influence Henry. When York
     was denied his “rightful” place on the King’s Council, he made his claim to the throne. Candidates’
     opinions or conclusions will be presented clearly and supported by appropriate evidence.
                                                  –7–                 N22/3/HISTX/HP3/ENG/TZ0/EU/M


Section 4: The Renaissance (c1400–1600)

7.   “Papal patronage was the most significant factor in the development of the Italian Renaissance.”
     Discuss.

     The question requires that candidates offer a considered and balanced review of the statement
     that Papal patronage was the most significant factor in the development of the Italian Renaissance.
     Candidates may discuss the interest of popes in making Rome the capital of Christendom.
     Candidates may also discuss the role played by popes as collectors of art and sponsors of
     painters, sculptors, architects and writers. Other relevant factors may be addressed, for example
     the influence played by the popes in defining topics for Renaissance paintings, and setting limits to
     the treatment of pagan topics. Candidates may also discuss papal patronage for Humanist studies.
     To challenge the statement, candidates may discuss the contribution of patronage from the rulers
     of other city states such as Florence and Milan to the development of the Renaissance.
     Candidates’ opinions or conclusions will be presented clearly and supported by appropriate
     evidence.


8.   Evaluate the impact of the Renaissance in one European country (other than Italy, Burgundy and
     Germany).

     The question requires that candidates make an appraisal of the impact of the Renaissance in one
     European country (other than Italy, Burgundy and Germany). Candidates may evaluate the extent
     of the impact of the Renaissance in the arts and the influence of new topics in painting and
     sculpture, as well as the introduction of new techniques and styles in architecture. Other relevant
     factors may be addressed, for example the impact of new political and social ideas imported by
     intellectuals travelling around Europe, and/or new topics and genres in literature. Candidates may
     evaluate the extent of the impact of these new ideas, and if only a small group of local artists and
     intellectuals engaged with them. Candidates may also refer to the reaction of rulers and the
     population to the Renaissance. Candidates may evaluate examples of kings and queens
     responsible for the introduction of Renaissance ideas like Elizabeth I and Henry VIII in England
     and Charles V in Spain, and/or they may also evaluate cases where the civil and religious powers
     rejected the Renaissance to preserve their medieval traditions. Candidates’ opinions or
     conclusions will be presented clearly and supported by appropriate evidence.

Section 5: The Age of Exploration and its impact (1400–1550)

9.    “Developments in shipbuilding were the most significant enabler of exploration.” To what extent do
      you agree with this statement?

      The question requires that candidates consider the merits or otherwise of the statement that
      developments in shipbuilding were the most significant enabler of exploration. Candidates may
      refer to the development of new models like naos and caravels, and to the techniques borrowed
      from the Arabs. The innovations made the new ships smaller and more manoeuvrable, and
      capable of navigating in rivers and shallow waters, which made them useful for coastal exploration.
      Candidates may also refer to the artillery aboard ships that transformed naval warfare, especially
      with the introduction of the galleon, a novelty that also contributed to exploration. As examples of
      successful development in shipbuilding and exploration, candidates may refer to the use of
      caravels by Christopher Columbus and his arrival in America, and the Portuguese and their trips to
      the East Indies and Brazil, among other cases. Candidates may also challenge the statement
      considering the role played by other factors as enablers of exploration like the developments in
      astronomy, the improvement in maps and the use of devices like compasses and sundials. They
      may also consider the role played by monarchies, rich bankers and merchants who provided the
      funds necessary to pay for the exploration. Candidates’ opinions or conclusions will be presented
      clearly and supported by appropriate evidence.


10.   To what extent was the Treaty of Tordesillas (1494) beneficial for Spain?

      The question requires that candidates consider the merits or otherwise of the suggestion that the
      Treaty of Tordesillas (1494) was beneficial for Spain. Candidates may argue that Spain benefited
      from the treaty by winning exploration and trading rights over half of the non-European world where
      it would have exclusive rights to explore and establish colonies. The treaty also stipulated that
      unless a land was already claimed by a Christian ruler, Spain (and Portugal) could claim it, this put
      all lands in the Americas under their control. Candidates may also point out that since the treaty did
      not take into consideration any possible claims made by other European kingdoms, it allowed
      Spain to continue the colonization without competitors. Candidates may challenge the question
      considering the treaty as a triumph for Portugal since the line of demarcation was moved an
      additional 270 leagues (about 1500 kilometres or 932 miles) farther west, enabling Portugal to
      claim the eastern coast of Brazil. From there, Portuguese explorers were able to advance over the
      territory gaining part of the lands under Spanish rule. Candidates may also argue that the treaty
      was not enough to stop future conflicts since other treaties, like the Treaty of Saragossa (1529),
      were needed. Candidates’ opinions or conclusions will be presented clearly and supported by
      appropriate evidence.
                                                   –9–                   N22/3/HISTX/HP3/ENG/TZ0/EU/M


Section 6: Aspects of the Reformation (c1500–1563)

11.   “Corruption within the Catholic Church was the main reason for the emergence of the
      Reformation.” Discuss.

      The question requires that candidates offer a considered and balanced review of the statement
      that corruption within the Catholic Church was the main reason for the emergence of the
      Reformation. Candidates may discuss the criticism generated by the involvement of the papacy in
      the political life of Europe as well as a number of practices that involved the Catholic Church in
      acts of corruption such as simony, nepotism, accumulation of wealth, etc. Candidates may
      challenge the question by discussing the role of many monarchies that supported the Reformation
      in order to gain power over lands and wealth that were under the control of the Catholic Church.
      Many kings were also interested in supporting national churches as a way to control ecclesiastical
      appointments. As an example, candidates may discuss the case of the German nobles and princes
      sponsoring the Reformation as a way to keep their independence. Candidates’ opinions or
      conclusions will be presented clearly and supported by appropriate evidence.


12.   Examine the impact of the Diet of Worms (1521) on the spread of Lutheran ideas in Germany.

      The question requires that candidates consider the interrelationship between the Diet of Worms
      (1521) and the spread of Lutheran ideas in Germany. The Diet of Worms allowed Martin Luther’s
      appearance to respond to charges of heresy. Candidates may examine the importance of this
      imperial diet calling a suspect of heresy before political authorities rather than before the pope or a
      council of the Roman Catholic Church. Candidates may also examine the deep impression caused
      by Luther‘s ideas in some German nobles and princes who were members of the Diet and were
      willing to support and protect him. Candidates may consider how the imperial diet helped to spread
      Lutheranism, since although Luther was excommunicated from the Catholic Church, he was not
      arrested by civil authorities. Even though he was declared to be an obstinate heretic, the Diet
      never enforced the edict which allowed Luther to continue his studies under Frederick III in
      Warburg, where he continued to spread his ideas. Candidates’ opinions or conclusions will be
      presented clearly and supported by appropriate evidence.

Section 7: Absolutism and Enlightenment (1650–1800)

13.   Discuss the impact of the Scientific Revolution on the emergence of Enlightenment ideas.

      The question requires that candidates offer a considered and balanced review of the links between
      the Scientific Revolution and Enlightenment ideas. Candidates may argue that the emergence of
      Enlightenment ideas followed directly from the Scientific Revolution of the late 17th and early 18th
      centuries. The Enlightenment’s emphasis on “reason” and the application of scientific method to
      non-scientific topics was a direct consequence of the Scientific revolution. It could also be argued
      that the growth of scientific societies and academies fed into the Enlightenment. Some may point
      out that the Enlightenment developed in parallel with the Scientific Revolution, citing thinkers such
      as Descartes and Bacon as influences on Enlightenment ideas. Others may argue that
      Renaissance humanism was the basis of the emergence of Enlightenment ideas many of which
      were focused on societal change. Candidates’ opinions and ideas will be presented clearly and
      supported by appropriate evidence.


14.   “There were no limits to the power of absolutist monarchs.” With reference to two monarchs, to
      what extent do you agree with this statement?

      The question requires candidates to consider the merits or otherwise of the view that absolutist
      monarchs had unlimited power. Potential arguments will vary depending on the chosen exemplars.
      To agree with the statement there may be some consideration of the “Divine Right of Kings” and
      the power that the effective use of patronage gave to absolutist monarchs. In some instances,
      standing armies were used to ensure that there was no challenge to monarchical power. To
      disagree with the statement some may argue that in some cases power was limited because of the
      difficulty in controlling vast empires as a consequence of poor communications and transport. In
      others, institutions such as the Church were to some extent independent of the monarchy. The
      need to raise taxes could also act as a limitation on power. Suitable exemplars could include Peter
      the Great and Catherine the Great of Russia, Charles XII of Sweden, and Frederick the Great of
      Prussia. The chosen examples can be from the same country and need not be contemporaneous.
      Candidates’ opinions or conclusions will be presented clearly and supported by appropriate
      evidence.

Section 8: The French Revolution and Napoleon I (1774–1815)

15.   Examine the impact of Robespierre on the course of the French Revolution.

      The question requires that candidates consider the impact of Robespierre on the course of the
      French Revolution. In the Constituent Assembly he argued for the rights of citizens who had no
      voice and had an impact on the establishment of the Constitutional Monarchy and the Declaration
      of the Rights of Man. As a member of the Jacobin Club, he continued to criticise the actions of the
      Court, the conduct of the war and other key figures such as Lafayette. He argued for more radical
      change. He was elected to the National Convention in 1791 and consistently advocated the
      execution of Louis XVI and for a republic. In 1793 he was active in reducing the influence of the
      moderate Girondins. As head of the Committee of Public Safety he employed almost dictatorial
      powers in order to “remove” enemies of the revolution. Arguably his main impact was to help
      establish the first democracy in France but also to radicalise the revolution. Some may point out
      that the Terror and the chaos that ensued contributed to the Thermidorean reaction and a return to
      more moderate government. Candidates’ opinions and conclusions will be presented clearly and
      supported by appropriate evidence.


16.   Evaluate the reasons for the collapse of the Napoleonic Empire.

      The question requires that candidates make an appraisal of the reasons for the collapse of the
      Napoleonic Empire. There may be evaluation of the role of Britain with her long resistance to
      Napoleon and also that Britain had the wealth to support the various coalitions. Candidates may
      evaluate the contribution of military campaigns such as in the Peninsula which was a drain on
      French resources or the disaster of the 1812 Russian campaign and its impact on Napoleon’s
      position. Rising nationalism in Austria and Prussia meant there was a greater willingness to join the
      4th Coalition. In some of the conquered territories there was unrest at the nature of French rule,
      weakening the Empire. He lost support at home because of his unwillingness to compromise and
      make peace with the coalition. Talleyrand staged a coup and when his war weary Marshals
      refused to support him, he abdicated. Some may argue that strategic mistakes at Waterloo were a
      contributing factor in his defeat which prevented a permanent restoration. Candidates’ opinions
      and conclusions will be presented clearly and supported by appropriate evidence.

Section 9: France (1815–1914)

17.   “The Bourbon restoration had limited impact on French society.” To what extent do you agree with
      this statement?

      The question requires that candidates consider the merits or otherwise of the statement that the
      Bourbon restoration had little impact on French society. Agreeing with the statement, candidates
      may argue that the Constitutional charter guaranteed the rights of “equality and freedom” although
      the electorate was relatively small and based on age and property qualifications. Property rights
      were confirmed, those who had gained Church and emigré lands retained them. Peasant
      landholders who had emerged during the revolution remained a significant sector of French
      society. The judicial and administrative structure of the Empire as well as the Code Napoleon
      remained. There was some political repression after the second restoration the “White Terror”, but
      this did not really affect wider society. To challenge the statement, it could be pointed out that
      Catholicism became the official religion and by 1824 bishops controlled the appointment of
      teachers. There was a religious revival supported by returning emigrés increasing church influence
      on society. There was limited immediate impact on French society until the Ultras began to limit
      freedom of speech from 1820. Candidates’ opinions and conclusions will be presented clearly and
      supported by appropriate evidence.


18.   “Middle class discontent was the main reason for the collapse of the July Monarchy in 1848.”
      Discuss.

      The question requires that candidates consider the merits or otherwise of the statement that middle
      class discontent led to the collapse of the July Monarchy. Candidates may discuss that the
      monarchy had lost the support of the middle classes by 1847–48 because of Guizot’s refusal to
      extend the franchise. The attempted repression of the Banquet Movement triggered disturbances
      in Paris. There was considerable discontent about a weak foreign policy. There was discontent
      with a regime that was considered to be repressive and much of the press supported left wing
      socialist or republican ideas. The discontent of the industrial working class who suffered
      unemployment and food shortages during the 1846–47 economic crisis rose to the surface in
      February 1848. The decision to fire on demonstrators led to around 40 deaths and triggered further
      riots. Thiers called off the troops and middle-class officers of the National Guard withdrew their
      support and Louis Philippe went into exile. Arguably, middle class discontent and working-class
      grievances combined to destabilise the monarchy in 1848. Candidates’ opinions and conclusions
      will be clearly presented and supported by appropriate evidence.

Section 10: Society, politics and economy in Britain and Ireland (1815–1914)

19.   Examine the political and social consequences of the 1845 Irish Famine in Britain and Ireland.

      The question requires that candidates discuss the impact of the Irish famine. The social impact of
      the famine was enormous, with over one million dead and 1–2 million emigrating to either the US
      or Britain; the Irish population declined by 20/25 %. Arguably the political impact was very
      significant with the famine being a turning point in Irish politics. The Anglo-Irish ascendancy and
      the land tenure system became synonymous with oppression. There was growth in support for
      Irish Nationalism and to some extent republicanism. In the 1850’s the Fenians emerged as an
      extremist political movement as did the more moderate Home Rule movement. The famine also
      had a significant impact on politics in Britain as Peel’s determination to repeal the Corn Laws split
      the Tory party and kept them out of office for over twenty years. In the longer-term attempts to
      solve the Irish question had a major effect on politics as Gladstone and others attempted to
      establish Home Rule for Ireland. Candidates’ opinions and conclusions will be presented clearly
      and supported by appropriate evidence.


20.   Discuss the reasons for unrest and protest in Britain and Ireland between 1909 and 1914.

      The question requires that candidates offer a considered and balanced review of the reasons
      causing unrest and protest. One reason for unrest was the rejection of Lloyd George’s “People’s
      Budget” and the struggle over the Parliament Bill. Suffragette agitation increased as Asquith did
      little for female suffrage. The government response to suffragette agitation with the Cat and Mouse
      Acts increased militancy. Trade Union unrest was caused by rising prices with limited wage
      increases. The use of force such as at Tonypandy and during the 1911 railway strike increased
      Trade Union agitation. The crisis in Ireland over Home Rule was exacerbated by the demands of
      Sinn Fein for a republic. In Ulster the Unionists resisted Home Rule forming the Ulster Volunteers.
      Tensions mounted with the Curragh Mutiny and the Larne and Howth gun running incidents. In
      some cases, the government policies of limited change mixed with repression increased militancy,
      for example with the suffragettes and to some extent the Trade Unions. Asquith’s “wait and see”
      attitude to Ireland contributed to increased tensions and the 1914 Home Rule Act did not provide
      for a separate Ulster. Candidates’ opinions or conclusions will be presented clearly and supported
      with appropriate evidence.

Section 11: Italy (1815–1871) and Germany (1815–1890)

21.   “Regional discontent was the main cause of the 1848–1849 Revolutions in Italy.” To what extent do
      you agree with this statement?

      The question requires that candidates consider the merits or otherwise of the statement that
      regional discontent was the main cause of the 1848–49 Revolutions. To agree with the statement,
      candidates may refer to the Tobacco Riots in Milan protesting at the Austrian monopoly of tobacco
      sales. Similarly, the rising in Sicily was against Bourbon despotism and after protest spread to the
      mainland Ferdinand granted a constitution. It could be argued that external events (revolutions in
      Paris and Vienna) stimulated demands for constitutional reform at a local level. Constitutions were
      granted in Tuscany, Piedmont and Rome. To disagree, candidates may argue that the underlying
      cause of revolution was resentment of Austrian dominance, especially in the North. The short-lived
      republic in Rome was established because the Pope refused to support the war against Austria.
      There were elements of Italian Nationalism in many of the disturbances but no clear consistent
      leadership to further that goal. Charles Albert was arguably pursuing his own ambitions and not
      seeking Risorgimento of the whole of Italy. Candidates’ opinions or conclusions will be presented
      clearly and supported by appropriate evidence.


22.   Examine the contribution of diplomacy and militarism to the unification of Germany.

      The question requires that candidates consider the interrelationship between diplomacy/militarism
      and the unification of Germany. Diplomacy was an important part of the process, for instance the
      alliance with Austria over Schleswig-Holstein paved the way for the 1866 Austro-Prussian War
      leading to the establishment of the North German Confederation. Diplomatic links with Russia and
      France ensured that neither would side with Austria and the alliance with Italy increased Austrian
      isolation. Arguably, diplomacy laid the groundwork for a situation where war would lead to the next
      stage of unification. Candidates may argue that whilst diplomacy was important, it was Bismarck’s
      opportunism that set the stage for war, for example, he exploited Napoleon III’s blunders over the
      Rhineland and Luxemburg to draw the South German states closer to Prussia. His alteration of the
      Ems Telegram provoked France into a war that culminated in unification in 1871. Military reforms
      strengthened Prussia’s ability to successfully engage in war. Candidate’s may argue that both
      diplomacy and militarism were equally important. Candidates’ opinions and conclusions will be
      clearly presented and supported by appropriate evidence.

Section 12: Imperial Russia, revolution and the establishment of the Soviet Union (1855–1924)

23.   To what extent were the policies of Nicholas II (1894–1917) the main cause of the February/March
      Revolution in Russia?

      The question requires that candidates consider the merits or otherwise of the suggestion that the
      policies of Nicholas II were the main cause of the February/March Revolution. Pre-war there was
      some economic and political improvement (Stolypin’s reforms and the establishment of the Duma)
      but Nicholas’ retention of autocratic power led to the rise of oppositions groups. His undermining of
      the Duma alienated moderate support for the monarchy and arguably revolution was only a matter
      of time. Candidates may argue that given time, reforms would have saved the monarchy. In 1914
      there was support for the war and Nicholas was very popular. Early defeats at Tannenberg and the
      Masurian Lakes highlighted the need for effective government. Nicholas was suspicious of bodies
      such as the Union of Zemstva, set up to organise medical support and his decision to become
      Commander in Chief in 1915 meant he was directly responsible for military actions. The ineffective
      government of the Tsarina and the continuing high casualty rate combined with food shortages and
      economic crisis established the conditions for revolution. The impact of war highlighted the
      weakness of autocratic government. Candidates’ opinions and conclusions will be presented
      clearly and supported by appropriate evidence.


24.   To what extent was the victory of the Bolsheviks in the Civil War due to the weakness of their
      opponents?

      The questions requires that candidates consider the merits or otherwise of the view that the
      Bolsheviks were successful because of the weakness of their opponents. Candidates may argue
      that the Bolsheviks were much stronger with effective political and military leadership and a clear
      goal: the survival of the revolution. After Brest-Litovsk Lenin was able to concentrate fully on the
      internal threat and his policy of War Communism ensured that the Red Army was well supplied. He
      portrayed the Bolsheviks as nationalists because of the foreign intervention. Trotsky was an
      excellent military leader building up the Red Army to 5.5 million by 1921, he restored discipline and
      responded quickly to White offensives. The Bolsheviks held the centre of Russia and Petrograd
      and Moscow. The Whites had considerable resources and some foreign assistance. However, they
      were geographically divided, there was no central leadership and various generals (Yudenich,
      Deniken and Wrangel) commanded different forces with poor communications. The White forces
      lacked unity of purpose consisting of monarchists, moderate SR’s and national groups.
      Candidates’ opinions or conclusions will be presented clearly and supported by appropriate
      evidence.

Section 13: Europe and the First World War (1871–1918)

25.   Examine the impact of domestic conditions on German foreign policy between 1890 and 1914.

      The question requires that candidates consider the interrelationship between domestic conditions
      and German foreign policies between 1890 and 1914. Candidates may examine the effects of
      Bismarck’s departure in 1890 and the new Wilhelmine era, the Kaiser’s active role in formulating
      domestic and imperial policies, especially Weltpolitik. Candidates may also refer to Germany’s
      desire to gain its own empire in Asia and Africa like other European powers had, and the efforts of
      Wilhelm II to make Germany a global power by sponsoring the building of a German navy.
      Candidates may also point out that the unification boosted industrial growth especially in coal
      production, iron mining and foreign investment. They may also examine how the German
      population supported these policies, especially the commercial and industrial middle class looking
      for imperial lands to expand their activities. Also, German banks grew quickly, providing credit and
      investment for new ventures. The rapidly growing population also impacted on German foreign
      policy and triggered the search for new territory. Militarism was also an important factor that grew
      within the German population and influenced foreign policy. Candidates’ opinions or conclusions
      will be presented clearly and supported by appropriate evidence.


26.   Evaluate the contribution of the arms race to the outbreak of the First World War.

      The question requires that candidates make an appraisal of the contribution of the arms race to the
      outbreak of the First World War. Candidates may evaluate the impact of the arms race in Europe,
      especially regarding the naval race between the United Kingdom and Germany. Closely connected
      to the arms race, candidates may suggest European imperialism as a key cause of the First World
      War, since it increased tensions among European countries and supported the development of the
      arms race. Candidates may also evaluate the role played by nationalism that led to the growth of
      the army and also reinforced the arms race. Other relevant factors may be addressed, for example,
      the contribution of the alliance system to the outbreak of the war. There may be some discussion
      of Germany’s support for Austria-Hungary in July 1914, (blank cheque). Finally, candidates may
      also argue for the importance of aggressive German foreign policy in the years leading up to 1914.
      Candidates’ opinions or conclusions will be presented clearly and supported by appropriate
      evidence.

Section 14: Inter-war domestic developments in European states (1918–1939)

27.   “Domestic resistance to the Nazis up to 1939 was limited and unsuccessful.” To what extent do
      you agree with this statement?

      The question requires that candidates consider the merits or otherwise of the statement that
      domestic resistance to the Nazis up to 1939 was limited and unsuccessful. Candidates may
      support the statement by arguing that many opposing groups to the Nazis had limited impact
      and/or were short-lived. They may also argue that by July 1933, political parties and trade unions
      were suppressed and that the press and radio were already under state control. This allowed the
      Nazis to neutralize most of their opponents. As examples of unsuccessful resistance, candidates
      may consider the role played by the “anti-Nazi” faction within the army led by General Beck that
      attempted a putsch to overthrow the Nazi regime. Candidates may also consider the resistance
      organized by religious groups, especially Protestant and Catholics. Protestant pastors, led by
      Niemöller, formed the Confessional Church in opposition to Hitler's Reich Church. There was some
      resistance from the Catholic Church to specific Nazi policies which had an impact on the Church,
      (1937 Papal Encyclical). Candidates may refer to the Edelweiss Pirates who evaded the Hitler
      Youth by leaving school and avoiding conscription, but their impact was limited. Candidates may
      challenge the statement arguing that there was persistent opposition to the Nazi regime from
      ordinary German workers, often organised by the underground SPD, SOPADE that played an
      important role in strikes in 1935 and 1936. Candidates’ opinions or conclusions will be presented
      clearly and supported by appropriate evidence.


28.   Evaluate the role of Azaña and Gil Robles to the polarization of Spanish politics before July 1936.

      The question requires that candidates make an appraisal of the role of Azaña and Gil Robles to the
      polarization of Spanish politics before July 1936. Candidates may discuss the significance of pre-
      existing divisions within Spain, based on class and region. Candidates could also argue for the
      importance of the military in the polarization of politics, (suppression of the Asturias rising in 1934).
      Azaña’s reforms focussed on land, the role of the Church and the army. This arguably contributed
      to polarization in 1931-33. In 1933, a centre-right government influenced by Gil Robles led to the
      Bienio Negro and the reversal of many reforms, further polarizing Spanish politics. The victory of
      the Popular Front in February 1936 led to a return to power for Azaña and violence increased on
      both sides. Some candidates may argue that Azaña and Gil Robles were leaders who represented
      the deep divisions within Spanish society and were trying to preserve the unity of their respective
      coalitions. Candidates’ opinions or conclusions will be presented clearly and supported by
      appropriate evidence.

Section 15: Diplomacy in Europe (1919–1945)

29.   Evaluate the causes of instability in the successor states of central and eastern Europe up to 1939.

      The question requires that candidates make an appraisal of the causes of instability in the
      successor states up to 1939. Reasons for instability varied but there was some commonality of
      problems as a consequence of the Paris Peace settlements. Ethnic tensions often caused
      instability despite the principle of National Self Determination influencing the settlement, most had
      large ethnic minorities. Czechoslovakia had over 3 million Germans, Poland had large German,
      Ukrainian and Jewish populations. In Yugoslavia there were tensions between Serbs and Croats.
      The states were often weak economically, only Czechoslovakia had highly developed industry,
      other state economies were based on an inefficient agricultural sector. All were badly hit by the
      Depression. There was limited political maturity with political parties often formed on the basis of
      ethnicity or sectional interests. There tended to be a multiplicity of parties and hence weak
      governments, only Czechoslovakia successfully established a functioning democracy. Other states
      became authoritarian, for example Pilsudski took over in Poland in 1926, Hungary was ruled by the
      right-wing Horthy from 1920 and Austria moved to the right under Dollfuss. Candidates’ opinions
      and conclusions will be presented clearly and supported by appropriate evidence.


30.   “The Axis was defeated because of poor strategic decisions.” Discuss.

      The question requires that candidates offer a considered and balanced review of the statement
      that the Axis was defeated due to poor strategic decisions. The main focus should be on Europe,
      but credit should be given to valid points about the Pacific theatre. Candidates may discuss poor
      decisions made by Hitler and Mussolini. For example, the decision to bomb cities and industrial
      centres during the Battle of Britain or to launch Operation Barbarossa while Britain was undefeated
      and the declaration of war on the US. In the case of Mussolini, his decision to join the war in 1940
      when Italy still lacked resources and to extend campaigns into the Balkans and North Africa. Italy’s
      military failures meant Hitler had to divert troops away from other campaigns to support Mussolini.
      Some may argue that the decision for war in 1939 and 1940 was ill judged as neither was
      economically strong enough for a major war. An alternative argument could be that once the Soviet
      Union and the US were involved, that Axis defeat was more likely because of the enormous
      resources that the Allies could utilise in terms of manpower and industrial power. The US decision
      to put significant effort into the European theatre was also crucial as Hitler had assumed the US
      would concentrate largely on the Pacific conflict. Candidates’ opinions and conclusions will be
      clearly expressed and supported by appropriate evidence.

Section 16: The Soviet Union and post-Soviet Russia (1924–2000)

31.   Examine the impact of the purges and Great Terror on the Soviet Union under Stalin.

      The question requires that candidates consider the impact of the purges and Great Terror on the
      Soviet Union under Stalin. Candidates may argue that the purges and the Great Terror reinforced
      Stalin’s leadership silencing members of the Bolshevik party that questioned his authority and were
      possible competitors. As examples, candidates may refer to those who were imprisoned and/or
      executed like Kamenev, Zinoviev, Bukharin and leading military figures such as Tukhachevsky.
      Candidates may also examine the impact the purges and the Great Terror had on the population
      and how it was unlikely to question government policies. Candidates may offer further details about
      the number of victims killed during this period. They may also refer to the numbers of people sent
      to Gulag labour camps . The Great Terror also targeted intellectuals, artists, and even experienced
      military leaders. This was one of the major factors contributing to the limited performance of Soviet
      forces in the initial phase of the German invasion of the Soviet Union. Candidates’ opinions or
      conclusions will be presented clearly and supported by appropriate evidence.


32.   Compare and contrast the foreign policies of Khrushchev and Brezhnev.

      The question requires that candidates give an account of the similarities and differences between
      the foreign policies of Khrushchev and Brezhnev. Candidates may compare and contrast their
      foreign relations with the Western powers and the way both leaders supported détente at times.
      Brezhnev ended it when he ordered the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan in 1979. Candidates may
      also compare the treaties signed by both leaders to maintain good relations with the West, for
      example, the Nuclear Test-Ban Treaty and the Strategic Arms Limitation Talks. Candidates may
      compare and contrast their policies towards other nations within the Soviet bloc; for example,
      Hungary in 1956 and Czechoslovakia in 1968. The relationship with communist or Marxist
      governments outside Europe may also be considered referring to Cuba, Vietnam, Ethiopia, and
      Nicaragua. Candidates’ opinions or conclusions will be presented clearly and supported by
      appropriate evidence.

Section 17: Post-war western and northern Europe (1945–2000)

33.   “Debt was the most significant post-war problem in Western Europe.” Discuss with reference to
      either France or West Germany.

      The question requires that candidates offer a considered and balanced review of the statement
      that debt was the most significant post-war problem in Western Europe with reference to either
      France or West Germany. In the case of France, candidates may point out that the country
      received foreign help to pay its debts, while it waited for reparations payments from Germany In
      the case of Germany, the debt to the Allies was around US$23 billion which hindered West
      German post war recovery. Candidates could also discuss the London Agreement on German
      External Debts (1953), a debt relief treaty between West Germany and creditor nations (including
      France). Candidates may challenge the statement by discussing the impact of the Marshall Plan in
      either of the two countries that helped to promote economic prosperity. They may also argue that
      other post-war problems were more significant, for example, the number of casualties, migration,
      unemployment, inflation, and occupation. Candidates’ opinions or conclusions will be presented
      clearly and supported by appropriate evidence.


34.   Examine the challenges to the establishment of democracy in Spain under Juan Carlos up to 1982.

      The question requires that candidates consider the challenges to the establishment of democracy
      in Spain under Juan Carlos up to 1982. Candidates may consider the challenges of passing a new
      constitution after intense negotiations among the leading political groups. Candidates may also
      refer to the challenge presented by demands for regional self-government which was resisted by
      the remnants of the Francoist state. Another challenge was the resistance to legalisation of
      previously banned political parties, eg the Spanish Communist Party, PCE. Another challenge
      which candidates may examine was the decline in electoral participation after the initial enthusiasm
      of the transición (transition) which led to what is known as desencanto (disenchantment) with
      the political system. Candidates may also consider the challenges of terrorist activity in the Basque
      country (ETA), and events such as the attempted coup by the military, known as 23-F in 1981.
      Candidates’ opinions or conclusions will be presented clearly and supported by appropriate
      evidence.

Section 18: Post-war central and eastern Europe (1945–2000)

35.   Evaluate the factors leading to the collapse of Soviet control in central and eastern Europe.

      The question requires that candidates make an appraisal of the factors leading to the collapse of
      Soviet control in central and eastern Europe. Candidates may argue that Gorbachev’s policies led
      to demands for the relaxation of Soviet control in central and Eastern Europe. Candidates may also
      discuss the rejection of Soviet political influence in many central and eastern European countries.
      There was growing criticism of censorship, suppression of freedom and economic controls., As
      examples, candidates may evaluate Poland where strong national leaders and trades unions from
      industrial cities successfully challenged Soviet control. Candidates may evaluate the impact of the
      ending of the Brezhnev Doctrine. Repressive national regimes closely aligned with the Soviet
      Union provoked large scale demonstrations in East Germany and Czechoslovakia and Gorbachev
      declined to intervene. Candidates’ opinions or conclusions will be presented clearly and supported
      by appropriate evidence.


36.   Discuss the role played by Milošević in the Balkan conflicts in the 1990s.

      The question requires that candidates offer a considered and balanced review of the role played by
      Milošević in the Balkan conflicts in the 1990s. Candidates may discuss Milošević’s role as Serbia’s
      president (1989–97) and later as president of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia
      (1997–2000). He pursued Serbian nationalist policies that contributed to the breakup of the
      Yugoslav federation. They may discuss his populist political style, appealing directly to the Serbian
      people, and calling for an “anti-bureaucratic revolution”. Candidates may also point out that in 1990
      Milošević introduced changes to the Serbian constitution that curtailed the provinces’ autonomy, he
      resisted a growing movement in favour of multiparty elections and sought to use the Serbian
      diaspora throughout Yugoslavia in his fight against Croatia and Slovenia. Milosevic’s hardline
      policies also contributed to war crimes, for example, Srebrenica in 1995. Candidates may also
      discuss the view that Milošević’s policies produced an anti-Serb backlash in the rest of the
      republics, contributing to the conflict. Later, in the early spring of 1999, Milošević ordered a
      program of ethnic cleansing against the Kosovar Albanians which led to further conflict.
      Candidates’ opinions or conclusions will be presented clearly and supported by appropriate
      evidence.
