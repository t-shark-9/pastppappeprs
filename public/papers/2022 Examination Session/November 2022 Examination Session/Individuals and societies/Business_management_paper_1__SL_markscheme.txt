                                               Section A

1.   (a)   Outline two ways in which the “place” element of the four Ps of the marketing mix is relevant
           to ELE.                                                                              [4]

           Place refers to the way products are distributed. This includes both the physical
           distribution of the good and the channels of distribution used to get the product to the
           consumer.

           Ways could include:
           • Zeat changed from B2B to B2C and this involved distribution through retail outlets;
           • using gasoline stations as an outlet for car hire;
           • car rentals at airports;
           • now using online as a sales portal (e-commerce)
           • opening convenience stores gives a new distribution channel
           • specific location of gasoline stations—on main road etc.

           N.B. do not credit operating in different locations (France vs Belgium etc).

           Accept any other relevant way.

           Mark as 2 + 2.

           Award [1] for each correct way identified and an additional [1] for a description of how that
           way relates to ELE. Award a maximum of [2] per way.

           Maximum award: [4].

     (b)   Explain the advantages and disadvantages of the methods ELE uses to appraise
           employees in its car rental division (lines 73–80).                      [6]

           Methods include:
           • Self-appraisal:
             o advantages: engages employees in the process, efficient, low cost; clarifies their job
                role and performance. Can help to identify training needs for the individual.
             o disadvantages: people not the best people to judge themselves, may lack foresight.
           • Formative appraisal:
             o advantages: helps build an action plan, involves feedback, continual; clarifies their job
                role; can help to identify training needs for the individual.
             o disadvantages: may be disruptive, needs criteria which may be difficult to plan.
           • Summative appraisal:
             o advantages: less disruptive; at the end of a process, easier to make comparisons;
                can help to identify training needs for the individual.
             o disadvantages: not ongoing, only picks up problems at the end. What criteria?

           Some candidates may write only about appraisal in general. This should be viewed as one
           method.

           Accept any other relevant explanation.

           N.B. context to come from the types of appraisal described in the case study and their
           appropriateness.

           Marks should be allocated according to the mark bands on page 3.

           Award a maximum of [3] for a theoretical answer.
                                       –6–                N22/3/BUSMT/SP1/ENG/TZ0/XX/M



Award a maximum of [3] for only one method.

Award a maximum of [5] if the explanation is mainly descriptive, but in context.
                                                 –7–                 N22/3/BUSMT/SP1/ENG/TZ0/XX/M


2.   (a)   Outline one advantage and one disadvantage for ELE of changing to cellular
           manufacturing in the Zeat factory (line 34).                               [4]

           The issue of changing from batch to cellular may help the answer to be contextual.

           Advantages
           • Zeat needed modernizing. A useful way of achieving that;
           • employees were demotivated, productivity levels are low. Cellular production could
             improve those through team work etc.
           • motivation may improve overall with workers who have a range of skills
           • cellular manufacturing improves quality as workers have greater pride in their work.

           Disadvantages
           • employees may resist change especially as it was introduced rapidly;
           • likely cost;
           • no previous experience.

           Accept any other relevant advantage or disadvantage.

           Mark as 2 + 2.

           Award [1] for one appropriate advantage and an additional of [1] for a description of how that
           advantage relates to ELE. Award a maximum of [2].

           Award [1] for one appropriate disadvantage and an additional of [1] for a description of how
           that disadvantage relates to ELE. Award a maximum of [2].

     (b)   Explain the importance to ELE of e-commerce.                                               [6]

           Importance of e-commerce to ELE includes:
           • point of sale/inventory ordering at retail outlets;
           • smartphone booking;
           • online booking, especially for airports/international traveller/use of The App
           • In3T could not be introduced without e-commerce.
           • customers have flexibility in booking. They are used to using the technology and car hire
             customers would expect to use it for this type of booking.
           • customers often use comparison websites for car hire and ELE will need to follow this
             method of selling
           • there are possible cost savings compared to other forms of selling
           • selling products this way generally leads to lower overall costs
           • accurate records of customer interaction can be kept electronically.

           Accept any other relevant explanation.

           Marks should be allocated according to the mark bands on page 3.

           Award a maximum of [3] for a theoretical answer, often a pre-prepared textbook answer.

           Award a maximum of [5] if the explanation is mainly descriptive, but in context.
                                                  –8–                 N22/3/BUSMT/SP1/ENG/TZ0/XX/M


3.   (a)   Outline one advantage and one disadvantage for ELE of internal recruitment (lines
           69–72).                                                                     [4]

           Advantages include:
           • can motivate employees;
           • employees already known;
           • employees have been selected in the past using ELE’s criteria;
           • less expensive than external recruitment.

           Disadvantages include:
           • there should be a wider choice of applicants;
           • External recruitment can bring in new ideas to ELE;
           • ELE is a business that needs to innovate;
           • the quality of applicants could be higher with more choice;
           • it can increase internal conflict if an internal candidate gets the job when that person is not
              liked.

           Accept any other relevant advantage / disadvantage.

           Mark as 2 + 2

           Award [1] for each correct advantage / disadvantage identified and an additional [1] for a
           description of how that advantage / disadvantage relates to ELE. Award a maximum of [2]
           per advantage / disadvantage.

     (b)   Explain suitable internal sources of finance that ELE could have used to take over Zeat PLC
           (line 19).                                                                           [6]

           Suitable internal sources of finance include:
           • retained profits: This has been preferred method in the past. How much is available?
           • sale of unused assets: Are there any suitable? There appear to be less profitable petrol
             stations. Can these be sold? From working capital e.g. debtors. It’s very unlikely to be
             sufficient.
           • Manage working capital more effectively.

           Accept any other relevant explanation.

            External sources not acceptable include:
           • bank loans
           • selling of shares
           • subsidies
           • government grants
           • business angels etc.

           N.B. The case study says that internal sources were used, so do not reward external
           sources.

           Marks should be allocated according to the mark bands on page 3.

           Award a maximum of [3] for a theoretical answer.

           Award a maximum of [5] if the explanation is mainly descriptive, but in context. E.g. if most of
           the context is mentioned but not developed.

                                                Section B

4.   (a)   Define the term redundancy.                                                        [2]

           Redundancy occurs when an employer determines that a job no longer needs to be
           performed.

           The two aspects of the definition are the facts that: (1) the worker loses their
           employment/position, (2) because the job is not required any longer.

           N.B. no application/example required.

           Candidates are not expected to word their definition exactly as above.

           Award [1] for a basic definition that conveys partial knowledge and understanding.

           Award [2] for a full definition that conveys knowledge and understanding similar to the answer
           above.

           (i)    Calculate ELE’s market share for car rentals in 2019 (show all your working) [2]

                  Market share % = (firm's sales revenue / total sales revenue in the market) x 100%

                  ELE’s sales revenue EUR 0.9 billion. Market sales revenue EUR 16.8 billion

                  Market share = (EUR 0.9/EUR 16.8) x 100% = 5.36% (allow 5.35%, 5.3% and 5.4%)

                  Award [2] if correct answer, which must include the percentage sign (%) and working
                  shown.

                  Award [1] if correct answer but no working shown, or no percentage sign (%).

                  Do not reward formula only.

           (ii)   Explain one reason why ELE’s market share has grown.                        [2]

                  Reasons include :
                  o new methods of management;
                  o more entrepreneurial approach;
                  o target culture, more motivation;
                  o competitor behaviour.

                  N.B. “generic” answer about customers satisfaction and marketing/sales (brand loyalty,
                  more customers etc), award only [1].

                  Award [1] for a relevant reason plus another [1] for an explanation in context.

                  Award a maximum of [2].
                                             – 10 –              N22/3/BUSMT/SP1/ENG/TZ0/XX/M


(c)   Explain two factors relevant to the Zeat division in its decision to outsource MiniC
      production to Hungary.                                                             [4]

      Factors include:
      • financial aspects: profit margins for MiniC had fallen due to rising costs in the UK: it might
        be cheaper to produce in Hungary.
      • sales aspects: much of the sales (90%) is in the EU which might make Hungary a better
        choice (EU single market).
      • political aspects: after Brexit, trading with EU is easier from a country within the EU (such
        as Hungary).
      • geographical aspects: geographical proximity to customers (but this aspect of (re)location
        must be linked to outsourcing).
      • legal aspects: laws/policies in Hungary (different/better?).
      • cultural and linguistic aspects: communication and possible problems of cross-cultural
        understanding.
      • quality aspects: quality and quality control/assurance might be better in Hungary (or not).
      • HR aspects: outsourcing means contracting a specialized company, so the Hungarian
        workforce may be more proficient (but less committed or less loyal?).

      Accept any other relevant factor.

      Mark as 2 + 2.

      Award [1] for each relevant factor identified and an additional [1] for a description of how that
      factor relates to the Zeat division. Maximum two factors.

      N.B. do not expect candidates to have advanced knowledge about EU/Hungary/Brexit.


      Maximum award overall: [4].

(d)   Recommend whether ELE’s directors should accept the offer from Perrana PLC to
      purchase all of ELE’s gasoline stations.                                 [10]

      Advantages:
      • offer exceeds market value;
      • taking the money would be attractive to some family members;
      • could finance the expansion into India?
      • It would offer considerable finance
      • It would fit the future changes to gasoline usage (switch to electric)
      • Giselle is happier with this idea.

      Disadvantages:
