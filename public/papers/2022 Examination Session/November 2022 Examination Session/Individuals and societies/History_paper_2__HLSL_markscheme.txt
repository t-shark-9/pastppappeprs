           substantiated assertions.
    0      Answers do not reach a standard described by the descriptors below.



Examiners are reminded of the need to apply the markbands that provide the “best fit” to the responses
given by candidates and to award credit wherever it is possible to do so. If an answer indicates that
the demands of the question are understood and addressed but that not all implications are
considered (for example, compare or contrast; reasons or significance; methods or success),
then examiners should not be afraid of using the full range of marks allowed for by the markscheme:
as such, responses that offer good coverage of some of the criteria should be rewarded accordingly.

For the attention of all examiners: if you are uncertain about the content/accuracy of a
candidate’s work please contact your team leader.

Topic 1: Society and economy (750–1400)

1.   Examine the impact of famine and disease on two societies, each chosen from a different region.

     The question requires that candidates consider the interrelationship between the impact of famine
     and disease on two societies that must be chosen from a different region. Candidates may offer
     equal coverage of both societies or may prioritize one of them. However, both will feature in the
     response. It is likely that candidates will note that disease often led to famine. Examples may
     include the impact of the Black Death on societies in Europe where the plague and famine led to a
     scarcity of labour, impacting the economy as well as the political structure of societies. Its impact
     upon sub-Saharan societies would also be relevant as would its impact upon China and, of
     particular note, the reduction in trade along the Silk Road. Candidates may also choose to prioritize
     famine over disease and to examine how it may have led to the decline of the Mayan civilization.
     Candidates’ opinions or conclusions will be presented clearly and supported by appropriate
     evidence.


2.   “Trade was the main factor in enabling the transmission of ideas and culture.” Discuss with
     reference to two societies.

     The question requires that candidates offer a considered and balanced review of the statement
     that trade was the main factor enabling the transmission of ideas and culture in two societies. The
     two societies may or may not be from the same region. Candidates may offer equal coverage of
     both societies or may prioritize one of them. However, both will feature in the response. There may
     be discussion of how trade routes such as the Silk Road enabled the spread of ideas and culture
     both in Yuan ruled China and in societies traversed along the route. The spread of ideas and
     culture into European societies along trade routes linked to the ‘Abbasid Empire may also be
     discussed. For the Americas, candidates may discuss how trade facilitated cultural exchange
     between the Aztec and Mayan empires. Other relevant factors such as military conquest, religious
     practices, the written word or the influence of travellers may be discussed, but with a focus on the
     issue in the question. Candidates’ opinions or conclusions will be presented clearly and supported
     by appropriate evidence.
                                                  –5–                   N22/3/HISTX/BP2/ENG/TZ0/XX/M


Topic 2: Causes and effects of wars (750–1500)

3.   “Political rivalry was the main cause of war between 750 and 1500.” Discuss with reference to
     two wars.

     The question requires that candidates offer a considered and balanced review of the statement
     that political rivalry was a main cause of war between 750 and 1500, with reference to two wars
     that may or may not be chosen from the same region. Candidates may offer equal coverage of
     both wars or may prioritize one of them. However, both will feature in the response. Candidates
     may discuss political rivalry that caused the Wars of the Roses or local feuding that led to the call
     for the First Crusade. Political rivalry may be viewed as a main cause of the Seljuk-Byzantine Wars
     and the shift in power from the Emperor to the Shogun seen to be a main cause of the Gempei
     Wars in Japan. Political rivalry as a cause of Tenochtitlan’s war against Tlatelolco may also be
     discussed. Other relevant causes of war such as territorial disputes; religious conflicts; control over
     resources may be discussed but with a focus on the issue in the question. Candidates’ opinions or
     conclusions will be presented clearly and supported by appropriate evidence.


4.   “The impact of war upon the role of women was mainly positive.” With reference to two wars, to
     what extent do you agree with this statement?

     The question requires that candidates consider the merits, or otherwise, of the statement that the
     impact of war upon the role of women was mainly positive. The two wars chosen may or may not
     be from the same region. Candidates may offer equal coverage of both wars or may prioritize one
     of them. However, both must feature in the response. The impact of the Crusades may be
     considered with increased authority and responsibility given to the wives of the lords who went to
     fight or who, like Eleanor of Aquitaine, accompanied their husbands to war. In the Gempei Wars,
     the role of Hojo Masako may be discussed. Candidates may consider alternate viewpoints such as
     a diminished role for women seen as the spoils of war or a change in status resulting from
     economic hardship when men went to war. Candidates may also argue that unless impacted
     directly, war may not have affected the role of women to any large extent. Candidates’ opinions or
     conclusions will be presented clearly and supported by appropriate evidence.
                                                  –6–                  N22/3/HISTX/BP2/ENG/TZ0/XX/M


Topic 3: Dynasties and rulers (750–1500)

5.   “The use of force was the most important method used to maintain power.” Discuss, with reference
     to two rulers, each chosen from a different region.

     The question requires that candidates offer a considered and balanced review of the statement
     that the use of force was the most important method used to maintain power. The two rulers must
     be from different regions. Candidates may offer equal coverage of both rulers or they may prioritize
     their discussion of one of them. However, both rulers will be a feature of the response. Candidates
     may discuss Charlemagne’s campaigns on his southern border, Itzcoatl’s defeat of enemies such
     as Maxtla or Louis VI of France’s defeat of the robber barons. In contrast, allegiance to the Eze Niri
     in West Africa was secured peacefully by religious oath, while Harun al-Rashid set a strong
     example of piety and godliness. Other relevant factors may be discussed, for example the role of
     competent administration, the promotion of a successful economy, diplomatic skill, or strong
     personal qualities, but with a focus on the issue in the question. Candidates’ opinions or
     conclusions will be presented clearly and supported by appropriate evidence.


6.   “Their successes outweighed their failures.” Discuss with reference to two rulers.

     The question requires that candidates offer a considered and balanced review of the statement
     that success outweighed the failures of two rulers that may or may not be chosen from different
     regions. Candidates may offer equal coverage of successes and failures, or they may prioritize
     their discussion of either of them. However, both aspects will be a feature of the response.
     Candidates may discuss Tunku Manin of Ghana’s successful promotion of loyalty to his rule and
     economic progress and his failure to counter religious disunity and the Almoravid threat. They may
     discuss Hongwu’s legal reforms and his success in war, and his defeat of internal enemies, albeit
     supported by brutal methods. Candidates may discuss the successes of Frederick Barbarossa,
     who strengthened his empire’s hold over Germany and patronised education and the
     secularisation of government. Stephen of England, while enjoying early success against the Scots,
     saw his kingdom descend into civil war. Candidates’ opinions or conclusions will be presented
     clearly and supported by appropriate evidence.
                                                 –7–                  N22/3/HISTX/BP2/ENG/TZ0/XX/M


Topic 4: Societies in transition (1400–1700)

7.   Evaluate the significance of intellectual movements on two societies.

     The question requires that candidates make an appraisal of the significance of intellectual
     movements on two societies weighing up their significance or otherwise. The two societies may or
     may not be from the same region. Significance may extend beyond the timeframe but it must be
     clearly linked to the issue raised in the question. Candidates may offer equal coverage of the two
     societies or they may prioritize their evaluation of one of them. However, both societies will be a
     feature of the response. Candidates may evaluate the significance of the Renaissance, in its
     questioning of religiously inspired beliefs, promoting exploration (with an impact on South
     American societies) and boosting the wealth of Italian city states. They may evaluate the
     significance of neo-Confucianism in Korea, which clashed with Buddhism and limited socio-
     economic change. The Timurid Renaissance saw scholars flocking to a thriving Samarkand to
     study astronomy, science and philosophy. Candidates’ opinions or conclusions will be presented
     clearly and supported by appropriate evidence.


8.   Examine the relationship between religion and the state in two societies, each chosen from a
     different region.

     The question requires that candidates consider the interrelationship between religion and the state
     in two societies, which must be from different regions. Candidates may examine Louis XIV’s
     successful resistance to papal power in securing his control over the church, and his persecution of
     the Huguenots after the Edict of Fontainebleau. In Morocco the Saadian rulers, claiming direct
     descendancy from the prophet, made religion and state indivisible; laws were promulgated as
     fatwas. In India the early Mughal emperors were religiously tolerant and established a secular legal
     system. Similarly, In Japan, Buddhism and polytheistic Shinto religions coexisted and state and
     religion were kept separate. Ottoman Emperors increasingly saw themselves as leaders of the
     Islamic world, but were, in general, religiously tolerant, although some Islamic sects, such as the
     Druze, were persecuted. Although Inca rulers were regarded as divine, their rule was largely
     secular. Candidates’ opinions or conclusions will be presented clearly and supported by
     appropriate evidence.
                                                  –8–                   N22/3/HISTX/BP2/ENG/TZ0/XX/M


Topic 5: Early Modern states (1450–1789)

9.    Evaluate the impact of ideology on the nature of rule in two Early Modern states.

      The question requires that candidates make an appraisal of the impact of ideology on the nature of
      rule in two Early Modern states, that may or may not be from the same region. Candidates may
      offer equal coverage of both states or prioritize one of them. However, both must feature in the
      response. Candidates may focus on one ruler or may discuss a series of rulers within the
      timeframe. Examples may include Frederick the Great of Prussia whose economic and political
      policies, as well as his nurturing of the arts, was influenced by the Enlightenment. In the Americas,
      the rejection of monarchical rule and its impact upon the constitution of the United States may be
      evaluated. Candidates may evaluate the role of neo-Confucianism on the Tokugawa Shogunate or
      upon the rule of emperors of the Ming dynasty. Candidates’ opinions or conclusions will be
      presented clearly and supported by appropriate evidence.


10.   With reference to two states, evaluate the success of the methods used to overcome challenges
      to power.

      The question requires that the candidate make an appraisal of the success of methods used to
      overcome the challenges to power in two states that may or may not be from the same region.
      Candidates may offer equal coverage of both states or prioritize one of them. However, both must
      feature in the response. For Elizabeth I, the success of methods such as espionage and her status
      as the Virgin Queen to overcome challenges such as the consolidation of Protestantism and
      opposition from Catholic Europe may be evaluated. For Moctezuma, there may be an evaluation of
      the success of such methods as his attempts to parlay with the Spanish or to present them with
      gifts. In Tokugawa Japan, the strict hierarchy and control over local samurai lords may be
      evaluated and whether such methods were successful in preventing challenges to power. The
      relative success of other methods such as the use of dynastic alliances or ruthless suppression of
      any opposition may be evaluated but with a focus on the issue in the question. Candidates’
      opinions or conclusions will be presented clearly and supported by appropriate evidence.
                                                  –9–                  N22/3/HISTX/BP2/ENG/TZ0/XX/M


Topic 6: Causes and effects of Early Modern wars (1500–1750)

11.   Compare and contrast the causes of two Early Modern wars, each chosen from a different region.

      The question requires that candidates give an account of the similarities and differences between
      the causes of two Early Modern wars, referring to both throughout. There does not need to be an
      equal number of comparisons and contrasts. The two wars must be chosen from different regions.
      Causes may predate the timeframe but they must be clearly linked to the issue raised in the
      question. Reference may be made to conflicts over territory and trade as a cause of the Beaver
      Wars or the Venetian-Ottoman Wars. Such examples may be compared and contrasted with
      examples such as the Thirty Years War caused by religious discord, among other factors such as
      the struggle for control of holy sites as well as the spice trade that may be seen as a cause of the
      Ottoman-Mamluk Wars. Further comparisons and contrasts may be made with the desire for
      territorial expansion as well as issues of succession that contributed, for example, to the outbreak
      of the Burmese-Siamese Wars.


12.   To what extent do you agree that demographic changes and population movements were the main
      effects of two Early Modern wars?

      The question requires that candidates consider the merits or otherwise of the statement that
      demographic changes and population movements were the main effects of two Early Modern
      Wars. The wars may or may not be from the same region. The effects may extend beyond the
      timeframe but they must be linked to the issues raised in the question. Candidates may offer equal
      coverage of both wars or may prioritize their assessment of one of them. However, both must
      feature in the response. Candidates may refer to the Thirty Years War and its impact upon
      population decline in the German states or the Qing conquest of China and the subsequent turmoil
      that led to the depopulation of whole provinces. The dispersal of populations taken into slavery as
      a result of war may also be considered. Other relevant factors may be addressed such as the
      destruction of settlements or the imposition of different religious beliefs but with a focus on the
      issue in the question. Candidates’ opinions or conclusions will be presented clearly and supported
      by appropriate evidence.
                                                   – 10 –                N22/3/HISTX/BP2/ENG/TZ0/XX/M


Topic 7: Origins, development and impact of industrialization (1750–2005)

13.   Evaluate the significance of technological developments to the origins of industrialization in
      two countries.

      The question requires that candidates make an appraisal of technological developments in two
      countries, weighing up their significance or otherwise. The two countries may or may not be from
      the same region. Significance may extend beyond the timeframe but it must be clearly linked to the
      issue raised in the question. Candidates may offer equal coverage of the two countries or they may
      prioritize their evaluation of one of them. However, both countries will be a feature of the response.
      There may be evaluation of the significance of technological developments in transport, such as
      railroads in the US; developments in the textile industry that fuelled industrialization in Britain and
      Meiji Japan; agricultural developments that made it possible to feed large urban populations, which
      provided a cheap workforce. Candidates’ opinions or conclusions will be presented clearly and
      supported by appropriate evidence.


14.   “The impact of industrialization on labour conditions was mainly positive.” Discuss with reference to
      two countries.

      The question requires that candidates offer a considered and balanced review of the statement
      that the impact of industrialization was mainly positive with reference to two countries. The two
      countries may or may not be from the same region. The impact of industrialization may extend
      beyond the timeframe but it must be clearly linked to the issue raised in the question. Candidates
      may offer equal coverage of both countries or they may prioritize their discussion of one of them.
      However, both countries will be a feature of the response. Candidates may refer to how
      industrialization has often been accompanied by legislation regarding, for instance, safety and
      working hours and how this has improved labour conditions. To challenge the statement,
      candidates may discuss the exploitation of workers, including women and children, especially
      when industrialization was in its early stages and worker safety was given little consideration.
      There may be discussion of the impact of rapid industrialization in authoritarian regimes, such as
      Stalin’s Russia, where conditions were often dangerous and brutal. Candidates’ opinions or
      conclusions will be presented clearly and supported by appropriate evidence.
                                                 – 11 –               N22/3/HISTX/BP2/ENG/TZ0/XX/M


Topic 8: Independence movements (1800–2000)

15.   Examine the importance of war to the rise of independence movements in two states, each chosen
      from a different region.

      The question requires that candidates consider the interrelationship between the importance of war
      to the rise of independence movements in two states, each of which must be from different
      regions. Candidates may offer equal coverage of the two states or they may prioritize one of them.
      However, both states will be a feature of the response. Candidates may examine the importance of
      Spain’s troubles in the Napoleonic Wars in fuelling independence movements in South America.
      British ingratitude for their contribution to the First World War boosted the Indian independence
      movement; the economic and political impact of the Second World War paved the way for the rise
      of independence movements throughout the British and French empires. Candidates’ opinions or
      conclusions will be presented clearly and supported by appropriate evidence.


16.   Compare and contrast the methods used in achieving independence in two states.

      The question requires that candidates give an account of the similarities and differences between
      the methods used in achieving independence in two states, referring to both throughout. There
      does not need to be an equal number of comparisons and contrasts. The two states may or may
      not be from the same region. Candidates may consider the use of force in, for example, the Greek
      War of Independence; Haiti, where Dessalines led a successful slave revolt; Bolivar’s campaigns
      against the Spaniards in Venezuela or the 8-year war of independence in Algeria. They may
      compare such methods with civil disobedience in India; patient negotiation with the colonial power,
      such as in Kenya, where Kenyatta eschewed violence, and Nigeria, where leaders were able to
      exploit the British promotion of self-government. Ideological leadership may have played its part,
      as in the case of Ho Chi Minh in Vietnam.
                                                 – 12 –                N22/3/HISTX/BP2/ENG/TZ0/XX/M


Topic 9: Emergence and development of democratic states (1848–2000)

17.   “Ideology was the most significant factor in the development of democratic states.” Discuss with
      reference to two states, each chosen from a different region.

      The question requires that candidates offer a considered and balanced review of the statement
      that ideology was the most significant factor in the development of two democratic states, each of
      which must be from different regions. Candidates may offer equal coverage of both states, or they
      may prioritize their discussion of one of them. However, both states will be a feature of the
      response. Candidates may discuss Nehru’s socialism which inspired him to create a corporatist
      state. In West Germany a robust liberal democracy was established, with the aim of banishing
      extremism. There may be discussion of the clash in Chile between Allende and Pinochet, who
      were at opposite ends of the ideological spectrum, or of the contrast between the Australian Liberal
      Party government of Menzies with Labour leaders such as Hawke. Other relevant factors may be
      discussed, for example economic and social aspects, but with a focus on the issue in the question.
      Candidates’ opinions or conclusions will be presented clearly and supported by appropriate
      evidence.


18.   To what extent were the aims of social policies achieved in two democratic states?

      The question requires that candidates consider the merits or otherwise of the suggestion that the
      aims of social policies were achieved in two states, which may or may not be from the same
      region. Achievements may extend beyond the timeframe but they must be clearly linked to the
      issue raised in the question. Candidates may offer equal coverage of both states, or they may
      prioritize their assessment of one of them. However, both states will be a feature of the response.
      Candidates may consider educational policy, which may have impacted on standards or equality of
      access, and the extent to which welfare policy supported the sick, disabled, unemployed or the
      elderly. Some states may have aimed to distribute wealth more fairly, or aimed to promote the
      rights of women and minorities and consideration may be given to how far these were achieved.
      Healthcare, housing and public health may also be addressed. Candidates’ opinions or
      conclusions will be presented clearly and supported by appropriate evidence.

Topic 10: Authoritarian states (20th century)

19.   To what extent did the weaknesses of political systems lead to the emergence of authoritarian
      states in two countries, each chosen from a different region?

      The question requires that candidates consider the merits or otherwise of the suggestion that
      weaknesses of political systems led to the emergence of authoritarian states in two countries which
      must be from different regions. Candidates may offer equal coverage of both states, or they may
      prioritize their assessment of one of them. However, both states will be a feature of the response.
      Candidates may refer to corruption in Obote’s Uganda or Batista’s Cuba; the chronic instability of
      Weimar Germany or Italy after the First World War; or the disunity within, and unpopularity of, the
      Ba’ath Party in Iraq before Saddam. Other relevant factors may be addressed, for example
      economic or social reasons or the impact of war, but with a focus on the issue in the question.
      Candidates’ opinions or conclusions will be presented clearly and supported by appropriate
      evidence.


20.   To what extent was foreign policy the most important factor in the maintenance of power in two
      authoritarian states?

      The question requires that candidates consider the merits or otherwise of the suggestion that
      foreign policy was the most important factor in the maintenance of power in two authoritarian states
      that may or may not be chosen from a different region. Candidates may offer equal coverage of
      both states, or they may prioritize their assessment of one of them. However, both states will be a
      feature of the response. Candidates may discuss the importance of the Suez Crisis in maintaining
      Nasser’s power in Egypt, or the importance of victory in Korea and the Russian alliance to Mao’s
      China. Hitler’s regime was maintained partly as a result of his foreign policy successes in 1935–38.
      Other relevant factors may be discussed, for example the use of law and the security forces,
      economic policy and charismatic leadership, but with a focus on the issue in the question.
      Candidates’ opinions or conclusions will be presented clearly and supported by appropriate
      evidence.

Topic 11: Causes and effects of 20th-century wars

21.   Compare and contrast the short-term causes of two wars.

      The question requires that candidates give an account of the similarities and differences between
      the short-term causes of two wars referring to both throughout. There does not need to be an equal
      number of comparisons and contrasts. The wars may or may not be from the same region.
      Candidates may refer to the short-term causes of the First and Second World War with
      comparisons made between the role of Serbia and Poland and a contrast between the threat to
      imperial longevity in one and political ideology in the other. The impact of the failure to uphold
      agreements to hold elections may be compared as a short-term cause of the Korean and Vietnam
      Wars and a contrast between the role of the superpowers as instigators of conflict. Civil wars may
      also provide appropriate examples with comparisons and contrasts made between such factors as
      ideological or ethnic divisions, the threat of counter-revolution or foreign intervention.


22.   Evaluate the short-term political impact of two wars, each chosen from a different region.

      The question requires that candidates make an appraisal of the short-term political impact of two
      wars. The wars must be chosen from a different region. Candidates may offer equal coverage of
      both wars or may prioritize the impact of one of them. However, both must feature in the response.
      Candidates may refer to the political impact of the First World War with an evaluation of the
      dissolution of empires and the emergence of the successor states. For the Malvinas/Falklands
      War, there may be an evaluation of the removal of a military junta on the one hand and, on the
      other, the consolidation in power of a victorious government. With reference to the Six Day War,
      the political impact of the territorial expansion of Israel; the perceived humiliation of Nasser; and
      the emergence of a more radical Palestinian nationalism may be evaluated. Candidates’ opinions
      or conclusions will be presented clearly and supported by appropriate evidence.

Topic 12: The Cold War: Superpower tensions and rivalries (20th century)

23.   Evaluate the cultural impact of the Cold War on two countries, each chosen from a different region.

      The question requires that candidates make an appraisal of the cultural impact of the Cold War in
      two countries that must be from different regions. Candidates may offer equal coverage of both
      countries or may prioritize one of them. However, both must feature in the response. Candidates
      may evaluate the impact of McCarthyism upon the Hollywood film industry. The desire to promote
      abstract art and jazz as indicators of a “free society” in the US may also be evaluated. In Cuba, the
      impact of Soviet brutalist architecture that ended projects such as the National Arts School may be
      evaluated as may the promotion of ballet as instrumental to promoting excellence in revolutionary
      Cuba. Candidates may also refer to the impact of the Cold War upon sporting activities such as
      boycotts of the Olympics. In China, the impact of the Cultural Revolution may be evaluated and
      the explosion of propaganda directed at the “revisionist” USSR as well as the castigation of all
      culture associated with the West. Candidates’ opinions or conclusions will be presented clearly and
      supported by appropriate evidence.


24.   Evaluate the impact of two crises, each chosen from a different region, on the development of the
      Cold War.

      The question requires that candidates make an appraisal of the impact of two crises on the
      development of the Cold War. The crises must be chosen from a different region. Candidates may
      offer equal coverage of both crises or prioritize one of them. However, both crises must feature in
      the response. Candidates may refer to the impact of the Cuban Missile Crisis and evaluate how it
      influenced superpower relations where tensions were initially heightened only to give way to
      agreements over nuclear testing. The impact of the Hungarian Revolution of 1956 may be
      evaluated with reference to the tightening of control over the Eastern Bloc and the impact it had
      upon the membership of Communist Parties in the West. The impact of the Korean Crisis leading
      to a proxy war may be evaluated and how this crisis was indicative of the reluctance of the
      superpowers to engage in open warfare. Candidates’ opinions or conclusions will be presented
      clearly and supported by appropriate evidence.
