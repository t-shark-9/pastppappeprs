Critical Thinking – explanation, analysis and evaluation

These trigger words often signal critical thinking. The bold words are the key terms in the various
criteria.
Explanation – Because, as a result of, due to, therefore, consequently, for example
Analysis – Furthermore, additionally, however, but, conversely, likewise, in addition, on the other hand,
whereas
Evaluation ‫ –ؘ‬My opinion, overall, although, despite, on balance, weighing up

Examiners should be aware that in some cases, candidates may take a different approach, which if
appropriate should be rewarded. If in doubt, check with your team leader.

In the case of an “identify” question read all answers and mark positively up to the maximum marks.
Disregard incorrect answers. In all other cases where a question asks for a certain number of facts
eg “describe two kinds”, mark the first two correct answers. This could include two descriptions,
one description and one identification, or two identifications.

It should be recognized that, given time constraints, answers for part (c) questions are likely to
include a much narrower range of issues and concepts than identified in the markband. There is
no “correct” answer. Examiners must be prepared to award full marks to answers which
synthesize and evaluate even if they do not examine all the stimulus material.

1.   Virtual learning environments

     (a)   (i)    Identify two hardware devices that a university lecturer could use to record
                  a lecture.                                                                     [2]

                  Answers may include:
                  • PC/laptop/cellphone
                  • Microphone
                  • Webcam / video recording device
                  • Audio interface

                  Award [1] for identifying each hardware device up to [2].

           (ii)   Identify the steps that a university lecturer may use to upload course
                  material to the virtual learning environment (VLE).                            [4]

                  Answers may include:
                  • Convert the recording into the correct format for uploading (compress if
                    needed).
                  • Enter URL of VLE landing page / access bookmark / open the university
                    website on a browser.
                  • Go to the login option.
                  • Provide login credentials / user ID and password.
                  • Open the platform (VLE).
                  • Use drop down menus to select course.
                  • Upload the course material / drag file from local computer or cloud to the
                    location.

                  Award [1] for identifying each step up to [4].

(b)   The university needs to choose between open-source software and proprietary
      software to develop the virtual learning environment (VLE).

      Analyse these two options.                                                                 [6]

      Using open-source software:
      • Open-source software is often free or low-cost, may allow the university to acquire
        more software within a limited budget/may suit budget constraints.
      • Open-source community is very active and is continually making updates which may
        be a more efficient mechanism than the staged releases by proprietary software
        companies.
      • The open-source community can often provide immediate help with any software
        problems.
      • Open-source software can be changed or customized to suit the university
        requirements.
      • The source code is available for programmers to modify.
      • Open-source software may not have all the options/features needed by the
        university.
      • Using open-source software for the VLE may require hiring more programming staff
        to upgrade the software.
      • Is the open-source software secure?
      • The open-source software can be personalized to the university’s needs

      Using proprietary software:
      • Proprietary software includes safeguards such as guarantees / warranties. (support is a
        new point and is included at the end).
      • Most proprietary software can be fully customized to suit the university requirements.
      • Companies that provide proprietary software generally provide frequent security
        updates/patches as they have a vested interest in keeping their product secure.
      • The user interface may be a more familiar design as the software is considered as part of a
        whole package.
      • Proprietary software may have a greater range of features/options than open-source
        software.
      • Proprietary software may demand a higher level of investment by the university.
      • Manufacturers of proprietary software can provide support and assistance to the company.

(c)   Students are in the process of selecting a university to complete their degree.
      They have two options:

      • Option 1: A traditional university using face-to-face environments.
      • Option 2: A university only offering online courses using a virtual learning
        environment (VLE) platform.

      Evaluate these two options.                                                                   [8]

      Answer may include:

      Reasons for opting for face-to-face learning
      • Students can focus better in F2F environment, learning from home may have
        distractions.
      • Access to resources – students will have better access to resources, e.g.
        laboratories, library, sports facility, etc.
      • Face-to-face learning may be more effective in organizing students and their
        studies.
      • Improve social and interpersonal skills – students may have greater bonding in F2F
        environment -they will have the ability to interact with professors and students in
        class physically.
      • Students may have better learning opportunities-they can get instant answers, can
        create a better network with fellow students, the professors.
      • the degree earned in F2F environment may carry more value than VLE.
      • Unlike VLE, it is easier to enforce compulsory attendance in F2F environment –
        students are more likely to succeed when they attend classes consistently.
      • It is not necessary to have the technology at home.

      Reasons for opting for online learning
      • Greater access to university courses overseas or in other states as they can study
        from home.
      • Students will have greater flexibility – they can learn at their own pace, in their own
        time ensuring that they understand each topic before moving on. But this requires
        motivation and good organizational skills. Can repeat the videos as many times as
        you want.
      • Professors can track students’ progress more efficiently using the content access
        logs and provide more personalized support to them – implies professors are given
        time to do this.
      • University can restrict the availability of any activity, resource or course section
        according to conditions such as date, grade obtained, group or other activity
        completion. This may need to be flexible to allow for special cases.
      • Learning through VLE would mean that learners can look after their families or work
        while studying as study can be done at a time that suits them.
      • There may be opportunities to collaborate with other students from different
        countries allowing a global perspective.
      • Less expensive – no need for traveling, hostel fees, etc.
      • Students will be able to build better organizational skills – but some students may
        find this challenging.
      • Good option for those with physical needs.

      In part (c) of this question it is expected there will be a balance in the ITGS terminology
      between IT technical terminology and the terminology related to social and ethical
      impacts.

                   • TIFF / tagged image file format
                   • PSD / Photoshop document
                   • RAW / raw image formats

                   Award [1] for each file format identified up to [2].

           (ii)    Define the term image resolution.                                                 [2]

                   Answers may include:
                   • The density of the pixels in the image / the number/amount of dots, or pixels
                     per inch.
                   • Resolution is measured in pixels per inch (PPI) or dots per inch (DPI).
                   • The sharpness and clarity of an image (the higher the number of pixels, the
                     greater the resolution).

                   Quality – only accept if it is related to resolution.

                   Award [1] for identifying each appropriate statement up to [2].

           (iii)   Identify two biometric authentication methods that could be used to access
                   the simulator.                                                                    [2]

                   Answers may include:
                   • Fingerprints.
                   • Facial recognition.
                   • Voice recognition.
                   • Iris recognition.
                   • Retina scan / Eye scan.

                   Award [1] for identifying each appropriate authentication method up to [2].

(b)   (i)    Distinguish between a model and a simulation.                                 [2]

             Answers may include:
             • A model is a simplification of the key characteristics, behaviours and
               functions of the selected system or process.
             • A model is based on the algorithms and equations used to capture the
               behaviour of the system being modelled.
             • A model is used to ask ‘what if’ questions.
             • A model is a ‘representation’ of a real-life object/system.

             • A simulation is the actual running of the program that contains these
               equations or algorithms.
             • A simulation, therefore, is the process of running a model / in a
               simulation, models can be used to study existing or proposed
               characteristics of a system.
             • Simulation takes user input to simulate a situation – to run through
               various scenarios.

             Award [1] for identifying each difference between a model and a simulation,
             up to [2].

      (ii)   Explain why the quality of user documentation is important for the success
             of the simulator.                                                             [4]

             Answers may include:
             • Good user documentation will make information easily accessible.
             • The details included in user documentation may explain the functionality
               of the simulator to the users. / It helps them have the best product
               experience.
             • It may prevent equipment from being damaged through incorrect use
             • It may simplify the understanding of the simulator to new users who can
               learn to use the simulator quickly.
             • It can cut support costs / less dependency on the developer’s direct
               support.
             • It may help the users troubleshoot certain common operational issues
               related to the simulator. / FAQs included in user documentation may
               have answers to most common issues faced by the users.

(c)   To what extent do the benefits of using simulators for training soldiers outweigh
      the concerns?                                                                          [8]

      Answers may include:

      Benefits of using simulators in the training process
      • Cost-effective and time-saving.
      • It can avoid danger and loss of life / safe environment to learn in / soldiers can
        be placed into a risk-free environment, which will let them safely carry out any
        combat drills without any harm.
      • Highly immersive experience – VR/AR / Conditions can be varied and
        outcomes investigated.
      • Soldiers can experience a variety of environments and scenarios, e.g.
        changes in terrain/changes in weather conditions.
      • Progress can be measured objectively / soldiers’ training performance can be
        recorded digitally for further analysis or training purposes.
      • Simulations can be slowed down to study a soldier’s behaviour more closely.
      • Simulators allow soldiers to experience any type of vehicle in a far more
        immersive and realistic way.
      • Soldiers can navigate environments native to any part of the world.

      Concerns associated with the use of simulators in the training process
      • Simulations are not always able to completely recreate real-life situations.
      • Use of VR/AR may cause eye strain.
      • To simulate a scenario, a thorough understanding is needed and an awareness
        of all the factors involved. This relies on developers being given complete and
        accurate data.
      • The developer may not be able to visualize real war like situation and may miss
        out important considerations.
      • Simulators can be very expensive and require constant updates and
        maintenance.
      • Trainees need to be trained on how to use the software and/or hardware and
        this takes up time and costs money.
      • No real consequences for mistakes may result in trainees underperforming and
        not being fully engaged in the training, thus producing inaccurate results.

      In part (c) of this question it is expected there will be a balance in the ITGS
      terminology between IT technical terminology and the terminology related to
      social and ethical impacts.

                   • Encryption translates original data (plain text) into an alternate form
                     (cipher text).
                   • The encryption process uses an encryption algorithm.
                   • Encryption keys have a predetermined length / longer keys are more
                     difficult for an attacker to guess than shorter ones.
                   • A key is used for encrypting and decrypting / to transform the cipher text
                     back into the plaintext.
                   • An asymmetric encryption, also known as public key encryption, uses
                     two separate keys; a public key and a private key.
                   • Even if encrypted data is intercepted, it cannot be used/read.

           (iii)   Identify one advantage for Tap2Talk users of receiving notifications.              [1]

                   Answer may include:
                   • Notifications can keep users updated e.g. promotional offers, social
                     media post by friends/relatives, emergency updates, news.
                   • It reminds the user to visit the app.
                   • Notifications can popup on screen even when the app is closed.
                   • Notifications are generally free for users to receive.

           (iv)    Identify one disadvantage for Tap2Talk users of receiving notifications.           [1]

                   Answer may include:
                   • Frequent notifications such as promotional messages may be irritating
                     for users.
                   • The notification may come at an awkward time for the user, for example,
                     due to time zone differences.
                   • The notifications often disappear after they have been accessed or
                     phone is restarted / users may lose access to important notifications.

                    Note to examiners: Do not accept a disadvantage that people next to you can see
                    notifications.
                   Award [1] for identifying a disadvantage of receiving notifications up to [1].

(b)   A number of Tap2Talk users are concerned about ticking a single check box to agree to the
      new terms of service and privacy policy (see Figure 3).

      Explain why Tap2Talk users might be concerned about ticking a single check box
      to agree to the new terms of service and privacy policy.                                [6]

      Answers may include:
      • Users will just click the accept check box as it is quick and will not read the
        policy terms in detail.
      • The language in the terms of conditions is so complex that users would not
        understand it.
      • The terms and conditions can be very long and in a very small font size and
        users will not read the whole document.
      • The user needs to use this service therefore they will agree to the terms and
        conditions almost regardless of what is included in them.
      • An unticked checkbox may lead to the termination of services.
      • Users know that the privacy policies in their country or region may be different
        from the company’s country or the country where the data is stored.
      • New terms of service and privacy policy are not clear or easy to understand
      • There is not a validation method to check if the end user is the one accepting
        the new terms of service and privacy
      • There is not a validation method in case terms are accepted by mistake
        (additional checkbox)
      • If the user wants to change his decision during the process, there is no option
        to go back to previous conditions

(c)   Tap2Talk has decided to share its users’ data with a third party, GlobalConnect.
      This will mean that all user data, such as text messages, locational information
      and media, will be held in GlobalConnect’s database.

      Discuss the impacts of this decision for Tap2Talk users.                             [8]

      Answer may include:

      Advantages for the users
      • They can enjoy highly personalized / targeted product suggestions.
      • Locational information may let the company combine user’s movements with
        information from other people and deliver services that benefit everyone.
      • This may minimize marketing communications irrelevant to them.
      • They can receive offers to help them save money on the things they buy often
      • They may get recommendations to try something new.
      • Users may have better backup capabilities – text message and media stored
        in GlobalConnect’s servers may help the user retrieve them if they are
        lost/deleted from their device.

      Disadvantages for the users
      • The pictures, text messages, locational information stored in GlobalConnect
         database may be hacked and misused.
      • They may be concerned about the breach of their personal data and the risks
         associated with identity theft.
      • User may not be aware of how their data is going to be used by
         GlobalConnect.
      • Users may be concerned about the confidentiality of their data, e.g. they may
         not be willing to disclose places of their visit to GlobalConnect or any third
         party company.
      • Users will not be aware of data sharing agreements GlobalConnect has with
         other companies, and the potential impacts of their data being shared.

      In part (c) of this question it is expected there will be a balance in the ITGS
      terminology between IT technical terminology and the terminology related to

4.   Electronic health records in a hospital

     (a)   (i)     Identify two features of a local area network (LAN).                               [2]

                   Answers may include:
                   • Multiple computers connected together (LAN Definition).
                   • Those in LAN have unique IP addresses.
                   • Is limited to a small (geographical) area.
                   • Privately owned
                   • Allows data transmission and resource sharing
                   • Have high data transfer rates.

                   • May be unreliable.
                   • May be prone to interference.
                   • Latency / slower speed compared to wired networks
                   • May not cover all areas.
                   • Transmission of high resolution images and videos, e.g. MRI, X-ray, may

(b)   (i)    Distinguish between the identification of a user and the authentication of
             that user on a network.                                                           [2]

             Answers may include:

             Identification
             • Identification – it is a form of access control which identifies who the user
                is.
             • Users supply information to identify themselves, such as name,
                username, and user ID.
             • Identification alone is not generally enough to grant access to the
                intended user.

             Authentication
             • Authentication is the process of validating an identity provided to a
               system / relates to the checks made to ensure the validity of a claimed
               identity.
             • May be done by entering a password / number sent to cellphone.
             • Authentication usually occurs after identification is complete, such as
               when you supply a password to support a username during the login
               process.
             • Requires information only the person identified knows (e.g., security
               question, password) / something the person identified has (e.g., ID
               badge, a cryptographic key) / something the customer is (e.g., facial
               recognition, biometric data).

             Award [1] for each definition (identification and authentication) up to [2].

      (ii)   Explain why a relational database would be used to store the patients’ data.      [4]

             Answers may include:
             • Reduced data storage footprint, i.e. removes redundant data through
               normalization.
             • Update anomalies – use of relational database may minimize the
               occurrence of update anomalies
             • Data only needs to be updated in one place
             • Scalability: new data may be added independent of existing records.
             • Future modifications can be easily made.
             • Ability to deal with larger datasets.
             • Access can be restricted to individual tables, e.g. accounts department
               may not have access to private health data.

(c)   The state health department has proposed a plan to centralize patient records
      and connect all hospitals to create a state-wide electronic health record (EHR)
      system.

      Discuss whether this state-wide EHR system should be developed.                      [8]

      Answers may include:

      Advantages of a state-wide EHR system
      • Providing accurate, up-to-date, and complete information about patients at the
        point of care eg if a patient of Philipedia Hospital becomes ill/has an accident
        when visiting another part of the state
      • Enabling quick access to patient records across the state for more
        coordinated, efficient care.
      • Enables the easy sharing of patient information with other clinicians who may
        not be located in the local hospital

      Challenges associated with implementation of a state-wide EHR system
      • May be very expensive to set up the state-wide EHR system.
      • Organization and administrative time to get consents and agreements in place
        and signed by patients
      • May require considerable amounts of time to transfer the patient’s records to
        the new EHR system.
      • There is more chance of unauthorized access using a WAN. If unauthorised
        access occurs this could pose considerable security risks for the patients.
      • Training will be required for the hospital staff for them to get acquainted with
        the new system and use it efficiently.
      • There may be unforeseen ethical / legal implications of sharing patient data
        via a WAN/VPN

      In part (c) of this question it is expected there will be a balance in the ITGS
      terminology between IT technical terminology and the terminology related to
      social and ethical impacts.
