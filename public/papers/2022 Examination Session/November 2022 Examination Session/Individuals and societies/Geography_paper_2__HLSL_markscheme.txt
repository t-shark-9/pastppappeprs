                                              Section A
1.   Changing population

     (a)   Outline one physical factor that can lead to an area having a high population density.       [2]

           Award [1] for the valid factor and [1] for development.

           Valid reasons include:
           • proximity to river [1]; this will ensure a consistent water supply [1]
           • availability of flat land [1]; means land is easier to build on [1]
           • coastal locations [1]; for easier access to trade [1]
           • fertile soil in an area [1]; crop yields are high [1]
           • access to energy or mineral resources resources [1] development of industry [1]
           • temperate/equable climates [1] allow agricultural production/pleasant living conditions [1].

     (b)   Suggest two ways in which a demographic dividend can bring economic benefits
           to a country.                                                                            [2 + 2]

           Award [1] for a valid economic benefit and [1] for development (at a national level).

           Possibilities include:
           • The “bulge” in the adult population leads to a high number of economically active people
             paying taxes [1], benefitting the overall economy / GDP of the country [1].
           • More economically active adults than elderly dependents [1] means that less
             governmental tax income will go towards e.g. pensions/care homes [1].
           • A lower number of young dependents than economically active people [1] will incur less
             cost for education [1].
           • More people in the economically active sector gives a market for goods/services [1] this
             will stimulate industrial activity [1].
           • Increase in labour supply [1] attractive for MNCs/industrial investment/boost to national
             productivity.

     (c)   Explain two ways in which environmental push factors lead to forced migration.           [2 + 2]

           Award [1] for the specific environmental push factor and [1] for the development explaining
           how it has led to forced migration.

           Possibilities include:
              • Crops fail due to excess heat [1], leading to food insecurity/loss of livelihood [1].
              • Homes are destroyed by volcanic eruption/earthquake [1], therefore people have
                  nowhere to live [1]
              • Extreme weather events such as cyclones destroy communities [1] people's homes
                  destroyed [1]
              • Long term climate change such as increased increased drought/changing
                  monsoons/desertification [1] – decrease agricultural yields [1]
              • Soil erosion/degradation [1] – unable to farm and produce food [1]
              • Water contamination from rising sea levels/chemicals [1] – water supply
                  reduced/unable to irrigate [1]
              • Sea level rise flooding coastal/lowland areas [1] – inundation of
                  farmland/communities [1]
              • Wildfires [1] – destroy settlements [1]
           .
                                                  –4–                 N22/3/GEOGR/BP2/ENG/TZ0/XX/M


2.   Global climate — vulnerability and resilience

     (a)   Describe the distribution of the selected heatwave events shown on the map. [2]

           Award [1] for each valid statement about the distribution, up to a maximum of [2].

           Possibilities include:
           • Uneven
           • More in S Europe
           • Clusters in SW Europe / Southern Spain
           • Clusters in SE Europe/Romania/Bulgaria
           • There are fewer in Northern Europe (such as in Sweden and Norway)
           • There are fewer in Central Europe (Southern Germany, Czech Republic).

     (b)   Suggest two human factors that can increase vulnerability to extreme weather events.      [2 + 2]

           Award [1] for a valid human factor and a further [1] for development. Do NOT award a mark
           for physical factors.

            •   Lower level of economic development of an area [1] could indicate a lower investment
                in projects that would help to reduce vulnerability [1].
            •   Due to poverty [1], large numbers of people live in locations/property which are/is more
                at risk from extreme weather [1].
            •   Development in areas that are liable to experience the impacts of extreme weather [1] –
                housing development on floodplains/lowland coasts [1].
            •   In areas that have an ageing population there may be greater risk [1] due to reduced
                mobility [1].
            •   In areas with lower education levels [1] there may be less knowledge as to how to
                prevent / minimize the vulnerability to extreme weather events [1].
            •   Governmental policies may prioritize spending in different areas such as education or
                health [1] – disaster preparation is not addressed [1].
            •   Limited risk perception by the population/governments [1] – continue to live in areas
                that experience extreme weather [1]
            •   Gender profile/women more vulnerable [1] – skewed power relations/roles in
                production/lack of access to education/exclusion from decision making [1]
            •   Occupation of the population [1] – farmers may be more vulnerable to weather as it is
                vital for their living [1]
            •   Populations that suffer from the impacts of conflict [1] – often live in situations that are
                susceptable to extreme weather [1]
                                             –5–                N22/3/GEOGR/BP2/ENG/TZ0/XX/M


(c)   Explain two government-led strategies to reduce the causes of global climate change.     [2 + 2]

      Award [1] for a valid government led strategy and [1] for development related to reduction of
      cause.

      For example:
        • Government investment in renewables [1] – reduction of GHG emissions from fossil
            fuels [1]
        • Government commitment to global conferences, such as Cop26 in Glasgow (not just
            the name of a Protocol/COP) [1], can lead to specific government planned action to
            combat the source of GHGs (must state specific planned action) [1].
        • Planning committees encourage replanting of forests [1] to create a new carbon sink
            [1].
        • Government-sponsored geoengineering strategies [1], such as cloud seeding to
            increase cloud cover to reflect solar radiation [1].
        • Local government strategies, such as recycling [1], reducing methane emissions from
            landfill [1].
        • Efficiency measures by local government eg installation of LED bulbs/insulation [1] –
            saves on energy use [1]
        • Transport policies such as making life easier for pedestrians/cyclists [1] – takes cars off
            the roads so decreases use of fossil fuels [1]

3.    Global resource consumption and security

      (a)   (i)        State the daily water usage in gallons per person for the Dominican Republic.       [1]

                       1000

            (ii)       Estimate the range of water usage.                                                  [1]

                       1693 (accept 1685–1710)

      (b)   Explain two aspects of Boserup’s optimistic view of resource management.                   [2 + 2]

            Award [1] for each valid understanding of the Boserup approach and [1] for development to
            show how it impacts on management of the food resource.

            For example:
               • New inventions/increase in technology [1] will increase food availability by using new
                   machinery [1].
               • An increase in ingenuity [1] will lead to high yield varieties of crops [1].
               • Land reform [1] will lead to increased productivity of food [1].
               • Increase in population stimulates agricultural change [1] – more food produced to
                   feed population [1]
               • Humans will develop alternative resources [1] – switch of food resources to cultured
                   meat/plant basd substitutes [1].

(c)   Explain why the growth of the global middle class may lead to:

            (i)        increased water consumption;                                                        [2]

                       Award [1] a valid reason and [1] for development.

                    For example:
                   •  The rise in disposable income associated with the GMC [1] means they are able to
                      buy more advanced appliances eg power showers/recreational use of water [1].
                   • Rise of GMC means more access to taps [1] – 24 hour availability of water [1]
                   • Increased education of population [1]
                   • Increased consumption of food/meat [1] – embedded water/growth of crops requires
                      water/meat production is heavy user of water [1]
                   • Increased use of natural resources/minerals [1] – water needed in extractions and
                      processing [1]
                   • Increased use of water in construction [1] – GMC build more and better houses [1]

            (ii)       changes in diet.                                                                    [2]

                       Award [1] a valid reason and [1] for development.

                       For example:
                       • An increase in knowledge about what makes a healthy diet [1], leads to an
                          increase in buying more fresh/organic food products [1].
                       • Increased availability/ability to afford of a range of food choices [1] and this can
                          lead to higher consumption of higher-cost food such as meat/imported foods [1]
                       • Increased disposable income [1] – increase in amount of food consumed [1]
                       • Changing perception of food [1] – Westernized diets [1]
                       • Increased purchasing power [1] – shift away from staples [1]
                       • Growth of GMC in urban settings [1] – access to restaurants/convenience foods [1]
                                                  –7–                N22/3/GEOGR/BP2/ENG/TZ0/XX/M


                                              Section B
4.   (a)   State the female and male age groups that have the highest number of bed days used.        [1 + 1]

           Female 85+ [1]
           Male 70–74 [1]

     (b)   Suggest one weakness of the choropleth map in the infographic in the way it represents
           the old age dependency data.                                                                   [2]

           Award [1] for a valid suggestion and [1] for development.

           For example: The area that is represented is an average [1], and variations within the area
           are not shown by category [1].

           Other possibilities include:
           • the categories are not continuous data
           • boundaries between the counties show abrupt changes in value but in reality changes are
             much more gradual
           • counties/provinces not identified
           • choropleth maps are normally shown as gradations of the same colour – makes them
             easier to interpret.

     (c)   To what extent does the evidence in the infographic support the view that ageing is a
           significant issue for the Republic of Ireland?                                                 [6]

           Award [1] for each valid point supported by evidence taken from the infographic and/or
           development of a valid point, up to a maximum of [5].

           Award a maximum of [4] if only one side of the argument is given.

           Award the final [1] for an overall appraisal, which weighs up the infographic as a whole.

           Support:
           • Reference to hospital beds occupied by ageing population.
           • Reference to healthcare concerns (arthritis).
           • Reference to increasing life expectancy.
           • Reference to concentration of high/low age dependency ratios in certain areas.
           • Healthcare costs relating to old people continuing to rise (11% GDP by 2050).

           Against:
           • Reference to contributions to society (caring for their grandchildren).
           • Reference to economic contributions to members of the family.
           • Reference to areas that do not contain high old age dependency.

           Do not credit simple quoting of data from the resource – it needs to be given a context.

           For example: Ageing is a significant issue for Ireland because providing medical care for the
           older population takes up a lot of GDP [1]. 30% have fair or poor health [1]. On the other
           hand, it is not an issue that is significant across the whole of Ireland [1]. The elderly can
           make contributions to society such as caring for their grandchildren [1]. The elderly also
           provide financial support to the younger generations [1]. On balance, ageing is an issue and
           will become an increasing issue in the future as life expectancy rises [1].
