Prescribed subject 1: Military leaders

1.   (a)   How, according to Source A, did the Capetian monarch Philip II expand his
           control over territory in France?                                                           [3]

           •   Philip II raised troops for a first campaign to take control of all the Norman Vexin.
           •   Philip II also made a second incursion into Normandy, taking more territory.
           •   Philip II destroyed several strongholds and took numerous prisoners.
           •   Philip II concluded an agreement with John Lackland.

           The above material is an indication of what candidates may elect to write about in
           their responses. It is neither prescriptive nor exhaustive and no set answer is
           required. Award [1] for each relevant point up to a maximum of [3].

     (b)   What does Source D suggest about the political relationship between Richard I
           and Philip II?                                                                              [2]

           • Philip II is the only one wearing a crown and holding a sword, suggesting his
             superior power.
           • Richard I is kneeling and paying homage to Philip II, which means he is
             accepting Philip II’s authority.
           • The presence of armies on both sides suggests that the relationship between
             Richard I and Philip II was unstable and could lead to conflict.

           The above material is an indication of what candidates may elect to write about in
           their responses. It is neither prescriptive nor exhaustive and no set answer is
           required. Award [1] for each relevant point up to a maximum of [2].

2.   With reference to its origin, purpose and content, analyse the value and limitations of
     Source A for an historian studying the expansion of the Capetian monarchy.                  [4]

     Value:
     • The source was written by an historian who was contemporary to the events.
     • It is a chronicle written with the aim of recording the deeds of Philip II.
     • It provides information about the conflicts between Philip II and the English kings.

     Limitations:
     • Since it is based on contemporary accounts it lacks the benefit of hindsight.
     • It is not clear from the source how successful Philip II was in expanding his control.
     • The information about Philip II’s actions could have been exaggerated to highlight
       his reputation.

     The focus of the question is on the value and limitations of the source. If only value or
     limitations are discussed, award a maximum of [2]. Origin, purpose and content should
     be used as supporting evidence to make relevant comments on the value and
     limitations. For [4] there must be at least one reference to each of them in either the
     value or the limitations.
                                                  –5–                  N22/3/HISTX/BP1/ENG/TZ0/XX/M


3.   Compare and contrast what Sources B and C reveal about the expansion of Philip II’s
     control in France.                                                                         [6]

      Marks    Level descriptor
       5–6     • The response includes clear and valid points of comparison and of contrast.
       3–4     • The response includes some valid points of comparison and/or of contrast,
                 although these points may lack clarity.
        1–2    • The response consists of description of the content of the source(s), and/or
                 general comments about the source(s), rather than valid points of comparison
                 or of contrast.
         0     • The response does not reach a standard described by the descriptors above.

     Apply the markbands that provide the “best fit” to the responses given by candidates
     and award credit wherever it is possible to do so. The following material is an
     indication of what candidates may elect to write about in their responses. It is neither
     prescriptive nor exhaustive and no set answer is required.

     Comparison:
     • Both sources suggest that the timing was right for Philip II’s plans to expand his
       control.
     • Both sources mention that Philip II’s expansion could be limited by an oath sworn to
       Richard I.
     • Both sources state that Richard I’s seneschal and men resisted Philip II.
     • Both sources mention Philip II’s alliance with John Lackland against Richard I.

     Contrast:
     • Source B suggests that Philip II’s plans were hindered due to Pope Celestine’s
       refusal to absolve him from the obligation of his oath, whereas Source C states his
       plans could be considered legal.
     • Source B claims that John Lackland signed a treaty and paid homage to Philip II,
       whereas Source C states he was stopped from joining Philip II by Richard I’s
       ministers and his mother Eleanor.

     expansion.                                                                                         [9]

     Apply the markbands that provide the “best fit” to the responses given by candidates
     and award credit wherever it is possible to do so. The following material is an
     indication of what candidates may elect to write about in their responses. It is neither
     prescriptive nor exhaustive and no set answer is required. While it is expected that
     there will be coverage of at least two of the sources, candidates are not required to
     refer to all four sources in their responses.

     Indicative content

     Source A             Philip II succeeded in conquering territories including the Vexin
                          and other regions in Normandy, destroying strongholds and taking
                          prisoners; but he failed to capture Rouen and was forced to
                          withdraw. Philip II tried to conclude an alliance with John, but this
                          proved to be unsatisfactory.

     Source B             Philip II’s proposal of an alliance with John was successful and
                          John paid homage to the French king. However, John’s plans were
                          stopped by the barons in England. Concurrently, Philip II rejected
                          Richard I as a vassal and demanded the seneschal of Normandy
                          recognise Philip II’s rule, but he refused to do so.
                                             –7–                  N22/3/HISTX/BP1/ENG/TZ0/XX/M


    Source C        Philip II’s plan was to claim Richard I’s lands based on legal terms.
                    Philip II also tried to gain territory by allying with John and
                    controlling the seneschal and nobles of Normandy, but this policy
                    failed. John was stopped by Richard I’s ministers and his mother,
                    and Richard I’s men in Normandy refused to accept Philip II’s
                    claims.

    Source D        Phillip II is the leading political authority and Richard I is
                    acknowledging his command by paying homage. However, the
                    presence of armies on both sides suggests Philip II’s authority
                    could be challenged.

    Own knowledge   Candidates may offer further details about the Treaty of Messina,
                    signed between Philip II and Richard I in 1191. They can also
                    mention the alliance with Count Baldwin IX of Flanders to aid the
                    advance over Angevin territory. Candidates may also make
                    reference to Richard I’s absence during the Third Crusade and his
                    subsequent captivity under the Duke of Austria, Leopold V, on his
                    way back to Europe, which benefitted Philip II’s plans in France.
                    They can also refer to Richard I’s men in Mantes accepting Philip
                    II’s authority in 1193.
                    Candidates may challenge the question by referring to the success
                    of Richard I on his return when he was able to regain a number of
                    fortresses, fought Philip II’s army in the battle of Fréteval, and took
                    control over the Vexin. Candidates may also argue that between
                    1198 and 1199 Philip II’s position was weak, he had lost the loyalty
                    of many men and only recovered his power after the death of
                    Richard I in 1199.

Prescribed subject 2: Conquest and its impact

5.   (a)   What, according to Source E, was the reaction of the Jewish elders to the
           Alhambra Decree?                                                                     [3]

           •   The elders pleaded for the decree to be annulled.
           •   One of the elders spoke to defend the Jewish people.
           •   The elders decided to ask for an extension of time.
           •   They believed that the king had decided to destroy all of the Jews.

           The above material is an indication of what candidates may elect to write about in
           their responses. It is neither prescriptive nor exhaustive and no set answer is
           required. Award [1] for each relevant point up to a maximum of [3].

     (b)   What does Source F suggest about the meeting between the Catholic Monarchs
           and the representative of the Jews in 1492?                                          [2]

           • The monarchs seem disinterested.
           • The Church was opposed to the meeting.
           • The Jewish representative is in a weak position as he is alone.

6.   With reference to its origin, purpose and content, analyse the value and limitations of
     Source H for an historian studying the expulsion of the Jews in 1492.                       [4]

     Value:
     • As a thesis written in 2018 it offers the benefit of hindsight.
     • The purpose of the source is to specifically research the expulsion of the Jews from
       Spain.
     • The source gives reasons for the expulsion of Jews from Spain.
     • The source offers detailed information on the economic consequences of the
       expulsion.

     Limitations:
     • The author is a student and not a professional historian.
     • The source is mainly focused on the economic impact and does not consider other
       aspects of the expulsion.

     The focus of the question is on the value and limitations of the source. If only value or
     limitations are discussed, award a maximum of [2]. Origin, purpose and content should
     be used as supporting evidence to make relevant comments on the value and
     limitations. For [4] there must be at least one reference to each of them in either the
     value or the limitations.

7.   Compare and contrast what Sources G and H reveal about economic change due to
     the expulsion of the Jews.                                                                 [6]

     prescriptive nor exhaustive and no set answer is required.

     Comparison:
     • Both sources state that Spain’s economy was negatively impacted.
     • Both sources suggest that Jewish economic activities were affected.
     • Both sources claim that some non-Jewish people benefitted from the expulsion.

     Contrast:
     • While Source H states that the Spanish economy suffered greatly, Source G
       suggests that this only caused a short-lived decline.
     • Source G states that most of the Jews played limited economic roles, whereas
       Source H suggests that they were very significant to the Spanish economy.
     • Source G states that most prosperous Jews had already converted by the fourteenth
       century and remained in Spain, whereas Source H suggests that there was a great
       loss of Jewish financial experts after July 1492.

     Indicative content

     Source E             After the Decree, the elders begged the Catholic Monarchs to have
                          it annulled or at least to have an extension of time to leave, but
                          they were not listened to. The Jews felt threatened and believed
                          the king had decided to destroy them.

     Source F             The Jewish representative was in a weak position and his pleas
                          were not listened to. The Church and the monarchs were against
                          him and so he had no support.

Source G        Jews were severely affected as they had only four months to leave
                Spain. It was difficult for Jews in Spain to be able to sell their
                possessions at a fair price and they were forbidden from taking
                any gold or silver out of Spain. Some converted rather than leave.
                However, very few prosperous Jews were affected by the Decree.

Source H        There was a great loss of Jewish financial workers and experts.
                Many foreign bankers and moneylenders replaced the Jews.

Own knowledge   Candidates may offer further details of the impact of the Decree
                such as that around 200 000 Jews converted to Catholicism and
                about 100 000 were expelled. Many of the Jews fled to Italy,
                Germany, the Middle East, and North Africa. As conversos, some
                Jews enjoyed social and commercial success in Spain. They
                competed with the Church and aristocrats for influence over the
                royal families. Jews and conversos also played an important role
                during the Reconquista War because they had the ability to raise
                money for war through their trade networks.
                Candidates may argue that the Decree furthered historical hostility
                against Jews in Spain. At the time of expulsion, the monarchy and
                other powerful families seized Jews’ valuable assets, including
                debts owed to them by aristocrats and even the monarchy itself.
                So, much of the wealth of the Jewish community remained in
                Spain.

9.   (a)   What, according to Source I, was the impact of the Japanese invasion of China
           in 1937?                                                                             [3]

           •   Schools and colleges were demolished.
           •   Everything of value was taken, including household items.
           •   The invasion deprived the survivors of their livelihoods.
           •   Chinese children were deported to other countries to be trained to hate
               everything Chinese.

     (b)   What does Source J suggest about Japan’s invasion of China between 1937
           and 1941?                                                                            [2]

           • Japan had initial successes.
           • By 1941, areas controlled by the Japanese were mainly in the north and east
             of China.
           • Vast areas in the south and west were still under Chinese Nationalist or
             Communist control.

10.   With reference to its origin, purpose and content, analyse the value and limitations of
      Source I for an historian studying the Sino-Japanese War (1937–1941).                       [4]

      Value:
      • As the wife of the Nationalist leader, Madame Chiang Kai-Shek will be well informed
        about the course of the Sino-Japanese War.
      • Its purpose is to record the impact of Japanese actions in China.
      • The objectives, actions and policies of the Japanese are described

      Limitations:
      • Being Chiang’s (Jiang’s) wife, her account may be highly subjective.
      • The language used in the book is very emotive and critical and could be seen as
        propaganda.
      • The source was written in 1940, when events were still unfolding.

      The focus of the question is on the value and limitations of the source. If only value or
      limitations are discussed, award a maximum of [2]. Origin, purpose and content should
      be used as supporting evidence to make relevant comments on the value and
      limitations. For [4] there must be at least one reference to each of them in either the
      value or the limitations.

      Comparison:
      • Both sources state that the Nationalist government moved into the interior.
      • Both sources suggest that the Japanese were unable to successfully control the
        areas they occupied.
      • Both sources state that the Chinese economy was affected by the Japanese
        invasion.
      • Both sources mention the resistance of the Nationalists and Communists to the
        Japanese invasion.

      Contrast:
      • While both sources discuss the effects of the invasion on the Chinese economy,
        Source K also highlights the negative effects it had on the Japanese economy.
      • Source L states that the Japanese were successful in containing Communist
        expansion, whereas Source K states that Communist forces returned after the
        Japanese departed.

      Indicative content

      Source I             Indicates that the Japanese initially met with success and were
                           able to take control over many aspects of Chinese society. The
                           Japanese destroyed schools and colleges as they were centres of
                           resistance.

      Source J             Despite initial early success in the north and east, vast areas of
                           China were still under Nationalist/Communist control by 1941.
                                       – 17 –               N22/3/HISTX/BP1/ENG/TZ0/XX/M


Source K        Identifies the areas of China that were successfully seized by the
                invading Japanese army in 1937. However, it also states that the
                Japanese were unable to hold the territory they had conquered.
                The damaging impact on both the Chinese and Japanese
                economies as a result of the invasion clearly shows a lack of
                success.

Source L        The Nationalists and Communists resisted Japanese attempts to
                gain territory by trading space for time so that the Japanese were
                only able to take the northern provinces. The Japanese were
                unable to force the Nationalists to surrender, negating the
                possibility of a quick Japanese success.

Own knowledge   Candidates may evaluate the role of the Second United Front as a
                contributory factor in preventing Japanese success. Despite early
                territorial gains in 1937, the attack on Shanghai in August 1937
                demonstrated that a rapid military victory was unlikely and
                complete success was uncertain.
                Candidates may refer to the fact that by the start of 1938 the
                Japanese government had effectively lost control of the military in
                China. The war became a stalemate following a series of
                Japanese defeats. After 1940, pro-Japanese puppet governments
                were established in China with limited success as the support of
                these leaders was inconsistent. Candidates may also evaluate the
                role of foreign support for China as a key factor in negating the
                possibility of a Japanese success. The oil embargo imposed by the
                US, Great Britain and the Netherlands in July 1941 was a decisive
                turning point in the war, making military success virtually
                impossible.

            • People’s patience with non-violent methods was not endless.
            • The MK had no choice but to fight to defend their people.
            • The peaceful nature of the African National Congress (ANC) was seen as a
              weakness.
            • The government had used armed force without any fear of reprisals.

14.   With reference to its origin, purpose and content, analyse the value and limitations of
      Source M for an historian studying the Sharpeville massacre (1960).                         [4]

      Value:
      • It is a contemporary report produced just three months after the events at
        Sharpeville.
      • As an official report into events, its purpose was to examine why the massacre
        happened.
      • The source provides reasons for the actions of the police.

      Limitations:
      • As the author was the commission appointed judge, his account may be favourable
        to the government and police.
      • The purpose of the source appears to be to absolve the police of wrongdoing and
        blame the protestors.
      • Not all police who fired were called as witnesses.

      Indicative content

      Source M             The report was a clear attempt to justify the actions of the police by
                           blaming the protestors for the attack. The protestors realised that
                           their voices were not being heard.

      Source N             Some protestors had been wounded or killed. The total lack of
                           concern by the police caused great anger and bitterness amongst
                           the protestors increasing support for the anti-apartheid movement.

    Source O        The extract from the manifesto condemns the government attacks,
                    such as Sharpeville. It suggests that peaceful methods have failed
                    and that it was time for a change in tactics from non-violence to
                    armed struggle.

    Source P        Peaceful methods were clearly not working and that the majority of
                    the white population had no appetite for change. Political change
                    after Sharpeville continued to be slow and anti-apartheid activists
                    went into exile.

    Own knowledge   Candidates may argue that the Sharpeville massacre led directly
                    to the African National Congress (ANC) and the Pan-African
                    Congress (PAC) abandoning non-violence, with the ANC setting
                    up Umkhonto we Sizwe and the PAC creating Poqo. Candidates
                    may also argue that the events at Sharpeville represented a
                    turning point as the UN called for sanctions against South Africa
                    and many investors took their money out of the country.
                    Candidates may also refer to the fact that many young South
                    Africans left the country to get military training in China, the USSR
                    and independent African countries. Alternatively, it could be
                    argued that the South African government became even more
                    resolute in upholding apartheid and that the authorities remained
                    firmly in control through the expansion of the security forces and
                    the Rivonia Trial. By 1964 South Africa appeared to be a police
                    state with resistance firmly beaten.

18.   With reference to its origin, purpose and content, analyse the value and limitations of
      Source R for an historian studying Belgian colonial rule in Rwanda.                         [4]

      Value:
      • It is contemporary to Belgian colonial rule, written by Hutu intellectuals.
      • It indicates how the Hutu elite wanted the international community to perceive the
        Rwandan social order under Belgian colonial rule.
      • It details Belgium’s support for the maintenance of a Tutsi monopoly and warns
        about its dangers.

      Limitations:
      • It only gives a Hutu perspective of the situation.
      • As a manifesto, it may be exaggerated to highlight the Hutu’s plight.
      • The source was written in 1957, when Belgian colonial rule was ongoing.

      The focus of the question is on the value and limitations of the source. If only value or
      limitations are discussed, award a maximum of [2]. Origin, purpose and content should
      be used as supporting evidence to make relevant comments on the value and
      limitations. For [4] there must be at least one reference to each of them in either the

      • Both sources suggest that as a result of identity cards, racial discrimination became
        a key issue for Hutus.

      Contrast:
      • While Source S states that classification was based on anatomical features, Source
        Q claims that ownership of cows was used as the key criterion.
      • Source S claims that Tutsi and Hutu did not see each as different races before the
        arrival of the Belgians, whereas Source Q indicates ethnic divisions existed in the
        pre-colonial period.

      Indicative content

      Source Q             Although Belgians cannot be blamed for having created ethnic
                           divisions in Rwanda, the introduction of identity cards made such
                           divisions more rigid and inflexible, contributing to the genocide in
                           1994.

      Source R             The indirect Belgian administration maintained the Tutsi monopoly
                           and favoured Tutsi culture. The Hutus warned the international
                           community about the dangers of continuing the Tutsi monopoly.
                                        – 27 –                N22/3/HISTX/BP1/ENG/TZ0/XX/M


Source S        Before the arrival of the Belgians, Tutsi and Hutu people did not
                see each other as different races, however, the Belgian
                introduction of identity cards promoted explicit racial discrimination.
                Identity cards were used to rapidly identify and kill Tutsis during
                the 1994 genocide.

Source T        Although there were differences between the Tutsi and other social
                groups during Belgian rule, relations appeared peaceful.

Own knowledge   Candidates may examine how Belgian colonial rule exacerbated
                ethnic tensions through segregation, which contributed to the
                genocide. For example, Belgian administrators replaced all Hutu
                chiefs and sub-chiefs with Tutsi. Tutsis were favoured in
                education, which increased divisions amongst different groups.
                Candidates may also argue that Belgian rule destroyed pre-
                colonial cooperation. For example, the Belgians used Hutus as
                forced labour for agricultural and infrastructural projects, and the
                Tutsi brutally enforced the system. Candidates may argue that
                before Belgian rule there was social mobility, Hutu and Twa could
                achieve the rank of Tutsi during the 19th century. Candidates may
                suggest that social division, economic stratification and racial
                classification promoted by Belgian colonial rule resulted in Hutu
                radicalization, as evidenced in the the creation of the Hutu power
                movement that gained control over government in the 1990s. The
                Hutu Ten Commandments may be cited as evidence of anti-Tutsi
                propaganda. Candidates may still consider other contributions to
                the genocide, including difficult economic conditions and the threat
                of the RPF, which led Habyarimana to fuel ethnic tensions.
