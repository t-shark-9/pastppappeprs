                                                   Section A

Answer one question from this section.

1.   Tipin (TI)

     Tipin (TI) manufactures shirts using a batch production method.

     Table 1 provides selected financial information for TI from:
     y its profit and loss account for the year ending 31 May 2022
     y its balance sheet at 31 December 2021.

                  Table 1: Selected financial information for TI (all figures in $000s)

                             Cash                                        14

                             Interest                                    22
                             Net profit after interest and tax           58
                             Net profit before interest and tax         100
                             Net profit before tax                       78
                             Retained profit                            225
                             Sales revenue                            1000
                             Stock                                       65

2.   Florian Stones (FS)

     Florian Stones (FS) sells handmade bracelets made from natural stones. FS enjoys strong
     brand awareness.

              Table 2: Forecasted figures for FS for the year ending 31 December 2022

                              Fixed costs                           $15 000

                              Variable costs per bracelet               $40

                              Price per bracelet                        $70

                              Number of bracelets produced              800

     (a)   Define the term brand awareness.[2]

     (b)   Using Table 2, draw a fully labelled break-even chart, to scale, for FS for 2022.            [4]

     (c)   Using Table 2, calculate:

           (i)    the profit or loss in 2022 for FS if production and sales increase to 1200 bracelets
                  (show all your working);[2]

           (ii)   the price FS would need to charge per bracelet if it sells 800 bracelets and wants
                  to make a profit of $10 000. Assume that the costs remain the same (show all
                  your working).[2]

                                              Section B

Answer one question from this section.

3.   Tijeras (TJ)

     Tijeras (TJ), a private limited company, manufactures surgical scissors. It has four
     shareholders and operates one factory in Peru. TJ sells in Central American and South
     American markets. Its sales have grown for the last 10 years, which has led to both
     economies of scale and diseconomies of scale.

     The chief operating officer (COO) analysed the situation. He discovered that:
     y current work areas are overcrowded
     y workers are specializing more than in previous years
     y maintenance costs are increasing
     y the firm now buys raw materials in bulk.

     The market for surgical equipment, including scissors, in the United States (US) is large and
     highly competitive. Recently, some hospitals in the US purchased TJ’s scissors.

                 Table 3: Selected financial information for TJ on 31 May 2021 and
                       2022 and for the years ending 31 May 2021 and 2022

                                      2021                2022            Industry average
             Current ratio                  1.4                1.2                   1.5
             Total cash              $400 000            $300 000          Not applicable
             Sales revenue         $7 500 000         $8 000 000           Not applicable
             Net profit margin           5.00 %            4.40 %                 6.00 %

     The COO determined that TJ needed more manufacturing capacity and put forward two options:
     y Option 1: Keep the current factory in Peru and build a second one in Mexico, closer to the
       North American market. TJ’s bank has agreed to provide a long-term loan to finance the new factory.
     y Option 2: Build a new factory that is large enough for all of TJ’s manufacturing-capacity
       needs and sell the old factory for $400 000. This new factory cannot be financed solely with
       external borrowing.

                          Table 4: Forecasted costs of Option 1 and Option 2

                                                               Option 1         Option 2
             Cost of land, construction, and equipment         $800 000        $2 200 000

     (a)   State two features of a private limited company.                                            [2]

     (b)   With reference to TJ, explain one economy of scale and one diseconomy of scale.             [4]

     (c)   With reference to TJ, explain the relationship between investment, profit and cash flow.    [4]

     (d)   Recommend whether TJ should choose Option 1 or Option 2.[10]

4.   Stuart Sporting Goods Ltd. (SSG)

     Stuart Sporting Goods Ltd. (SSG) is a private limited company in Uisge, Scotland. The
     Stuart family has owned the store since 1937. SSG sells sporting equipment and clothes. It
     has strong brand awareness and loyalty based on excellent customer service. In 2021, the
     company had GBP 2.5 million in assets and GBP 2.1 million in equity.

     Uisge is near Glasgow, Scotland’s largest city. Young families from Glasgow are moving
     to Uisge, where housing is cheaper and the pace of life is slower. These new residents’
     employers, usually in Glasgow, allow them to telework two days per week. Uisge’s population
     has grown only slightly, as these new residents are largely replacing an ageing population.

     Recently, MuraMerk (MM), a retailer, opened a superstore in Uisge, MM’s first in Scotland.
     This superstore sells groceries, clothing, hardware, electronics and sporting equipment.
     MM also sells online. Because of the economies of scale, MM offers lower prices and more
     choices than other businesses in Uisge, including SSG. For several years before MM’s
     arrival, SSG’s sales revenue did not grow and, after MM arrived, sales revenue started to decline.

     Aware of MM’s impact on small businesses in the United States (US), Douglas Stuart, who is
     59 years old and the Chief Executive Officer (CEO) of SSG, is considering two options:
     y Option 1: Lower prices, reduce employee levels, and cut costs in the hope that MM will be
        unsuccessful in Scotland (as it has been in several other countries).
     y Option 2: Accept a takeover offer of GBP 1.1 million from a large chain of sporting goods.

     (a)   Define the term equity.[2]

     (b)   With reference to the new residents of Uisge, explain one advantage for employees of
           teleworking.[2]

     (c)   Explain three possible reasons for the decline of sales at SSG.[6]

     (d)   Evaluate the two options that Douglas is considering (Option 1 and Option 2).[10]




                                                                                              Turn over
                                                  –6–                                          8822 – 5014


5.   Musical Musings (MM)

     Musical Musings (MM) manufactures musical keyboards,
     using batch production to produce a limited range.

     MM’s products are designed for use in schools and homes.
     MM sells directly to schools, and, for the home market, sells
     through shops specializing in technology. MM’s costs are
     kept low by:
     y limiting its product range
     y focusing on a small target market, which enables MM to limit the features on its keyboards and
        keep the appearance functional.

     MM provides free online “Teach yourself to play the keyboard” training courses for all customers.

     In 2021, MM employed an average of 50 people. During that year, however, 12 people left
     the company. Their reasons for leaving are shown in Table 5.

                    Table 5: Stated reasons for employees leaving MM in 2021

                        Stated reason              Number of employees leaving MM
                Retirement                                          1
                Offered a more interesting job                      5
                Higher pay at a competitor                          3
                Lack of promotion opportunities                     2
                Family reasons                                      1

     MM’s labour turnover rate for 2021 was 24 %. The manufacturing industry average was 15 %.

     In 2021, MM’s sales declined. MM is now considering targeting the niche market of
     professional musicians. MM would change its product design by adding a range of different
     sound features and improving the appearance of its keyboards. To achieve this change,
     MM would eventually stop supplying its existing market. Professional musicians would pay
     a higher negotiated price for improved keyboards made to their individual specifications.
     Changing its production process to job/customized production would be expensive for MM,
     however, and it would have to invest in a new marketing strategy.

     (a)   State two characteristics of a niche market.                                                 [2]

     (b)   Explain two methods that MM could use to reduce its labour turnover.                         [4]

     (c)   Explain two ways in which MM’s profits could be affected by changing from batch
           production to job/customized production.                                                     [4]

     (d)   Discuss the impact on MM’s marketing mix if MM changes its target market to
           professional musicians.                                                                  [10]
