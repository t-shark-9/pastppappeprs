Notes for examiners:

1. Whenever relevant, carry over marks must be awarded. If a candidate makes an error in
   calculation, but then uses the incorrect figure appropriately and accurately in later question
   parts, then the candidate may be fully rewarded. This is the “own-figure rule” and you should
   put OFR on the script where you are rewarding this.

2. Alternative approaches may be taken in responses to the [4] questions that use A02
   command terms. If this is the case and the alternative approaches are valid, then full credit
   should be given.

3. A candidate may be penalized for not rounding correctly, failing to give answers correct to 2
   dp or, in some cases, for not including the appropriate units. However, a candidate may only
   be penalized ONCE per script for each type of error.


1.   (a)   (i)    Determine the missing cost figures and insert your answers in Table 1.                  [2]

           Meals prepared per hour            Average cost        Total cost (US$)        Marginal cost
                                                 (US$)                                       (US$)

                  For 3 correct figures [1]
                  For 4 correct figures [2]

                  OFR applies (e.g. if TC(15) incorrect but AC(15) is then calculated via TC/Q. Also if
                  TC(16) is incorrect but MC(16) is calculated via TC(16) – TC(15).

           (ii)   Assuming that this catering market is in long run equilibrium, sketch a
                  diagram in which the profit-maximizing level of output for a firm in this
                  market is shown.                                                                        [2]

                  For a negatively sloped D (AR) tangential to AC [1]

                  For the point of tangency being vertically above the profit maximizing output
                  where MR and MC intersect [1]

                  A response with missing or incorrect labels or without MC intersecting
                  minimum AC may be awarded a maximum of [1]
                                           –4–             N22/3/ECONO/HP3/ENG/TZ0/XX/M




        The vertical axis may be labelled Cost (C), Price (P) or Revenue (R). The horizontal
        axis may be labelled Quantity (Q) or Output. AC may be labelled ATC. A title is not
        necessary.

(iii)   Using Figure 1, calculate the change in the consumer surplus resulting
        from this government intervention.                                                     [2]

        Initial CS = (4 – 2.4) x 16 x 0.5 = 12.8

        Final CS = (4 – 2.8) x 12 x 0.5 = 7.2

        Any valid working is sufficient for [1]

        Change in CS = 7.2 – 12.8 = – $5600 (or, a decrease) [1]

        An alternative approach with valid workings should be fully rewarded.
        eg Change in CS = 0.5 x 0.4 x (12 + 16) = $5 600 (decrease)

        For full marks to be awarded the response must provide valid working, specify the
        decrease and include correct units.

 (iv)   With reference to Figure 1, explain how the price floor will impact on
        allocative efficiency in the market for tomatoes.                                         [4]

Level                                                                                       Marks
0     The work does not meet a standard described by the descriptors below                  0
1     The written response is limited.                                                      1–2
      • The market equilibrium moves away from D = S (MB = MC)/ OR excess
         supply is created [1]
      • So allocative efficiency is no longer achieved because of overproduction
         (OR that social surplus is not maximized) [1]
2     The written response is accurate                                                      3–4
       For an explanation that allocative efficiency requires that (for the last unit
      produced) price is equal to marginal cost [1]
      which was the case when output was 16000 kilograms where P=MC= US$2.4
      (OR where MB = MC). [1]

        However, as a result of the price floor, 4000 kg (or, units) more are produced
        and for the last unit (20 000) price (US$2.80) is greater than MC (US$2.00).
        [1] and therefore allocative efficiency is no longer achieved [1]

        Candidates who do not make reference to the diagram may be
        awarded a maximum of [3].

        A valid alternative approach is to calculate the welfare loss resulting from the price floor

        Change in CS = – 5600
        Change in PS = 0.5 x 0.4 x (16 + 20) = 7200 [1]
        Change in G = 2.8 x 8 = – 22 400 [1]
        Net welfare loss = -5600 + 7200 – 22 400 = – $20 800 [1]

        Any valid working is sufficient for [1]

        OFR applies if the change in CS, PS or G is incorrect, but the calculation of net welfare
        loss is accurate.

        Therefore the market is not allocatively efficient [1]

 (v)    Calculate the indirect tax paid by airlines for the catering meals they bought
        in 2021 if the domestic indirect tax rate on food was 6.5% and their
        expenditure on meals was US$54 506.70.                                                    [2]
                                         54506.70
        Expenditures without the tax =              = 51180
                                           1.065

        Any valid working should be rewarded with [1].

        Sales tax paid = 54 506.70 – 5 1180 = $3326.70

        An answer of $3326.70 without working is sufficient for [1].

        Any valid alternative calculation should be rewarded.

        e.g. 54 506.7 x (0.065/1.065) = $3326.70

        For full marks to be awarded the response must provide valid working and include
        correct units.

    (vi)   The impact of a 4.5% rise in the price of airline tickets on the quantity of
           leisure travel demanded has been calculated to be –10.26%. Using the
           figures in Table 3, calculate the impact of the same 4.5% rise in the price of
           airline tickets on the quantity of business travel demanded.                            [2]

                                                      +4.5

           Any valid working is sufficient for [1].

           −0.34 × 4.5 = −1.53%

           An answer of –1.53%, –1.53 or 1.53 without any valid working is sufficient for [1].

           For full marks to be awarded the response must provide valid working, specify the
           decrease and include correct units.

    (vii) Using relevant information from Table 3, describe the expected impact this
          rise in global incomes will have on the demand for domestic routes in
          relation to the demand for international routes.                                         [2]

           YED is lower for domestic routes than for international routes
           OR an appropriate calculation is used. [1]

           Therefore demand for domestic routes will increase by a smaller percentage. [1]

           NB Calculations of demand based on the figures without a description of
           the impact may receive [1].

    (viii) The information on page 6 strongly suggests that the aviation industry is
           responsible for a significant market failure. Using this information and an
           appropriate diagram, explain the market failure the aviation industry
           creates.                                                                                [4]

           For a negative production externalities diagram in which the MSC curve lies
           above the S, MPC curve and shows that the market output is greater than the
           socially optimum level of output OR that explains that the aviation industry is
           responsible for negative externalities leading to overproduction (free market
           equilibrium is greater than the socially optimum level of output).
2          The written response is accurate                                                  3–4
           For a negative production externalities diagram in which the MSC curve lies
           above the S (MPC) curve and shows that the market output is greater than
           the socially optimum level of output AND that explains that the aviation
           industry is responsible for negative externalities leading to overproduction
           (free market equilibrium is greater than the socially optimum level of output).

           An alternative approach, which should be accepted, is that MSB is below the demand
           curve and the market failure is caused by a consumption externality.

           The y axis may be labelled price but could be costs or benefits and the x axis is
           labelled quantity.

(b)   Using the text/data provided and your knowledge of economics, recommend a
      policy that may be implemented to reduce the contribution of emissions the
      aviation industry makes to global warming.                                               [10]

      Possible policies may include (but are not restricted to):
      • Introduce carbon taxes in the aviation industry
      • Cap & trade schemes on a wider (global) basis
      • Impose indirect (sales) tax on air ticket purchases
      • Eliminate fuel and other subsidies paid to airlines
      • Subsidize rail and other greener forms of transport
      • Enter into international agreements to reduce emissions from the aviation industry
      • Ban short-haul flights
      • Any other valid policy.

                      Wheat prices have been rising (from August 2020 to February 2021) [1]

                      And one of the following: [1]
                      • Wheat prices are volatile
                      • Wheat prices increased from around US$4.90 in August 20 to around
                        US$6.60 in February 21
                      • The period saw two peaks (in Oct 20 and Jan 21)
                      • Wheat prices levelled off after (Nov 20 or Jan 21)
                      • Any other valid piece of information shown should be awarded.

                      A response which merely details the data may be awarded [1].

           (ii)       Using Figure 2 and the information above, explain two reasons that may
                      account for Turkey’s decision to eliminate the 20 % tariff on wheat imports
                      from Russia.                                                                        [4]

                      Reasons may include:
                      • The price of wheat has been rising; it had increased by 35% in 6
                        months. Elimination of the tariff would keep wheat prices low and help to
                        maintain the competitiveness of Turkish flour (in its export markets).
                      • Russia had recently decided to introduce a tax on its wheat exports. Elimination of
                        the tariff would keep wheat prices low and help to maintain the competitiveness of
                        Turkish flour (in its export markets).
                      • Elimination of the tariff would decrease the costs of producing wheat and thus the
                        price of flour in Turkey, reducing inflationary pressure.
                      • By eliminating the tariff on wheat imports, Turkey may hope that Russia will
                        reciprocate and eliminate the tax on wheat exports.
                      • The Turkish government supports trade liberalization as a policy for efficiency /
                        growth / development / diplomacy
                      • There may have been a poor harvest in Turkey and thus the policy would help to
                        prevent the domestic wheat price from increasing / ensure food security
                      • Any other valid reason.

(iii)   Using Figure 3, calculate the change in social/community surplus that
        resulted from the elimination of the 20% tariff.                                   [2]

        6 x 1.2 x 0.5 = 3.6

        6 x 1.2 x 0.5 = 3.6

        Any valid working is sufficient for [1].

        3.6 + 3.6 = $7.2 million

        An answer of 7.2 without workings is sufficient for [1]. For full marks to be
        awarded, the response must provide valid working and include correct
        units.

        An alternative approach which may be rewarded is to calculate the net change in CS +
        PS only

        Change in CS = 0.5 x 1.2 x (64 + 70) = 80.4
        Change in PS = 0.5 x 1.2 x (30 + 36) = 39.6 (decrease)

        Any valid working is sufficient for [1].

        Change in social surplus = 80.4 – 39.6 = $40.8 million

        For full marks to be awarded the response must provide valid working and include
        correct units.

(iv)    The currency of Turkey is the Turkish lira (TL). If TL1.00 = US$0.134, using
        Figure 3, calculate in TL, the change in the monthly total revenues of
        Turkish wheat producers as a result of the elimination of the 20 % tariff.         [3]

        TR1 = 7.20 x 36 = $259.20

        TR2 = 6 x 30 = $180 [1]

        Change = 180 – 259.20 = – 79.20 [1]

        Any valid working is sufficient for [1].

        OFR may be applied if either the initial or the final revenues collected is
        correct and the subtraction is performed correctly.

        – 79.2 * 1/0.134

        – 591 044 776 OR – 591.04 million [1]

        Rounding to two decimal places is not required for the first option above
        i.e, – 591 044 776 is sufficient and 591 044 776.12 is not required.

        OFR applies if an incorrect US$ figure is converted correctly into TL, and
        [1] may be awarded; the mark is awarded for accurately converting a US$
        figure to a TL figure.

        A candidate may be awarded [1] for converting accurately before applying to (an
        incorrect) figure for revenue (i.e. 1/0.134 = 7.46)

      A valid alternative approach is
      TR1 = 7.20 x 36 = $259.20
      TR2 = 6 x 30 = $180 [1]
      Change = 180 – 259.20 = –79.20 [1]

      Any valid working is sufficient for [1].

      1/0.134 = 7.46
      –79.2 * 7.46
      = – 590 832 000 OR – 590.83 million [1]

      OFR may be applied if either the initial or the final revenues collected is
      correct and the subtraction is performed correctly.

      For full marks to be awarded the response must provide valid working and
      specify the decrease.

      NB TL units are not required, since “in TL” is referred to in the question.

(v)   Using information from Table 4, calculate the additional income tax Beycan
      would pay if the Turkish government decided to increase the marginal tax
      rate for incomes over TL600 001 to 55%, as it has been in Austria since
      2016.                                                                                    [2]

      355 000 x 0.55 – 355 000 x 0.40 [or, 355 000 x 0.15) [1]

      Any valid working is sufficient for [1].

      TL 53 250 [1]

      OR

      354 999 x 0.55 – 354 999 x 0.4 = 195 249.45 – 141 999.60 = 53 249.65

      OR

      354 999 x 0.15 = 53 249.85

      Responses may also take the approach of calculating the initial and the final tax paid

      Initial tax paid = 22*0.15 + 27*0.2 + 131*0.27 + 420*0.35 +355*0.4 = 333.07

      Final tax paid = 22*0.15 + 27*0.2 + 131*0.27 + 420*0.35 +355*0.55 = 386.32 [1]

      Any valid working is sufficient for [1].

      Change = 386.32 - 333.07 = TL53 250 [1]

      For full marks to be awarded the response must provide valid working and include
      correct units.

(vi)   Using the income distribution information in Table 5, construct a fully
       labelled Lorenz curve diagram for Turkey in 2017.                                         [2]




       For constructing a Lorenz curve below the diagonal (which need not be
       drawn) with correct labels on the axes [1]

       For an accurately constructed Lorenz curve [1]

       The vertical axis should be labelled cumulative % of income, or % of income and the
       horizontal axis should be cumulative % of population or % of population. A title is not
       necessary.

      (vii) Using the data in Table 6, explain why a greater reliance on indirect taxes
            compared to income taxes for revenue collection is often associated with a
            higher Gini coefficient value.                                                      [4]

       Level                                                                               Marks

                 below
         1       The written response is limited                                            1-2
                 Indirect taxes are regressive / income taxes are progressive. Turkey
                 relies much more on indirect taxes and less on income taxes and has a
                 higher Gini coefficient.
         2       The written response is accurate                                           3-4
                 • Indirect taxes are regressive with respect to income and thus burden
                    the poor proportionately more [1]
                 • personal income taxes are progressive, so it is higher income earners
                    that pay proportionately more [1]
                 • Turkey relies much more on indirect taxes (40.5% cf 32.1%)/ less on
                    income taxes (15.4% cf 23.9%) (than the other countries / OECD) [1]
                 • Turkey therefore has greater income inequality and thus a higher Gini
                    coefficient [1].

      (viii) Identify one reason for the difference between Turkey’s GNI per capita
             ranking and its HDI ranking.                                                       [1]

             For identifying that Turkey’s spending on education is low compared with
             other countries.

             NB The response must refer to education.

(b)   Using the text/data provided and your knowledge of economics, recommend a
      policy that the government of Turkey could introduce to reduce income inequality.      [10]

      Possible policies may include (but are not restricted to):
      • Increasing the progressivity of direct taxes
      • Reducing reliance on indirect taxes
      • Implementing or increasing a wealth tax
      • Investing more in education
      • Investing more in health care
      • Investing more in human capital
      • Increasing transfer payments (or, conditional cash transfers)
      • Provide universal basic income
      • Improving access to labour markets
      • Measure(s) to improve equality of opportunity
      • Policies to reduce discrimination
      • Increase the minimum wage
      • Any other valid policy.
