                                                Section A
1.   (a)   State two features of a private limited company.                                              [2]

           Private limited company: is a limited company whose share cannot be sold to the general
           public.

           Features of a private limited company include:
           • the owners have limited liability;
           • shares can only be sold to friends and family and not on the stock exchange. Shares
             cannot be offered for sale to the general public or transferred without agreement of all
             shareholders.
           • better access to finance than, for example, sole trader or partnership;
           • legal continuity;
           • often a small to medium sized family business;
           • not obliged to share financial information with public hence more privacy than public
             limited company (PLC) (do not accept “no need to publish financial accounts” as all
             incorporated firms must do this) separate legal identity – same as “incorporation”.

           Accept any other relevant feature.

           Award [1] for each appropriate feature of a private limited company stated (application not
           required), up to a maximum of [2].

     (b)   Using Table 1 and other information provided, calculate for SSA’s second academy:

           (i)   the payback period (show all your working);                                    [2]

                  Year     Cash inflow   Cash outflow    Net cash flow       Cumulative
                              ($)            ($)              ($)           cash flow ($)

                    0                      (500 000)          (500 000)       (500 000)

                    1       160 000         40 000            120 000         (380 000)

                    2       200 000         50 000            150 000         (230 000)

                    3       240 000         60 000            180 000         (50 000)

                    4       375 000         75 000            300 000         250 000

                    5       700 000         140 000           560 000         810 000

                 Payback between years 3 and 4.
                 $300 000/12 = $25 000/month
                 $50 000/$25 000 = 2

                 Payback is 3 years 2 months.
                 (or 2 years 7 months, 2.58333 or 2.58 years or 31 months if only cash inflows used)

                 Alternative working: $120 000 + $150 000 + $180 000 + ($50 000/$300 000) x 12
                 = 3 years 2 months
                                         –5–                 N22/3/BUSMT/HP2/ENG/TZ0/XX/M


       Alternative working: = $120 000 + $150 000 + $180 000 + ($50 000/$300 000) =3.1666
       or 3.17 years (allow rounding) or 38 months

       Award marks as follows:

       [1] If a candidate who has shown working provides a correct procedure (thus,
       demonstrates an understanding of the underlying concepts) but has made an error in
       calculation or the answer does not include years/months.

       [1] If a candidate does not show any working and simply writes the answer.

       [2] if a candidate provides the correct answer with working. A correct answer must
       include years/months.

       N.B. award a maximum of [1] if net cash inflows used.

(ii)   the average rate of return (ARR) for the first five years of operation (show all your
       working);                                                                         [2]

       Total returns = $120 000 + $150 000 + $180 000 + $300 000 + $560 000 = $1 310 000
       Capital Cost = $500 000
       Years of use = 5

       ARR = (total returns - capital cost) / years of use   x100
                  capital cost

       Total return over 5 years = $1 310 000 - capital cost = $810 000

       Average annual profit = $810 000 / 5 = $162 000

       ARR = ($162 000 / $500 000) x100% = 32.4%
       (Accept 47% if only cash inflows used)

       Award marks as follows:

       [1] if a candidate who has shown working provides a correct procedure (thus,
       demonstrates an understanding of the underlying concepts) but has made an error in
       calculation or the answer does not include the percentage sign (%).

       [1] if a candidate does not show any working and simply writes the answer.

       [2] if a candidate provides the correct answer with working. A correct answer must
       include the percentage sign (%).

       Award no marks [0] merely for writing the formula.

       Apply candidate own figure rule (OFR) if candidate uses an incorrect net cash flow
       figure from (b)(i).
                                         –6–                 N22/3/BUSMT/HP2/ENG/TZ0/XX/M


(iii)   the net present value (NPV) at a discount rate of 4% (see Table 2) (show all your
        working).                                                                     [2]

        Using discount tables:

        Year 1     $120 000 x 0.9615 = $115 380
        Year 2     $150 000 x 0.9246 = $138 690
        Year 3     $180 000 x 0.8890 = $160 020
        Year 4     $300 000 x 0.8548 = $256 440
        Year 5     $560 000 x 0.8219 = $460 264

        Total present value = $1 130 794

        Net present value (NPV) = TPV - capital cost

        NPV = $1 130 794 - $500 000 = $630 794
        (accept $948 000 if only cash inflows used)

        Some candidates may add the $500 000 as Year 0 and calculate it this way. Please
        award full marks if the correct answer is arrived at.

        Full headings and full calculations are not expected for each year.

        Full marks can be awarded if there is some evidence of calculation especially the
        movement from the total DCF to NPV, if the DCF for each year is not shown but it is clear
        the candidate understands the method.

        N.B. allow the candidate own figure rule (OFR) if using incorrect net cashflow from (b)(i).

        Award [2] if a candidate provides the correct answer with working. A correct answer
        must include $ sign. Award [1] for working and [1] for the correct answer.

        Award [1] If a candidate who has shown working provides a correct procedure (thus,
        demonstrates an understanding of the underlying concepts) but has made an error in
        calculation or the answer does not include $ sign.

        Award [1] If a candidate does not show any working and simply writes the answer.

        Award no marks [0] for writing the formula.

(c)   Explain one disadvantage for SSA of only using the payback period method in
      making its decision to open a second academy.                             [2]

      ● only focuses on how fast it will payback rather than overall profit as the most important
        factor. Overall ARR is 32.4%, a very high return;
      ● using the payback method can encourage short-termism as it does not look at the net
        cash flow made after it has paid back. Student numbers significantly increase after the
        payback period but this is not accounted for;
      ● this new soccer academy seems like a long-term investment, is payback suitable?
      ● fails to consider the time value of money especially if interest rates change over the 5
        years of cash flows being considered.

      Accept any other relevant disadvantage and explanation.

      This question is about a limitation of the payback method so do not credit either all the
      figures are forecasted, or this method does not take non-financial factors into account. This is
      true of all investment appraisal methods.

      Award [1] for a relevant and correct disadvantage identified.

      Award [1] for a relevant and correct explanation with application to SSA, up to a maximum of
      [2].
                                                 –8–                 N22/3/BUSMT/HP2/ENG/TZ0/XX/M


2.   (a)   Define the term brand awareness.                                                       [2]

           Brand awareness is a marketing term that describes the degree of consumer recognition
           of a product or service by its name, logo or sound.

           N.B. no application required. Do not credit examples.
           Candidates are not expected to word their definition exactly as above.

           Award [0] marks if the candidate writes a response along the lines of repeating the stimulus
           such as “customers are aware of the brand.”

           Award [1] for a basic definition that conveys partial knowledge and understanding of
           consumer recognition of the product of service.

           Award [2] for a full definition that conveys knowledge and understanding similar to the
           answer above and indicates that the consumer recognizes the brand be at least one of the
           following: name, logo, or sound.


     (b)   Using Table 3, draw a fully labelled break-even chart, to scale, for FS for 2022.            [4]

            800               15000        32000         47000        56000         9000

           Candidates do not need to create the table above – these are the figures for the break-even
           chart.
                                       –9–                  N22/3/BUSMT/HP2/ENG/TZ0/XX/M



Candidates could also calculate the break-even point using this alternative method:

Break-even point (units) = Fixed costs / (Price per bracelet – Variable cost per bracelet)
Break-even point (units) = $15000 / ($70 - $40) = $15000 / $30 = 500 bracelets
Break-even point ($) = Price per unit x units = $70 x 500 = $35 000; or
Break-even point ($) = Fixed costs + (Variable cost x units) = $15000 + ($40 x 500) = $35000
Break-even point = 500 bracelets (x-axis) and $35000 (costs/revenues; y-axis)

Award marks as follows:

[1] for a correctly labelled and accurately drawn total revenue (TR) line – can be TR or revenue
(but not “sales” on its own).

[1] for a correctly labelled and accurately drawn total cost (TC) line.

[1] for identifying the break-even point. Ideally, the candidate will draw an arrow pointing to the
break-even point and label the arrow. However, accept as an accurately labelled break-even
point a vertical line from the x-axis to the break-even point, provided that the line is labelled
“break-even point”.

[1] for correctly labelling BOTH axes – y-axis must have both costs and revenue; x-axis must
have some indication of quantity, e.g. units/quantity/items/bracelets.

A break-even chart that is not neat, not drawn with a straight edge, or is not drawn to scale
can be awarded a maximum of [2] if the total revenue and total cost lines and axes are all
correctly labelled.

If a candidate produces a table rather than a chart, award [0].

N.B. do not penalize if graph paper is not used. However, drawn diagrams must have a
consistent verifiable scale, otherwise it cannot be determined if TR and TC are accurate, even
if correctly labelled.

(c)   Using Table 3, calculate:

      (i)    the profit or loss in 2022 for FS if production and sales increase to 1200 bracelets (show
             all your working);
                                                                                       [2]
             Profit = Total revenue – total costs
             Profit = 1200 bracelets x ($70) – [$ 15 000 + (1200) x ($40)]
             Profit = $ 84 000 – [$ 15 000 + $ 48 000]
             Profit = $ 84 000 - $ 63 000
             Profit = $ 21 000
             Alternative method:
             Profit = [(Price per bracelet -Variable costs per bracelet) x 1200] - total costs
             Profit = [($70 – $40) x 1200] - $ 15 000
             Profit = [$30 x 1200] - $ 15 000
             Profit = $36 000 - $ 15 000
             Profit = $ 21 000
             Or

             Break-even quantity = 500
             Output beyond break even is 1200 - 500 = 700
             Unit contribution = 70 - 40 = 30
             Profit = 700 x 30 = $21 000

             demonstrates an understanding of the underlying concepts) but has made an error in
             calculation or the answer does not include $.

             [1] If a candidate does not show any working and simply writes $21 000.

             [2] if a candidate provides the correct answer with working. A correct answer must
             include $.

      (ii)   the price FS would need to charge per bracelet if it sells 800 bracelets and wants to make
             a profit of $10 000. Assume that the costs remain the same (show all your working). [2]

             Target profit = total revenue – total costs
             $ 10 000 = $ 800X – [ $ 15 000 + (800 x 40)]
             $ 10 000 = $ 800X – [$ 47 000]
             $ 10 000 + $ 47 000 = 800X
             $ 57 000 = 800X
             X = $ 71.25
             Price per bracelet = $ 71.25
             N.B. accept alternative working.

3.   (a)   Define the term organizational culture.                                                     [2]

           Organizational culture is based on the beliefs, values and attitudes of the leadership
           and employees in a business. It can be classed as “the way we do things around here”.
           N.B. no application required. Do not credit examples.

           Candidates are not expected to word their definition exactly as above.

           Award [1] for a basic definition that conveys partial knowledge and understanding.

           Award [2] for a full, clear definition that conveys understanding similar to the answer above
           that shows understanding that culture is driven by the leadership.

     (b)   Using Herzberg’s motivation theory, explain two reasons for DS’s high employee morale. [4]

           Herzberg’s theory believes that motivators are the factors which make employees happy
           in their job. The main motivators detailed are:
           ● Job enlargement - giving employees more variety in their work, this will then make work
               more interesting. In DS, employees were able to take advantage of job rotation;
           ● Job empowerment - there is a democratic leadership style which means employees take
               part in decision making. Quality circles mean employees can work together to try to solve
               problems within the business;
           ● Job enrichment - This refers to employees being given more challenging tasks to allow
               them to improve their skills. In DS, employees are given the opportunity to manage tasks
               – a vertical expansion.

           Accept any other relevant reason.

           N.B. Do not credit any reference to hygiene factors such as office space, generous breaks or
           competitive salaries as motivators.

           N.B. It is not mandatory for candidates to specifically mention “democratic style” since it is not
           explicit in the stimulus.

(c)   Explain two reasons for the working capital problems at DS.                                      [4]

      Working capital is the capital of a business which is used in the day-to-day running of the
      business. It is calculated as the current assets minus current liabilities.

      Reasons for working capital problems:
      ● DS’s debtor days ratio is remarkably high, especially when compared to creditor days.
        In 2021, it was taking almost six months to receive payment for orders of board games;
      ● the difference between debtor and creditor days ratio means DS are paying their invoices
        much quicker than they are receiving payment from the retailers. This will cause
        working capital issues;
      ● the acid-test ratio is worsening. By 2021, it is 0.61 - this could mean DS is holding too
        much stock, the least liquid of current assets. They don’t have enough liquid assets to
        cover current liabilities. Note: it is difficult to be specific about the effects of low acid test
        as this we do not know what is normal for this industry;
      ● DS are operating on a long working capital cycle with new games taking up to 12 months
        to develop;
      ● acid test ratio in 2019 (i.e. 1.32) was in the acceptable range between 1:1 to 1.5:1. It
        deteriorated in 2020 and 2021, which were much below the acceptable range;
      ● DS has more employees to pay but without the requisite increase in cash received.

      Accept any other relevant reason.

(d)   Discuss whether DS should choose Option 1 or Option 2.                                       [10]

      The candidate is expected to analyse both options in a balanced manner and make
      reasoned judgments as to what option is most favourable for DS.

      Option 1: Accept the takeover request from BGI.
      If Emma and Laura accept the takeover from BGI they will receive a significant sum for
      their share capital. They are relatively new to business, being recent university graduates,
      and they might feel they can now look at starting another business.

      This offer will offer security to DS to continue in business. BGI is a market leader and will
      have the funds needed to fix the working capital problems and enable DS to continue to
      grow. The DS brand will continue and the original owners will still hold a substantial
      percentage of the share capital. BGI also has experience in this industry and the new Chief
      Executive will be able to take DS forward.

      On the other hand, DS would no longer belong to Emma and Laura. They would have
      no input to any strategic decisions and would effectively be side-lined by BGI.

      Might BGI want to take DS in a different strategic direction? Currently, DS employees are
      very happy in their work but there could be redundancies or a change in working
      practices. BGI will install their own CEO, they may want to put their own designers,
      marketing employees into DS. This could negatively the morale at DS.

      Option 2: Venture capitalist
      Selling 35% of their shares to a venture capitalist will give DS capital to both remedy the
      liquidity issues and continue their rapid expansion. This would mean risks would be
      spread and would not all be Emma and Laura’s. Emma and Laura will still have a
      controlling share in the business and will have the deciding vote in any strategic
      decisions.
      While it is not detailed in the stimulus, it could be assumed there is the possibility of synergy
      with the venture capitalist. DS could benefit from skills, experience and resources which the
      new investor will bring. They could have experience in the board game market or dealing
      with working capital problems.

      On the other hand, is this going to be a significant enough investment for DS? The stimulus
      says it will be sufficient for one year but this doesn’t seem enough to pursue rapid expansion.
      As games can take one year from design to retail there is a danger DS will find themselves
      with the same problems in a year (and with 35% less ownership).

      There is the possibility that instead of synergy there is a degree of conflict with how the
      venture capitalist wants to run DS. We are given no indication of the background or skills of
      the investor and DS will be expected to undertake due diligence before accepting the offer.
      Overall, the takeover will provide DS with significant finance but it would mean a major
      upheaval for the company, including Emma and Laura having no further say in strategic
      decisions. While the VC offer provides less capital, it means the current leadership team
      stays in place to provide continuity.

      It is expected that candidates provide a conclusion with substantiated judgment.

      Accept any substantiated judgment.

4.   (a)   State two characteristics of flow production.                                        [2]

           Two characteristics include:
           • continuous process of manufacturing products often using assembly lines
           • standardized large quantity products are being produced
           • often very capital intensive with investment in machinery
           • often able to utilize relatively low skilled labour.

           Accept any other relevant characteristic.

           N.B. do not credit advantages.

           Award [1] for each characteristic identified (application not required).

     (b)   Explain one advantage and one disadvantage for ER of commissioning market
           research using focus groups.                                                               [4]

           The possible advantages for ER of commissioning market research based on focus groups
           are:
           • a deep and meaningful discussion can be carried out by a professional researcher with
              the participants being asked detailed questions about their options/ideas. In this case, the
              discussion revealed participants’ perception towards competitors’ pricing (medium) and
              suppliers’ quality (also medium)
           • reactions of the participant to each of the options can also be observed by the qualified
              researcher (application to the stimulus would be similar to the one above);
           • ER was given insightful information about consumers’ opinion, preferences,
              expectations and the most important issue, customers prioritise innovative products more
              than ER being an environmentally friendly business.

           The possible disadvantages for ER of commissioning market research based on focus
           groups are:
           • ER sells to customers worldwide, while the focus group members were chosen only
              from the Middle East;
           • the sample is likely to be unrepresentative because the location where the focus group
              took place was limited to the Middle East. The answers might reflect the opinion of
              particular segments of the population - income, lifestyle, and perceptions of the
              importance of being environmentally friendly in a biased way.

           Market research was undertaken by a professional market research company, however there
           might still be bias as perhaps the more talkative, environmentally concerned, more self-
           assured, extroverted people joined the group and or expressed their opinion more than other
           participants. The information upon which ER is going to change its strategic focus may be
           inaccurate, incomplete and costly.

           Accept any other relevant advantage/disadvantage.

           N.B. do not credit advantages/disadvantages that are common to ANY primary research.

      and / or application.

      For example:
      For an identification or a description of an advantage/disadvantage with or without
      application [1].
      For explanation of an advantage/disadvantage with no application [1].
      For explanation of an advantage/disadvantage and application [2].

      Maximum award overall: [4].

(c)   Explain one advantage and one disadvantage for ER of raising finance through loan capital
      from a bank.                                                                     [4]

      The advantages for ER of taking loan capital from a bank are:
      • it is likely that because profit has not been made recently, ER is likely to have experienced
        a fall in retained profit;
      • a loan might be a good option and there is a possibility that being an LTD, ER can
        potentially raise the large amount of the finance needed in the form of a bank loan.
        Collateral is likely to be available in the form of real estate/ factories;
      • if the bank agrees, the process can be quick and it fits well with ER’s desire for a quick
        response;
      • if a bank specializing in SMEs can be found to offer loans at low interest rates this may be
        beneficial compared to regular banks.

      The disadvantages for ER of taking loan capital from a bank are:
      • ER is highly geared; therefore, the likelihood is that the bank will refuse the loan as ER
        can be perceived as a risky venture for the bank;
      • even if the bank approves the bank loan, the likelihood is that the bank will offer the loan
        with a relatively high interest rate which ER will have to pay regardless of their financial
        position;
      • ER is not profitable and the accumulated interest rate burden can increase the
        financial problem/ collapse etc.

(d)   Recommend whether ER should implement Option 1 or Option 2 as a research and
      development strategy, given the pace of change in the scooter industry.                    [10]

      It is expected that firstly, candidates know how numerous factors such as organizational
      culture, change of pace, technology, etc., may affect the ability of an individual, a team or a
      business to innovate successfully – and may influence the R&D practices and strategies of
      an organization, and secondly, will show a clear understanding of the difference between the
      two types of innovation.
      Option 1-
      Adaptive creativity is unlikely to create a new USP given the increase in global
      competition. It appears that customers prefer Innovative creativity /cutting-edge products,
      adapting the scooters. E-scooters using the same positioning, cannot be judged as
      an example of such cutting-edge innovation as E-scooters are globally available. One may
      judge this argument against the option as highly significant.
      Based on the market research results, demand is likely to increase due to the
      scooters being electric and therefore environmentally friendly and produced by an
      environmentally friendly organisation. However, customers did not rate this issue as the
      most important. Given the customers identical perceptions of all the scooter manufacturers,
      this part of the strategy might not be successful and therefore the strategy is likely to make a
      limited impact on ER’s market share/ finance.
      ER is going to subcontract the production of the batteries; therefore, ER will be
      dependent on a designer and manufacturer of electric batteries in terms of quality, price,
      and delivery. Perhaps this is too much of a risk.
      One may also argue that some part of the overall production will be more ecologically
      friendly. However, the cell production method is not as environmentally friendly as flow
      production could be due to the duplication of resources.
      Employees’ motivation may increase significantly as cellular manufacturing will reduce
      boredom as employees carry out more tasks, rotate tasks as well as seeing the completion
      of a particular task/creation of a model. Training will also boost the confidence/ morale of
      the employees. Employees’ motivation can be judged as an important factor to consider.
      This option will be quicker to implement and this is what the management would like to do.
      Still, one may judge this issue as ER having a short- term focus.
      Option 2-
      The merits of innovative creativity are many and are highly significant. This innovative
      creativity will satisfy the top priority of the customers and creates a new competitive
      advantage. More innovative and technologically advanced scooters will be produced- the
      new products and the new positioning away from the competitors will create a new USP/
      competitive advantage/clear differentiation.
      ER will address/ satisfy the main priority of their customers. The demand for their scooters
      is likely to increase.
      High prices can be charged that will eventually cover the high costs and enable ER to
      start making a profit again. In-house quality control will improve.

      However, the lengths and the costs of the implementation could be regarded as a critical
      issue to consider. The length of time to create and implement the innovative creativity
      could harm ER financially in the short term. Despite the fact that some diverse sources of
      finance are available, ER has liquidity problems and might not be able to survive. Still,
      given some availability of finance, one may judge this issue of less significance.
      Maintaining flow production will not solve employees' complaints. The new competitive
      advantage will be due to the new and skilled employees in the R&D department hence, some
      evidence of demotivation is unlikely to strongly impact on ER.
      Overall, it looks as if the arguments for option 2 outweigh the arguments for option 1
      especially in the long term.

5.   (a)   State two characteristics of a niche market.                                                  [2]

           Niche market is a well-defined segment of a market with consumers in that market having
           specific characteristics.
           Characteristics include:
           • is made up of that segment of consumers within the larger market place, who possess a
              common demographic, purchasing behaviour and lifestyle.
           • segment likely to be very small compared the market as a whole.
           • it has its own distinctive set of needs, preferences, or identity, making it unrelated from the
              traditional market.
           • it often gives firms the opportunity to deliver goods and/or services that target the
              audience, and to build a competitive position in the market to defend against new
              entrants.
           • products or services are often tailormade hence able to charge higher prices.
           • products are generally more expensive than products for a mass market.
           • customer loyalty tends to be higher than in a mass or large market.

           N.B. No application required. Do not credit examples.

           Accept any other relevant characteristic.

           Award [1] for each relevant characteristic stated up to a maximum of [2]. An example is not
           necessary but may help to clarify a definition.

     (b)   Explain two methods that MM could use to reduce its labour turnover.                    [4]

           Methods include:
           • MM could change the pay structure, allowing for increases in pay, providing opportunities
             for bonuses, or offering fringe benefits (perks) to prevent employees from going to
             competitors who offer better salaries. In 2021, 3 people gave pay as reason for leaving.
           • MM could be creative with low-cost rewards, such as flexible work hours, employee
             discounts, etc.
           • MM could create new posts with promotion in mind, that way employees become aware
             of career progress opportunities. In 2021, 2 people gave lack of promotion as a reason for
             leaving.
           • MM could recruit internally for vacant senior posts, that way employees know that they
             have a chance of promotion provided they meet qualifications. Application similar to
             above.
           • MM could invest in training, which subsequently could help promote career opportunities
             and professional advancement (as stated above), given that according to the table
             employees left for a more interesting job. This likely to be needed if MM transitions to
             more complex keyboards with additional features.
           • MM could make job more interesting by proceeding with the change marketing strategy
             which would involve moving from batch to job production methods. In 2021 5 people gave
             being offered a more interesting job as a reason for leaving.
           • MM could provide meaningful feedback in appraisals of employees so that they feel
             respected and seen (no opportunity for an application mark if a candidate expresses this
             idea.

           N.B. regarding application, candidates must use wording from the stimulus or directly
           and explicitly link the response to the stimulus. For example, if a candidate says “offer
           better pay” they have not applied that response to the stimulus. Thus, they receive [1]. If the
           candidate says “MM could offer better pay, as 3 employees left last year because of higher
           pay offered by a competitor,” they have linked the response to the stimulus.

Further, if a candidate writes that “MM should motivate its employees” or “improve
motivation,” even if they name a theorist, this response is not enough. They must correctly
specify a method to reduce labour turnover.

Finally, if a candidate cites from the table in the stimulus with no precise and appropriate
method, award [0].

Accept any other relevant method.

Mark as 2 + 2

For [2], candidates must identify a method, explain it, and apply it to the stimulus up to a
maximum of [4].

(c)   Explain two ways in which MM’s profits could be affected by changing from batch
      production to job/customized production.                                   [4]

      Answers should reflect the idea that profits are determined by (revenues – costs) and
      that either element could be affected.
      Ways include:
      • smaller volumes are likely to be produced. This could lead to lower incomes, and
         possibly lower profits but that depends on the price relative to home/school sales. It
         states that these individually produced items could be sold at a much higher price. The
         profits also depend on what happens to costs;
      • The per unit cost is likely to increase because (1) in general it is cheaper per unit to
         produce with batch production than by job production and (2) the new keyboards will be
         more complex. Whether this increases or decreases profits will depend on price.
      • the change in production method leads to increased costs (hiring skilled workers,
         training existing workers etc.) which would have a downward impact on profits;
      • the change in production method is also likely to be more time consuming hence adding to
         production costs, However, this may not affect profits adversely if higher prices negotiated
         in advance offset this cost increase;
      • the marketing strategy is likely to be different. The new market is much more of a niche
         market and easier to target so may cost less. Price is less likely to be a key element of the
         strategy giving the opportunity for higher prices negotiated in advance with musicians.
         These suggest a reduction in marketing costs and a possible increase in profits.

      Accept any other relevant influence on profits.

      N.B. answers must reflect the impacts specifically on profits NOT just on costs.

      Accept any other relevant influence on profits.

      Award [1] for each influence on profits and an additional [1] for an explanation of the
      influence in context. Award a maximum of [2] per influence.

(d)   Discuss the impact on MM’s marketing mix if MM changes its target market to
      professional musicians.                                                   [10]

      Price:
      • current price is set low and aimed at consumer market via shops and contracts with
         schools. Likely to be a standard price, as low as possible;
      • new price is negotiated. Likely to be different for each professional musician customer,
         depending on the specification. Likely to be much higher due to the uniqueness of each
         product and its complexity relative to existing market;
      • change is from standard process to negotiated, custom prices – more work and skills;
      • it is not known whether the new niche market is competitive. If so, this may affect the
         degree of flexibility with pricing.

      Place:
      • currently distributed through third party retail outlets or through direct supply to
         schools. The requirements of these customers remain fairly constant;
      • new arrangements will be sales direct to the customer. MM lack experience in this type
         of marketing where customers often have varied requirements meaning MM need to be
         constantly aware of market changes;
      • change is from mixed retailer/direct to all direct so some skills already.

      Promotion:
      • currently likely to be done by retail outlets with the addition of the free training
        packages. Currently, MM probably relies mostly on below-the-line (BTL) promotion and
        that is unlikely to change, though it may switch to different types of BTL promotion.
        Promotion to schools may be done through personal contact or through educational
        exhibitions, conferences, etc.;
      • new promotion could be through musical publications or direct contact. Mass
        methods of promotion wasteful and not appropriate. Overall effect could be to lower
        promotion costs;
      • change is to in house rather than relying on others. However, this may involve hiring
        staff with specialist knowledge adding to costs.

      Product:
      • currently a standard design, fairly simple in terms of standard features. Appearance may
        be less important to the current target market. This may enable MM to save on finishing
        costs;
      • changing to a tailor-made product with customized features. Musicians likely to each
        have the owned demands in terms of appearance and features. Lack of standardization of
        the product however may increase costs of customized production but may well be offset
        by higher prices.

      People:
      • Currently, MM has 50 employees, and some of them have left in search of better
        opportunities. MM should find out if there is a skills gap to implement the change they
        have in mind. Those staff involved directly with musicians will need to understand the
        specific needs of this type of customer. Dealing with schools was likely a much simpler
        task. Rectifying any skills gap through training or external hiring may prove expensive.
        However, job production may prove more motivating to staff and hence reduce the high
        cost of labour turnover.

Process:
• MM should find out if there are any internal barriers in the way to delivering the best
  customer value at the time of changing the product design by adding the range of different
  sound features and improving the appearance of the keyboards. This will depend on how
  MM interact with musicians during the design part of the process.

Physical evidence:
• How does MM reassure the customers? Are MM staff well-trained? Will they continue to
  offer free online courses? Does MM offer a place where professional musicians can come
  and try/test the products?

The overall judgment is that no element of the marketing mix will remain unchanged and that
MM will have to take on more responsibility for its own marketing and develop some skills.
Also, the transition to the new market will not happen overnight, hence, MM will need to run
two complimentary marketing strategies alongside each other for an undetermined period of
time. This could lead to a lot of marketing confusion regarding where their priorities lie.

A conclusion with judgment is expected.

Candidates should not be penalized if they do not address the extended marketing mix.

Marks should be allocated according to the markbands on page 3 with further guidance
below.

N.B. The marks listed in the left column are maximum awards. Candidates could technically
have a response that addresses two Ps in a balanced way yet still lacks the depth, precision,
or application for [4] (for example). In other words, use the table below as a guideline but
also make some holistic judgment about the quality of the response.
