Subject details:         Computer science HL paper 1 markscheme

Mark allocation

Section A: Candidates are required to answer all questions. Total 25 marks.
Section B: Candidates are required to answer all questions. Total 75 marks.
           Maximum total = 100 marks.

General

A markscheme often has more specific points worthy of a mark than the total allows. This is intentional.
Do not award more than the maximum marks allowed for that part of a question.

When deciding upon alternative answers by candidates to those given in the markscheme, consider the
following points:

Each statement worth one point has a separate line and the end is signified by means of a
semi-colon (;).

An alternative answer or wording is indicated in the markscheme by a “/”; either wording can be
accepted.

Words in ( … ) in the markscheme are not necessary to gain the mark.

If the candidate’s answer has the same meaning or can be clearly interpreted as being the same as that
in the markscheme then award the mark.

Mark positively. Give candidates credit for what they have achieved and for what they have got correct,
rather than penalizing them for what they have not achieved or what they have got wrong.

Remember that many candidates are writing in a second language; be forgiving of minor linguistic slips.
In this subject effective communication is more important than grammatical accuracy.

Occasionally, a part of a question may require a calculation whose answer is required for subsequent
parts. If an error is made in the first part then it should be penalized. However, if the incorrect answer is
used correctly in subsequent parts then follow through marks should be awarded. Indicate this with
“FT”.


General guidance

  Issue            Guidance
  Answering        In the case of an “identify” question, read all answers and mark positively up to the
  more than        maximum marks. Disregard incorrect answers.
  the quantity     In the case of a “describe” question, which asks for a certain number of facts
  of               eg “describe two kinds”, mark the first two correct answers. This could include two
  responses        descriptions, one description and one identification, or two identifications.
  prescribed       In the case of an “explain” question, which asks for a specified number of
  in the           explanations eg “explain two reasons …”, mark the first two correct answers.
  questions        This could include two full explanations, one explanation, one partial
                   explanation etc.

           Prototyping approach allows the end users (employees, management, owner) to visualize
           how the final solution might look;
           So, they can provide feedback to the system analysis team;

           Gives the design team the chance to explore different possibilities;
           Before choosing the best one / most likely one;

           Feedback from end users;
           Saves wasting time at a later stage;

           Note: Reward other suitable answers.

           Award [1] for stating an advantage and [1] for an expansion.

     (b)   Award [2] max.
           Software developer works on a rather simple project / in a small company;
           No end-users so no need for feedback / to explore different possibilities;

           The software developer is the only end-user;
           No need to waste time and money on a prototype / to view how the solution might look;

           When designing very large/resources intensive systems;
           A prototype may be too expensive/ cost inefficient;

           In a case where trial/error is a dangerous approach/can be lethal/harmful for
           human lives/unethical;
           For example, systems that overlook nuclear power plants/ surgical equipment, etc.

     The XOR operation takes two Boolean operands and returns true (if and only) if the operands are
     different;
     it returns false if the two operands have the same value;

     Note: If defined by drawing the truth table; then award 1 mark for all four combinations of two
     inputs and 1 mark for the correct output column.

           that they were fine with her posting and share their pictures with everyone;

     (b)   Award [2] max.
           there could be problems if the person at the event does not have the facility to see the
           video/images;
           because of, for example, inadequate internet connection / browser / video player;

            employees’ computers);


      (b)   Award [4] max.
            The reliability of wireless depends on the strength of the wireless signal;
            Depends on distance from router;
            depends on the topology/shape of the surroundings;
            a wireless LAN has slower data transfer;

            whilst
            Ethernet is more reliable as the strength of the signal does not depend on the
            distance from the router/ wired LAN support longer distances;
            wired is immune to interference;
            there is no issue with the topology/shape of the surrounding;
            but the Ethernet cable may be cut/broken affecting reliability;

      (c)   Award [2] max.
            wired network is only accessible with a physical cable connection and in wireless
            networks signals are broadcasted outside of the building;
            leaving it open to the public and potential hackers/ it is easy to intercept transmissions;

            a wireless network is more open to misuse;
            as network administrator cannot directly monitor a specific machine;

      (d)   Award [4] max.
            Authentication;
            Nobody outside the VPN should be able to use the VPN and affect the security of the VPN,
            so only user name and password authentication is not enough;
            Strong user VPN authentication uses various methods, including certificates, one-time
            passwords and software tokens;

            Encryption;
            If data intercepted, it will not be readable;
            encrypting each encapsulated data packet’s content with an encryption key (the key is
            shared only between the VPN’s server and clients);

            Tunnelling software;
            A VPN hides a user’s data by encrypting it with a tunnel created between the user’s device
            and the VPN’s web server (The user then takes on the IP address of the web server (rather
            than their true IP), and this leads to one advantage of a VPN (namely that a user can appear
            to be in a different geographic location than they are actually located in);

            Multiple exit nodes;
            Makes it hard to distinguish where the data sent is originated (protecting privacy);

(e)   Award [4] max.
      Data is organized in specially formatted units (data packets);
      Each data packet contains: data, address of the sender, address of the receiver, size of
      packet, sequence number, control codes, etc.;
      which are routed from source to destination using network switches and routers;
      network switches and routers determine how best to transfer the packet between a number
      of intermediate devices (routers and switches) on the path to its destination (rather than
      flowing directly over a single wire on the path to its destination);
      data packets are reassembled at destination;

      Applications in the legacy/outdated system do not have upgrades;
      Documentation of the legacy system might be missing/incomplete/unreliable;
      Data cannot be converted to newer formats;
      Legacy systems are typically large and complex systems/ mainframes, so programs might be
      disorganized/hard to understand/expensive to change;
      It may be difficult to find system engineers/ employees/ programmers familiar with the old
      programming languages/ old operating systems to maintain the system;

(d)   Award [3] max.
      Two systems will be run simultaneously so that operations are not disrupted, this is a costly
      operation;
      Because both systems and all their resources need to be maintained/run at the same time;
      Data migration has many risks/is a complex process so the costs to implement it correctly
      are high because of additional costs due to delays /lost time/data entry;
      The decision on when and whether the new system is ready to remove the
      old one depends on the testing and validation of the new system, which includes some
      additional costs associated with the testing/validation of the system;

      Note: Reward other suitable responses.

(c)   Award [6] max.
      Award [1] for a loop (to input all the data)
      Award [1] for placing the inputted data into a newly created node
      Award [1] for setting the root node to the new node(if the tree is empty/ no root node)
      Award [1] for start searching from the root node
      Award [1] for searching for the empty location in the left subtree if the input score is higher
      than the current value
      Award [1] for inserting the new node in the left subtree when the proper location is found
      Award [1] for searching for the empty location in the right subtree if the input score is lower
      than the current value
      Award [1] for inserting the new node in the right subtree when the proper location is found

      Example 1:
      Repeat the following steps (until all the names and scores are inputted);
           input the values (name and score of one student), create a new node and
           place the input values into the newly created node;
           If the tree is empty, set the root to a new node;
           Else (if the tree is not empty)
                 repeat the following until a leaf node is reached;
                       If a new node is smaller than or equal to the node (here it is a root node)
                       move to its right child;
                       If a new node is larger than the node, move to its left child:
                  insert the new node (as a right or left child of the leaf node based on node
                  is less or greater than the leaf node);

      Example 2:
      Repeat the following steps (until all the names and scores are inputted);
      Create a new node (for example, named ITEM); input the values (name and score of one
      student) and place them into the new node (ITEM) ( and set its left and right to NULL);
      If there isn't a root node, set the root node to ITEM;
      If there is a root node, start searching from the root node (to find ITEM's proper location),
              if the score in ITEM is greater than the score in the root search for the empty
              location in the left subtree;
      otherwise (if the score in ITEM is lesser than the score in the root), search for the empty
      location in the right subtree;
      insert ITEM into empty location;

      Example 3:
      While the end of the input list is not reached do the following;
         input the values (name and score of one student), create a new node
         and place the input values into the newly created node;
         if there is no root node, set the root to the new node;
         if there is a root node
                start from the root node and if the score in the node to insert is less than
                 the root, go to right child;
                 otherwise go to the left child of the root;
                 continue this process (Note: each node is a root for some subtree) until
                  a null pointer (or leaf node) is found ( where it is not possible to go any further);
          when the leaf node is found, insert the node as a right or left child of the leaf node
          ( based on node is less or greater than the leaf node);
