Subject details:        Computer science SL paper 1 markscheme

Mark allocation

Section A: Candidates are required to answer all questions. Total 25 marks.
Section B: Candidates are required to answer all questions. Total 45 marks.
           Maximum total = 70 marks.

General

A markscheme often has more specific points worthy of a mark than the total allows. This is intentional.
Do not award more than the maximum marks allowed for that part of a question.

When deciding upon alternative answers by candidates to those given in the markscheme, consider the
following points:

• Each statement worth one point has a separate line and the end is signified by means of a
   semi-colon (;).

• An alternative answer or wording is indicated in the markscheme by a “/”; either wording can be
   accepted.

• Words in ( … ) in the markscheme are not necessary to gain the mark.

• If the candidate’s answer has the same meaning or can be clearly interpreted as being the same as
   that in the markscheme then award the mark.

• Mark positively. Give candidates credit for what they have achieved and for what they have got correct,
   rather than penalizing them for what they have not achieved or what they have got wrong.

• Remember that many candidates are writing in a second language; be forgiving of minor linguistic slips.
   In this subject effective communication is more important than grammatical accuracy.

• Occasionally, a part of a question may require a calculation whose answer is required for subsequent
   parts. If an error is made in the first part then it should be penalized. However, if the incorrect answer
   is used correctly in subsequent parts then follow through marks should be awarded. Indicate this with
   “FT”.


General guidance

 Issue            Guidance
 Answering        • In the case of an “identify” question, read all answers and mark positively up to the
 more than           maximum marks. Disregard incorrect answers.
 the quantity     • In the case of a “describe” question, which asks for a certain number of facts
 of                 eg “describe two kinds”, mark the first two correct answers. This could include two
 responses          descriptions, one description and one identification, or two identifications.
 prescribed       • In the case of an “explain” question, which asks for a specified number of
 in the             explanations eg “explain two reasons …”, mark the first two correct answers.
 questions          This could include two full explanations, one explanation, one partial
                    explanation etc.

               Prototyping approach allows the end users (employees, management, owner) to visualize
               how the final solution might look;
               So, they can provide feedback to the system analysis team;

               Gives the design team the chance to explore different possibilities;
               Before choosing the best one / most likely one;

               Feedback from end users;
               Saves wasting time at a later stage;

               Note: Reward other suitable answers.

               Award [1] for stating an advantage and [1] for an expansion.

     (b)       Award [2] max.
               Software developer works on a rather simple project / in a small company;
               No end-users so no need for feedback / to explore different possibilities;

               The software developer is the only end-user;
               No need to waste time and money on a prototype / to view how the solution might look;

               When designing very large/resources intensive systems;
               A prototype may be too expensive/ cost inefficient;

               In a case where trial/error is a dangerous approach/can be lethal/harmful for
               human lives/unethical;
               For example, systems that overlook nuclear power plants/ surgical equipment, etc.

           Higher level languages are easier for programmers to understand/use;
           they are made in a human-understandable form / in the form of natural language
           (so humans are able to understand the language too, not only computers);
           higher level languages enable a programmer to write programs that are independent (less
           dependent) of a particular type of computer;
           A human-readable form of the program should be translated into executable binary code /
           machine language code which is the only language computer hardware can understand;


5.   (a)   Award [2] max.
           the video/images could be viewed by anyone;
           which may not be desirable since some people may not wish to have themselves regarded
           by everyone;

           anybody could download the images/video;
           and they can be manipulated by outsiders;

           Posting images of other people at a private function requires their permission;
           did she get permission from her friends? ;
           that they were fine with her posting and share their pictures with everyone;

     (b)   Award [2] max.
           there could be problems if the person at the event does not have the facility to see the
           video/images;
           because of, for example, inadequate internet connection / browser / video player;

           space on web server could cause problems;
           if the size of files exceeds the allocation on server;


6.   Award [1] max.
     Variables define areas in memory in which values (data) are stored;
     Variables are unique identifiers that retrieve values from the memory addresses at which they are

           (Wireless) controller;
           Wireless adaptors/ Network interface cards (NICs) (that operate within the
           employees’ computers);


     (b)   Award [4] max.
           The reliability of wireless depends on the strength of the wireless signal;
           Depends on distance from router;
           depends on the topology/shape of the surroundings;
           a wireless LAN has slower data transfer;

           whilst
           Ethernet is more reliable as the strength of the signal does not depend on the
           distance from the router/ wired LAN support longer distances;
           wired is immune to interference;
           there is no issue with the topology/shape of the surrounding;
           but the Ethernet cable may be cut/broken affecting reliability;

     (c)   Award [2] max.
           wired network is only accessible with a physical cable connection and in wireless
           networks signals are broadcasted outside of the building;
           leaving it open to the public and potential hackers/ it is easy to intercept transmissions;

           a wireless network is more open to misuse;
           as network administrator cannot directly monitor a specific machine;

     (d)   Award [4] max.
           Authentication;
           Nobody outside the VPN should be able to use the VPN and affect the security of the VPN,
           so only user name and password authentication is not enough;
           Strong user VPN authentication uses various methods, including certificates, one-time
           passwords and software tokens;

           Encryption;
           If data intercepted, it will not be readable;
           encrypting each encapsulated data packet’s content with an encryption key (the key is
           shared only between the VPN’s server and clients);

           Tunnelling software;
           A VPN hides a user’s data by encrypting it with a tunnel created between the user’s device
           and the VPN’s web server (The user then takes on the IP address of the web server (rather
           than their true IP), and this leads to one advantage of a VPN (namely that a user can appear
           to be in a different geographic location than they are actually located in);

           Multiple exit nodes;
           Makes it hard to distinguish where the data sent is originated (protecting privacy);

(e)   Award [4] max.
      Data is organized in specially formatted units (data packets);
      Each data packet contains: data, address of the sender, address of the receiver, size of
      packet, sequence number, control codes, etc.;
      which are routed from source to destination using network switches and routers;
      network switches and routers determine how best to transfer the packet between a number
      of intermediate devices (routers and switches) on the path to its destination (rather than
      flowing directly over a single wire on the path to its destination);
      data packets are reassembled at destination;

                   Data migration is the process of transporting/transferring data between computers /
                   storage devices;
                   Data migration is importing the data/database(s) (created in Africa) into the new

                   Incompatible file formats;
                   Which could lead to incomplete or incorrect data transfer / data loss;

                   Different file structures / different employee records;
                   Which will result in a mismatch of data/ incorrect data;

                   New validation rules differ to the old validation rules (used in the Africa headquarters);

(c)   Award [3] max.
      Applications in the legacy/outdated system do not have upgrades;
      Documentation of the legacy system might be missing/incomplete/unreliable;
      Data cannot be converted to newer formats;
      Legacy systems are typically large and complex systems/ mainframes, so programs might be
      disorganized/hard to understand/expensive to change;
      It may be difficult to find system engineers/ employees/ programmers familiar with the old
      programming languages/ old operating systems to maintain the system;

(d)   Award [3] max.
      Two systems will be run simultaneously so that operations are not disrupted, this is a costly
      operation;
      Because both systems and all their resources need to be maintained/run at the same time;
      Data migration has many risks/is a complex process so the costs to implement it correctly
      are high because of additional costs due to delays /lost time/data entry;
      The decision on when and whether the new system is ready to remove the
      old one depends on the testing and validation of the new system, which includes some
      additional costs associated with the testing/validation of the system;

      Note: Reward other suitable responses.
