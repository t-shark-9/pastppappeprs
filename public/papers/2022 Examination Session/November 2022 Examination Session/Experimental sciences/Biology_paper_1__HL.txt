36.   Two kinds of wolf spider rub specialized body parts together in order to produce distinct sounds
      to attract females. Females of both groups will only allow a male of the same kind to mate with
      them. It has been found through experimentation, however, that offspring can be produced from
      crossings between the two groups. What can be hypothesized?

           I.       The groups are reproductively isolated.
           II.      They could be the same species.
           III.     This is an example of behavioural isolation.

      A.   I only

      B.   II only

      C.   I and II only

      D.   I, II and III


37.   Movement of insects requires muscles in antagonistic pairs. The diagram shows an insect leg with
      muscles labelled X and Y.

      What actions in the human arm are equivalent to muscle X contracting and muscle Y relaxing?

38.   A person with failing kidneys is often treated with dialysis several times a week. This is done either
      by passing blood through a dialysis machine or by using the peritoneum, the lining of the abdomen,
      as shown in the diagram.

      B.    Salts and urea only

      C.    Sugar only

39.   Which step occurs in both spermatogenesis and oogenesis?

      A.   First division of meiosis is stopped in prophase I until puberty begins.

      B.   Germinal epithelium cells divide by mitosis.

      C.   At the end of the first division in meiosis, the cytoplasm is divided equally between
           daughter cells.

      D.   Four haploid gametes are produced at the end of meiosis II.


40.   What is the role of HCG in pregnancy?

      A.   It is secreted by the embryo to stimulate progesterone secretion by the ovary during
           early pregnancy.

      B.   Together with oxytocin, it is involved in the positive feedback required for uterine
           contractions during birth.

      C.   It sustains the secretion of progesterone by the placenta throughout pregnancy.

      D.   It stimulates the ovary to maintain secretion of estrogen in early pregnancy.
