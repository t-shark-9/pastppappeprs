     floated on water.

20.   By the end of the 19th century in England, the dark form of the moth Biston betularia formed up to
      98 % of the total population in industrial areas. From 1970, the percentage of dark forms decreased
      significantly. What is an explanation for the decrease?

      A.    An increase in environmental pollution killed the dark forms more than the light forms.

      B.    Reduction of pollution resulted in greater camouflage for light forms of the moth.

      C.    Dark forms could no longer find mates.

      D.    Light forms had superior feeding mechanisms.
