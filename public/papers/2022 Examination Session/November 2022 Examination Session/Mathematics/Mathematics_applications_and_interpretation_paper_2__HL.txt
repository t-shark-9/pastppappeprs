Answer all questions in the answer booklet provided. Please start each question on a new page.
Full marks are not necessarily awarded for a correct answer with no working. Answers must be
supported by working and/or explanations. Solutions found from a graphic display calculator should
be supported by suitable working. For example, if graphs are used to find a solution, you should sketch
these as part of your answer. Where an answer is incorrect, some marks may be given for a correct
method, provided this is shown by written working. You are therefore advised to show all working.

     At Mirabooka Primary School, a survey found that 68 % of students have a dog and 36 % of
     students have a cat. 14 % of students have both a dog and a cat.

     This information can be represented in the following Venn diagram, where m , n , p and q
     represent the percentage of students within each region.

(Question 1 continued)

     Each year, one student is chosen randomly to be the school captain of Mirabooka
     Primary School.

     Tim is using a binomial distribution to make predictions about how many of the next 10
     school captains will own a dog. He assumes that the percentages found in the survey will
     remain constant for future years and that the events “being a school captain” and “having
     a dog” are independent.

     Use Tim’s model to find the probability that in the next 10 years

     (c)       5 school captains have a dog.
           (i)	

           (ii)    more than 3 school captains have a dog.

           (iii)   exactly 9 school captains in succession have a dog.                                     [7]

     John randomly chooses 10 students from the survey.

     (d)   State why John should not use the binomial distribution to find the probability that 5
           of these students have a dog.                                                                   [1]

     Adesh is designing a glass. The glass has an inner surface and an outer surface. Part of
     the cross section of his design is shown in the following graph, where the shaded region
     represents the glass. The two surfaces meet at the top of the glass. 1 unit represents 1 cm.

     A company makes doors for kitchen cupboards from two layers. The inside layer is wood,
     and its thickness is normally distributed with mean 7 mm and standard deviation 0.3 mm.
     The outside layer is plastic, and its thickness is normally distributed with mean 3 mm and
     standard deviation 0.16 mm. The thickness of the plastic is independent of the thickness of
     the wood.

     (a)   Find the probability that a randomly chosen door has a total thickness of less than 9.5 mm.[5]

     Eight doors are to be packed into a box to send to a customer. The width of the box is 82 mm.
     The thickness of each door is independent.

     (b)   Find the probability that the total thickness of the eight doors is greater than the width
           of the box.                                                                                    [4]

     The company buys two new machines, A and B, to make the wooden layers. An employee
     claims that the layers from machine B are thinner than the layers from machine A. In order
     to test this claim, a random sample is taken from each machine.

     The seven layers in the sample from machine A have a thickness, in mm, of

                                 6.23, 7.04, 7.31, 6.79, 6.91, 6.79, 7.47.

     (c)   Find the

           (i)    mean.

           (ii)   unbiased estimate of the population variance.                                           [3]

     The eight layers in the sample from machine B have a mean thickness of 6.89 mm
     and sn−1 = 0.31 .

     (d)   Perform a suitable test, at the 5 % significance level, to test the employee’s claim.
           You may assume the thickness of the wooden layers from each machine are
           normally distributed with equal population variance.                                           [6]
