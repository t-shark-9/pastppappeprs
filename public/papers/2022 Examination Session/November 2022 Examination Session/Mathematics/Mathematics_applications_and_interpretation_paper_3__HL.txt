Full marks are not necessarily awarded for a correct answer with no working. Answers must be
supported by working and/or explanations. Solutions found from a graphic display calculator should be
supported by suitable working. For example, if graphs are used to find a solution, you should sketch
these as part of your answer. Where an answer is incorrect, some marks may be given for a correct
method, provided this is shown by written working. You are therefore advised to show all working.

     In this question, you will explore possible approaches to using historical sports results
     for making predictions about future sports matches.

     Two friends, Peter and Helen, are discussing ways of predicting the outcomes of international
     football matches involving Argentina.

     Peter suggests analysing historical data to help make predictions. He lists the results of the
     most recent 240 matches in which Argentina played, in chronological order, then considers
     blocks of four matches at a time. He counts how many times Argentina has won in each
     block. The following table shows his results for the 60 blocks of four matches.

                             Number of wins for Argentina
                                                                 Frequency
                              (per block of four matches)

     (a)   Determine the mean number of wins per block of four matches for Argentina.                   [2]

     Peter thinks that this data can be modelled by a binomial distribution with n = 4 and decides
     to carry out a χ 2 goodness of fit test.

     (b)   Use Peter’s data to write down an estimate for the probability p for this binomial model.    [1]

     (c)   (i)	Use the binomial model to find the probability that Argentina win zero matches in
                a block of four matches.                                                                [1]

(Question 1 continued)

     As some expected frequencies are less than 5, Peter combines rows in his table to produce
     the following observed frequencies. He then uses his binomial model to find appropriate
     expected frequencies, correct to one decimal place.

           Number of wins for Argentina

     (d)   Peter uses this table to carry out a χ 2 goodness of fit test, to test the hypothesis that
           the data follows a binomial distribution with n = 4 , at the 5 % significance level.

           For this test, state

           (i)     the null hypothesis;                                                                   [1]

           their next four international football matches.                                                [2]

(Question 1 continued)

     Helen thinks that a better prediction might be made by considering the transition between
     matches. To keep the model simple, she decides to use only two states: Argentina won (A)
     or Argentina did not win (B). Helen looks at Peter’s list of results and counts the number of
     times that:
     y Argentina won, twice in succession (AA),
     y Argentina won, then did not win (AB),
     y Argentina did not win, then won (BA),
     y Argentina did not win, twice in succession (BB).

     She recorded the following results.

                                          Transition    Frequency

                                              AA             85

     Helen uses the relative frequencies to estimate the probabilities in a transition matrix.

     (f)   (i)	Given that Argentina won the previous match, show that Helen’s estimate for the
                                                                        17

           international football matches involving Argentina. Use Helen’s model to find the

     Some medical conditions require patients to take medication regularly for long
     periods of time. In this question, you will explore the concentration of a medicinal
     drug in the body, when the drug is given repeatedly.

     Once a drug enters the body, it is absorbed into the blood. As the body breaks down the
     drug over time, the concentration of the drug decreases. Let C (t ) , measured in milligrams
     per millilitre (mg ml−1) , be the concentration of the drug, t hours after the drug is given to the
     patient. The rate at which the drug is broken down is modelled as directly proportional to its
     concentration, leading to the differential equation

                                           dC
                                               kC , where k∈+ .
                                           dt

     The initial concentration is d mg ml−1 , d > 0 .

     (a)   By solving the differential equation, show that C = de−kt .                                                      [3]

     For the remainder of this question, you will consider a particular drug where it is known
     that k = 0.2 . The first dose is given at time t = 0 and it is assumed that before this there
     is no drug present in the blood.

     (b)   Find the time, in hours, for this drug to reach 5 % of its initial concentration.                                [2]

     The drug is to be given every T hours and in constant doses, such that the concentration of
     the drug is increased by an amount d mg ml−1 . To simplify the model, it is assumed that each
     time the drug is given the concentration of the drug in the blood increases instantaneously.


     (c)

(Question 2 continued)

     After a patient has been taking this drug for a long time, it is required to keep the
     concentration within a particular range so that it is both safe and effective.

     Let Hn be the highest concentration of the drug in the body for the interval (n − 1)T ≤ t < nT .

     Let Ln be the lowest concentration of the drug in the body for the interval (n − 1)T ≤ t < nT .
