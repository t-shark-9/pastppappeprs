Answer all questions in the answer booklet provided. Please start each question on a new page.
Full marks are not necessarily awarded for a correct answer with no working. Answers must be
supported by working and/or explanations. Solutions found from a graphic display calculator should be
supported by suitable working. For example, if graphs are used to find a solution, you should sketch
these as part of your answer. Where an answer is incorrect, some marks may be given for a correct
method, provided this is shown by written working. You are therefore advised to show all working.

     Elsie, a librarian, wants to investigate the length of time, T minutes, that people spent in her
     library on a particular day.

     (a)     State whether the variable T is discrete or continuous.                                        [1]

     Elsie’s data for 160 people who visited the library on that particular day is shown in the
     following table.

           T (minutes)     0 ≤ T < 20    20 ≤ T < 40     40 ≤ T < 60     60 ≤ T < 80      80 ≤ T < 100

     (b)     Find the value of k .                                                                          [2]

     (c)     (i)	Write down the modal class.

             (ii)   Write down the mid-interval value for this class.                                       [2]

     (d)     Use Elsie’s data to calculate an estimate of the mean time that people spent in the library. [2]

     (e)     Using the table, write down the maximum possible number of people who spent 35
             minutes or less in the library on that day.                                                    [1]

     Elsie assumes her data to be representative of future visitors to the library.

     (f)     Find the probability a visitor spends at least 60 minutes in the library.                      [2]

(Question 1 continued)

     The following box and whisker diagram shows the times, in minutes, that the 160 visitors
     spent in the library.

                                               T (minutes)

     (g)   Write down the median time spent in the library.                                                 [1]

     (h)   Find the interquartile range.                                                                    [2]

     (i)   Hence show that the longest time that a person spent in the library is not an outlier.           [3]

     Elsie believes the box and whisker diagram indicates that the times spent in the library are
     not normally distributed.

     (j)   Identify one feature of the box and whisker diagram which might support Elsie’s belief.          [1]




                                                                                                 Turn over

     Each year, one student is chosen randomly to be the school captain of Mirabooka
     Primary School.

     Tim is using a binomial distribution to make predictions about how many of the next 10
     school captains will own a dog. He assumes that the percentages found in the survey will
     remain constant for future years and that the events “being a school captain” and “having
     a dog” are independent.

     (a)   (i)	Find f ′ (x) .

           (ii)   Hence find the coordinates of the point on the field that is furthest north.               [5]

     Point A has coordinates (0 ,   0), point B has coordinates (0 ,   30), point C has coordinates
     (70 ,   72) and point D has coordinates (70 ,   0).

     (b)   (i)	Write down the integral which can be used to find the area of the shaded region R .

           (ii)   Find the area of Linda’s field.                                                            [4]

(Question 5 continued)

      Linda used the trapezoidal rule with ten intervals to estimate the area. This calculation
      underestimated the area by 11.4 m2 .

      (c)     (i)	Calculate the percentage error in Linda’s estimate.

              (ii)   Suggest how Linda might be able to reduce the error whilst still using the
                     trapezoidal rule.                                                                      [3]

      Linda would like to construct a building on her field. The square foundation of the building,
      EFGH, will be located such that [EH] is on the southern boundary and point F is on the
      northern boundary of the property. A possible location of the foundation of the building is
      shown in the following diagram.

                                                                                    North

                       60


                                F                   G

                       30




                                                                 D
                         0 E                        H                               x
                                          30              60              90

      The area of the square foundation will be largest when [GH] lies on [CD].

      (d)     (i)	Find the x-coordinate of point E for the largest area of the square foundation
                   of building EFGH.

              (ii)   Find the largest area of the foundation.                                               [5]
