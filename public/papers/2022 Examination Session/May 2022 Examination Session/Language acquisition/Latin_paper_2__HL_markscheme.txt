Extract 8      Horace, Carmina 1.2.29–52
8.   (a)    Award [1] up to [2] for any of the following: Apollo: Augustus’s patron deity / the god who
            helped him at Actium; Erycina = Venus was Augustus’s mythological ancestor; Mars: Augustus
            had vowed to build a temple to Mars Ultor; Jupiter: sends Augustus to save Rome (vel sim).
            Answers that refer to Iocus or Cupid should be assessed on the quality of their explanations.
     (b)    Return to heaven/the sky late/ after a long time (serus in caelum redeas) [1], and stay among
            the Romans for a long time (diu intersis populo Quirini) [1].
     (c)    Horace portrays Augustus as the saviour of the Romans by drawing attention to his military
            achievements, his association with divinities, and by focussing on the relationship between the
            population and the emperor.
            Accept a range of substantiated answers, awarding [1] up to [4] for any point supporting the
            argument. Then award up to [2] for the coherence and clarity of the argument using the
            following scale: [2] if the argument is supported by 3–4 developed points; [1] if the argument is
            supported by 1–2 developed points; [0] if the argument is supported by no developed points or
            if no details from the text are given.
            Points may include:
            • rhetorical question (cui dabit Iuppiter?) emphasises how much the Romans were longing
                for a restorer of peace and order
            • praises him (candentis umeros) by analogy with Apollo, Augustus’s saving patron (venias Apollo)
            • reminds reader of Augustus’s benevolence by focusing on his divine ancestress’s
               benevolence (Erycina ridens)
            • apostrophes to gods (augur Apollo / auctor / ultor) refer to Augustus, suggesting his near-
               divine status
            • comparison with Mars shows Augustus’s military prowess (iuvat clamor/galeae) but also
               that he is the bringer of peace (satiate ludo)
            • he speculates that he might be Mercury, alluded to as ales/ filius Maiae
            • presents him as a model of pietas (Caesaris ultor)
            • chiasmus (filius Maiae, Caesaris ultor) to highlight the identification of the speculative
               Mercury and the historically certain Octavian
            • he assumes that Augustus is already divine (redeas, not eas)
            • reference to several gods (Apollo, Erycina, quem ... acer, filius Maiae only) puts him on a
               level with deities
            • enjambment of diu with laetus and intersis to emphasize how long the Romans want to hold
               on to Augustus, suggesting their affection for their emperor
            • elevates him over mere human imperfections or extolls him above ordinary citizens or
               emphasises the virtue of Augustus as leader vs the general population’s lack of virtue
               (nostris vitiis iniquum)
            • repetition (hic, 49–50), emphasising Augustus’s bond with Rome or the earnestness of
               Romans’ prayers to keep him
            • presents him as a model of military prowess (magnos triumphos)
            • alliteration / “jingle” (pater atque princeps) emphasizing the roles of Augustus as both father
               (caring, affectionate) and political leader
            • ‘prays’ to Augustus to save Rome’s honour (neu sinas Medos equitare inultos) as if to a god
               or confident of future military success
            • word placement (te duce, Caesar) highlights Augustus’s position as sole ruler/general
            • Emphatic word placement, ending the ode with a triumphal/religious acclamation (Caesar) as
               to a god or imperator
                                                                                                      Total: [10]

Extract 9      Livy, Ab Urbe Condita 3.46.1–6

9.   (a)    Award [3] if the meaning has been fully communicated, and vocabulary and grammar are
            rendered correctly. Award [2] if the meaning has been communicated, and vocabulary and
            grammar are rendered adequately despite inaccuracies. Award [1] if the meaning has not been
            communicated adequately, and vocabulary and grammar are not rendered adequately. Award
            [0] if the work does not reach a standard described by the descriptors above.

     (b)    The cited reason was to allow Verginius to attend [1] but the real reason was to avoid Icilius
            inciting the people to a riot (or similar) [1]. Some answers will be much closer to the Latin text
            than others.

     (c)    He will enforce his own law [1] and he will not lack in firmness as a decemvir (must be singular)
            [1]. Do not accept references to the use of lictors.

     (d)    Go to the gate (pergere ad portam) [1]; summon Verginius from the camp (or similar)
            (Verginium acciri e castris) [1] because the girl’s hope revolved around him (being present) (in
            eo verti puellae salutem) [1].

Extract 10      Sallust, Bellum Catilinae 3 8.2–9.5

10.   (a)    The Athenians’ exploits seem greater than they were as they are retold by great authors [1],
             whereas there were no such Roman authors [1] or similar.

      (b)    The most able men were very busy or nobody trained his ingenium without the body [1];
             preferred to have their deeds praised rather than write about the deeds of others [1].

      (c)    Sallust portrays Roman virtue by focussing on social unity, the Romans’ upstanding values in
             peace time, and their military bravery.

             Accept a range of substantiated answers, awarding [1] up to [4] for any point supporting the
             argument. Then award up to [2] for the coherence and clarity of the argument using the
             following scale: [2] if the argument is supported by 3–4 developed points; [1] if the argument is
             supported by 1–2 developed points; [0] if the argument is supported by no developed points or
             if no details from the text are given.

             Points may include:
             • Alliteration of fama feruntur emphasizes the insubstantiality of the Athenians achievements.
             • Superlatives help to identify prudence/wisdom/approval with action
               (prudentissimus/optimus quisque)
             • Contrast (facere quam dicere or sua ab aliis bene facta laudari quam ipse aliorum narrare)
               focuses attention on Roman deeds, not tales of deeds.
             • Roman virtue is found in all circumstances (domi militiaeque)
             • Chiasmus (concordia maxuma, minuma avaritia) and polyptoton (cives cum civibus)
               emphasise Roman social unity
             • Contrast (non legibus magis quam natura) drives home the point that virtue is intrinsic to the
               Romans
             • List/asyndeton (iurgia, discordias, simultates) shows proper ruthlessness towards enemies
             • Irony (certabant) makes Romans’ only internal strife one of cultivating virtue
             • Tricolon (suppliciis ... fideles) piles on praise of Romans’ key virtues
             • Variatio/chiasmus (audacia in bello, ubi pax evenerat, aequitate) highlights Roman virtues in
               war and in peace
             • Specific examples prove the strength and objectivity of his point (documenta haec) backed
               up with alliteration (haec habeo)
             • Epigrammatic statement (beneficiis magis quam metu imperium agitabant) emphasises
               Roman conduct in ruling

Instructions
Section B is assessed by the assessment criteria found below and published in the subject guide.

Criterion A (Range of evidence) assesses to what extent the evidence represents both prescribed
passages and supplementary reading. A candidate is expected to:

• fully address the contexts and background knowledge pertinent to the examples related to the chosen
   option.
