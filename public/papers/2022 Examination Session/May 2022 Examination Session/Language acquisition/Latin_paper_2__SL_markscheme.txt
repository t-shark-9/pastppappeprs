Extract 10     Sallust, Bellum Catilinae 6.7–7.5

10.   (a)    Men whose bodies were feeble (corpus infermum) [1] due to age (annis) [1] but whose
             minds were healthy (ingenium validum) [1] due to wisdom (sapientia) [1]. Due to the
             hyperbaton (“corpus annis infirmum” / “ingenium sapientia validum”) both points should be
             given, even within one quote (i.e. “corpus annis infirmum” would still receive two points).

      (b)    There had been kings to preserve liberty (conservandae libertatis) [1] and grow the state /
             promote public interest (augendae rei publicae) [1]; they were replaced because the
             monarchy degenerated into arrogance and tyranny (in superbiam dominationemque se
             convortit) [1].

      (c)    To kings, good men are always more suspected/objects of suspicion than bad men (boni
             quam mali suspectiores) [1] and anyone else’s virtue/excellence was a source of fear/alarm
             (aliena virtus formidulosa) [1].

      (d)    They took pleasure in splendid weapons [1] and military horses [1] rather than prostitutes [1]
             and dinner parties [1].

      (e)    Award [1] for any relevant point of discussion supported by the Latin text and [1] for a
             credible effect such as:
             • anaphora/parallel structure (non … non … non), emphasizing the men’s many virtues
             • tricolon (non labor … non locus … non armatus), emphasizing the men’s many virtues
             • litotes (non labor insolitus), emphasizing their work ethic
             • asyndeton (non…non…non); emphasizing how many virtues the men had.
