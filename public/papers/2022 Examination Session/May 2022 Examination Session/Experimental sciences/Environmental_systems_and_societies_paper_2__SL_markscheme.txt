Subject details: Environmental systems and societies SLP2
Markscheme
Mark allocation

Candidates are required to answer:
• ALL questions in Section A [25] and TWO questions in Section B [40].
• The maximum total = [65].


1.   Environmental systems and societies uses marking points and markbands to determine the
     achievement of candidates

     When using marking points (All of this paper except Section B, part (c) questions):
       i.    A markscheme often has more marking points than the total allows. This is intentional
      ii.    Each marking point has a separate line and the end is shown by means of a semi-colon (;)
      iii.   Where a mark is awarded, a tick/check () must be placed in the text at the precise point
             where it becomes clear that the candidate deserves the mark. One tick to be shown for each
             mark awarded
     iv.     The order of marking points does not have to be as in the markscheme, unless stated
             otherwise.

     When using markbands (Only for Section B, part (c) questions):
       i.    Read the response and determine which band the response fits into
      ii.    Then re-read the response to determine where the response fits within the band
      iii.   Annotate the response to indicate your reasoning behind the awarding of the mark
             Do not use ticks at this point
     iv.     Decide on a mark for the response
      v.     At the end of the response place the required number of ticks to enable RM Assessor to
             input the correct number of marks for the response.


2.   An alternative answer or wording is indicated in the markscheme by a slash (/). Either wording can
     be accepted.

3.   Words in brackets ( ) in the markscheme are not necessary to gain the mark.

4.   Words that are underlined are essential for the mark.

5.   If the candidate’s answer has the same “meaning” or can be clearly interpreted as being of
     equivalent significance, detail and validity as that in the markscheme then award the mark.
     Where this point is considered to be particularly relevant in a question it is emphasized by
     OWTTE (or words to that effect).
                                                   –4–                  M22/4/ENVSO/SP2/ENG/TZ0/XX/M


6.   Remember that many candidates are writing in a second language. Effective communication is
     more important than grammatical accuracy.

7.   Occasionally, a part of a question may require an answer that is required for subsequent
     marking points. If an error is made in the first marking point then it should be penalized. However, if
     the incorrect answer is used correctly in subsequent marking points then follow through marks
     should be awarded. When marking, indicate this by adding ECF (error carried forward) on the
     script.

8.   Do not penalize candidates for errors in units or significant figures, unless it is specifically referred
     to in the markscheme.
                                                  –5–                 M22/4/ENVSO/SP2/ENG/TZ0/XX/M


                                               Section A
1.   (a)   With reference to Figure 1, identify the recycling rate in England in 2018.                [1]

           44%;

           Note: Accept 43%–45%

     (b)   Outline one reason for the shape of the recycling rate curve from 2013 to 2018.        [1 max]

           Curve has flattened between 2013–18 due to:
           only certain types of waste are recyclable;
           limited market for recyclable materials/goods (OWTTE);
           difficult to change human behaviour completely;
           recycling facilities/ability may have reached full capacity (OWTTE);

           Note: Accept other valid reasons for the plateau – do not credit responses that
           explain why it has increased.

     (c)   Estimate the reduction in solid domestic waste (in million tonnes) going to landfill
           from 2001 to 2018.                                                                         [1]

           (22 – 4 =)
           ~18 (million tonnes);

           Note: Accept 16–19 (million tonnes); do not accept percentage (eg 18%)

     (d)   Describe three reasons why the proportion of solid domestic waste being
           recycled/composted and incinerated has changed.                                        [3 max]

           public awareness campaigns/government legislation/education promoting
           recycling/incineration;
           meeting international agreements/quotas/obligations;
           lack of space / suitable sites for landfill;
           to reduce environmental impacts of landfill (eg leachates/landfill gas/habitat
           destruction/ pests/vermin);
           developing technology/facilities for recycling/for energy production;
           increasing need for renewable/cleaner energy sources;
           financial reward/incentive for energy production;

           Note: Avoid double marking (sim) where responses give similar reasons for both
           recycling/composting and incineration (eg more efficient than landfill)
                                                    –6–                 M22/4/ENVSO/SP2/ENG/TZ0/XX/M


     (e)   Outline one reason why there has been an overall change in recorded total solid
           domestic waste between 2001 and 2018.                                                   [1 max]

           There has been an overall decrease in total solid waste due to:
           government promotion/incentives for reuse/upcycling;
           economic changes leading to reduced consumption;
           greater awareness of environmental issues leading to less wasteful consumerism;
           changes/errors in methods of data collection;
           reduction in amount of packaging;
           reduction in production/use of single-use items;

           Note: Credit any valid reason for a decrease in total waste. (Do not credit ‘increase in
           recycling’ as recycling is included in SDW in the graphic ...but reuse or upcycling is OK)


2.   (a)   (i)    With reference to Figure 2, identify when the diversity of species was
                  lowest in the past 400 million years.                                                 [1]

                  around 250 million years ago/Ma/Mya;

                  Note: Accept 240–255 Mya.
                  Do not credit if units (million years/Mya) are not given.

           (ii)   Describe what may have caused the deviation from the trend line at point X
                  in Figure 2.                                                                          [2]

                  mass extinction/extinction event / mass extinction of dinosaurs (65 Mya);
                  due to meteor/asteroid impact / volcanic activity / climatic change / ice age;

     (b)   (i)    Identify the relationship between the number of continents and the diversity
                  of species during the past 250 million years.                                         [1]

                  the greater the number of continents, the greater the diversity / positive
                  correlation (OWTTE);

           (ii)   Describe two reasons why there is a relationship between the number of
                  continents and the diversity of species.                                         [2 max]

                  separation of continents isolates populations leading to (allopatric)
                  speciation;
                  continents are moved into different climatic regions causing evolution of
                  different species;
                  continental movement creates new habitats, eg mountain ranges/islands;

     (c)   Outline the role of natural selection in increasing the diversity of species.           [2 max]

           natural selection (resulting from changing environment) acts on existing genetic
           variation (that has arisen through mutations over the eons);
           natural selection increases the survival of fittest genetic variations/traits;
           these traits are heritable/passed onto offspring / selected individuals will have
           higher reproduction potential / so species will adapt to different environments;
           the proportion of these traits may increase in some populations/in subsequent
           generations;
           which can lead to speciation/increasing species diversity if there is reproductive
           isolation;
                                                  –7–                  M22/4/ENVSO/SP2/ENG/TZ0/XX/M


3.   (a)   (i)    Identify one primary pollutant from the pollutants shown in Figure 3.               [1]

                  NO/NO2/hydrocarbons;

           (ii)   Outline why the pollutant named in Question 3 (a)(i) is referred to as a
                  primary pollutant.                                                                  [1]

                  impacts environment directly on emission / undergoes no chemical change
                  before impacting environment / is active on emission;

                  Note: Even if response to 3(a)(i) is wrong full credit (ECF) can be given for
                  appropriate definition of primary pollutant.

     (b)   Outline one reason why there is an increase in nitrogen oxides and hydrocarbons
           early in the day.                                                                          [1]

           increase in fossil fuel combustion/increased traffic/transport/industry/power
           plants;

     (c)   Explain the changes in ozone concentration over the period shown in Figure 3.          [3 max]

           ozone is (a secondary pollutant) produced from nitrogen oxides/NOx reacting
           with oxygen;
           it increases as more NOx accumulates in atmosphere due to human activity/fossil
           fuel use;
           sunlight/heat catalyses this reaction so it increases towards midday;
           later, ozone decreases due to dispersal by wind/less fossil fuel use/light
           becoming less intense;

           Note: Do not credit any further detail of chemical process of ozone formation.
           .
     (d)   State one environmental impact of the accumulation of ozone shown in Figure 3.         [1 max]

           damages plants (crops and forests) / reduces photosynthesis/plant growth;
           increase susceptibility to diseases/other pollutants;
           habitat deterioration;
           change in water and nutrient cycles;
           loss of biodiversity;
           impacts human health eg eye irritation/respiratory illness;
           damages fabrics and rubber materials;
           contributes to global warming/climate change / adverse weather;

           Note: Do not credit responses that address ozone depletion.

     (e)   Outline two local conditions that may increase the severity of photochemical
           smog.                                                                                  [2 max]

           low-lying topography/valley/mountains/high-rise buildings;
           low windspeed/air movement;
           thermal inversion / hot humid days;
           high population density/heavy use of fossil fuels;
           cities closer to equator get more intense sunlight;
                                           –8–                 M22/4/ENVSO/SP2/ENG/TZ0/XX/M


(f)   Outline the role of catalytic converters in reducing photochemical smog.          [1]

      conversion/reduction of nitrogen oxides/carbon monoxide/hydrocarbons from
      cars;
                                                  –9–                 M22/4/ENVSO/SP2/ENG/TZ0/XX/M


                                               Section B

Part (c) questions in Section B are all to be assessed using the markbands on page 18
with the guidance given below for each question.

4.   (a)   Outline how species diversity and population size influence the resilience of
           an ecosystem.                                                                           [4 max]

           greater species diversity/greater population size usually lead to greater resilience;
           with more species, it is more likely others can take over the role/niche of any
           lost/declining species;
           more food chains/energy/biogeochemical pathways in an ecosystem provides
           redundancy therefore greater stability;
           a variety of species is more likely to include those resistant to environmental
           change;
           larger populations provide greater storages that can last over periods of lower
           productivity; larger populations generally carry greater genetic diversity;
           larger populations of invasive species may lead to reduced diversity/resilience;
           lower populations are more prone to extinction after a disturbance (eg habitat
           fragmentation) / or due to stochastic fluctuations;
           an ecosystem may be more resilient if there are many small populations of
           different species than one large population of a single dominating species;
           large populations of foundation/keystone species may be crucial for resilience of
           certain ecosystems (eg corals, kelp, beavers, elephants, pines, hemlock);

           Note: Award credit to any valid arguments providing they directly relate species
           diversity or population size to resilience.
           Award [3] max for responses addressing only diversity or only population size.

     (b)   Describe the similarities and differences in using a biotic index and a diversity
           index to assess ecosystems.                                                             [7 max]

           Similarities:
           both may involve species identification;
           both may involve quantitative sampling/estimating the abundance of living
           organisms;
           both require multiple samples for effective comparisons/reliability;
           both indices involve evaluating the range/variety of different species;
           both involve calculating a single figure (index) from a collection of data;

           Differences:
           only biotic indices (not diversity indices) give different values to sensitive and
           tolerant species;
           biotic indices are specifically used for evaluating impact of pollution whereas
           diversity indices just measure variety and evenness of species/general
           condition/maturity of an ecosystem;
           diversity indices are appropriate for most ecosystems whereas biotic indices are
           usually for aquatic systems;
           biotic indices usually focus on animal species/macroinvertebrates alone whereas
           diversity indices can be used for plant or animal communities;
           diversity indices usually address all species present in system whereas biotic
           index focuses on a particular selection;

           Note: Award [4] max if only similarities or only differences are given.
           Only credit differences where both sides of the contrast are given or clearly
           implicit. No credit for naming indices eg Simpson’s, Trent etc.

(c)   With reference to named examples, discuss the significance of diversity in the
      sustainability of food production systems.                                                  [9 max]

      The following guide for using the markbands suggests certain features that may
      be offered in responses. The five headings coincide with the criteria given in each
      of the markbands (although “ESS terminology” has been conflated with
      “Understanding concepts”). This guide simply provides some possible inclusions
      and should not be seen as requisite or comprehensive. It outlines the kind of
      elements to look for when deciding on the appropriate markband and the specific
      mark within that band.

      Answers may include:
      • understanding concepts and terminology of genetic/species/habitat
         diversity; cultural / political diversity; sustainability; ecological footprint; yield
         per unit area; aquatic and terrestrial food production; commercial vs.
         subsistence; multinational vs. local production; monoculture v polyculture;
         organic farming; GMOs; selective breeding; impact of escapees on wild
         populations; integrated agriculture; habitat loss/degradation; air/water/soil
         pollution; threats to biodiversity/pollinators; pesticide/fertilizer/antibiotic use;
         biological pest control; food choice; buffer zones; mineral cycles; crop
         rotation, etc;
      • breadth in addressing and linking technological and management
         strategies of terrestrial and aquatic food production systems with
         genetic/species/habitat diversity and significance of this in terms of
         sustainability and ecological footprint in the context of a range of
         geographical locations, social settings, levels of economic development,
         traditional values, international relations, legislations, personal attitudes and
         EVSs, etc;
      • examples of named food production systems and strategies involved in
         monoculture, polyculture and integrated agriculture, wild fisheries,
         aquaculture etc;
      • balanced analysis evaluating the extent to which diversity is significant in
         determining the sustainability of food production systems along with relevant
         limitations and counterarguments, etc;
      • a conclusion that is consistent with, and supported by, analysis and
         examples given eg “because diversity is such a significant factor in
         maintaining stability of systems, it is inevitably of great significance in
         maintaining both a sustainable production system and the wider environment
         in which the production takes place”;

5.   (a)   Outline the role of the atmospheric system in the distribution of biomes.               [4 max]

           atmospheric/tri-cellular circulation (including Hadley, Ferrel & polar cells) creates
           patterns of climate that determine dominant vegetation types;
           low pressure due to intense heating/high insolation at the equator causes / rising
           moist air in the tropics creates high precipitation giving rise to rainforests;
           moving polewards (at high altitude), air cools, becomes denser and sinks forming
           a high-pressure zone / descending/dry air (20–30° latitude/tropics) creates water-
           limiting/arid conditions giving rise to deserts;
           some of the air continues towards the poles to equalize temperature difference /
           atmosphere transfers heat from (sub-)tropics to mid-latitudes giving rise to
           temperate biomes;
           descending/dry air (high latitude/polar regions) creates water-limiting conditions
           in tundra;
           water vapour (from mid-latitudes/temperate regions) is transferred to high
           latitudes giving rise to heavy precipitation/snow in boreal forest;
           water vapour is transferred from ocean surfaces overland generating freshwater
           aquatic systems;
           prevailing winds/jet streams (blowing from high to low pressure) bring
           precipitation to a region, eg temperate rainforest in mountainous
           region/riverine/water-margin systems;
           rain shadow effect of high mountains causes dry winds in the leeward side,
           resulting in arid or semi-arid biomes (eg Tibetan Plateau, Mongolian Gobi desert
           and steppes);
           atmosphere may be responsible for shifting biomes due to global
           warming/climate change;

     (b)   Explain how human impacts on the atmosphere may influence the productivity of
           terrestrial biomes.                                                                     [7 max]

           release of ozone-depleting substances reduces stratospheric ozone increasing
           UV on Earth...;
           UV can damage plants/photosynthesis reducing primary productivity;
           release of NOx/SOx from fossil fuels can generate acid precipitation...;
           acid rain can damage plants/leaves reducing primary productivity;
           acid rain can cause leaching of nutrients from soils reducing plant
           growth/productivity;
           acid rain can release toxic cations/minerals in soil that reduce plant
           growth/productivity; emission of greenhouse gases can lead to an increase in
           global temperatures/global warming...;
           increased temperatures may lead to higher rates of photosynthesis/increased
           productivity;
           higher temperatures may damage certain plant species reducing productivity;
           higher temperatures may cause greater evaporation/water scarcity that reduces
           plant growth/productivity;
           higher temperatures may melt permafrost increasing primary productivity in
           tundra / ice retreat, eg in Greenland, can lead to expansion of tundra ecosystem;
           emissions from fossil fuel combustion causing photochemical smog which
           reduces photosynthesis;
           any reduction in primary productivity will lead to reduction in secondary
           productivity/productivity of consumers;

           Note: Credit may be given for any further potential impacts of atmospheric
           pollution on productivity of terrestrial biomes.

(c)   To what extent is the need for conservation more significant in tropical biomes?        [9 max]

      The following guide for using the markbands suggests certain features that may
      be offered in responses. The five headings coincide with the criteria given in each
      of the markbands (although “ESS terminology” has been conflated with
      “Understanding concepts”). This guide simply provides some possible inclusions
      and should not be seen as requisite or comprehensive. It outlines the kind of
      elements to look for when deciding on the appropriate markband and the specific
      mark within that band.

      Answers may include:
      • understanding concepts and terminology of biodiversity; conservation
         strategies; tropical biomes; rainforests; swamps; coral reefs; hotspots;
         LEDCs & MEDCs; international v national conservation bodies;
         environmental value systems; productivity; carbon sinks; global warming;

         indigenous cultures; endangered species; Red List, etc;
      • breadth in addressing and linking threats to biodiversity with different
         societies, ecosystems, conservation strategies; the global dependence upon
         and significance of tropical biomes compared with others; implications of
         economic development in tropical regions with challenges of conservation;
         different EVS perspectives on reasons for conservation, etc;
      • examples of tropical biomes/ecosystems; their local societies; conservation
         efforts; reasons/needs for conservation, etc;
      • balanced analysis evaluating the extent to which conservation efforts are of
         particular importance for tropical biomes along with relevant limitations and
         counterarguments, etc;
      • a conclusion that is consistent with, and supported by, analysis and
         examples given eg “although the loss of any species may be considered of
         equal significance from an ecocentric point of view, the high productivity and
         biodiversity that characterize tropical biomes, along with the limited facility of
         local societies, which are often less developed, make tropical biomes a
         priority for international conservation efforts”;

6.   (a)   Outline four ways in which urbanization may influence processes in the
           hydrological cycle.                                                                        [4 max]

           urban (paved) surfaces/reduced veg cover will lead to increase in run-off;
           …and thus increase stream-flow/flooding;
           urban (paved) surfaces/reduced veg cover will reduce infiltration of water into soils;
           …and thus reduce inputs to groundwater/aquifers/water table level;
           urbanization can increase heat/local temperature leading to greater
           evaporation/downwind precipitation;
           urbanization will reduce vegetation cover and thus reduce
           evapotranspiration/regional precipitation;
           urbanization will increase local water extraction reducing river flows/increasing
           outputs from groundwater storages/aquifers;
           urbanization may lead to increased emission of greenhouse gases/global warming
           /climate change that may result in multitude of changes in hydrological cycle eg
           increased melting of glaciers/shifting precipitation patterns/increased evaporation etc;
           urbanization may lead to increased emissions of NOx/SOx leading to acid
           precipitation;

           Note: Ensure that each markpoint includes an explicit link to a direct consequence
           of urbanization and how this influences a process in the hydrological cycle.

(b)   Hydropower is a resource that can be exploited from rivers. Explain how the
      value of this resource to a society may vary over time.                                 [7 max]

      Positive changes promoting the value of hydropower:
      rise in environmental awareness/need for renewable energy may increase value of
      hydropower;
      need for industrial development entails increased demand for energy, thus
      increasing value of hydropower;
      improved/more efficient technology of dam building making the political decision
      more attractive to voters / increasing the margin of profit / reducing the initial
      investment for LEDCs / making overall project more sustainable;
      technological development of small scale/damless projects may render hydropower
      more aesthetically appealing / cheaper to implement in LEDCs / more
      environmental-friendly / more fit to ecocentrists;
      hydropower may become favoured due to depletion in local non-renewable
      sources/need for energy security;

      Negative changes reducing value of hydropower:
      impacts of hydropower on aquatic systems / local human settlements cause
      increasing conflict with cultural values/local needs;
      other renewable resources may become more favourable through technological
      development/reduced costs;
      decreasing rainfall/increased evaporation due to climate change renders an existing
      dam less efficient / profitable;
      energy security reasons / political change / economic recession dictate shift from
      hydropower to more dense nuclear power / cheaper coal;
      societal values/EVS may stop seeing damming of a river as sustainable and
      demand shift away from river dams to wind/solar power;
      society realizing it was unethical to relocate a local tribe and demanding the
      restoration of the river;

      Note: Do not credit general arguments on dynamic nature of natural capital, unless explicitly
      linked to hydropower or clearly discussed in the context of hydropower.
      Do not credit any argument relating to the high value (monetary, intrinsic, aesthetic,
      environmental, cultural, economic, ethical, social, spiritual, technological) of hydropower, if
      not explicitly shown how this value has changed over time. (eg local Native American tribe
      resents river diversion due to its spiritual value; this is not a valid MP, as no change shown,
      just a different value system)

(c)   To what extent are water scarcity issues better addressed through changing
      human behaviour than through technological development?                               [9 max]

      The following guide for using the markbands suggests certain features that may
      be offered in responses. The five headings coincide with the criteria given in each

      and should not be seen as requisite or comprehensive. It outlines the kind of
      elements to look for when deciding on the appropriate markband and the specific
      mark within that band.

      Answers may include:
      • understanding concepts and terminology of water accessibility,
         distribution, security, scarcity; approaches of different EVS to water
         management; management policies/legislation; irrigation; domestic use;
         industrial development; international conflict; water conservation strategies;
         desalination; artificial recharge of aquifers; rainwater harvesting; grey-water
         recycling, etc;
      • breadth in addressing and linking changes in human behaviour and
         technological approaches with a range of water conservation strategies in
         the context of different societies and geographical locations, etc;
      • examples of water scarcity issues and changes in human behaviour and
         technological solutions that may address these issues, etc;
      • balanced analysis evaluating the extent to which changes in human
         behaviour address water scarcity more effectively than technological
         solutions along with limitations and counterarguments, etc;
      • a conclusion that is consistent with, and supported by, analysis and
         examples given eg “although technological solutions often become
         necessary when scarcity is particularly severe, changing human behaviours
         address the root of the problem and have a more widespread affordability”;

7.   (a)   Outline the processes involved in the formation of fertile soils from bare rock.          [4 max]

           (mechanical/chemical) weathering/breaking up of parent rock producing small particles;
           deposition of sediment/eroded material (through wind/water) increasing soil depth;
           dissolving of particle material to release soluble minerals;
           colonization of parental rock/sediments by plants/animals/decomposers/pioneer
           species;
           biological/atmospheric nitrogen fixation adds available nitrogen (nitrates, ammonium) to
           soil;
           activity of mycorrhizal fungi/decomposition of dead organisms/leaf litter to release
           mineral/nutrients/organic material/humus;
           growth of mosses form mats that stabilize soils in sterile/barren ecosystems;
           earthworms/burrowing insects spread soil particles/open soil pores;
           precipitation adding water to soil;

     (b)   Explain how negative and positive feedback mechanisms may influence the
           growth of decomposer populations in the soil.                                             [7 max]

           negative feedback occurs when the output of a process inhibits or reverses the same
           process / in such a way as to reduce change/counteract deviation/maintain equilibrium;

           positive feedback occurs when the output of a process accelerates that same process
           (will tend to amplify changes) / deviate away from equilibrium / or drive the system
           toward a tipping point (adopting a new equilibrium);

           Negative feedback (occurring at carrying capacity):
           growth of decomposer populations will reduce available organic material;
           …thus leading to reduced growth in population;
           growth of decomposer population may lead to increase in predators feeding on
           decomposers;
           …thus leading to reduction in population growth;

           Positive feedback (occurring during phase of exponential growth):
           increase in number of decomposers will increase potential for reproduction;
           …thus leading to increased rate of population growth;
           increase in decomposers may favourably modify environment (eg increase
           temperature/improve soil);
           …thus leading to increased rate of population growth;

           which credit should be given.

           Do not credit simple changes in decomposer populations.

(c)   To what extent are natural limiting factors more likely than population policies to
