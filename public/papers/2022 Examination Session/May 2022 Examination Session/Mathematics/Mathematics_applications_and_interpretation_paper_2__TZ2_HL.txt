Answer all questions in the answer booklet provided. Please start each question on a new page.
Full marks are not necessarily awarded for a correct answer with no working. Answers must be
supported by working and/or explanations. Solutions found from a graphic display calculator should
be supported by suitable working. For example, if graphs are used to find a solution, you should sketch
these as part of your answer. Where an answer is incorrect, some marks may be given for a correct
method, provided this is shown by written working. You are therefore advised to show all working.

     Scott purchases food for his dog in large bags and feeds the dog the same amount of
     dog food each day. The amount of dog food left in the bag at the end of each day can be
     modelled by an arithmetic sequence.

     On a particular day, Scott opened a new bag of dog food and fed his dog. By the end of the
     third day there were 115.5 cups of dog food remaining in the bag and at the end of the eighth
     day there were 108 cups of dog food remaining in the bag.

     (a)   Find the number of cups of dog food

           (i)    fed to the dog per day;

           (ii)   remaining in the bag at the end of the first day.                                    [4]

     (b)   Calculate the number of days that Scott can feed his dog with one bag of food.              [2]

     In 2021, Scott spent $625 on dog food. Scott expects that the amount he spends on dog food
     will increase at an annual rate of 6.4 %.

     (c)   Determine the amount that Scott expects to spend on dog food in 2025. Round your
           answer to the nearest dollar.                                                               [3]

     A cafe makes x litres of coffee each morning. The cafe’s profit each morning, C , measured
     in dollars, is modelled by the following equation

     A geneticist uses a Markov chain model to investigate changes in a specific gene in a cell
     as it divides. Every time the cell divides, the gene may mutate between its normal state and
     other states.

     At an archery tournament, a particular competition sees a ball launched into the air while an
     archer attempts to hit it with an arrow.

     The path of the ball is modelled by the equation
                                                                      ​ux​
                                                               ( y         )
                                           ​(​y​)​= ​(5​ ​)​+ t​ ​​u​​− 5t​
                                              x
                                                       0

     where x is the horizontal displacement from the archer and y is the vertical displacement
     from the ground, both measured in metres, and t is the time, in seconds, since the ball
     was launched.

     y ​ux​​  is the horizontal component of the initial velocity
     y ​uy​​  is the vertical component of the initial velocity.

     In this question both the ball and the arrow are modelled as single points. The ball is launched
     with an initial velocity such that  ​ux​​= 8​  and  ​uy​​= 10​  .

     (a)   (i)	Find the initial speed of the ball.

           (ii)   Find the angle of elevation of the ball as it is launched.                                     [4]

     (b)   Find the maximum height reached by the ball.                                                          [3]

     (c)   Assuming that the ground is horizontal and the ball is not hit by the arrow, find the x
           coordinate of the point where the ball lands.                                                         [3]

     (d)   For the path of the ball, find an expression for y in terms of x .                                    [3]

     An archer releases an arrow from the point ​(0 ,  2)​. The arrow is modelled as travelling in a
     straight line, in the same plane as the ball, with speed ​60 m ​s​−1​and an angle of elevation of ​10​∘​.

     (e)   Determine the two positions where the path of the arrow intersects the path of the ball.              [4]

     (f)   Determine the time when the arrow should be released to hit the ball before the ball
           reaches its maximum height.                                                                           [4]

      An environmental scientist is asked by a river authority to model the effect of a leak from a
      power plant on the mercury levels in a local river. The variable x measures the concentration
      of mercury in micrograms per litre.

      The situation is modelled using the second order differential equation

                                                                    ​  dx ​ + 2x = 0
                                                    2
                                                  ​​  ​d​ ​x ​  + 3 ___
                                                  ___
                                                  d​t​2​        dt

      where  ​t ≥ 0​  is the time measured in days since the leak started. It is known that when
                              ​​  dx ​ = 1​.
      ​t = 0 ​, ​  x = 0​ and ___
                         dt
      (a)     Show that the system of coupled first order equations:

                                                             ​​  dx ​ = y
                                                             ___
                                                             dt
                                                        ___dy
                                                        ​​   ​ = −2x − 3y​
                                                        dt

              can be written as the given second order differential equation.                             [2]

      (b)     Find the eigenvalues of the system of coupled first order equations given in part (a).       [3]

      (c)     Hence find the exact solution of the second order differential equation.                     [5]

      (d)     Sketch the graph of x against t , labelling the maximum point of the graph with
              its coordinates.                                                                             [2]

      If the mercury levels are greater than 0.1 micrograms per litre, fishing in the river is
      considered unsafe and is stopped.

      (e)     Use the model to calculate the total amount of time when fishing should be stopped.          [3]

      The river authority decides to stop people from fishing in the river for 10 % longer than the
      time found from the model.

      (f)     Write down one reason, with reference to the context, to support this decision.              [1]
