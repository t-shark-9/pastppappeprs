                                  Instructions to Examiners

Abbreviations

M    Marks awarded for attempting to use a correct Method.

A    Marks awarded for an Answer or for Accuracy; often dependent on preceding M marks.

R    Marks awarded for clear Reasoning.

AG Answer given in the question and so no marks are awarded.

FT   Follow through. The practice of awarding marks, despite candidate errors in previous parts,
     for their correct methods/answers using incorrect results.


Using the markscheme

1    General

     Award marks using the annotations as noted in the markscheme eg M1, A2.


2    Method and Answer/Accuracy marks

     • Do not automatically award full marks for a correct answer; all working must be checked,
       and marks awarded according to the markscheme.
     • It is generally not possible to award M0 followed by A1, as A mark(s) depend on the
       preceding M mark(s), if any.
     • Where M and A marks are noted on the same line, e.g. M1A1, this usually means M1 for
       an attempt to use an appropriate method (e.g. substitution into a formula) and A1 for
       using the correct values.
     • Where there are two or more A marks on the same line, they may be awarded
       independently; so if the first value is incorrect, but the next two are correct, award
       A0A1A1.
     • Where the markscheme specifies A3, M2 etc., do not split the marks, unless there is a
       note.
     • The response to a “show that” question does not need to restate the AG line, unless a
       Note makes this explicit in the markscheme.
     • Once a correct answer to a question or part question is seen, ignore further working even
       if this working is incorrect and/or suggests a misunderstanding of the question. This will
       encourage a uniform approach to marking, with less examiner discretion. Although some
       candidates may be advantaged for that specific question item, it is likely that these
       candidates will lose marks elsewhere too.
     • An exception to the previous rule is when an incorrect answer from further working is used
       in a subsequent part. For example, when a correct exact value is followed by an incorrect
       decimal approximation in the first part and this approximation is then used in the second
       part. In this situation, award FT marks as appropriate but do not award the final A1 in the
       first part.
                                                 –4–               M22/5/MATHX/SP2/ENG/TZ1/XX/M


Examples:

     Correct        Further            Any FT issues?          Action
     answer         working seen
     seen
1.                    5.65685...        No.                     Award A1 for the final mark
       8 2           (incorrect         Last      part    in    (condone the incorrect further
                    decimal value)      question.               working)
2.      35           0.468111…          Yes.                    Award A0 for the final mark
                     (incorrect         Value is used in        (and full FT is available in
        72          decimal value)      subsequent parts.       subsequent parts)


3    Implied marks

     Implied marks appear in brackets e.g. (M1),and can only be awarded if correct work is
     seen or implied by subsequent working/answer.


4    Follow through marks (only applied after an error is made)

     Follow through (FT) marks are awarded where an incorrect answer from one part of a
     question is used correctly in subsequent part(s) (e.g. incorrect value from part (a) used in
     part (d) or incorrect value from part (c)(i) used in part (c)(ii)). Usually, to award FT marks,
     there must be working present and not just a final answer based on an incorrect answer
     to a previous part. However, if all the marks awarded in a subsequent part are for the answer
     or are implied, then FT marks should be awarded for their correct answer, even when
     working is not present.

     For example: following an incorrect answer to part (a) that is used in subsequent parts,
     where the markscheme for the subsequent part is (M1)A1, it is possible to award full marks
     for their correct answer, without working being seen. For longer questions where all but
     the answer marks are implied this rule applies but may be overwritten by a Note in the
     Markscheme.

     • Within a question part, once an error is made, no further A marks can be awarded for
       work which uses the error, but M marks may be awarded if appropriate.

     • If the question becomes much simpler because of an error then use discretion to award
       fewer FT marks, by reflecting on what each mark is for and how that maps to the simplified
       version.

     • If the error leads to an inappropriate value (e.g. probability greater than 1, sin  = 1.5 , non-
       integer value where integer required), do not award the mark(s) for the final answer(s).

     • The markscheme may use the word “their” in a description, to indicate that candidates
       may be using an incorrect value.

     • If the candidate’s answer to the initial question clearly contradicts information given in the
       question, it is not appropriate to award any FT marks in the subsequent parts. This
                                              –5–               M22/5/MATHX/SP2/ENG/TZ1/XX/M


      includes when candidates fail to complete a “show that” question correctly, and then in
      subsequent parts use their incorrect answer rather than the given value.

    • Exceptions to these FT rules will be explicitly noted on the markscheme.

    • If a candidate makes an error in one part but gets the correct answer(s) to subsequent
      part(s), award marks as appropriate, unless the command term was “Hence”.


5   Mis-read

    If a candidate incorrectly copies values or information from the question, this is a mis-read
    (MR). A candidate should be penalized only once for a particular misread. Use the MR
    stamp to indicate that this has been a misread and do not award the first mark, even if this
    is an M mark, but award all others as appropriate.
    • If the question becomes much simpler because of the MR, then use discretion to award
      fewer marks.

    • If the MR leads to an inappropriate value (e.g. probability greater than 1, sin  = 1.5 , non-
      integer value where integer required), do not award the mark(s) for the final answer(s).

    • Miscopying of candidates’ own work does not constitute a misread, it is an error.

    • If a candidate uses a correct answer, to a “show that” question, to a higher degree of
      accuracy than given in the question, this is NOT a misread and full marks may be scored
      in the subsequent part.

    • MR can only be applied when work is seen. For calculator questions with no working and
      incorrect answers, examiners should not infer that values were read incorrectly.


6   Alternative methods

    Candidates will sometimes use methods other than those in the markscheme. Unless the
    question specifies a method, other correct methods should be marked in line with the
    markscheme. If the command term is ‘Hence’ and not ‘Hence or otherwise’ then alternative
    methods are not permitted unless covered by a note in the mark scheme.

    • Alternative methods for complete questions are indicated by METHOD                         1,
      METHOD 2, etc.
    • Alternative solutions for parts of questions are indicated by EITHER . . . OR.
                                                   –6–                 M22/5/MATHX/SP2/ENG/TZ1/XX/M


7   Alternative forms

    Unless the question specifies otherwise, accept equivalent forms.

    • As this is an international examination, accept all alternative forms of notation for
      example 1.9 and 1,9 or 1000 and 1,000 and 1.000 .

    • Do not accept final answers written using calculator notation. However, M marks and
      intermediate A marks can be scored, when presented using calculator notation, provided
      the evidence clearly reflects the demand of the mark.

    • In the markscheme, equivalent numerical and algebraic forms will generally be written
      in brackets immediately following the answer.

    • In the markscheme, some equivalent answers will generally appear in brackets. Not all
      equivalent notations/answers/methods will be presented in the markscheme and
      examiners are asked to apply appropriate discretion to judge if the candidate work is
      equivalent.


8   Format and accuracy of answers

    If the level of accuracy is specified in the question, a mark will be linked to giving the answer
    to the required accuracy. If the level of accuracy is not stated in the question, the general
    rule applies to final answers: unless otherwise stated in the question all numerical answers
    must be given exactly or correct to three significant figures.

    Where values are used in subsequent parts, the markscheme will generally use the exact
    value, however candidates may also use the correct answer to 3 sf in subsequent parts.
    The markscheme will often explicitly include the subsequent values that come “from the use
    of 3 sf values”.

    Simplification of final answers: Candidates are advised to give final answers using good
    mathematical form. In general, for an A mark to be awarded, arithmetic should be completed, and
                                                                             25                     5
    any values that lead to integers should be simplified; for example,         should be written as .
                                                                             4                      2
    An exception to this is simplifying fractions, where lowest form is not required (although the
                                                                         10
    numerator and the denominator must be integers); for example,           may be left in this form or
                                                                          4
                 5            10
    written as     . However,    should be written as 2, as it simplifies to an integer.
                 2             5

    Algebraic expressions should be simplified by completing any operations such as addition and
    multiplication, e.g. 4e2 x  e3 x should be simplified to 4e5 x , and 4e2 x  e3 x − e4 x  e x should be
    simplified to 3e5 x . Unless specified in the question, expressions do not need to be factorized, nor
    do factorized expressions need to be expanded, so x ( x + 1) and x 2 + x are both acceptable.

    Please note: intermediate A marks do NOT need to be simplified.

9   Calculators

    A GDC is required for this paper, but If you see work that suggests a candidate has used
    any calculator not approved for IB DP examinations (eg CAS enabled devices), please follow
    the procedures for malpractice.


10. Presentation of candidate work

    Crossed out work: If a candidate has drawn a line through work on their examination script,
    or in some other way crossed out their work, do not award any marks for that work unless
    an explicit note from the candidate indicates that they would like the work to be marked.

    More than one solution: Where a candidate offers two or more different answers to the
    same question, an examiner should only mark the first response unless the candidate
    indicates otherwise. If the layout of the responses makes it difficult to judge, examiners
    should apply appropriate discretion to judge which is “first”.
