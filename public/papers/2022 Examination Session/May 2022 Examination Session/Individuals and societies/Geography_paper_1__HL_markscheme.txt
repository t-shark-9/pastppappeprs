Option A — Freshwater

1.   (a)   (i)   State the number of countries where more than 60 % of rural households rely on water
           from outside the home.      [1]

                  13

           (ii)   Identify the country where men and women have equal responsibility for collecting
                  water from outside the home.      [1]

                  Afghanistan

     (b)   Outline one environmental impact of increased human pressure on aquifers.         [2]

           Award [1] for a valid impact and an additional [1] for development.

           Ground subsidence [1] due to all the water having been removed/over-abstraction [1].

           Other impacts include:
           • Pollution from agricultural chemicals / industry
           • rivers/lakes drying up due to lowering of water table.


     (c)   Explain two ways in which water can be managed to provide a more sustainable future for
           local communities in countries such as these. [3+3]

           Award [1] for each way and a further [2] for development / explanation / exemplification.


           For example, pipes/sewers/water filters can be built [1] in order to separate sewage and
           drinking water [1] thereby reducing the risk of disease for future generations [1].

           Reference to sustainability is not required although it may be implied.

           Other ways include, but are not limited to:
           • recycling water
           • tube wells
           • more efficient irrigation systems
           • training local people to take responsibility for repairs
           • building dams provides irrigation water for local communities
           • alternative energy developed.
                                           –6–                  M22/3/GEOGR/BP1/ENG/TZ0/XX/M


2.   (a) Examine why geographers use a systems approach in the study of drainage basins.
     [10]

     Marks should be allocated according to the markbands.

     Drainage basins operate as open systems, in which inputs, stores, flows and outputs are
     inter-related. The relationships between these will vary depending on the characteristics of
     the drainage basin, including geology, slope, shape, and land use, and the nature of the
     inputs, including type, intensity and variability of precipitation.

     Possible applied themes (AO2) demonstrating knowledge and understanding (AO1):

     • Drainage basins function as open systems, in which inputs, stores, flows and outputs are
       inter-related. The systems approach helps us understand these interrelationships.
     • River discharge varies over time within drainage basins, and over space between different
       drainage basins, which produces knock on effects elsewhere in the system.
     • The characteristics of drainage basins, such as geology, slope, vegetation cover and land
       use will affect flows and stores, which, in turn affect discharge: e.g. permeable rocks and
       low relief will result in underground flows and stores and a more even discharge.
     • Stores may be on the surface, as lakes or wetlands, or underground as aquifers.
     • Changes in land use, such as deforestation and urbanization, will affect flows and stores,
       and in turn affect discharge.
     • The systems approach can help planners anticipate flooding and/or shortages.

     Good answers may be well structured (AO4) and may additionally offer a critical
     evaluation (AO3) of the statement in a way that examines the importance of a systems
     approach in the study of processes within a drainage basin. Another approach might be to
     examine drainage basins at different time and spatial scales, for example with changes in
     land use or climate.

     For 5–6 marks, expect weakly-evidenced outlining of a systems approach to a drainage
     basin.

     For 7–8 marks, expect a structured account that includes:
     • either evidenced explanation of why a systems approach is useful to the study of drainage
       basins
     • or a discursive conclusion (or ongoing evaluation) grounded in geographical concepts
       and/or perspectives.

     For 9–10 marks, expect both of these traits.
                                           –7–                  M22/3/GEOGR/BP1/ENG/TZ0/XX/M


2.   (b) Examine how conflicts between different stakeholders in the management of wetlands
     might be resolved. [10]

     Marks should be allocated according to the markbands.

     There are growing pressures on wetlands, and it is important that they are managed for a
     sustainable future. The focus of the response should be on the varied and often conflicting
     pressures from different stakeholders, and the future possibilities for management.

     Possible applied themes (AO2) demonstrating knowledge and understanding (AO1):
     • The importance of wetlands as major ecosystems which form a critical part of the natural
       environment: diverse ecosystems, flood control, improving water quality, carbon sinks,
       fertile farmland, recreation and tourism.
     • Increasing pressures on wetlands include: water abstraction, land drainage, chemical and
       physical pollution, eutrophication.
     • Different stakeholders at local, national and international scales, who may be in conflict,
       include: environmentalists, water management organisations, farmers, tourist
       organisations, local and national governments.
     • The purpose of management from different perspectives – e.g. biodiversity, water
       security, flood control, tourism, climate change.
     • Strategies for management of wetlands, including the roles of international
       (e.g. Ramsar Convention), national and local stakeholders.

     Good answers may be well structured (AO4) and may additionally offer a critical
     evaluation (AO3) of the statement in a way that examines the different perspectives and
     varying power of stakeholders for the future management possibilities of wetlands. Another
     approach might be to focus on how conflicts may partly depend on the scale of the issues.

     For 5–6 marks, expect weakly-evidenced outlining of at least one conflict and/or how it could
     be resolved.

     For 7–8 marks, expect a structured account that includes:
     • either an evidenced explanation of the conflicts between different stakeholders on
       wetlands including some idea of resolution.
     • or a discursive conclusion (or ongoing evaluation) grounded in geographical concepts
       and/or perspectives, examining future management possibilities.

     For 9–10 marks, expect both of these traits.

Option B — Oceans and coastal margins

3.         (a)    (i)   Identify the chokepoint with the most barrels of oil moved per day.    [1]

                  Strait of Hormuz

           (ii)   State the number of millions of barrels of oil moved per day at the Strait of Malacca
                  choke point.    [1]

                  15

     (b)   Outline one reason why the ownership of one named ocean area or territory is contested.
           [2]

           Award [1] for a valid reason and [1] for further development.

           Award maximum [1] if no example.

           For example: Spratley Islands – multiple countries claim ownership [1] because the islands
           are within their territorial waters [1].

     (c)   Suggest one political challenge and one environmental challenge associated with the
           movement of oil around the globe by sea.                                            [3+3]

           Award [1] for a political challenge and a further [2] for development/explanation
           /exemplification.

           For example, an international dispute can escalate between unfriendly countries [1] when
           one country’s tankers move through the territorial waters of the other [1] because of
           geographical features, such as narrow straits, causing choke points [1].

           Award [1] for an environmental challenge and a further [2] for
           development/explanation/exemplification.

           For example, pollution from accidental spillage/ accidents from tankers [1] causing harm to
           marine eco-systems [1] which is extremely difficult/costly and difficult to clean up as ocean
           currents disperse it over a wide area [1].

           Accept weather related conditions that may affect navigation.

4.   (a)   Examine the major threats to coral reef environments.     [10]

     Marks should be allocated according to the markbands.

     Coral reefs play a vital role in physical processes and ecosystems of coastal margins and are
     an important economic and social resource to coastal communities. Threats to coral reefs
     include the possible impacts of climate change, and increasing pressure from varying human
     activities, such as resource exploitation, over-fishing and tourism.

     Possible applied themes (AO2) demonstrating knowledge and understanding (AO1):
     • Coral reefs play a vital role in the functioning of coastal processes and ecosystems.
     • They are under increasing threat from a variety of natural and human pressures.
     • Coral reefs are very diverse ecosystems, and face multiple stresses caused by climate
       change, including rising sea levels and warmer ocean temperatures.
     • Increased acidification of the oceans poses serious threats to the growth of coral reefs,
       other marine organisms, and the marine food chain.
     • Threats from human activity include the impacts of resource exploitation (such as oil),
       over-fishing, pollution and increasing pressures from tourism.
     • These threats may cause severe damage to fragile ecosystems.
     • Coastal margins may also become more vulnerable to erosion by wave action associated
       with tropical storms.

     Good answers may be well structured (AO4) and may additionally offer a critical
     evaluation (AO3) of the statement in a way that examines a variety of threats to processes
     on coral reefs, and the different perspectives and varying power of stakeholders. Another
     approach might be to examine the scale of the threats, and how these might vary over time.

     For 5–6 marks, expect weakly-evidenced outlining of one or more threats to coral reef
     environments.

     For 7–8 marks, expect a structured account that includes:
     • either an evidenced explanation of two or more threats to coral reef environments
     • or a discursive conclusion (or ongoing evaluation) grounded in geographical concepts
       and/or perspectives, examining the different scale of the threats.

     For 9–10 marks, expect both of these traits.

4.   (b)   Examine why conflicts often develop over the commercial use of coastal margins. [10]

     Marks should be allocated according to the markbands.

     Coastal margins are under increasing threat from commercial activities, including the
     concentration of urban development, tourism and industry. As population and economic
     activity becomes increasingly concentrated in coastal areas, there is a need to conserve and
     manage vulnerable landscapes and ecosystems.

     Possible applied themes (AO2) demonstrating knowledge and understanding (AO1):
     • Coastal margins under increasing stress from commercial activities such as retailing,
       industry, fishing, waste disposal and tourism.
     • Different stakeholders will have varying, and sometimes conflicting, priorities over
       development of coastal margins.
     • Strategies for coastal protection from increased erosion and flooding may cause conflict
       between stakeholders.
     • Conservation strategies to protect vulnerable coastal ecosystems may also cause conflict.
     • Conflicts between stakeholders may be difficult to resolve: eg tourism and commercial
       development; conservationists; local peoples.

     Good answers may be well structured (AO4) and may additionally offer a critical
     evaluation (AO3) of the statement in a way that examines a variety of conflicts between
     stakeholders, and the different perspectives and varying power of stakeholders. Another
     approach might be to examine the scale of the threats, and the outcomes for different
     stakeholders.

     For 5–6 marks, expect weakly-evidenced outlining of at least one conflict developing from
     commercial use of coastal margins.

     For 7–8 marks, expect a structured account that includes:
     • either an evidenced explanation of two or more conflicts developing from commercial use
       of coastal margins
     • or a discursive conclusion (or ongoing evaluation) grounded in geographical concepts
       and/or perspectives, examining the outcomes for stakeholders.

     For 9–10 marks, expect both of these traits.

Option C — Extreme environments

5.         (a)    (i)  Estimate the desalination capacity of the United States, in thousands of cubic
                  metres per day. [1]

                  2800 (allow 2700-2900).

           (ii)   State the country shown on the map with the smallest desalination capacity.      [1]

                  Chile

     (b)   Outline one reason why some semi-arid areas with low annual rainfall are considered
           to be extreme environments.                                                                   [2]

           Award [1] for a valid reason and [1] for further development.

           For example: Water scarcity [1] creates problems for arable or settled farming [1].
           (Do not accept lack of water without further development.)

           Other possibilities include:
           • seasonal water shortages
           • flash flooding
           • although annual rainfall is low it can still be extreme/intense periodically
           • lack of access to freshwater.

     (c)   Explain two ways in which solar power can help the sustainable development of
           communities in hot, arid areas such as these. [3+3]

           In each case, award [1] for the way solar power can help and up to [2] for further
           development/explanation/exemplification.


           For example: The use of solar power provides energy for desalinisation plants [1] which
           increases water supply allowing sedentary farming [1] which can sustainably support a larger
           population [1].

           Other ways may include:
           • social development – bringing electricity to remote villages – education / internet
           • economic development – exporting energy to other countries
           • climatically controlled greenhouses / irrigation / wells
           • removing reliance on non-renewable fuels.

6.   (a) Examine the possible long-term challenges associated with tourism in one or more
     types of cold environment. [10]

     Marks should be allocated according to the markbands.

     The focus of the response should be on tourism in different types of cold environment:
     including ice sheets, glaciers and permafrost in high altitude mountain regions, and high
     latitudes. Some long-term challenges will be similar for different types of environment, while
     others might be unique. Challenges might be physical, economic and social. Local and global
     stakeholders may be involved in the management of these long-term challenges for a
     sustainable future.

     Possible applied themes (AO2) demonstrating knowledge and understanding (AO1):
     • Challenges might include pressure on local resources, such as landscapes, water supply,
       and timber: exceeding carrying capacities and environmental degradation.
     • Pressures on fragile ecosystems in cold environments: destruction of natural vegetation,
       wildlife and habitats.
     • Environmental pollution by tourist activities, e.g. waste disposal in oceans and on land; air,
       noise and visual pollution.
     • Economic challenges include: accessibility, isolation and difficult terrain; land ownership;
       conflicts between national/international tour operators and local people — economic
       leakage.
     • Social challenges might include conflicts between locals and tourists.
     • Climate change (and associated warming) is a long term challenge.
     • Consideration could be given as to how these challenges might be managed by different
       stakeholders for a sustainable future.
     • There may be international and local agreements regarding the creation of protected
       areas and national parks, the development of “green tourism” and ecotourism.

     Good answers may be well structured (AO4) and may additionally offer a critical
     evaluation (AO3) of the statement in a way that examines the variety of long-term
     challenges in different places and scales. Another approach might be to examine the varying
     perspectives and varying power of stakeholders for possibilities of future management.

     For 5–6 marks, expect weakly-evidenced outlining of one or more challenges associated
     with tourism in a cold environment

     For 7–8 marks, expect a well-structured account that includes:
     • either an evidenced explanation of a variety of long-term challenges associated with
       tourism in one or more types of cold environment
     • or a discursive conclusion (or ongoing evaluation) grounded in geographical concepts
       and/or perspectives.

     For 9–10 marks, expect both of these traits.

6.   (b) Examine the importance of wind in the development of two or more hot, arid
     landscape features. [10]

     Marks should be allocated according to the markbands.

     Both wind and water are involved in the formation of desert landscapes, although their
     relative importance varies from place to place and over different time scales, including the
     effects of possible climatic change on processes. Despite the popular image of deserts as
     being dominated by extensive sand seas and dunes, wind often plays a relatively minor role
     in landform development in many desert regions.

     Possible applied themes (AO2) demonstrating knowledge and understanding (AO1):
     • Understanding of the relative importance of processes of wind erosion, transportation and
       deposition in the formation of landscape features.
     • These include: different dune systems, rock pedestals, yardangs, zeugen, deflation
       hollows and desert pavements.
     • Wind processes are important where there is little vegetation cover, very little water, and a
       plentiful supply of sand.
     • Wind is only able to transport fine particles, mainly very close to the ground surface, in
       suspension in the air, or close to the ground by saltation and creep.
     • Wind deposition may lead to the formation of different types of dune systems, such as
       barchans and seifs, which may form part of large sand seas.
     • Wind erosion is most effective close to the ground, as abrasion and sand blasting. This
       may result in the formation of distinctive rock pedestals, yardangs and zeugen. However,
       water may also be important in their formation.
     • Wind erosion in the development of large deflation hollows, and desert pavements, where
       the selective removal of sand leaves larger rock fragments as a lag deposit.
     • On a smaller scale, wind abrasion may result in polished and pitted rock surfaces, forming
       features such as ventifacts.
     • The relative importance of wind and water in the formation of arid landscapes should be
       considered, especially in the formation of many large features, such as wadis, mesas and
       buttes, and inselbergs.

     Good answers may be well-structured (AO4) and may additionally offer a critical
     evaluation (AO3) of the statement in a way that reaches an evidenced judgment regarding
     the importance of wind processes in landscape development. Another approach might be to
     examine the relative importance of different processes over varying time scales and places.

     For 5–6 marks, expect weakly-evidenced outlining of the importance / relative importance of
     wind in the formation of at least two landscape features


     For 7–8 marks, expect a well-structured account that includes:
     • either an evidenced explanation of the importance / relative importance of wind in the
       development of two or more landscape features
     • or a discursive conclusion (or ongoing evaluation) grounded in geographical concepts
       and/or perspectives, perhaps considering the relative importance of wind compared to
       other processes.

     For 9–10 marks, expect both of these traits.

Option D — Geophysical hazards

7.         (a)    (i)   Identify the location of the earthquake event with the highest magnitude.        [1]

                  Indian Ocean

           (ii)   State the number of deaths caused by the earthquake event in the USA.           [1]

                  Accept answers between 130–160

     (b)   Outline one reason why high-magnitude earthquake events do not occur very often.                    [2]

           Award [1] a valid reason and [1] for development.

           For example, it takes a long time for sufficient tension to build between plates [1]
           in order to generate the higher amounts of energy to be released in a high-magnitude
           earthquake event [1].

           (c)    Explain how the risk to a community from earthquake events such as these might be
                  affected by:

                  (i)   the age structure of its population;                                                   [3]

                        Award [1] for a basic link between a valid population factor and some aspect of
                        vulnerability/risk (such as preparedness, resilience, response) and up to [2] for
                        further development/exemplification.

                        For example, a population with a higher proportion of elderly people has greater
                        vulnerability [1] as earthquakes /tsunamis are sudden events with little warning
                        time [1] with insufficient time for people with limited mobility to reach higher
                        ground (tsunami) [1].

                         It is acceptable that different aspects of the age structure (elderly / youthful) can
                        be discussed rather than focusing on just one segment of the population.

                        Other factors include:
                        • vulnerable to injury eg falling masonry
                        • vulnerability to secondary hazards eg spread if disease
                        • older population may have greater perception of the hazard and are better
                          prepared eg survival kits
                        • very young / old are more likely to be at home.

(ii)   political factors (governance of the country).                                      [3]

       Award [1] for a basic link between a valid political factor and some aspect of
       vulnerability/risk (such as preparedness, resilience, response) and up to [2] for
       further development/exemplification.

       For example, governments have put in place effective communications to warn
       their people about earthquake risks [1] for example, United States Geological
       Survey (USGS) providing information to the Californian people about the
       San Andreas fault [1] thereby prompting citizens to take steps to increase
       their resilience [1].

       Other factors include legislation for:
       • land zoning
       • education
       • building controls
       • availability and readiness of emergency personnel.

8.   (a) Examine the severity of the impacts of different types of mass movement on human
     well-being. [10]

     Marks should be allocated according to the markbands.

     Human well-being is a broad concept, which can be measured in a variety of different ways.
     It includes social factors, morbidity and mortality rates, health, education, human rights,
     access to resources (food, shelter, water) and employment, and quality of life. Different types
     of mass movement include fast/slow, solid/loose: such as landslides, rockslides, debris or
     mud flows

     Possible applied themes (AO2) demonstrating knowledge and understanding (AO1):
     • Human well-being is a broad concept, including social factors, such as health, education,
       access to resources and quality of life, economic and political factors.
     • Different types of mass movement include: landslides, rockslides, debris or mud flows.
     • Mass movement can have significant economic, social and health impacts, including —
       morbidity and mortality rates, deaths and injuries.
     • The severity of the impact on human well-being will partly depend on the type of mass
       movement and will vary spatially between different places.
     • The severity may be considered in terms of long and short-term impacts.

     Good answers may be well-structured (AO4) and may additionally offer a critical
     evaluation (AO3) of the statement in a way that reaches an evidenced judgment regarding
     the importance of different types and processes of mass movement in affecting human well-
     being in different places. Another approach might be to examine the severity of the impacts
     in terms of different time scales (long and short term).

     For 5–6 marks, expect weakly-evidenced outlining of the impact of at least one type of mass
     movement on human well-being.

     For 7–8 marks, expect a well-structured account that includes:
     • either an evidenced explanation of the severity of impacts of two or more types of mass
       movement on human well-being
     • or a discursive conclusion (or ongoing evaluation) grounded in geographical concepts
       and/or perspectives, perhaps considering severity at different time scales.

     For 9–10 marks, expect both of these traits.

8.   (b) Examine the effectiveness of technology and planning strategies in reducing human
     vulnerability to volcanic hazards. [10]

     Marks should be allocated according to the markbands.

     Increasing numbers of people are living in areas of hazardous volcanic activity, especially
     near destructive plate margins associated with violent, explosive volcanoes. People may be
     especially vulnerable to the destructive effects of rapid flows of lava and pyroclastics, and
     large-scale ash falls. Management strategies involving the use of planning and technology
     might contribute to the reduction of human vulnerability to volcanic hazards.

     Possible applied themes (AO2) demonstrating knowledge and understanding (AO1):
     • Technologies might be used to predict future volcanic eruptions, including monitoring of
       volcanic activity, seismic and crater monitoring surveys; GPS surveys to measure
       changes in shape of volcanoes, and monitoring of movements in the magma chamber.
     • Other technological strategies might include: improving telecommunications (SMS
       messages) to give warnings of possible eruptions.
     • Planning strategies could include mapping of volcanic areas to produce hazard-zone
       maps; land use zoning.
     • Education and drills to warn and inform people what to do in case of an eruption;
       evacuation plans.
     • Planning and technologies to locate and rescue survivors, and rehabilitation plans for the
       aftermath of an eruption.
     • The effectiveness of these strategies will depend partly on levels of economic
       development, and on the perception of the hazard by local people and other stakeholders.

     Good answers may be well-structured (AO4) and may additionally offer a critical
     evaluation (AO3) of the statement in a way that reaches an evidenced judgment regarding
     the effectiveness of different strategies, and the power of different stakeholders in reducing
     vulnerability. Another approach might be to consider effectiveness in terms of the scale of
     hazard events in different places.

     For 5–6 marks, expect weakly-evidenced outlining of technological and/or planning
     strategies.

     For 7–8 marks, expect a well-structured account that includes:
     • either an evidenced explanation of the effectiveness of technology and planning strategies
       in reducing human vulnerability
     • or a discursive conclusion (or ongoing evaluation) grounded in geographical concepts
       and/or perspectives, discussing the relative effectiveness of strategies.

     For 9–10 marks, expect both of these traits.

Option E — Leisure, tourism and sport

9.         (a) Using the photograph, identify two characteristics of this area that may reduce
           accessibility for visiting football supporters. [1+1]

           Award [1] for each characteristic inferred or identified.

           Possibilities include:
           • parking-no parking spaces shown
           • congestion-narrow streets
           • lack of main road / railway / public transport.

     (b)   Outline one reason why some city stadiums have a large sphere of influence.            [2]

           Award [1] for a valid reason relating to the sports or leisure hierarchy and [1] for
           development/explanation/exemplification.

           For example: The team that plays there has a high status [1] people are prepared to travel
           long distances to see them play [1].

           Other possibilities include:
           • city is well-connected therefore people can travel from long distances
           • stadium is used for other events eg music festivals attracting international visitors.

           (c)   Suggest how large numbers of visitors in an area such as this could have:

                 (i)    one positive economic impact for local communities;[3]

                        Award [1] for a valid impact and up to [2] for development / explanation
                        /exemplification.

                        For example, employment opportunities [1] as a result of multiplier effects built
                        around the stadium eg catering jobs [1] providing long term economic
                        sustainability [1].

                        Other impacts include:
                        • improved transport leading to more visitor spending
                        • increased income to local businesses

                 (ii)   one negative economic impact for local communities.                                 [3]

                        Award [1] for a valid impact and up to [2] for development/ explanation/
                        exemplification.

                        For example: rental prices for houses increase due to Airbnb [1] placing them
                        beyond reach of some local people [1] resulting economic costs of relocating
                        elsewhere [1].

                        Other possibilities include:
                        • increased costs for security / police / waste management
                        • increased congestion increases cost of transport
                        • TNCs are attracted to such venues and may take income away from local
                          businesses.

10.   (a) Examine why views may differ on the benefits of tourism as a development strategy.
      [10]

      Marks should be allocated according to the markbands.

      There has been a rapid growth in international tourism, especially to low-income countries.
      Tourism is an important area of economic policy in many countries, stimulating domestic
      growth and improving international links. However, there is debate regarding the benefits of
      tourism in economic and social development, and its impact on local cultures.

      Possible applied themes (AO2) demonstrating knowledge and understanding (AO1):
      • Rapid growth of international tourism, especially towards low income countries; facilitated
        by rising living standards, growth in communications, and the power of transnational
        corporations (TNCs).
      • Economic advantages might include: earning of foreign currency, growth in gross national
        product (GNP), development of infrastructure (airports, roads, hotels and resorts),
        increased employment, rise in living standards.
      • Tourist industry may be dominated by foreign TNCs; leakage of profits; tourism develops
        in small enclaves (core-periphery); employment may be low skilled, poorly paid and
        seasonal.
      • Cultural impacts might include: increasing pressure of numbers in areas of
        historical/archaeological/scenic importance, resulting in degradation; need for effective
        management.
      • Increasing “westernization” of culture; problems relating to crime, drugs and prostitution.
      • Views regarding the benefits of tourism will vary between different stakeholders, from local
        to national and international.

      Good answers may be well-structured (AO4) and may additionally offer a critical
      evaluation (AO3) of the statement in a way that reaches an evidenced judgment regarding
      the benefits of tourism as a development strategy. Views regarding possible benefits of
      tourism will differ between stakeholders in different places, and processes operating at
      different scales.

      For 5–6 marks, expect weakly-evidenced outlining of one or more benefits of tourism.

      For 7–8 marks, expect a well-structured account that includes:
      • either an evidenced explanation of varying viewpoints concerning the benefits of tourism
        as a development strategy
      • or a discursive conclusion (or ongoing evaluation) grounded in geographical concepts
        and/or perspectives.

      For 9–10 marks, expect both of these traits.

10.   (b) Examine the influence of cultural and political factors on participation in sport at
      varying scales. [10]

      Marks should be allocated according to the markbands.

      Political and cultural influences are important in the increasing participation in international
      sports by different individuals and societies, for example in the Paralympics and the
      increasing participation by people of different gender. The globalization of sport has resulted
      in increased participation by all groups in society.

      Possible applied themes (AO2) demonstrating knowledge and understanding (AO1):
      • The growing importance of international sporting events, including the Paralympics, with
        increased numbers of athletes participating from different countries.
      • Political influences include training facilities and support by national governments; pride
        and prestige for governments to host international events, construction of facilities to host
        international events.
      • Cultural influences include: changing public attitudes towards disabilities; changing gender
        roles and the increasing high profile of female participation in sports.
      • Many countries (especially low income) are poorly represented in international sport,
        partly due to high cost and lack of funding. Discrimination remains a major issue in
        many countries.

      Good answers may be well-structured (AO4) and may additionally offer a critical
      evaluation (AO3) of the statement in a way that shows understanding of cultural and political
      factors affecting participation, and that these may differ between places and at various
      spatial scales. Another approach might be to evaluate the temporal scale over which political
      and cultural factors view may differ.

      For 5–6 marks, expect weakly-evidenced outlining of at least one political and/or cultural
      factor.

      For 7–8 marks, expect a well-structured account that includes:
      • either an evidenced explanation of a range of political and cultural factors affecting
        participation in sport at different scales
      • or a discursive conclusion (or ongoing evaluation) grounded in geographical concepts
        and/or perspectives.

      For 9–10 marks, expect both of these traits.

Option F — Food and health

11.         (a)    (i)   State the age group which had the highest incidence of dengue fever in 2012.
                   [1]

                   55–59

            (ii)   Estimate the mean incidence rate of dengue fever for all years in
                   the 20–24 age group. [1]

                   6.2 (allow 6 to 6.4)

      (b)   Outline one strategy used to limit the spread of a water-borne disease.         [2]

            Award [1] for the strategy and a further [1] for development/explanation.

            For example, only use safe (boiled/bottled) water [1], to ensure that disease is not
            transmitted by drinking potentially infected water [1].

      (c)   Explain how using genetically modified organisms (GMOs) to increase food production
            can lead to:

            (i)    one environmental disadvantage; [3]

                   Award [1] for a valid disadvantage and up to [2] for further development /
                   exemplification.

                   For example: potential loss of biodiversity/ depletion of wildlife [1] due to the
                   extensive use of herbicides to cultivate GMOs [1] for example, the use of
                   glyphosate/RoundUp as an herbicide could cause the decline of the monarch
                   butterfly [1].

                   Other possible environmental disadvantages include:
                   • pressure on water resources/ depletion of groundwater supplies, due to need
                     for irrigation for GMOs
                   • decrease in resilience to issues such as drought and insect infestation; due to
                     lack of bio-diversity in GMO crops
                   • the “out-crossing” of GM crops with wild relatives, and the potential to create
                     new weeds.

(ii)   one social disadvantage.                                                              [3]

       Award [1] for a valid disadvantage, and up to [2] for further development/
       exemplification.

       For example: population health issues [1] GMOs may increase resistance to
       anti-biotics [1], due to the manipulation of genes in a laboratory environment [1].

       Other possible social disadvantages include:
       • possible increased risk of cancer; because the disease is caused by mutations
         in DNA, it is dangerous to introduce new genes into the body
       • rise in inequality between rich and poor farmers, as poor are unable to afford
         high cost of inputs required by GMOs
       • debt reduces farmers spending on health/education as farmers borrow
         money for high input costs of GMOs (seeds/fertilizer/irrigation) so have to
         cut back elsewhere.

12.   (a) Examine how food production systems can use water and energy more sustainably.
      [10]

      Marks should be allocated according to the markbands.

      The sustainability of food production systems can be assessed by consideration of their
      energy efficiency and water footprints. The water footprint is the volume of freshwater used in
      the production of food; a measure developed to address issues relating to water security and
      sustainable water use. Energy efficiency measures the amount of energy input to a farming
      system compared with output.

      Possible applied themes (AO2) demonstrating knowledge and understanding (AO1):
      • The sustainable use of water can be measured by the water footprint — the volume of
        freshwater used in the production of food. The size of the water footprint varies between
        different animal and crop production systems.
      • The intensification of farming has resulted in increased demands for water and an
        increase in the water footprint.
      • The increase in agricultural demands for water may result in the need to use water more
        efficiently and reduce waste using strategies such as drip irrigation, re-using water,
        rainwater harvesting.
      • Energy efficiency measures the input of energy into a farming system compared with
        outputs of food yield and quantity.
      • Where energy inputs, such as in labour, machinery, pesticides and fertilizers are greater
        than the energy in food produced, the system may be unsustainable.
      • In order to be more sustainable, energy inputs need to reduce, and outputs need to
        increase eg using alternative energy sources, or reducing high energy consuming inputs,
        such as machinery.
      • Increasing commercialization and capital-intensity of farm systems, with higher energy
        inputs, may result in unsustainable production.

      Good answers may be well-structured (AO4) and may additionally offer a critical
      evaluation (AO3) of the statement in a way that shows understanding of how water and
      energy can be used more sustainably in agricultural processes and systems in different
      places. Another approach might be to consider the power and perspectives of different
      stakeholders.

      For 5–6 marks, expect weakly-evidenced outlining of the sustainable use of water and/or
      energy in food production systems.

      For 7–8 marks, expect a well-structured account that includes:
      • either an evidenced explanation of how water and energy can be used more sustainably
        in different food production systems
      • or a discursive conclusion (or ongoing evaluation) grounded in geographical concepts
        and/or perspectives.

      For 9–10 marks, expect both of these traits.
                                            – 24 –                M22/3/GEOGR/BP1/ENG/TZ0/XX/M


12.   (b) Examine how different stakeholders influence the diets of individuals and societies.
      [10]

      Marks should be allocated according to the markbands.

      The diet of different communities concerns the type and amount of food consumed and has a
      direct influence on people’s health and well-being. The diets of individuals and societies can
      be influenced by a variety of different stakeholders, at varying scales. These include
      transnational corporations (TNCs) — for example, agribusiness, supermarkets and fast-food
      outlets — international food organizations (eg Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO)), and
      governments. At a more local scale, the roles of doctors, teachers and family members are
      important.

      Possible applied themes (AO2) demonstrating knowledge and understanding (AO1):
      • A variety of stakeholders influence people’s diets, from international to local.
      • TNCs have a strong influence on food production and supply through fast-food outlets and
        supermarkets. The food chain, from supplier to consumer is dominated by a few TNCs,
        who have a large influence on diets.
      • International organisations, such as the FAO and World Health Organization (WHO) also
        play a large role in influencing diets.
      • The role of the media is significant, either through advertising for TNCs, or through
        educating people to consume a balanced diet and healthy lifestyle.
      • National governments play a role in advising about diets, and their views/policies are
        transmitted to people through doctors, health workers and teachers.
      • At a local scale, community groups and family members may influence the diets of other
        individuals.

      Good answers may be well-structured (AO4) and may additionally offer a critical
      evaluation (AO3) of the statement in a way that shows understanding of the power and
      perspectives of different stakeholders. These may vary between different places and spatial
      and temporal scales.

      For 5–6 marks, expect weakly-evidenced outlining of the influence of one or more
      stakeholders on the diets of people.

      For 7–8 marks, expect a well-structured account that includes:
      • either an evidenced explanation of the influence and perspectives of a variety of different
        stakeholders
      • or a discursive conclusion (or ongoing evaluation) grounded in geographical concepts
        and/or perspectives.

      For 9–10 marks, expect both of these traits.

Option G — Urban environments

13.         (a)    (i)   Identify the state highway located in grid reference 6105. [1]

                   6A

            (ii)   State one physical reason for the location of the airport to the east of Frankton
                   (Queenstown Airport). [1]

                   Accept any possible physical reason such as:

                   Flat land [1] / prevailing winds [1] / orientation of valleys [1]


      (b)   Outline one reason why land values are higher in some parts of an urban area.        [2]

            Award [1] for the reason and [1] for development/explanation.

            For example: many people want to live by the coast due to the nice view [1] so demand
            drives up prices [1].

            Other possible factors (these may or may not relate to the map) include:
            • proximity to the city centre / CBD
            • transport
            • access
            • physical factors such as flat land
            • planning decisions may limit development.

      (c)   Explain two challenges associated with making infrastructure improvements in urban
            settlements such as Queenstown. [3+3]

            For each one, award [1] for the challenge, and up to [2] for explanation, development and/or
            exemplification.

            For example: provision of a new airport runway may require the use of existing residential
            areas [1] involving the resettlement / out migration of residents [1] possibly leading to urban
            sprawl if new suburbs are to be built [1].

            Other challenges include:
            • older infrastructure
            • site restrictions – two entirely different ones are acceptable.
            • community unwillingness / pressure groups eg environmental
            • planning restrictions / loss of countryside.

14.   (a) Examine the strengths and weaknesses of resilient city design as a way of managing
      climatic challenges. [10]

      Marks should be allocated according to the markbands.

      Climatic challenges to urban areas occur at both the macro and local scale, long and short
      term. They include challenges from global climatic change, including secondary impacts such
      as rising sea levels and increasing frequency and intensity of storms. At the local scale,
      increasing air pollution poses a serious threat to the environment, human health and
      increasing death rates. The local heat island effect might also intensify. Strategies to manage
      escalating climatic risks include adopting resilient city design. Resilient cities are cities that
      have the ability to absorb, recover and prepare for future shocks, especially challenges
      associated with climate change.

      Possible applied themes (AO2) demonstrating knowledge and understanding (AO1):
      • Challenges include global warming, resulting in rising sea levels, increased storm activity
        and flooding, especially in low-lying coastal cities.
      • Man-made climate challenges include increased air pollution and heat island effects,
        causing serious health issues and possible death.
      • Strength of resilient city design include equipping cities to face future climate challenges.
        For example, improved flood defences; land-use zoning; strategies to improve air quality.
        Cities become more sustainable, and better-suited to face future climate shocks.
      • Increased provision of open space; conservation and enhancement of natural systems.
      • Weaknesses include high economic costs in modifying infrastructure; rapid growth of
        population, and low incomes, in some cities makes it difficult to enact to design principles.

      Good answers may be well-structured (AO4) and may additionally offer a critical
      evaluation (AO3) of the statement in a way that shows understanding of how the principles
      of resilient city design can be used to manage climatic challenges, and illustrates the power
      and different perspectives of stakeholders. Another approach might be to consider how the
      challenges and their management might vary between different places, at varying levels of
      development, or at different timescales.

      For 5–6 marks, expect weakly-evidenced outlining of at least one resilient city design to
      manage a climatic challenge.

      For 7–8 marks, expect a well-structured account that includes:
      • either an evidenced explanation of the strengths and weaknesses of resilient city design in
        managing climatic challenges
      • or a discursive conclusion grounded in geographical concepts and/or perspectives,
        evaluating the strengths and weaknesses of resilient city design.

      For 9–10 marks, expect both of these traits.

14.   (b) Examine why social deprivation occurs for different reasons in urban areas at varying
      stages of development.   [10]

      Marks should be allocated according to the markbands

      Urban social deprivation includes increasing levels of poverty, low living standards, poor
      health, low educational attainment, and poor access to resources. Deprivation occurs in all
      urban areas, in countries at varying levels of economic development. The causes of
      deprivation are often difficult to determine. It is often associated with high unemployment and
      rising crime levels. Urban deprivation is concentrated in particular areas of cities, including
      inner-city and outer-city housing estates and areas of informal housing.

      Possible applied themes (AO2) demonstrating knowledge and understanding (AO1):
      • Urban social deprivation includes: poverty and low living standards; lack of access to
        resources, low provision of health care and education; high crime rates.
      • Social deprivation is concentrated in particular areas of cities.
      • There is an increasing divide between “rich” and “poor” areas in cities, and increasing
        social and economic inequalities.
      • Management of deprivation involves perspectives of different stakeholders, including
        national and local governments, city planners, and local residents.
      • Causes of social deprivation may differ between urban areas at varying stages of
        development.
      • Low income countries have rapidly growing populations, resulting in low quality housing,
        shanty towns and high levels of unemployment and poverty.
      • In high income countries the deprivation may be on a smaller scale, and concentrated in
        specific areas of a city. Deprivation linked to poor housing and low income levels may be
        caused by factors such as closure of traditional industries and planning policies.

      Good answers may be well-structured (AO4) and may additionally offer a critical
      evaluation (AO3) of the statement in a way that shows evidenced judgment of the processes
      causing social deprivation in different urban places. Another approach might be to consider
      the power and perspectives of different stakeholders.

      For 5–6 marks, expect weakly-evidenced outlining of one or more reasons for urban social
      deprivation.

      For 7–8 marks, expect a well-structured account that includes:
      • either an evidenced explanation of a variety of different reasons for social deprivation in
        two or more cities at different stages of development
      • or a discursive conclusion (or ongoing evaluation) grounded in geographical concepts
        and/or perspectives.

      For 9–10 marks, expect both of these traits.
