Notes for examiners:

1. Use the question-specific markscheme together with the markbands. Award up to the
maximum marks as indicated.
2. Whenever relevant, carry over marks must be awarded. If a candidate makes an error in
calculation, but then uses the incorrect figure appropriately and accurately in later question
parts, then the candidate may be fully rewarded. This is the “own-figure rule” and you should put
OFR on the script where you are rewarding this.
3. A candidate may be penalized for not rounding correctly, failing to give answers correct to 2
dp or, in some cases, for not including the appropriate units. However, a candidate may only be
penalized ONCE for each type of error across all subparts of (b) questions.

(b)   (i)     Using information from Table 1, calculate North Macedonia’s annual rates of
              inflation between 2016 and 2019.                                                          [2]

              Inflation in 2017:
              [(110.9 – 109.4)/109.4] x 100 = 1.37%

              Inflation in 2018:
              [(112.5 – 110.9)/110.9] x 100 = 1.44%

              Inflation in 2019:
              [(113.4 – 112.5)/112.5] x 100 = 0.8%

              Award [1] for any valid working but incorrect inflation rates calculated or for figures
              rounded to less than 2 dp or figures without the % sign.

              Award [2] for correct inflation rates (with or without workings).

      (ii)    Using your answer to part (b)(i), identify the year disinflation sets in.                 [1]

              Award [1] for identifying 2019 as the year disinflation sets in (“after 2018” or
              “between 2018 and 2019” are also valid answers).

              OFR applies.

      (iii)   Using information from Text A, paragraph 4, calculate North Macedonia’s
              balance of trade in 2018.                                                                 [2]

Command term
“Discuss” requires candidates to offer a considered and balanced review that
includes a range of arguments, factors, or hypotheses. Opinions or conclusions
should be presented clearly and supported by appropriate evidence.

Responses may include:
• The impact on the unemployment rate may be mixed:
      o it could be argued that the inflows of FDI (Text A, paragraph 2; Table 2) and
         greater exports to the EU could lead to job creation.
      o The lower wages may attract EU firms which may help reduce the high
         unemployment rate (Text A, paragraph 6; Table 2).
      o Jobs may be lost in the agricultural sector (Text C) which still employs 16%
         of the population (Text A, paragraph 5).
      o Funds from the EU have helped increase access to education and workers’
         training which could help reduce the skills mismatch (text B, paragraph 4)
         and hence reduce the high (structural) unemployment rate (Text A,
         paragraph 6).
• The impact on economic growth:
      o the increase in trade could close the current account (balance of trade)
         deficit (Table 2, answer to b(ii)), lead to increase in AD and hence actual
         growth.
      o more trade may raise efficiency in North Macedonia through increased
         competition, economies of scale from larger markets, and improved
         resource allocation
      o it could be argued that trade may not increase significantly since North
         Macedonia is already enjoying free trade with the EU over most goods and
         services (Text C).
      o as North Macedonia currently suffers a deficit in the balance of trade (Text
         A, paragraph 4, answer to b(ii)) and a current account deficit (Table 2), the
         removal of quotas may worsen its balance of trade position and could lead
         to a fall in AD.
      o the various supply-side policies needed to meet the requirements for EU
         membership have allowed potential growth and kept the inflation rate low
         (Table 1).
      o the net FDI inflow throughout the 4-year period (Table 2) reflects potential
         growth.
• Access to seaports would be easier since North Macedonia is landlocked (Text A,
  paragraph 1). This would further attract investment.
• The free movement of labour which comes with the common market may worsen
  the emigration problem and contribute to a ‘brain drain’ problem (Text A,
  paragraph 6).
• The EU is providing North Macedonia with financial assistance to finance supply-
  side policies, which will allow them to become more globally competitive (Text B,
  paragraph 1).
• Increased trade with the EU has allowed for diversification (Text B, paragraph 4)
  and the growth of the manufacturing sector (Text A, paragraph 5).
• Once North Macedonia no longer receives financial assistance from the EU, it
  may have difficulties financing government expenditure.
• The removal of quotas may have some impact on the local agricultural sector
  (Text C) which could worsen the incidence of poverty (Text A, paragraph 6) and
  lead to over-reliance on other countries for food security since North Macedonia
  is already a net importer of food (Text C).
• As a member of the EU common market, North Macedonia will continue to have
  unrestricted access to imported capital goods, enhancing productivity and
  potential growth (Text A, paragraph 4).
                                                – 12 –              M22/3/ECONO/SP2/ENG/TZ0/XX/M


           • North Macedonia will have to adopt EU external tariffs which may negatively
             impact its trade position with non-members (3 neighbouring countries are not part
             of the common market - Text A, paragraph 1).
           • The repatriation of foreign firms’ profits (Text A, paragraph 3) may lead to a
             worsening of the balance of payments and a shortage of financial capital.
           • There could be a loss of sovereignty as North Macedonia will need to give
             unrestricted access to EU firms which have already invested in essential services
             (Text A, paragraph 3)
           • Compliance with EU standards for environmental protection could lead to less
             pollution and an improved quality of life (Text B, paragraph 3).
           • Greater competition due to exposure to foreign firms may lead to innovation.

           Examiners should be aware that candidates may take a different approach which,
           if appropriate, should be rewarded.


2.   (a)   (i)   Define the term gross domestic product (GDP) indicated in bold in the text

(b)   (i)    Using the information in Table 3, calculate the change in Sierra Leone’s
             current account balance from 2017 to 2018.                                      [3]

             Current account balance in 2017 = 974 – 1796 – 101 + 400 = –523 [1]
             Current account balance in 2018 = 714 – 1603 – 112 + 324 = –677 [1]
             Change = (–677 –(–523)) = -(US)$154 million [1]

             An answer of –(US)$154 million or “a wider deficit (US)$154 million” without
             workings is sufficient for [1].

             OFR applies provided at least one of the current account balances is correct.

      (ii)   Using the information in Table 3, calculate Sierra Leone’s rate of economic
             growth between 2017 and 2018.                                                   [2]

             (3617 – 3497)/3497 x 100% [1]

             Any valid working should be rewarded with [1]

             = 3.43% [1]

             Award [1] for the correct economic growth rate without workings or without
             the % sign or for a figure rounded to less than 2 dp.

Command term
“Evaluate” requires candidates to make an appraisal by weighing up the
strengths and limitations. Opinions and conclusions should be presented clearly
and supported with appropriate evidence and sound argument.

Responses may include:
• a definition of economic growth.
• a definition of economic development.
• an explanation of the sources of economic growth and development.
• an explanation of the link between economic growth and development.

Budget deficit (Text D, paragraph 7)
• The government has reduced the budget deficit, and this will slow the increase
  in the government debt, reducing the future debt burden (Text D, paragraph
  7).
• The reduction in the budget deficit could mean that there will be less
  government spending on social welfare negatively impacting economic
  development.
• The government maintains a budget deficit and this could have an
  expansionary impact on AD, leading to economic growth since injections
  (government spending) remain higher than withdrawals (taxes). Economic
  growth may lead to development.
• The government is still borrowing from banks and this leads to crowding out
  (Text F, paragraph 1). However, this would not affect foreign investment.

Removal of fuel subsidy (Text D, paragraph 5)
• This will have a disproportionate impact on those in poverty who are already
  adversely affected by the high inflation rate (Text D, paragraph 5).
• This may lead to cost-push inflation.
• It will help reduce government spending and close the budget deficit (Text D,
  paragraph 7)
• This would help reduce the negative externalities/market failure associated
  with the burning of fossil fuels and reduce pollution.
• This could lead to higher energy and transportation costs for businesses and
  may dampen efforts to diversify the economy.

Provision of healthcare services in tandem with the private sector and
NGOs (Text D, paragraph 6)
• It improves access to, and quality of public health and increases the
  productivity of workers.
• Reliance on the private sector and NGOs avoids adding to the mounting public
  debt (Text D, paragraph 7).

Fight against corruption (Text D, paragraph 8)
• This will help bring in foreign investment and may make the country more
   credible in taking loans with multilateral organisations such as the World Bank
   and the IMF. This would help increase access to foreign aid (Text D,
   paragraph 8).

Free primary and secondary education, inclusive of technical education
(text E, paragraph 2 and 4)
• This will help households break the poverty trap as more income can be used to
   spend on necessities and capital equipment (Text E, paragraph 2).
• This will have an impact on the empowerment of women (Text E, paragraph 2).
                                       – 20 –              M22/3/ECONO/SP2/ENG/TZ0/XX/M


• Productivity will increase in the agricultural sector, ensuring food security (Text
  E, paragraph 3) and reduce the price of rice and other food items (Text E,
  paragraph 4).
• This will promote diversification (Text E, paragraph 4) and reduce structural
  unemployment, particularly amongst youths (Text D, paragraph 8).
• This may worsen the budget deficit and increase government debt in the short
  term (Text D, paragraph 7).

Improvement in infrastructure
• This will help attract MNCs (Text F, paragraph 1) and allow for the
  development of the manufacturing sector (Text E, paragraph 4), which could
  help achieve diversification. This would reduce volatility in export revenue and
  promote economic growth (Text D, paragraph 2) and it may help reduce the
  current account deficit (Table 3).
• This reduces unemployment (Text D, paragraph 8) and prevents rural-urban
  migration if manufacturing takes place in rural areas.
• This could worsen the budget deficit and increase the government debt (Text
  D, paragraph 7).

Tax benefits for foreign investment
• This would help diversify the economy by developing the tourism sector (Text
  F, paragraph 2).
• Excessive reliance on foreign investment might lead to a loss of sovereignty
  as many essential services are provided by MNCs (Text F, paragraph 2).
• MNCs might exploit resources (Text F, paragraph 2) and labour.
• The increase in FDI inflows could help compensate for the current account
  deficit (Table 3, answer to (b)(i)) through the financial account. MNCs would
  also provide an export market which would increase the export revenue and
  reduce the current account deficit. The overall increase in the balance of
  payments could prevent further depreciation of the currency.
• However, the repayment of profit and interest might widen the deficit on the
  net income account (Table 3).

Examiners should be aware that candidates may take a different approach which,
if appropriate, should be rewarded.
