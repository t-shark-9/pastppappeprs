Notes for examiners:

1. Use the question-specific markscheme together with the markbands. Award up to
the maximum marks as indicated.
2. Whenever relevant, carry over marks must be awarded. If a candidate makes an
error in calculation, but then uses the incorrect figure appropriately and accurately in
later question parts, then the candidate may be fully rewarded. This is the “own-figure
rule” and you should put OFR on the script where you are rewarding this.
3. A candidate may be penalized for not rounding correctly, failing to give answers
correct to 2 dp or, in some cases, for not including the appropriate units. However, a
candidate may only be penalized ONCE for each type of error across all subparts of (b)
questions.

                      - the repayment of interest on the debt/borrowing/loans

                      (of a person /a firm / a country / government)

           (ii)   Define the term Gini coefficient indicated in bold in Table 2.                [2]

            Level                                                                      Marks

(b)   (i)     Sketch a demand and supply diagram to show the effect on revenue
              earned by Vietnamese farmers with improved access to the Japanese
              market (Text B, paragraph 1).                                                  [3]

              The diagram has three requirements:
              • correctly labelled demand and supply diagram
              • a shift of the demand curve to the right
              • effect on revenue correctly indicated on diagram.

      Level                                                                          Marks

      2         The diagram meets only two requirements.                             2
      3         The diagram meets all three requirements.                            3

              Candidates who incorrectly label diagrams can be awarded a maximum of
              [2].

              For a demand and supply diagram, the vertical axis should be price or p.
              The horizontal axis should be quantity or q. A title is not necessary.




              The increase in revenue could alternatively be indicated by labelling the
              corners of the revenue boxes or by referring in writing an increase in
              revenue from P x Q to P1 x Q1.

      (ii)   Using information from Table 1, calculate the change in the surplus on
             Vietnam’s balance of trade in goods with Japan between 2015 and 2019.               [2]

             2015:    (15 141 – 12 531)                2610
             2019:    (22 475 – 16 484)                5991

             any valid working should be rewarded with [1]

             (Change in surplus)            (US)$ 3381 million

             An answer of 3 381, without workings or without units, is sufficient for [1].

             Own figure rule applies.

(c)   Explain two economies of scale which may not be available to smaller farms
      (Text A, paragraph 2).                                                                     [4]

            below.
      1     The written response is limited                                              1–2
            Two economies of scale stated:
            • large machinery/technical economies
            • specialization/ division of labour/management economies
            • economies of increased dimensions
            • bulk buying
            • marketing economies
            • transport / logistical economies
            • financial economies.

              Any other valid response.
      2       The written response is accurate                                           3–4
              Two valid explanations of how / why the economies of scale
              decrease (long run) average costs.

              For example, small farms:
              • are unable to use (apply) division of labour or employ specialist
                 managers, which could increase efficiency
              • are less likely to use large machines/capital equipment which can
                 increase capacity / efficiency
              • are less likely to buy in bulk and therefore pay higher prices for
                 inputs
              • cannot spread costs over large quantity of output for transport or
                 marketing
              • have to pay higher interest rates on loans.

              Any other valid and explained response.

      NB Alternatively, if a student answers in terms of the economies of scale that
      large farms can get, the answer may be fully rewarded.

(d)   Using a production possibilities curve (PPC) diagram to show comparative
      advantage, explain why Vietnam would export seafood to Japan while Japan
      would export machinery to Vietnam (Text B, paragraph 1).                         [4]

      Level                                                                    Marks
      0       The work does not meet a standard described by the descriptors   0

      1       There is a correct diagram OR an accurate written response.      1–2
              For a diagram with two PPCs showing that Japan has a
              comparative advantage in machinery while Vietnam has a
              comparative advantage in seafood OR stating that Japan has a
              lower opportunity cost in machinery [1], therefore Japan has
              comparative advantage or lower opportunity cost than Vietnam
              [1]
              (or explained in terms of Vietnam).
      2       There is a correct diagram AND an accurate written response.     3–4
              For a diagram with two PPCs showing that Japan has a
              comparative advantage in machinery while Vietnam has a
              comparative advantage in seafood AND stating that Japan has a
              lower opportunity cost in machinery [1], therefore Japan has
              comparative advantage or lower opportunity cost than Vietnam
              [1]
              (or explained in terms of Vietnam).

      Candidates who incorrectly label diagrams can be awarded a maximum of [3].

      For a diagram showing comparative advantage, the PPC lines could be linear or
      curved and they could intersect or be non-intersecting. They should show that
      Japan has a comparative advantage in machinery production while Vietnam has
      a comparative advantage in seafood production. However, the labelling could be
      reversed from the examples below. Either one of the examples below is
      satisfactory or two diagrams can be drawn, with one for Vietnam and one for
      Japan, but the PPCs should have different slopes that correctly convey the
      comparative advantages. A title is not necessary.

(e)   Using a demand and supply of money diagram, explain the likely effect on
      interest rates of a reduction in the minimum reserve requirement for banks
      (Text C, paragraph 1).                                                                  [4]

               For a money demand and supply diagram, with a vertical money
               supply line shifting to the right to show the reduction in the
               interest rate OR for an explanation that a reduction in the
               minimum reserve requirement will allow banks to lend more [1]
               which will increase the money supply and thus reduce interest
               rates [1].
      2        There is a correct diagram AND an accurate written response.           3–4
               For a money demand and supply diagram, with a vertical money
               supply line shifting to the right [1] leading to a reduction in the
               interest rate [1] AND for an explanation that a reduction in the
               minimum reserve requirement will allow banks to lend more [1]
               which will increase the money supply and thus reduce interest
               rates [1].

      Candidates who incorrectly label diagrams can be awarded a maximum of [3].

      For a money demand and supply diagram, the vertical axis should be labelled
      interest rate, i, ir or r. The horizontal axis may be labelled Quantity (Q) or Q of
      Money. A title is not necessary.

(f)   Using an exchange rate diagram, explain how the central bank in Vietnam could
      prevent the dong from depreciating by using its reserve assets
      (Text C, paragraph 2).                                                                     [4]

               right and the equilibrium price of the dong rising
               OR
                for an explanation that the central bank would buy the dong with
               its reserve assets / foreign reserves [1], increasing the demand
               for the dong (resulting in the exchange rate to rise / prevent the
               dong depreciating) [1].
      2        There is a correct diagram AND an accurate written response.             3–4

               for an explanation that the central bank would buy the dong with
               its reserve assets / foreign reserves [1], increasing the demand
               for the dong (resulting in the exchange rate to rise / prevent the
               dong depreciating) [1].

      Candidates who incorrectly label diagrams can be awarded a maximum of [3].

      For an exchange rate diagram, the vertical axis may be exchange rate, price of
      dong in another currency, other currency/dong or other currency per dong. The
      horizontal axis should be quantity, or quantity of dong. A title is not necessary.




                 :
      Alternatively, a candidate may draw a diagram showing the dong depreciating
      (due to S shifting right or D shifting left) and the D curve then shifting right to
      restore the exchange rate to its initial level. If explained properly, this can be fully
      rewarded.

Answers that only deal with trade or only deal with FDI should be rewarded a
maximum of level 3.

Command term
“Discuss” requires candidates to offer a considered and balanced review that
includes a range of arguments, factors or hypotheses. Opinions or conclusions
should be presented clearly and supported by appropriate evidence.

Answers may include:
• definition of development
• definition of trade
• definition of foreign direct investment.

Economic models / theories may include:
• AD/AS
• poverty cycle
• PPC
• trade creation / diversion
• comparative advantage
• free trade / protectionism.

Points that support the view that trade is more beneficial:
Benefits of trade with Japan:
• trading based on comparative advantage enables Vietnam to consume beyond
  its production possibilities curve therefore could increase living standard in
  Vietnam (Text B, paragraph 1)
• create more employment in export industries leading to improved living standard
  for the workers employed in these industries (Table 1)
• more exports of agricultural goods enable farms to earn and invest more, leading
  to more efficiency (Text A, paragraph 2 or Text B, paragraph 1)
• incomes are rising and will rise more in rural areas ( Text B, paragraph 1 or
  Table 1).

Costs of FDI from Japan:
• because Japanese factories tend to locate in urban areas, inequality is
  increasing as shown by the rise in the Gini coefficient (Table 2)
• Japanese firms are taking advantage of low-cost labour (Text B, paragraph 2)
• environmental impact of more factories and coal-fired power plants and its
  effects on economic development (Text A, paragraph 3 or Text B, paragraph
  2)
• foreign firms are getting preferential tax treatment and the government is
  spending on infrastructure, which has an opportunity cost of possibly less
  government spending on health and education (Text A, paragraph 4).

Points that support the view that FDI is more beneficial:
Benefits of FDI from Japan:
• more jobs are available leading to improving indicators for health and life
  expectancy (Table 2) and rising incomes (Text A, paragraph 1 and Table 1)
• Japanese FDI also results in Japanese aid directed at required infrastructure.
  This improves Vietnam's economic capacity (Table 2 and Text A, paragraph 5)
• Japanese firms are introducing more technology leading to improved human
  capital and enabling more exports of manufactured goods leading to more growth
  and consequential improvement in economic development (Text B, paragraph 2)

           • FDI enables Vietnam to add more value to the primary products it produces. This
             helps avoid economic problems attached to specializing in primary product
             exports and therefore may increase living standards in rural areas (Text B,
             paragraph 2).

           Costs of trade with Japan:
           • because Vietnam is specializing in primary goods, trade with Japan may be
             disrupted by supply shocks (particularly due to the climate) and volatile prices
             (due to inelastic demand and supply) restricting economic development in
             rural areas (Text A, paragraph 3 and Text B, paragraph 1)
           • land and fisheries and forests are being unsustainably used (Text A,
             paragraph 3).

           Synthesis of relative benefits of trade vs FDI:
           • trade and FDI are not substitutes for each other but together may have a
             significant impact on economic development, because more FDI allows Vietnam
             to start exporting manufactured and higher value-added goods (Text B,
             paragraph 2)
           • both are contributing to development, but both have drawbacks.

           Examiners should be aware that candidates may take a different approach which, if
           appropriate, should be rewarded.

              human capital on Malawi’s potential output (Text D, paragraph 2).            [3]

              The diagram has three requirements:
              • correctly labelled PPC diagram
              • two PPC curves drawn
              • shift to the right is clearly shown

              Candidates who incorrectly label diagrams can be awarded a maximum of [2].

              For a PPC diagram, there must be two goods or groups of goods competing
              for the same resources on the axes. Good X and Good Y are appropriate,
              but simply X and Y are not sufficient. A title is not necessary.

              Clear labelling of the PPC curves such as PPC1 PPC2 is sufficient to indicate
              the shift to the right.

              Labelling PPC diagram with P and Q or PL and RGDP are fundamental errors
              thus zero marks.

      An answer may alternatively draw a Keynesian AS curve, with the original
      intersection of AD and AS being in the upward sloping portion of the AS curve.
      Alternatively, the original intersection may be in the horizontal section of the AS
      curve and the PL may not fall. This can receive full marks if the explanation
      states that due to high unemployment/spare capacity in Malawi, contractionary
      fiscal policy will not be able to reduce inflation.
