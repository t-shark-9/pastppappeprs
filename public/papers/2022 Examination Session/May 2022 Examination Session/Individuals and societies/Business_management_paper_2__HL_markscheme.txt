                                         Section A

1.   (a)   Define the term productivity rate.                                           [2]

           Productivity rate is a measure of the efficiency of production and can
           be defined as the rate of output to input of production. It is also a
           measure of the added value of the business.

           Award [1] for a basic definition that conveys partial knowledge and
           understanding.

           Award [2] for a full definition that conveys knowledge and
           understanding similar to the above and refers to inputs and outputs
           or similar words such as resources and production.

           N.B. no application required. Do not credit examples.

     (b)   Using the information provided above and in Table 1, calculate:

           (i)    the total contribution per month for the production of 20 000
                  chocolate-filled donuts (show all your working);              [2]

                  Total contribution = contribution per unit x number of units
                  = 3 x 20 000 = $60 000

                  OR

                  Total contribution = total revenue – total variable costs
                  = 100 000 – (2 x 20 000) = $60 000

                  Award [1] for correct working and [1] for the correct answer.
                  Award up to a maximum of [2].
                  Working should include some reference to the contribution
                  calculation.
                  Award a maximum of [1] if $ sign is omitted.

           (ii)   the monthly profit if Roscas sells sugar donuts and chocolate-
                  filled donuts (show all your working).                         [2]

                  Profit = sales revenue – total costs

                  Monthly profit = (100 000 + 70 000) – (15 000 + 1000) – (25 000
                  + 40 000) = $89 000

                  Award [1] for correct working and [1] for the correct answer.
                  Award up to a maximum of [2].

                  Award a maximum of [1] if $ sign is omitted, however do NOT
                  penalize more than once if repeated in any question part i.e.
                  part (b)(i) and (b)(ii).

                  Award [1] if profit for only one of sugar or chocolate is provided.

                  Award [1] to incorrect answers where there is a single numerical
                  error in what is otherwise correct working.

(c)   Using the information provided above and in Table 2, calculate:

      (i)       the payback period for the new machine (show all your working); [2]

                     Annual Net Cash Flow $000          Cumulative Cash Flow $000

                Award [1] for correct working and [1] for the correct answer.
                Award up to a maximum of [2].
                Accept any other method of calculation.
                Accept answer discrepancies due to decimal rounding.

                your working).                                             [2]

                ARR = ((total returns – capital cost/years of usage)/capital cost)) x 100

                Total returns = $3 330 000

2.   (a)   State two features of a cooperative.                                    [2]

           Two features include:
           • A cooperative society works on the principle of sharing and
             welfare. If any surplus (or loss) is generated, it is
             distributed/shared amongst the members (shared profits or
             losses of members).
           • An elected managing committee has the power to take decisions.
             Members have the right to vote, by which they elect the members
             who will constitute the managing committee (shared decision
             making between members).
           • There is limited liability of the members of a cooperative society.
             Liability is limited to the extent of the amount contributed by
             members as capital (limited liability of members).

           Accept any other relevant feature.
           An explanation is not required.

           Award [1] for each correct feature stated. Award a maximum of [2].
           Application is not expected.

           N.B. whilst the command term is “features” it is also true that some
           features may also be advantages.

(b)   Using Table 3 and the information provided above, prepare a
      monthly cash-flow forecast for LLC for the first four months of
      operations.                                                               [6]

      N.B. Allow candidate own figure rule (OFR): if a candidate makes an
      error in one row and carries it through the remainder of the forecast, that
      is only one error. This provision includes both mathematical errors and
      conceptual errors (for example, if a candidate includes the credit sales
      for January in this month, it is one error) and candidates should only lose
      [1] for that error.

      Award [1] if the candidate has some idea of what a cash-flow forecast is
      and looks like.

      Award [2] for a cash-flow forecast that has some problems in layout and
      wording and which has more than three errors/mistakes (apply OFR),
      which could include in addition to number placement problems and
      mathematical errors, or conceptual errors, or omissions, such as not
      having a line like “closing balance”.

      Award [3] for a largely correct cash-flow forecast that has some minor
      problems with layout, wording and calculations, which has three
      mistakes (apply OFR).

      Award [4] for a largely correct cash-flow forecast that has some minor
      problems with layout and wording and which has up to two mistakes
      (apply OFR) or the candidate does not produce a mathematically correct
      cash flow.

      Award [5] for a mathematically correct cash-flow forecast that has up to
      one calculation error, or some omission of the wording above.

      Award [6] for a fully correct cash-flow forecast with a generally accepted
      format and lines for total inflows/receipts, total outflows/payments (or
      some other acceptable wording), a line for net cash flow/inflow, etc., and
      lines for opening and closing balance.

      Substituting the term “net profit” in the cash-flow forecast for “net cash-
      flow” is inaccurate and [1] should be deducted.
      Cash sales and credit sales need not be separated.

(c)   Calculate LLC’s forecasted net profit at the end of April (show all
      your working).                                                          [2]

      Closing balance in April – opening balance in January + credit sales
      = 600 – 5000 + 8000 = $3600

      Award [1] for working and [1] for the correct answer. Award up to a
      maximum of [2]. If the credit sales are not added, then this is one
      error and only [1] should be awarded.
      Award a maximum of [1] if $ sign is omitted. If answer presented in a
      table as below with $ sign in heading do NOT penalize.
      Candidates do not need to produce a table, but amounts should be
      labelled. Missing labels equal one error.

      Allow candidate own figure rule (OFR).

                         Net profit                             3600

      Do not penalise if response includes labour as part of cost of goods
      sold (COGS). The gross profit (GP) will differ but net profit (NP)
      should be the same.

      If a candidate assumes question refers only to a single month of
      April as shown below and produces an answer similar to below,
      award a maximum of [1].

3.   (a)   Define the term fixed cost.                                                  [2]

           Fixed cost is defined as those costs that do not vary through output
           or quantity produced.

           Award [1] for a basic definition that conveys partial knowledge and
           understanding. e.g. fixed costs do not change.

           Award [2] for a full definition that conveys knowledge and
           understanding similar to the answer above. e.g links directly to output.
           Output can also be sales for retail businesses.

           N.B. no application required. Do not credit examples.

     (b)   Explain one advantage and one disadvantage for CD of using a
           job/customized production method.                                           [4]

           Job/customized production refers to the production of a single or
           exclusive item specially designed for each customer.

           Advantages:
           • One benefit to CD of using a job production approach is that CD can
             design an exclusive dress for each client considering personal styles
             and preferences, resulting in high consumer satisfaction and thus
             increased sales for her business.
           • As exclusively designed items, CD can charge high prices for the
             dresses.
           • As all dresses are entirely designed and produced by CD and her
             assistants, job production can be highly motivating for them, as they
             can take pride in their designs and creations.

           Disadvantages:
           • One cost to CD of using job production is that it is labour intensive
              resulting in high unit costs. This is implied since Carol only has
              two employees, Carol and her assistants design and make the
              dresses as a whole by hand. Added value is high, so customers
              should be prepared to pay a high price for the dresses.
           • Job production is time consuming. It will take time for Carol to
              design and make each ordered dress. Customers will have to be
              prepared to wait for their dresses. Carol could lose potential
              clients if they have to wait too much for her to finish other orders.
              The stimulus mentions that recently, some customers have
              complained about her delivery times.

           Accept any other relevant advantage / disadvantage.

           N.B. the response must reflect the advantaqe / disadvantage to CD and not
           customers.

           Mark as [2] + [2].

           Award [1] for each correct advantage / disadvantage identified or
           described and [1] for a relevant explanation with application to CD.
           Award up to a maximum of [2].

      [2] cannot be awarded per advantage / disadvantage if the response
      lacks either explanation and/or application.

      For example: For an identification or description of an advantage /
      disadvantage with or without application [1]. For explanation of an
      advantage / disadvantage with no application [1].

      For explanation of an advantage / disadvantage and application [2].

(c)   Explain one advantage and one disadvantage for CD of forming a
      partnership.                                                            [4]

      Advantages:
      • Juan as a business angel will inject some money to the business.
        Carol will be able to raise finance and solve her cash-flow
        shortages.
      • Carol will be able to delegate some of her tasks and concentrate
        on the operations of the business, to meet deadlines and the
        increasing demand of dresses.
      • Juan may bring new ideas for the operational side of the business.

      Disadvantages:
      • Carol will have to share all her decisions with Juan. As Carol is a
         designer, and Juan is an engineer, they may have a totally
         different approaches on how to run the business and conflict may
         arise. Juan has already suggested that Carol be less involved with
         design and more on operations. However, it could be argued that
         Carol’s design skills underpins the brand.
      • Carol will have to share profits with Juan who will own 50 % of the
         business.
      • Juan has no knowledge of the dress business so may have little to
         contribute.

      Accept any other relevant advantage / disadvantage.

      Award [1] for each correct advantage / disadvantage identified or
      described and [1] for a relevant explanation with application to
      Carol. Award up to a maximum of [2].

      [2] cannot be awarded per advantage / disadvantage if the response
      lacks either explanation and/or application.

      For example: For an identification or description of a disadvantage
      with or without application [1]. For explanation of a disadvantage
      with no application [1]. For explanation of a disadvantage and
      application [2].
                                       – 11 –              M22/3/BUSMT/HP2/ENG/TZ0/XX/M
(d)   Discuss Carol’s decision to use e-commerce.                                [10]

      Through e-commerce Carol can reach a larger and global audience
      with relatively low investment. As an emergent talent, she cannot
      afford the fixed costs of an expensive physical retailer. E-commerce,
      with lower fixed costs, seems to be the only alternative for her to sell
      the dresses to a large global audience. E-commerce is increasing
      worldwide and consumers are more likely to buy goods and services
      online. Carol who already has a B2C approach could take advantage
      of the world-changing consuming patterns to take her business to
      another level. Through e-commerce, Carol can interact with her
      clients who can leave on her web page important information and
      valuable opinion. She could then use this data for marketing
      purposes, such as offering new products and services.

      Carol could also use e-commerce for promotion purposes as
      promotional costs of using social media and e-platforms are relatively
      low cost compared to other traditional forms of promotion. As an
      emerging designer, she cannot afford traditional and expensive
      promotional techniques. However, through social media marketing,
      Carol will be able to promote her dresses to a large global audience
      with minimum investment. She could also make a deal with Alexia
      Bros to promote her dresses during the cinema festivals and upload
      her pictures to social media for promotion.

      However, e-commerce also has disadvantages. Delayed delivery
      times could affect the reliability and satisfaction of the purchase.
      Carol has received some complaints about delivery delays which
      could erode her brand image among customers.
      Arguably if e-commerce has the effect of attracting more customers
      then the current operational difficulties are only likely to be made
      worse. In addition, party dresses are difficult to sell online as many
      customers will probably prefer to try them on before buying.

      E-commerce needs maintenance and it takes time to manage it. If it
      is not properly done it can damage the business reputation. Carol
      has not been able to answer to negative feedback and comments
      which could be a bad sign for customers that may not trust the
      business and refuse to buy online. Carol will have to hire a suitable
      qualified employee to work on this if she does not want to put at risk
      her brand image and compromise her future business growth.

      All in all, even if there are some disadvantages to Carol of using e-
      commerce, it seems the only viable alternative for Carol to make her
      business grow.

           Features include:
           • It provides a sense of direction to the entire organization in terms
             of what to accomplish or pursue and which markets the
             organization will serve and how.
           • It reflects the corporate philosophy, identity, character, and image
             of the organization which can be used to communicate with
             external stakeholders such as customers, pressure group etc.
           • It could act as a motivator for employees by providing them with
             goals and a feeling of belonging to the organization.
           • It defines the overall aims and objectives of an organization.

           Accept any other relevant feature.

           N.B. no application required. Do not credit examples.

           Award [1] for a basic description of one feature that conveys partial
           knowledge and understanding.

           Award [2] for a full description of one feature that conveys
           knowledge and understanding similar to the answer above.

     (b)   Explain two advantages of BM’s unique selling point/proposition (USP).       [4]

           A unique selling point/proposition (USP) is a feature that
           differentiates a product or an organization from its rival products and
           competitors. BM’s USP is based on the production of specialist food
           for unhealthy dogs.

           Advantages include:
           • BM sells a differentiated product; BM could benefit from more sales
             opportunities compared to other dog food brands that only sell
             generic food for dogs.
           • BM could benefit from dominating a niche market.
           • BM could use their USP for promotion. For example, BM already
             promote the brand through veterinarians that recommend BM food
             for their patients.
           • BM can benefit from improved brand image and brand loyalty as
             they reach the market segment of unhealthy dogs that needs
             exactly what BM offers.
           • BM may benefit from being able to charge higher prices for its
             product.

           Accept any other relevant advantage.

           Mark as [2] + [2].

           Award [1] for each correct advantage identified or described and [1] for a

           explanation and/or application. For example: For an identification or
           description of an advantage with or without application [1]. For
           explanation of an advantage with no application [1].

(c)   Explain one advantage and one disadvantage for BM of using a cost-
      plus (mark-up) pricing strategy.                                   [4]

      A cost-plus pricing is a strategy by which the selling price is
      calculated by adding a profit margin to the full cost of product.

      Advantages to BM include:
      • This strategy is especially helpful for BM as they do not have
        direct competitors in the market, and they can charge the mark-up
        to costs that they want.
      • It is an easy pricing strategy for BM to apply, as they do not have
        to consider, customers preferences or do further market research.
      • It’s a valid pricing strategy for BM, as pet owners would be
        prepared to pay a high price for such specialist pet food.
      • It can cover the full cost of production. Given that raw material
        costs are rising, BM can ensure a profit is made and all costs are
        covered when a product is sold.

      Disadvantages to BM include:
      • BM’s costs of raw materials are increasing, a cost-plus pricing
         strategy could lead to a very high price that BM customers may
         not be willing to pay
      • A cost-plus pricing strategy could be highly inefficient for BM, as it
         gives very little incentive to reduce costs.
      • BM sales are stagnant which means that, probably due to the
         uncompetitive market, BM is not paying sufficient attention to
         customer needs.

      Accept any other relevant advantage / disadvantage.

      Mark as [2] + [2].

      [2] cannot be awarded per advantage / disadvantage if the response
      lacks either explanation and/or application. For example: For an
      identification or description of an advantage disadvantage / with or
      without application [1]. For explanation of an advantage /
      disadvantage with no application [1]. For explanation of an
      advantage/ disadvantage and application [2].

(d)   Discuss whether BM should diversify into specialist cat food or introduce a new
      distribution channel for dog food.                                           [10]

      If BM diversifies into specialist food for cats, it will open up to a larger
      and growing new market. The demand for cats is increasing, BM
      could also take advantage of its brand image as customers already
      know BM’s high quality. BM’s excellent brand image is an asset that
      can be capitalized in the development of new specialist food for cats.
      Vets who already recommend BM’s dog food would presumably
      recommend BM’s specialist cat food.

      In addition, BM has experience in developing new products. Even if
      the costs of building its own research facilities are high, BM could get
      the necessary finance by becoming a private limited company.

      However, introducing a new product into an existing market (Product
      Development) is a risky move. However, BM has the know-how of
      producing and selling specialist dog food. If BM becomes a private
      limited company to get the necessary finance, ownership will be
      diluted. Dr. Jones and Dr. Morris could lose some control of their
      business as decisions will have to be shared. BM’s current focus on
      quality could be compromised if the new partners prioritize profit
      maximization. What is more, the finance raised through the private
      limited company may not be enough to fund BM’s research facilities
      and the warehouse that will need refurbishing to stock more
      products.

      N.B. with reference to Ansoff, cat owners might be considered a
      different market to dog owners hence Market Development.

      As an alternative BM could introduce a new channel of distribution for
      the specialist dog food. A two intermediary distribution channel is one
      that includes a wholesaler that buys the goods from the producer and
      sells to the retailers.

      So far, BM dog food was only distributed through veterinarians and
      large pet shops and BM food was not available for customers in
      certain areas. A two intermediary distribution channel that includes a
      larger supermarket chain, a wholesaler and many small pet shops,
      will enable BM to reach a larger customer base. Now, potential
      customers in different areas will be able to buy BM. BM will still pay
      for transport costs to the delivery to veterinarians and large pet
      shops, but they will not have to add transport costs to distribute to
      other small retailers around the country as the wholesaler will pay for
      transport costs.

      In addition, the wholesaler and the supermarket chain could store the
      food and help BM to reduce stocks. This could be very convenient for
      BM as it would not need to refurbish the warehouse.

      However, a major disadvantage is that BM‘s selling price will be
      more expensive to final customers as a wholesaler is introduced.
      BM’s price is probably already high and a higher markup could lead
      to a very high price to final customers. Alternatively, BM could accept
      reduced profit margins and keep the price stable.
                                 – 16 –             M22/3/BUSMT/HP2/ENG/TZ0/XX/M
Another disadvantage is that in supermarkets and small pet shops,
BM food will probably be sold without sales advice and
recommendation from veterinarians and large pet shops owners. BM
food will be sold among cheaper brands of lower quality, without
specialist features. Competition could be strong as customers may
not be well informed. BM could lose potential sales.

BM could lose control over the marketing mix. In addition, the
supermarket chain could use promotions or change other elements
of the marketing mix that BM would not be able to control.

Candidates could apply the Ansoff matrix model. For instance:

If BM diversifies into specialist cat food, it will be marketing a new
product in a new market. This alternative entails several risks as BM
will be moving into a market in which it has no experience at all.
Diversifying into specialist cat food can also be seen as an expensive
option as new food will have to be researched and developed. New
premises will also be needed. However, if BM is successful, it will be
growing in sales and spreading its product portfolio. Synergies and
common know-how could help to reduce costs to produce a
successful new product for cats.

N.B. reward candidates that understand the distinction between
related and unrelated diversification, with the former representing
considerably less risk.

If BM chooses to open a new distribution channel for the food for
dogs, it will be adopting a market development strategy and will be
selling into unreached areas. New customers will be able to access
BM’s food and sales will probably increase. Costs and risks seem to
be lower for this option, however, if BM increases its price due to
more intermediaries, sales could remain stagnant.
Even if diversifying appears to be risky and costly, BM should
consider the right balance between risk and reward when choosing
what to do. A new distribution channel could be safer in the short run;
however, diversifying can be highly rewarding and strategically
speaking a better option for BM’s future.

Accept product development strategy as it could also be seen as a
new product (cat food) in the existing broader market of pet food.

Accept any other relevant and applicable argument for and against
each option.

To sum up: candidates can provide a judgment, a conclusion or
recommend any option provided it is well substantiated.

Marks should be allocated according to the markbands on page 3

against for each option.

Candidates may contrast one option with another for a balance, as

5.   (a)   State two features of a public limited company.                               [2]

           The main features of a public limited company, some of which may apply to a
           private limited company, include:
           • Government rules, laws, and regulations strictly govern public
              limited companies.
           • Shareholders do not participate in the day-to-day management of
              the business of a company.
           • Shareholders’ liability is limited to their investment in the company.
           • The board of directors has decision-making power, most of which
              it delegates to the chief executive officer. The board, nonetheless,
              makes policy and strategic decision by majority rule.
           • The company has separate legal existence from its owners
              (shareholders).
           • The company raises capital by selling shares.
           • The shares of a company are freely transferable and do not
              require consent of other shareholders.
           • Shares can be bought-sold only via a stock exchange.
           • Anyone can purchase shares.
           • Financial statements/accounts are made public and are easily
              accessible.
           • Legal continuity.

           Accept any other relevant feature.

           Award [1] for each relevant feature stated up to [2]. Maximum award: [2].

(b)   (i)   Explain, with reference to Maslow’s motivation theory, how teleworking
            may damage employee motivation at FR’s head office.                    [2]

            Maslow’ 3rd level, social needs / teamworking, will not be met
            as employees that choose teleworking will be working from
            home for all but one day per month and therefore will have
            little opportunities to meet with colleagues, to work as part of a
            face to face team.

            Maslow’s 4th level may also not be met due to the typical lack of
            a formal workplace among teleworkers. It may be difficult for
            remote workers to experience formal recognition of their
            accomplishments. In addition, the virtual nature of their jobs
            reduces direct / face to face input that signifies goal
            achievement and personal development, which affect
            employees’ esteem. This may be further exacerbated by the
            fact that 40% of workers who chose not to telework will
            continue to enjoy these benefits. This may cause resentment
            among teleworkers leading to problems with teamworking (3rd
            level).

            respect to FR. Award a maximum of [2].

            [2] cannot be awarded if the response lacks either explanation
            and / or application.

            For example:

            For an identification or a description of one of Maslow’s
            hierarchy of needs with or without application [1].

            N.B. For application, candidates do not have to say "only one
            day per month" but they do need to convey the idea that
            teleworking employees are not coming to the office often.

(ii)   Explain one disadvantage for FR, other than the impact on employee
       motivation, of introducing teleworking.                            [2]

       Other disadvantages include:
       • It will be more difficult for the business to complete 360-
         degree feedback appraisals, which have been a factor in
         improving staff morale and retention.
       • It will be more difficult for line managers to assess the
         performance of their employees as they will not see them on
         a day-to-day basis as some employees are working from
         home for all but one day per month.
       • Teleworking may introduce inefficiencies. For example, with
         40% of workers still at head office and 60% working from
         home, communication may be more difficult.
       • Communication issues may arise if workers have poor IT
         facilities at home. Informal communication will be more
         difficult as 40% of workers are still in head office.
       • The business may need to provide teleworking employees
         with improved IT facilities at home which will increase the
         business costs. This would reduce cost savings made by
         head office from introducing teleworking.

       Accept any other relevant disadvantage.

       Award [1] for identifying or describing the disadvantage to FR
       and a further [1] for a development with respect to FR. Award a
       maximum of [2].

       [2] cannot be awarded if the response lacks either explanation
       or application.

       For example: For an identification or a description of the
       disadvantage without application, such as “productivity may
       decline as teleworkers have family distractions at home” award
       [1].

(c)   Explain two disadvantages for FR if it extends its 360-degree feedback
      appraisal system to its supermarket employees.                           [4]

      Disadvantages with potential for application include:
      • It will increase the business costs as collecting data and
         performing the appraisals for all employees will mean additional
         paper work and possibly hiring more managers and/or paying
         overtime for the extra work. Department managers are already
         complaining about their workload and this will make it worse. This
         is particularly relevant as there are far more supermarket
         employees (6000) than head office employees (250).
      • It will increase workload on department managers particularly as
         the business has hired an additional 1000 part-time staff.
         Department managers already have concerns about workload and
         doing 360-degree feedback appraisals on all employees will
         increase workload even more.
      • The whole process is time-consuming for everyone involved and
         could reduce the efficiency of FR’'s core activity, running
         supermarkets. (For application, candidates must refer to the
         number of employees).

      Disadvantage where opportunity for application is limited include:
      Employees may select “raters” that are “fans”. This can lead to
      skewed results and department managers may disagree with an
      employee’s choice of raters, which may further increase staff
      turnover of departmental managers.

      Accept any other relevant disadvantage.

      Award [1] for identifying or describing the disadvantage for FR and a
      further [1] for a development with respect to FR. Award a maximum
      of [2].

      [2] cannot be awarded per disadvantage if the response lacks either
      explanation or application.

      For example: For an identification or a description of a disadvantage
      without application award [1]. For an explanation of a disadvantage
      with no application award [1].

      For explanation of a disadvantage and application [2].

      Mark as [2] + [2]. Maximum award: [4]

      N.B. the disadvantage has to be specific to a 360-degree feedback
      appraisal system, not to appraisal in general.

(d)   Recommend whether FR should choose Option 1 or Option 2.                    [10]

      There is no “correct answer”. Answers could include:

      Option 1

      Pros

      This option is less expensive in the long-term. The business will need
      to raise $17m (500 x $34 000). Currently, interest rates are very low
      and therefore the interest charges will only raise the business costs
      by a relatively small amount. E.g. 3 % per annum ($510 000 in year
      1).

      At the end of the five-year period, the business intends to replace the
      vans – as it owns them it can sell them to raise some finance towards
      their replacement.

      As FR already has a $50m bank loan it might be assumed they have
      a good relationship with their bank and further borrowing would not
      be a problem.

      Cons

      The business will need to negotiate an additional loan from its bank
      and may need to provide the bank with additional financial
      documents and possibly collateral. (see comment above) Should the
      business fail to repay the loan then the collateral would be seized by
      the bank.

      It is not a cost-free option even when interest rates are low, as a
      $17m loan would incur interest charges of 3 % per annum ($510 000
      in year 1). If using simple interest this totals $19.55m over five years.

      If the trend to buying online is not maintained and shoppers gradually
      return to shopping face to face, then FR may have a large number of
      vans that it no longer needs but is paying for over five years. Whilst
      these could be re-sold there would be a significant loss made as
      second-hand prices will be a lot lower than the $34 000 purchase
      price.

      FR would be liable for the maintenance and repair of vans.

      N.B. candidates might attempt to use a gearing argument. Without
      any data on the capital base of the company we have no way to
      know whether the existing loan of $50m gives rise to high gearing or
      not. All we can say is that borrowing $17m would increase gearing.

Option 2

Pros

Leasing is more flexible. The business will need to lease the vans for
at least 24 months. At that point if it finds that consumer trends have
changed then it can either not renew the leases on 500 vans or lease
a much smaller number, say 200. This will save the business money
in the long run e.g. leasing just 200 vans will cost only $2.6m per
year.

If after 24 months demand is not seen to be there then the business
could end the lease and purchase vans, saving money in the long
run.

One of the tax advantages to leasing a van could include claiming up
to 100% sales tax back on the monthly payments. Also, leasing
payments are expenses and, thus, lower pre-tax profits and income
tax expense.

In addition, lessors are usually liable for maintenance and servicing
of the vans on a regular basis.

N.B. Terms and conditions of fleet leasing vary. In some instances,
lessors are not responsible for maintenance or service. In other
cases, fleet lessors are responsible for service and maintenance,
though they often contract out the management of the service and
maintenance to a third company for a monthly fee.

Given the limited experience of our candidates, which could well
inform their knowledge about vehicle leases, candidates can argue
that FR will not be responsible for maintenance and servicing (a pro
of leasing) or that FR might still be responsible for maintenance and
servicing (a con of leasing).

Cons

This may have higher long-term costs. A lease of 500 vans will cost
the business $6.5m annually (500 x $13 000). Over five years this
would be $32.5m which is almost twice the cost of the option A. This
is a significant difference in terms of costs.

At the end of each lease period the business does not own the vans
and has to negotiate a new leasing agreement.

The business will pay penalties at the end of the lease agreement if
the leased vans are damaged in any way.

It is expected that candidates provide a conclusion with a
substantiated judgment.

Marks should be allocated according to the markbands on page 3.

If a candidate evaluates / addresses only one option, award a
maximum of [5].

A balanced response is one that provides at least one argument for
and one argument against each option.

Candidates may contrast one option with another for a balance, as
long as at least two arguments are given for each option.

Award a maximum of [6] if the answer is of a standard that shows
balanced analysis and understanding throughout the response with
reference to the stimulus material but there is no
judgment/conclusion.

Candidates cannot reach the [7–8] markband if they give
judgment/conclusions that are not based on analysis/explanation
already given in the answer.
