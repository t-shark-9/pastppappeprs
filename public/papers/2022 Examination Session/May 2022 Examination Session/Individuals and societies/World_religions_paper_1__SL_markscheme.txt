Sikhism

3.   “In ego they are born, and in ego they die.
     […]
     In ego they laugh, and in ego they weep.
     […]
     In ego they are ignorant, and in ego they are wise.
     They do not know the value of salvation and liberation.
     In ego they love Maya, and in ego they are kept in darkness by it.”

                                                                       Guru Granth Sahib 466

     (a)   Identify three teachings in this passage.                                           [3]

           Candidates might cite or interpret some of the following points:
           • Human beings are born in a state of ego-centredness/self-centredness.
           • They also die in that state.
           • This ego-centredness comes into aspects of everyday life such as when
             people laugh and cry.
           • The perceived wisdom and ignorance of people is bounded with ego.
           • Salvation and liberation are of higher worth, but people do not know this.
           • The state of ego-centredness/self-centredness makes people love maya
             (illusion).
           • This keeps people ignorant, in darkness and therefore they are not focused on
             higher spiritual affairs as taught by Sikhism, such as focus on God.

           Award [1] for each relevant point up to a maximum of [3].

     (b)   Explain the importance of leaving behind ego-centredness in Sikh teachings.         [6]

           In explaining about the importance of leaving behind ego-centredness in Sikh
           teachings candidates may refer to the following:
           • Haumai (ego-centredness) and maya (illusion) prevent Sikhs from realizing
              the jot (divine spark).
           • Ego makes human beings focus on their baser emotions, under which they
              may become involved in the five vices of kam (lust), lobh (covetousness), moh
              (attachment), krodh (anger) and ahankar (pride).
           • Leaving behind ego enables Sikhs to free themselves of these vices.
           • The follower of ego is in a condition known as manmukh; by freeing
              themselves from this a Sikh may become one who is focused on God, living
              by the teachings of the gurus, known as gurmukh.
           • Sikhs are taught to perform altruistic service, sewa, which helps them leave
              behind ego and strengthens the bonds of the community.
           • Worship to focus on God and service to the community are central to Sikh life
              and practice, which helps them leave behind the ego.
           • Leaving behind ego influences a Sikh's rebirth in the cycle of reincarnation:
              those centred on themselves may find suffering in their new life, whereas
              those who have overcome their ego and are totally focused on God
              (Waheguru) may attain liberation from the cycle of rebirth.

               yetzer ha-tov (good inclinations).
           • God gave all humans beings free will.
           • Humans can make a choice to follow their bad inclinations or their good
               inclinations.
           • Yetzer ha-ra and yetzer ha-tov are inclinations and therefore humans can
               choose which to follow.
           • Making the choice is a constant process and depends upon each situation.
           • Actions defined as yetzer ha-ra are those that go against the will of God.
              .Relevant examples should be credited

              • A Muslim who rejects Allah’s will may fear being sent to hell, so this belief
                 helps to motivate Muslims to adhere to the straight path.
              • The very basis of Islam may be regarded as submission to the will of Allah, so
                 disobedience is rejecting that.
              • Muslims believe that life is a test and that everything is predetermined by
                 Allah, even to the extent of whether or not they are meant to disobey Allah.
              • Disobedience is referred to as an active decision – it is not the same as those
                 who doubt or question, or who do not know.
              • If a Muslim does not repent after disobedience, they may be punished in
                 jahannam (hell), but Allah is believed to be merciful.
              • Muhammad cast out those who worked against Islam, so today some Muslims
                 disassociate with those who reject Allah.
              • There are examples of stories of the prophets, such as Adam, who disobeyed,
                 but asked for forgiveness which Allah granted. So Muslims try not to disobey
                 but there is always hope of forgiveness if they ask for it.

Taoism

7.   “Whoever is planted in the Tao
     will not be rooted up.
     Whoever embraces the Tao
     will not slip away.
     Her name will be held in honor
     from generation to generation.”

     (b)   Explain the importance of the Way to Taoists.                                          [6]

           The focus of the question is the importance of the Way

           In explaining about the importance of the Way to Taoists candidates may refer to
           the following:
           • The Way is also called the Tao and is central to the beliefs and practices of all
              Taoists.
           • The Universe is an orderly thing and following the Way achieves that order.
           • The Way (Tao) is considered to be the original nature of all humans – the
              natural order of things. Chuang Tzu describes it as the natural condition of life
              as rivers and lakes are to fish.
           • Through following the Way, cosmic harmony is made possible.
           • The Way is like a system of guidance. By following the Way and achieving
              union with the Tao then humans become closer to the truth.
           • The Tao Te Ching is the book of the Way and gives guidance.
           • The most important concept of the Way is wu-wei (nature or action by non-
              action). This doesn’t mean passivity but that you should follow the Tao and
              understand the importance of going with the flow.
           • The Way teaches the importance of finding the balance between the yin and
              the yang.

     (b)   Explain why karma is important to Jain beliefs about moksha (liberation).             [6]

           In explaining why karma is important to Jain beliefs about moksha (liberation),
           candidates may refer to the following:
           • In Jainism, karma is [a law of cause and effect relating to our thoughts and
              actions and their consequences]
           • In Jainism karma is seen as a fine (subtle) physical substance [or ‘matter’] that
              pervades the universe.
           • For Jains there is no divine being involved in this process.
           • Mental or physical action of the jiva (soul/person) attracts karma to the jiva,
              like dust on a mirror.
           • Karma causes the jiva to be bound in samsara, which is the cycle of life, death
              and rebirth.
           • Jains also describe samsara as ajiva (the world of matter).
           • Jains attempt to eradicate the binding effects of karma by following Mahavira's
              teachings, including the Five Great Vows. They also practice ahimsa (non-
               .violence), meditation and asceticism
           • Once free from karma, the jiva is said to have achieved liberation (moksha)
              from karma and samsara
           • Moksha is the goal of Jainism

     (b)   Explain Bahá’i teachings about paradise and hell.                                      [6]

           Candidates cannot achieve the highest band if they write only about paradise or
           hell.

           In explaining Bahá’i teachings about paradise and hell, candidates may refer to
           the following:
           • The Bahá’í teachings state that there is no such physical place as heaven or
              hell.
           • They explain that references to “paradise” and “hell” in the Holy Scriptures of
              other religions are to be understood symbolically, describing states of
              nearness to and distance from God in this world and in the realms beyond.
           • Paradise is not a place but a state of perfection and in harmony with God’s
              will.
           • Paradise is characterized by unity, justice, understanding and cooperation
              between all peoples of the world.
           • There will be a universal government ruling according to God’s will.
           • Racial and economic divisions will be overcome.
           • The rational, divine nature (or soul) of human beings will overcome their lower,
              animal nature (or soul).
           • Hell is understood to be a state of imperfection, far removed from God and in
              conflict with his will.
           • Hell can be identified as a state of ignorance, division, hatred and conflict.
           • The Baha’i understanding emphasizes the eternal journey of the soul towards
              perfection.
