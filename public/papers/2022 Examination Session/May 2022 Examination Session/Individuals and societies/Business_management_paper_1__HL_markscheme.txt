                                               Section A
1.   (a)   Describe two long-term benefits for PU of its marketing strategies (lines 60–64).            [4]

           Background given in the case study: PU’s marketing strategies are “aggressive”
           (line 60) and PU, unlike its competitors, keeps investing a lot in its marketing
           (“Adriana saw marketing expenditure as a worthwhile investment”, (lines 62-63)),
           especially in terms of promotion (communicating actively on PU’s “achievements
           both in research and teaching” (line 63) and on its “competitive fees” (line 64)).

           Long-term benefits include:

           The main anticipated long-term benefit (ie the strategic aim that justifies these
           marketing strategies) is to get more students (as they are the ‘customers’ of PU),
           both local students (as “many local students have decided to postpone their studies
           for a year”, (lines 52-53)) and international students (as they “pay higher fees to the
           university than the fees that the university receives from local student” (lines 54-55)).
           For PU, more students mean more revenue (more income), which improves the
           cash-flow situation (very important, as PU has “cash-flow problems”, as repeated
           several times, lines 57, 69 and 85).

           Other long-term benefits of PU’s marketing strategies include:
           • other external stakeholders will be aware of PU’s success – stakeholders from
             the private sector (eg Di Jones who is “director of a multinational computer
             company that is funding some of PU’s IT research”, (line 108)), or in the public
             sector (local and regional politicians, so that they remember PU and keep
             supporting it);
           • attracting new staff to PU, as its intensive promotion indirectly showcases it as a
             potential employer of choice.

           N.B. The question is not about the marketing mix (4Ps, or even 7Ps). If the answer
           is just an outline of PU’s marketing mix (describing PU’s Product (high quality
           courses), Price (competitive fees) etc); award up to [2], as it shows some
           understanding of marketing, but not of the topic of strategy, nor of the notion of long-
           term benefits. Likewise, answers about ATL and BTL forms of promotion and
           answers that use the Ansoff matrix (eg product development: PU offering new
           courses) may also be partially credited, as they display knowledge of marketing.

           Accept any other relevant long-term benefit.

           If a candidate provides context that provides a benefit, but the benefit is not explicitly
           stated, the “second” mark can be awarded i.e. [0] + [1].

           Mark as a [2] + [2].

           Award [1] for each appropriate benefit identified and [1] for some description and
           application. Award a maximum of [2] for each benefit. Maximum [4] for two benefits.
                                             –6–                M22/3/BUSMT/HP1/ENG/TZ0/XX/M



(b)   Explain the possible impacts on PU of the ethical issues it faces (lines 101–117).   [6]

      Ethical issues and impacts include:
      • Appointment of new trustee with links to slave trade: Can PU resolve? Will the
         problem go away? What impact is it having? If the trustee is sacked what are
         the implications? Loss of talented and valuable person. Reputational loss.
      • Guest speaker: That’s a matter for the students to decide. Should Adriana get
         involved? How much bad publicity will it generate? Does PU want
         confrontation with students? What about free speech? What are the laws
         covering this/university regulations? Impacts depends on what students
         decide. PU could lose some reputation if speaker comes, could seem
         authoritarian, against free speech if speaker does not attend invitation to
         speak at Politics Society.
      • Over-priced medicines to LDCs: If funding is stopped then this action could
         impact on university research.

      Accept any other relevant impact.

      Use the markbands on page 3.

      Award a maximum of [3] for a theoretical answer or for limiting answer to only
      one impact.

      Award a maximum of [5] if the answer is mainly descriptive but in context.

      Award a maximum of [6].
                                                  –7–                 M22/3/BUSMT/HP1/ENG/TZ0/XX/M


2.   (a)   Outline two steps that Adriana should take if she decides to dismiss the head of
           the Faculty of History, Jim (lines 89–100).                                          [4]

           Two steps include:
           • Tell Jim and other faculty members.
           • Follow PU’s HR procedure for dismissal.
           • May need to meet with Jim and his trade union representatives. Prepare a
             case substantiating the reasons in case Jim takes PU to court for unfair
             dismissal, exactly as Patricia is doing after her own dismissal (line 90) (as
             ‘dismissal’ is about a fault, as opposed to ‘redundancy’).
           • Ask HR to advertise for a new post, internally or externally, as Jim needs to be
             replaced
           • Review of current staffing in the History department. Assess whether Jim
             needs to be replaced.

           Accept any other relevant step, as long as they apply to what Adriana would need
           to do if she decides to dismiss Jim. Non-procedural steps can also be rewarded
           such as the department review.

           Mark as a [2] + [2].

           Award [1] for each appropriate step and [1] for application of each step.
           Maximum award, for two steps: [4].

     (b)   Explain strategies, in addition to redundancies, that PU could use to solve its
           cash-flow problems (lines 56–59).                                                    [6]

           Strategies include:
           • 20 % of staff are on part time contracts. More staff could have their hours
              reduced.
           • PU has maintained its marketing budget and this could be reduced.
           • Some facilities are underused so could be let to provide additional income.
           • Reduce overseas visits for lecturers.
           • Stop courses that are not economically viable eg history, modern languages.
           • Increase fees but these are competitive and there is a shortage of students.
           • Make more/other staff redundant.
           • Other methods which are generic include: delay payments to suppliers, reduce
              spending.
           • Short-term sources of finance. These must be appropriate to PU.

           Accept any other relevant strategy, or methods mentioned as part of an overall
           strategy.

           Use the markbands on page 3.

           Award a maximum of [3] for a theoretical answer or for limiting answer to only
           one strategy.

           Award a maximum of [5] if the answer is mainly descriptive but in context.

           Award a maximum of [6].
                                                –8–                M22/3/BUSMT/HP1/ENG/TZ0/XX/M


3.   (a)   Outline two STEEPLE factors that influence PU’s decisions.                              [4]

           STEEPLE framework: Social, Technological, Economic, Ethical, Political, Legal, Ecological
           (‘Environmental’)

           STEEPLE factors include:
           • Activists spreading bad publicity (social)
           • Changes in artificial intelligence and other technologies (technological)
           • The accident at the chemical factory (ecological, environmental)
           • The economic recession (economic)
           • Reduction in other universities (economic)
           • Government grants and “large amount of funding from the government to
             research medicines” (lines 42-43) (political)

           If the STEEPLE factor is not explicitly stated, the “second” mark can be awarded
           i.e. [0] + [1] if it is clear from the context what factor is being referred to.

           Answers must present two separate STEEPLE factors.
           E.g. two economic factors would only be awarded a maximum of [2].

           Accept any other relevant factor.

           Mark as a [2] + [2].

           Award [1] for an appropriate factor and [1] for application. Maximum award for
           two factors: [4].

           Note: To be awarded the second mark, each factor must be explicitly linked to
           the STEEPLE framework. Some flexibility is allowed in the categorization, for
           example the economic recession could be outlined from a social perspective, or
           the governments grants could be seen as the result of a legal decision. The same
           factor; however, cannot be counted twice.
                                             –9–                 M22/3/BUSMT/HP1/ENG/TZ0/XX/M


(b)   Explain ways in which PU could achieve greater sustainability in the 2022/23
      academic year (lines 118–131).                                                      [6]

      Ways to achieve greater sustainability include:
      • Rebuilding facilities to higher sustainability standards and this could include
        building design, heating/lighting systems, furniture and equipment, use of
        space.
      • Maintain and improve on the current lower levels of waste, pollution, energy
        and consumption (these four would only be one way). This could be through
        ensuring recycling facilities, encouraging minimization of waste, finding more
        efficient uses of energy
      • Expand the use of solar and other sustainable energy sources. Available
        space?
      • Review, maintain and further develop CSR policies. Continued reduction in
        energy consumption.
      • Review online teaching provision. An increase in online teaching would help to
        reduce energy consumption at PU.

      Candidates may refer to different forms of sustainability including the triple
      bottom line; this should be awarded.

      Use the markbands on page 3.

      Award a maximum of [3] for a theoretical answer, or for limiting the answer to
      only one way, or for only copying extracts from the case study.

      Award a maximum of [6].
                                                 – 10 –              M22/3/BUSMT/HP1/ENG/TZ0/XX/M


                                              Section B
4.   (a)   Define the term contingency planning.                                                 [2]

           Contingency planning is preparing for an outcome other than that expected in
           usual circumstances. It often used to manage risks for exceptional circumstances
           that could have a catastrophic outcome.

           Beware of circular definitions, which cannot be rewarded.

           There needs to be some suggestion of forward thinking (prior to things/events
           that might happen).

           Some may focus on contingency planning as a way of ‘preventing’ things/events
           happening. This should only be awarded [1].

           Candidates do not have to word exactly as above. Award [1] for a partial
           definition which contains some of the elements, award [2] for a clear definition
           that shows understanding. No application is required. Maximum award: [2].

     (b)   Explain two elements of PU’s organizational culture after the accident at the
           nearby chemical plant.                                                                [4]

           Organizational culture refers to the underlying beliefs, assumptions, values and
           ways of interacting that contribute towards the working environment of a
           business.

           E.g. teamwork; community; trust; innovation; caring; trustworthy management.

           Two elements of PU’s organizational culture include:
           • The main changes have been a ‘hardening’ of the culture to overcome the
             accident.
           • Funds have declined, competition between faculties has increased and this
             changes the nature of working relationships, possibly greater efficiency but
             maybe distrust?
           • Demanding targets: More stress? Better, clearer focus? Is this appropriate to a
             university?
           • Less time on student welfare: indicative of a less caring organization?

           Other possible issue arises from the case study: change of focus to online
           teaching – less social contact; a culture that did nothing about intolerant
           behaviour.

           Some may wish to make use of actual types of culture (role; task etc). This is fine
           but the context is critical.

           Some of the mission statement may not have been achieved in particular,
           inclusivity with some online teaching making courses less available to some,
           excellence with some courses compromised.

           Mark as [2] + [2].

           Award [1] for each appropriate element identified and an additional [1] for
           explanation applied to the stimulus. Maximum award: [4].

             Cost of laptop $500

             Residual value $50

             Fall in value $450 over 3 years = $150 per year per laptop (or annual
             depreciation per laptop)

             OR
             $500 – $50 = $450 = $150 per year per laptop
                  3         3

             OR
             Candidates can present the annual depreciation as a percentage: 30%
             (150 / 500).

             Accept answers where candidates calculate the total depreciation $150 x
             500 = $75000 and present this as their final answer as long as the $150 in
             included as part of the working.

             Possible answers and marks:
             $150 with working [2]
             30% with working [2]
             30% without working [1]
             150 (no units) with working [1]
             $75000 without mention of $150 [1] (an attempt)
             $75000 with working and mention of $150 [2]

             Award [2] for correct answer, with workings and correct units.
             Award [1] for a reasonable attempt or absence of workings and/or correct
             units.

      (ii)   Comment on the usefulness to PU of the results of your calculation in part (i).   [2]

             Depreciation is a component of profit/loss and balance sheet. Ensures PU’s
             profits factor in replacement laptop costs. PU will need to replace laptops
             after 3 years.

             Straight line is useful when there is not a great variation in the actual value
             of the asset over time (such as the laptops in this case).

             Straight line is generally better for lower valued items.

             Award [1] for a general comment about the numbers rather than the usefulness.
             Award [2] for a brief explanation that shows some understanding of the
             usefulness to PU.

(d)   Using information from the case study and additional information above, discuss
      the importance to PU of the extended marketing mix in the provision of services
      at the university.                                                                    [10]

      People

      The university is entirely dependent on people:
      • Customers: (students) are making judgements about the services and
        facilities that the university provides. They do this through surveys and through
        the guides for university choice. These are highly influential in lecturer
        appraisals and the choices that prospective students make.
      • Lecturers: provide the core service of the university. The teaching quality
        depends on their skills and, more recently on their training for online courses.
        The research undertaken which is dependent on supervisors and research
        students.
      • Support staff: students may not get adequate services.
      • Management: Adriana plays a key role in decision making and managing.
      • Trustees: the strategic decision makers.

      Probably the most important people are the lecturers and students without which
      the university would not exist.

      Processes

      This has changed drastically since the accident. From face-to-face teaching using
      dedicated resources such as buildings to online teaching and the use of
      temporary, non-specific resources elsewhere. The process has been highly rated
      in surveys.

      The process also involves other services such as recruiting new students, and
      providing training for lecturers in online teaching. Support services are not as
      good as they could be.
      The online teaching is a major change in how they operate.

Physical evidence

The campus was always beautiful and part of what attracted students to PU. It is
now severely damaged. It will be important to restore the campus. Buildings
facilitated PU’s teaching and research work. These will need to be restored.
Issues such as sustainability could also be included, facilities such as solar
panels, energy efficient classrooms could be built.

It could be argued that restoring the infrastructure of PU (the buildings and
campus), in other words physical evidence, is the most important in the short
term, but that, overall, people are critical, without these the processes will not be
effectively delivered.

Accept reasonable alternative answers.

Marks should be allocated according to the mark bands on page 4.

Award a maximum of [4] for a purely theoretical answer or there is no effective
use of case (e.g. only repeating case material without development).

Award a maximum of [4] for an answer that only explores the 4P’s of the
marketing mix (price; promotion; place and product).

Award a maximum of [5] if only one element of the extended marketing mix is
considered.

Award a maximum of [6] if only two elements of the extended marketing mix are
considered.

Award a maximum of [6] if the extended marketing mix is considered but there is
limited use of data or if there is good analysis of data with limited consideration of
issues.

Award a maximum of [8] if all three elements of the extended marketing mix are
considered and there is good use of data but there are no significant judgements.
