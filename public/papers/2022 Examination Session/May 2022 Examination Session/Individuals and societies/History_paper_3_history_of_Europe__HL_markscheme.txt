Apply the markbands that provide the “best fit” to the responses given and award credit wherever it is
possible to do so. If an answer indicates that the demands of the question are understood and
addressed but that not all implications are considered (for example, compare or contrast; reasons
or significance; methods or success), then examiners should not be afraid of using the full range of
marks allowed for by the markscheme. Responses that offer good coverage of some of the criteria
should be rewarded accordingly.

Section 1: Monarchies in England and France (1066–1223)

1.   Evaluate the methods used by William I to establish his authority in England.

     The question requires that candidates make an appraisal of the methods used by William I to
     establish his authority in England after the Battle of Hastings. Methods to consider could include the
     use of force, changing the social structure, and gaining the support of key institutions. Use of force
     could include the “harrying of the North” and dealing ruthlessly with other rebellions such as in East
     Anglia. The establishment of the feudal system, dominated by Norman barons, extended his
     authority. Some may point out that castle building helped establish his authority. William retained the
     existing structure of counties and earldoms which aided efficient government. Candidates may refer
     to the fact that he had the support of the Church as he left its position and landholdings untouched
     and the Church did not support unrest. Some may argue that early in his reign, force was the most
     important method but that over time effective government helped to fully establish his rule.
     Domesday was undertaken at the end of his reign when his power was fully established. Candidates’
     opinions or conclusions will be presented clearly and supported by appropriate evidence.


2.   “Both Louis VII and Philip II (Philip Augustus) were able to expand royal power in France.” To what
     extent do you agree with this statement?

     The question requires that candidates consider the merits of the statement that both kings were able
     to expand royal power in France. Candidates may argue that both kings attempted to do this but that
     Philip II was more successful. Louis VII’s marriage to Eleanor gave him some control of Aquitaine
     and he appeared to be extending royal power. This ended in 1152 when his marriage to Eleanor
     was annulled, somewhat reducing his power. Louis was unable to resist the extension of Angevin
     rule in Normandy, Brittany and Aquitaine despite attempting to exploit tensions between Henry II and
     his sons. In contrast Philip extended both royal power and the royal demesne. He was the first “King
     of France”, he brought the nobility under control to some extent. In terms of territory, he gained
     Touraine and Maine from Henry II and later Normandy from John by 1214. Royal power was also
     extended to Southern France with the Albigensian Crusade. Candidates’ opinions or conclusions will
     be presented clearly and supported with appropriate evidence.
                                                 –5–                  M22/3/HISTX/HP3/ENG/TZ0/EU/M


Section 2: Muslims and Jews in medieval Europe (1095–1492)

3.   “The conflict between Christian-ruled states and Muslim-ruled states had limited impact on
     economic activity.” To what extent do you agree with this statement?

     The question requires that candidates consider the merits or otherwise of the statement that conflict
     between Christian-ruled states and Muslim-ruled states had limited impact on economic activity.
     Candidates may support the statement arguing that most of the conflicts took place in border areas
     without impacting on large peasant communities. Candidates may also refer to the ongoing trade in
     glassworks and silk textiles between Christians and Muslims kingdoms across the Mediterranean,
     and the presence of Arabic coins in Christian towns, markets, and royal treasuries as proof of the
     continuity of economic activities. Candidates may challenge the statement pointing out that conflicts
     affected the mobility of merchants disturbing trade. They can also refer to cases where battles
     provoked the destruction of lands, towns, and loss of population. Candidates’ opinions or conclusions
     will be presented clearly and supported by appropriate evidence.


4.   Examine the role and contribution of Jews to royal bureaucracies in medieval Europe.

     The question requires that candidates consider the role and contribution of Jews to royal
     bureaucracies. Candidates may refer to their contribution writing legal documents and enlarging the
     royal archives. Candidates may also consider that their knowledge of different languages and
     mathematics, and their cultural background allowed them to occupy different roles as ambassadors,
     (especially in frontier areas between Christian and Muslim kingdoms); officials responsible for the
     collection of taxes; and moneylenders for the crowns. In England both Henry I and Henry II relied on
     Jews for tax collection. Candidates may refer to the cases of Jews that reached high positions in the
     royal bureaucracy enjoying authority over many Christian or Muslim officials. Candidates may also
     examine the role played by many Jews as scapegoats blamed for measures applied by Christian or
     Muslim kings. Candidates’ opinions or conclusions will be presented clearly and supported by
     appropriate evidence.
                                                  –6–                 M22/3/HISTX/HP3/ENG/TZ0/EU/M


Section 3: Late medieval political crises (1300–1487)

5.   “French weakness was the main reason for English success in the Hundred Years’ War between
     1415 and 1429.” Discuss.

     Candidates are required to offer a considered and balanced review of the reasons for English
     success in the war up to 1429. Some may agree with the statement citing the incapacity of Charles
     VI and tensions between Burgundy and Orleans as reasons for France’s weak efforts against the
     English, culminating in the Treaty of Troyes. In contrast, it could also be argued that the French
     became more effective because of the impact of Joan of Arc and the succession of Charles VI.
     Others may argue for English military superiority as a key reason for success. Referring to the better
     funding of the English army and the fact that English soldiers were better trained, leading to victory
     at Agincourt and Verneuil. After Henry’s death, the Duke of Bedford was less successful because of
     a loss of funding and allies, such as Burgundy, which supports the view of English strength up to
     1429. Candidates’ opinions or conclusions will be presented clearly and supported by appropriate
     evidence.


6.   Compare and contrast reasons for the weakness of royal authority during the rule of both Henry VI
     and Edward IV.

     Candidates are required to give an account of the similarities and differences in the causes of weak
     royal authority during both reigns. Both kings had insecure claims to the throne, Henry’s claim came
     through dubious heredity and Edward’s claim was because of victory in battle. Both had wives who
     caused political difficulties; Margaret of Anjou’s favoured courtiers were very unpopular and
     Edward’s marriage led to a breach with Warwick. Both were forced from the throne temporarily
     undermining their authority. However, by 1471, Henry and the Lancastrians were no longer a threat
     to Edward. Both attempted to retain English influence in France and were unsuccessful, but Edward
     did secure a large pension from the Treaty of Picquigny. For contrast reference may be made to
     Henry’s phases of incapacity that led to political instability undermining his authority whereas once
     Edward was restored in 1471, he was able establish firm government and restore law and order
     therefore increasing royal authority until his death in 1483. Candidates’ opinions or conclusions will
     be presented clearly and supported by appropriate evidence.
                                                    –7–                   M22/3/HISTX/HP3/ENG/TZ0/EU/M


Section 4: The Renaissance (c1400–1600)

7.   “The wealth of Italian cities was the main cause of the Renaissance.” Discuss.

     The question requires that candidates offer a considered and balanced review of the statement that
     the wealth of Italian cities was the main cause of the Renaissance. Candidates may refer to the rise
     from the 12th century of city-states like Florence, Milan, and Venice. Most of them were republics
     that abandoned their old feudal structures, allowing new economic practices, especially in the field
     of commerce and banking. These activities enriched many of their citizens who acted as patrons of
     artists and intellectuals, who were also supported by monarchs, the nobles and the papacy.
     Candidates may challenge the statement by discussing the importance of maritime crossroads in
     the Mediterranean as one of the main causes for the intellectual and artistic interchanges that
     developed the Renaissance. There may be some discussion of scientific developments on
     intellectual activity and the reduction of the influence of religion. Also, the political and civic freedom
     enjoyed in these cities could be discussed as a main cause. Candidates’ opinions or conclusions will
     be presented clearly and supported by appropriate evidence.


8.   Examine the impact of literature during the Renaissance.

     The question requires that candidates examine the impact of literature during the Renaissance.
     Candidates may refer to the impact of a new literature written in vernacular languages, like the early
     works of Dante, Petrarch, and Machiavelli, and its new anthropocentric perspectives linked to
     Humanism and Greco-Roman topics. They may also examine the introduction of new literary genres
     (e.g. the essay) and new metrical forms like the sonnet. Candidates may also consider the printing
     of books initiated in Venice by Aldus Manutius that allowed the influence of the new literature to
     spread. Candidates may examine the limits of the impact of literature during the Renaissance
     arguing that many works still revolved around classic religious topics, while Latin and Greek were
     still considered languages of culture. Candidates may also refer to a number of geographical areas
     where the influence of the new literature was limited. Candidates’ opinions or conclusions will be
     presented clearly and supported by appropriate evidence.
                                                  –8–                  M22/3/HISTX/HP3/ENG/TZ0/EU/M


Section 5: The Age of Exploration and its impact (1400–1550)

9.    To what extent were national and personal rivalries the main motives for exploration in the 15th
      century?

      The question requires that candidates consider the merits or otherwise of the suggestion that
      national and personal rivalries were the main motives for exploration in the 15th century. Candidates
      may argue that national rivalries and the search for lands and wealth played a major role for royal
      families, as in the case of Portugal and Spain. Candidates may also refer to the flow of money and
      treasures that enriched Spain and Portugal, encouraging other European nations
      like England, France and the Netherlands to send expeditions. Other relevant factors may be
      addressed, for example, personal rivalries between nobles or explorers in search of fortune.
      Candidates may challenge the question by stating that these were not the main reasons for
      exploration since many voyages were motivated by the search for new routes to trade, and/or
      scientific and religious interests. Candidates’ opinions or conclusions will be presented clearly and
      supported by appropriate evidence.


10.   Examine the economic impact on Europe of the exploration of the New World.

      The question requires that candidates consider the economic impact on Europe of the exploration of
      the New World. Candidates may examine how the exploration of the New World allowed states like
      Portugal and Spain to increase their wealth and power with the acquisition of gold from the New
      World, leading other states such as England to participate in voyages of exploration to increase their
      wealth. They can also consider that the developments in cartography and navigation techniques
      were later applied in European regions like the Mediterranean, improving the transportation of
      products and trade. Candidates may also highlight that for many dispossessed men the exploration
      of the New World was an opportunity to gain lands and wealth. Candidates may discuss the limited
      economic impact of exploration by considering the standards of living of the peasant population in
      Europe. Candidates’ opinions or conclusions will be presented clearly and supported by appropriate
      evidence.
                                                    –9–                  M22/3/HISTX/HP3/ENG/TZ0/EU/M


Section 6: Aspects of the Reformation (c1500–1563)

11.   Discuss the impact of Erasmus’s ideas on the Catholic Church at the start of 16th century.

      The question requires that candidates offer a considered and balanced review of the impact of
      Erasmus’s ideas on the Catholic Church at the start of 16th century. Candidates may refer to
      Erasmus’s criticism on issues related to faith, piety, and grace, as well as his denouncement of a
      number of rituals as abuses. Erasmus’s ideas are also recognized as an initial groundwork for
      Luther's opinions and the future Reformation and had an impact on scholars like Jacques-Auguste
      de Thou and Hugo Grotius. Other relevant factors may be addressed, for example, his extensive
      scholarly projects such as the production of the first Greek New Testament (which gave theologians
      direct access to the original text), and the edition of reliable editions of patristic works. Candidates’
      opinions or conclusions will be presented clearly and supported by appropriate evidence.


12.   Examine the reasons for, and the impact of, the Knights’ Revolt in Germany.

      The question requires that candidates examine the reasons for, and the impact of, the Knights’
      Revolt in Germany. As reasons, candidates may refer to the fragile economic situation of many
      knights who suffered a decline in the value of their lands; they could not compete with the growth of
      trade and industries in the cities; and suffered from innovations in military tactics that lessened their
      status. They resented the growing power of princes and the introduction of new codes inspired by
      Roman law that were disadvantageous for many of them. Candidates may also address the
      unsuccessful attempt to improve the knights’ representation in the Reichstag, the banning of private
      warfare, and the rejection of their right to plunder Roman Catholic prelates as reasons for the
      rebellion. After their defeat and as impacts of the revolt candidates may examine the situation of
      many knights who had their castles confiscated, their imposition of heavy taxes on peasants, and
      the influence the Knights’ Revolt had on the peasant’s refusal to pay church tithes. Candidates’
      opinions or conclusions will be presented clearly and supported by appropriate evidence.
                                                   – 10 –               M22/3/HISTX/HP3/ENG/TZ0/EU/M


Section 7: Absolutism and Enlightenment (1650–1800)

13.   Compare and contrast the extent of the power of two absolutist monarchs.

      The question requires that candidates give an account of the similarities and differences between
      two absolutist monarchs in terms of the extent of their power. Candidates may refer to their qualities
      as leaders and their identification with their states. Candidates may also consider their capacity to
      limit the political role played by medieval institutions like the Church, the feudal lords, and the
      customary law. Candidates may argue that both Louis XIV and Peter the Great gained greater control
      of the nobility by moving the royal courts to Versailles and St Petersburg, removing the nobility from
      their local power bases. Candidates may also compare and contrast the extent of their economic
      power and their success in expanding their kingdoms. The extent of their control of trade, the tax
      system, diplomacy, and their role as military leaders may also be considered. Some examples that
      candidates may compare and contrast are: Louis XIV of France, the Tsarist autocracy in Russia, and
      Philip V of Spain. Candidates’ opinions or conclusions will be presented clearly and supported by
      appropriate evidence.


14.   “Social and economic change in the Enlightenment era was limited.” Discuss.

      The question requires that candidates offer a considered and balanced review of the statement that
      social and economic change in the Enlightenment era was limited. To support the statement,
      candidates may consider the privileges the nobility retained, the authority of the Church over the
      population, and the preservation of traditional values within peasant communities, among other
      factors. Candidates may also state that many feudal practices still regulated access to the land, trade
      and the tax system. Candidates may challenge the statement discussing the impact of the new
      philosophical and scientific ideas on society and economy, the changes in the international market,
      and the early stages of industrialization. Candidates may also point out that many monarchs
      embraced the Enlightenment introducing new laws to modernize their kingdoms. Candidates’
      opinions or conclusions will be presented clearly and supported by appropriate evidence.

Section 8: The French Revolution and Napoleon I (1774–1815)

15.   “Social inequality was the main cause of the French Revolution of 1789.” Discuss.

      Candidates should offer a considered and balanced review of a range of causes of the 1789
      revolution. Many will agree with the statement arguing that the estates system with its inherent
      inequalities, both social and financial, was the main cause of the Revolution. Others may argue that
      a range of factors combined to cause revolution and that no one factor was more significant. There
      may be discussion of the indecisive rule of Louis XVI with frequent ministerial change (Calonne,
      Necker) and the increasing unpopularity of the “extravagant” monarchy. There may be discussion of
      the financial crisis caused by government debt because of war in America, an inefficient taxation
      system and bad harvests. Some might point out that the initial stages of the Revolution were
      instigated by some of the nobility and the lawyers of the Third Estate who were attempting to reform
      the government of Louis XVI. Candidates’ opinions or conclusions will be presented clearly and
      supported by appropriate evidence.


16.   Examine the reasons for the failure of the Directory and the rise of Napoleon I.

      Candidates should consider the interrelationship between problems with the Directory and the
      emergence of Napoleon I as a political leader. Some may discuss reasons why the Directory was
      established such as the desire for political stability; to control revolutionary excess and to strengthen
      the economy. Evidence of failure could include the number of attempted coups (Prairial,
      Vendemaire); the collapse of the assignat and near famine conditions. The Directory was perceived
      as corrupt and self-seeking and became increasingly unpopular. The army was politically significant
      as a means of maintaining order. Napoleon was personally popular because of success in Italy and
      in 1799 the threat of a Jacobin revolt meant that Sieyes encouraged him to stage the coup of
      Brumaire to bring order in France. Candidates may well argue that the reasons for both events were
      interrelated, the weakness of the Directory providing an opportunity for Napoleon. Candidates’
      opinions or conclusions will be presented clearly and supported by appropriate evidence.

Section 9: France 1815–1914

17.   Examine the reasons for political instability in France during the reign of Louis XVIII.

      Candidates should consider the range of factors that contributed to political instability in France
      between 1814–1824. During the first restoration, Louis XVIII’s policies were not always popular, he
      guaranteed property rights even of church and émigré land. The parliamentary system was based
      on royal prerogative and he adopted the Bourbon flag, but this failed to reconcile Bonapartists
      contributing to support for Napoleon upon his return from Elba. It could be argued the 100 Days
      increased political divisions as it was followed by a White Terror with the execution of Ney and many
      other Bonapartists. The Chamber of 1815 was dominated by Ultras. However, some reforms were
      made (a liberal press and electoral law) between 1816 and 1820. But, after the murder of the Duc
      de Berry, fear of revolution and fear of Bonapartists led to the Ultras forcing reactionary policies on
      the King. The main reason for instability were the tensions between moderates and Ultras and the
      divisions between Royalists, Bonapartists, and Republicans. Candidates’ opinions or conclusions
      will be presented clearly and supported by appropriate evidence.


18.   “The weakness of the Second Republic led to the establishment of the Second Empire.” Discuss.

      Candidates should offer a considered and balanced review of the problems of the Second Republic
      and how they may have contributed to the establishment of the Second Empire. There may be
      discussion of radical policies after February 1848 (adult male suffrage, abolition of censorship and
      the National Workshops). The Constituent Assembly was dominated by centrists and right wingers
      who were reluctant to raise taxes for social reform. By May/June many of the reforms were
      dismantled leading to the June Days and the suppression of revolutionaries by Cavaignac. The
      public disorder highlighted the weakness of the Republic especially its reliance on the army to control
      the situation. Louis Napoleon won the November election by five and half million votes. In a largely
      conservative nation, he promised stability and order and possible social reform. Louis Napoleon was
      able to use the presidency to stage a coup in 1851 to establish the Second Empire. The main
      weakness of the Second Republic was that it was too radical, and its main support was in Paris.
      Candidates’ opinions or conclusions will be presented clearly and supported by appropriate
      evidence.

Section 10: Society, politics and economy in Britain and Ireland (1815–1914)

19.   Examine the impact of the Peterloo Massacre on politics up to 1830.

      Candidates should make an appraisal of the impact of the Peterloo Massacre (1819) on political
      attitudes up to 1830. Candidates may set the context for political agitation, referring to the post-war
      recession, fluctuating employment levels and high food prices. The immediate impact of Peterloo
      was to extend the policy of repression with the passage of the Six Acts increasing the power of
      magistrates to deal with unrest. By the mid 1820s, the Liberal Tories (Peel, Huskisson) were
      introducing reforms to address some of the causes of agitation. Peel reformed the jails, the
      Combination Laws were repealed and Huskisson was able to improve trade, thus reducing prices. It
      could be argued that in the medium term Peterloo led to some liberal policies from the government.
      It might also be argued that these policies were designed to reduce demand for electoral reform
      which had been a demand of the demonstrators at Peterloo. Candidates’ opinions or conclusions
      will be presented clearly and supported by appropriate evidence.


20.   Discuss the reasons why British governments were unable to resolve the Irish Question in the
      second half of the 19th century.

      The question requires that candidates offer a considered and balanced review of the reasons why
      the Irish Question was unsolved. Some may argue that Irish demands were constantly shifting.
      During Gladstone’s first ministry the demands were for reform of land tenure and reducing the
      influence of the Anglican Church. By his second ministry, the demand was for Home Rule.
      Increasingly violent agitation with the emergence of the Fenians, also made the situation hard to
      resolve. Government policy was often inconsistent; both the Liberals and the Tories offered reform
      (Kilmainham Treaty, Land Purchase Act) that was often followed by repression (Gladstone’s
      Coercion Acts and Balfour’s Crimes Act). Arguably, all governments were hindered by the actions of
      entrenched interests in parliament such as Anglo-Irish landowners and Anglican Bishops. In 1886
      and 1893, Liberal Unionists joined with the Conservatives to block Home Rule. Candidates’ opinions
      or conclusions will be presented clearly and supported by appropriate evidence.

Section 11: Italy (1815–1871) and Germany (1815–1890)

21.   “Foreign intervention was the main cause of the defeat of the 1848–1849 Revolutions in Italy.”
      Discuss.

      Candidates should offer a considered and balanced review of the factors that led to the defeat of the
      Revolutions in Italy in 1848–1849. Some may argue there was no real unity of purpose. Piedmont
      was keen to extend its power in northern Italy. In Rome, Venice and Milan, the desire was to establish
      republics and unify Italy. In Sicily, the aim was to gain independence from Naples. Piedmont was
      largely unsupported by the rest of revolutionary Italy. Piedmont was defeated at Custoza and signed
      an armistice, but in 1849 declared war again and was defeated at Novara. To agree with the
      statement, responses may discuss the recovery of Austria and the activities of other powers. The
      Austrians regained control in the Central Duchies and Lombardy, the Venetian Republic collapsed
      without aid from Piedmont. In Naples, Ferdinand regained control with French mercenaries and the
      Roman Republic collapsed when Louis Napoleon sent aid to the Pope. Candidates’ opinions or
      conclusions will be presented clearly and supported by appropriate evidence.


22.   Examine the role of Prussia in the consolidation of the new German state after 1871.

      The question requires that candidates examine the relationship between Prussia and the new
      German state. The head of state (Kaiser) was by hereditary right the King of Prussia. The constitution
      of the new state gave Prussia an automatic veto in the Reichstag and Bundesrat. The Kaiser
      appointed the government that controlled key areas such as foreign policy, defence, coinage and
      customs. Responses may argue that Prussian dominance in government ensured the consolidation
      of the new state. Others may point out that some states were allowed a measure of autonomy, which
      reconciled them to Prussian dominance (Bavaria controlled her own railways and troops in
      peacetime). Bismarck, as Chancellor, arguably played a key role in consolidating the new state. He
      ended the Kulturkampf after protests from South German states ensuring they remained loyal to the
      Kaiser. Prussia’s economic and political dominance were central to the consolidation of the new
      federal state. Candidates’ opinions or conclusions will be presented clearly and supported by
      appropriate evidence.

Section 12: Imperial Russia, revolution and the establishment of the Soviet Union (1855–1924)

23.   Evaluate the effectiveness of Stolypin’s policies in stabilizing Russia after the 1905 Revolution.

      The question requires that candidates make an appraisal of Stolypin’s policies after the 1905
      Revolution and assess whether they resolved the underlying problems in Russia. Responses may
      point out that Stolypin’s policies were a mixture of repression (Stolypin’s Necktie) and reform. He
      introduced land reform, freeing peasants from the Mir and establishing the Peasants Land Bank in
      an attempt to form a loyal kulak class. Some may argue that this was too little, too late and that
      peasant discontent pre-1914 indicated the limits of this policy. Politically, the empire appeared stable
      but it could be argued that this was a consequence of the alteration of electoral law to produce a
      compliant Duma and the suppression of radical opposition. In the pre-war period after Stolypin’s
      death there were many outbreaks of discontent (Lena Goldfield Strike) supporting the view that
      Stolypin’s policies were only effective to a limited extent. Candidates’ opinions or conclusions will be
      presented clearly and supported by appropriate evidence.


24.   “Lenin was able to consolidate power by 1924 because of his use of force.” To what extent do you
      agree with this statement?

      The question requires that the candidates consider the merits of the statement with reference to
      Lenin’s consolidation of power. Responses may refer to Lenin’s willingness to use force at crucial
      times. Evidence could include the closing of the Constituent Assembly, the Red Terror, the deaths
      of the Imperial family, the quelling of the 1921 Kronstadt rebellion and the setting up of the one-party
      state by 1922. Bolshevik victory in the Civil War also aided the consolidation of power. Others may
      argue that Lenin’s policies also ensured the consolidation of Bolshevik power, for example, the
      Decrees on Peace and Land were very popular. War Communism helped ensure Bolshevik victory
      in the Civil War. Lenin’s adaptability was also an important factor, he introduced the NEP to end
      widespread protests against War Communism. Some may conclude that the consolidation of power
      resulted from a combination of the use of force and of popular policies. Candidates’ opinions or
      conclusions will be presented clearly and supported by appropriate evidence.

Section 13: Europe and the First World War (1871–1918)

25.   “Imperial expansion in Africa and Asia had a significant impact on European diplomacy.” Discuss.

      The question requires that candidates offer a considered and balanced review of the statement that
      Imperial expansion in Africa and Asia had a significant impact on European diplomacy. To support
      the statement candidates may argue that disputes arising from imperial expansion did have a clear
      effect on European diplomacy, eg Jameson Raid, Kruger Telegram, Fashoda and the two Moroccan
      crises. The creation and development of the Entente Cordiale could be linked to these events.
      Candidates may challenge the statement and argue that imperial expansion in Africa and Asia had
      little or no impact on European diplomacy. Instead, they could stress the importance of events in
      Europe, especially the Balkans in the years up until 1914 in influencing European diplomacy. In
      addition, there were long-running tensions between France and Germany that impacted European
      diplomacy. Candidates’ opinions or conclusions will be presented clearly and supported by
      appropriate evidence.


26.   To what extent did the Alliance system lead to the outbreak of the First World War?

      The question requires that candidates consider the merits or otherwise of the suggestion that the
      Alliance system led to the outbreak of the First World War. Candidates could discuss the
      development of two armed camps in Europe, the Triple Entente and the Triple Alliance. There may
      be a discussion of the various crises in the decade prior to war that strengthened the two alliances.
      There may be reference to the annexation of Bosnia-Herzegovina in 1908 and the two Moroccan
      Crises as events that led to stronger ties within the alliances. These crises often led to an
      unwillingness to back down in the future. Candidates may argue that Austria Hungary took a hard
      line with Serbia after Sarajevo because of the strong alliance with Germany citing the Blank Cheque.
      Others may argue that the Alliance system was not a major cause of the outbreak of the war but had
      a “domino effect” of expanding the war once the conflict had begun in July 1914. Others may argue
      that underlying causes such as imperialism, the Naval race, nationalism (especially in the Balkans)
      contributed to long-term tensions and that the Alliance system had developed because of these
      tensions. Candidates’ opinions or conclusions will be presented clearly and supported by appropriate
      evidence.

Section 14: Inter-war domestic developments in European states (1918–1939)

27.   To what extent was popular support the main reason for Hitler becoming Chancellor in January
      1933?

      The question requires that candidates consider the merits of the view that popular support was the
      key factor in Hitler becoming Chancellor. Responses may argue that the Nazis were the largest party
      in the Reichstag with 230 deputies in July 1932 making Hitler a potential Chancellor. He also had
      the backing of elite groups (big business and the army), because they feared communism. Others
      may discuss the weakness of the Weimar Republic with political parties unwilling to work together
      for a stable government. Undemocratic methods (Article 48) were overused and democracy had
      ended by 1930, making Hitler more acceptable. Alternatively, it could be argued that Nazi support
      was declining, (November 1932 they had 192 deputies), that it was the plotters around the president
      who convinced him to make Hitler Chancellor. Some may argue that the failure of Weimar to deal
      with the impact of the Depression led to Hitler’s rise as a national politician. Candidates’ opinions or
      conclusions will be presented clearly and supported by appropriate evidence.


28.   Examine the reasons for political change in the inter-war years in one European country (other
      than Germany, Italy or Spain).

      The question requires that candidates consider the reasons for political change in their chosen state.
      Established states such as Great Britain and France would be appropriate as would any of the states
      which were established as a consequence of the post-war settlement. Possible reasons could
      include a drift to the right because of discontent with the post-war treaties (Hungary for example was
      a revisionist state). Economic factors could be a key reason for political change in any state,
      particularly the impact of the Great Depression. In some cases, fear of communism had a significant
      impact on politics: in Hungary, Horthy’s position was strengthened by his anti-communist stance.
      Similarly, Salazar in Portugal gained support because of his anti-communist views. Reasons will vary
      depending on the chosen exemplar. Candidates’ opinions or conclusions will be presented clearly
      and supported by appropriate evidence.

Section 15: Diplomacy in Europe (1919–1945)

29.   To what extent had the Paris peace treaties (1919–1923) achieved their aims by 1929?

      The question requires that candidates consider whether the aims of the peace makers had been
      achieved by 1929. Responses may broadly identify some key aims, such as, stabilizing Europe both
      politically and economically; preventing the spread of communism and establishing an organization
      to maintain stability (League of Nations). Candidates may argue that these were largely achieved by
      1929 but that there were underlying weaknesses. Other responses may focus on individual
      peacemakers and their aims. Orlando was extremely unhappy about the terms of St Germain as it
      failed to give Italy territory that had been promised in the 1915 Treaty of London. Lloyd George was
      reasonably satisfied with the economic recompense Britain received but by 1929 Great Britain
      realized that reparations were problematic. Clemenceau wanted a weak Germany but by 1929
      Germany was again a major power. Candidates’ opinions or conclusions will be presented clearly
      and supported by appropriate evidence.


30.   “The weakness of collective security was the main reason for Chamberlain’s signing of the Munich
      Agreement.” Discuss.

      The question requires that candidates offer a considered and balanced review of the reasons
      Chamberlain signed the Munich Agreement. Some may agree with the statement arguing that
      collective security as a policy had been weakened since the early 1930s and that nations only
      cooperated when it suited their own national agenda. This had been demonstrated over the
      Abyssinian Crisis. Other reasons could include how Britain was unwilling to back French support of
      Czechoslovakia because Britain feared Soviet expansion into western Europe in the wake of the
      Franco-Soviet Pact of 1935. Neither Britain nor France were militarily strong enough to prevent an
      attack on Czechoslovakia. Others may argue that Chamberlain was still committed to the policy of
      appeasement and he was convinced that he could avoid a war if he reached a settlement with Hitler.
      A third line of argument could be that Chamberlain signed the Munich Agreement because he had
      no other option, he needed to buy time for Britain and France to prepare for war. Candidates’
      opinions or conclusions will be presented clearly and supported by appropriate evidence.

Section 16: The Soviet Union and post-Soviet Russia (1924–2000)

31.   Discuss the reasons why Stalin was able to become leader of the Soviet Union by 1929.

      The question requires that candidates discuss the reasons why Stalin was able to become leader of
      the Soviet Union by 1929. Candidates may refer to Stalin’s strategies to gain prestige from
      presenting himself as Lenin’s chosen successor in spite of Lenin’s Testament. They may discuss his
      role at Lenin’s funeral and Trotsky’s non appearance. Candidates may also underline the importance
      of his position as General Secretary of the Communist Party. This position allowed him to increase
      his support in the Party via the Lenin Enrollment. He maneuvered between factions to defeat his
      various rivals; first of all, isolating Trotsky and then expelling Kamenev and Zinoviev from the Party.
      He used the debate on the New Economic Policy (NEP) to reduce the influence of Bukharin and the
      Right. Having adopted the policy of “Socialism in One Country” which was popular in the Party, he
      reinterpreted it to push for Collectivisation and Industrialization. Candidates’ opinions or conclusions
      will be presented clearly and supported by appropriate evidence.


32.   “Post-Soviet Russia experienced more economic change than political change up to 2000.”
      Discuss.

      The question requires that candidates offer a considered and balanced review of the statement that
      post-Soviet Russia experienced more economic change than political change up to 2000.
      Candidates may offer equal coverage of economic and political changes, or they may prioritize the
      discussion of one of them. However, both aspects will be a feature of the response. Regarding the
      political changes, candidates may discuss new policies introduced by Gorbachev and Yeltsin; the
      long term impact of the glasnost policy; the foundation of the Russian Federation; its new
      constitution; and the performance of the new multi-party system. Regarding economic
      developments, candidates may discuss the consequences of the perestroika policy; the extent of the
      privatization of the economy; market liberalization; the impact on currency, salaries, and
      employment. Candidates’ opinions or conclusions will be presented clearly and supported by
      appropriate evidence.

Section 17: Post-war western and northern Europe (1945–2000)

33.   “The state played the most significant role in achieving economic recovery during
      ‘Les Trente Glorieuses’ in France.” Discuss.

      The question requires that candidates offer a considered and balanced review of the statement that
      the    state   played the       most     significant    role  in achieving economic recovery during
      “Les Trente Glorieuses” in France. Candidates may support the statement citing redistributive plans
      and state policies to avoid inequalities and inflation. Candidates may also refer to the creation of
      state planning institutions such as the DATAR, and the participation of France in the European
      Economic Community, (EEC) that also helped economic recovery. Candidates may challenge the
      statement discussing the positive impact of the Marshall Plan and the Bretton Woods Agreement;
      population growth that led to increased economic activity; the role played by private companies; as
      well as scientific and technical progress that aided economic recovery. Candidates’ opinions or
      conclusions will be presented clearly and supported by appropriate evidence.

34.   Evaluate the social changes in one western or northern European country (other than France, the
      Federal Republic of Germany and Spain) between 1945–2000.

      The question requires that candidates make an appraisal of the social changes in one western or
      northern European country (other than France, the Federal Republic of Germany and Spain)
      between 1945–2000. Candidates may refer to the emergence of democracies and the changes they
      brought in terms of freedom of speech and freedom of association. Candidates may also evaluate
      changes in the population due to migrations and/or population growth. Other relevant factors may
      be addressed, for example the foundation of welfare states that allowed governments to offer
      education and health services. Some candidates may discuss the declining influence of religion in
      society, for example in Italy. Candidates may also refer to the recognition of minorities’ rights and
      the introduction of gender issues to the political agenda as examples of social changes. Candidates’
      opinions or conclusions will be presented clearly and supported by appropriate evidence.

Section 18: Post-war central and eastern Europe (1945–2000)

35.   “Repression was the main reason for Soviet domination between 1945 and 1968.” Discuss with
      reference to two of the following countries: East Germany, Poland, Hungary, Czechoslovakia.

      The question requires that candidates offer a considered and balanced review of the statement that
      repression was the main reason for Soviet domination between 1945 and 1968, considering two of
      the named countries. Candidates may support the statement discussing the hierarchical authority
      imposed by the Soviet Union; the mobilization of Soviet troops; the suppression of any possible
      dissent, such as the 1956 Revolution in Hungary and the Prague Spring in 1968. Candidates may
      challenge the statement by arguing that Soviet domination was based on different factors besides
      repression for example: economic bonds as evidenced by the establishment of COMECON; the
      Warsaw Pact; the support of part of the population; the role played by loyal local leaders, such as
      Gomulka from Poland and the diplomatic and economic relations between the Soviet Union and East
      Germany. Candidates’ opinions or conclusions will be presented clearly and supported by
      appropriate evidence.


36.   Examine the social and economic challenges faced by one country in central or eastern Europe
      from 1989 to 2000.

      The question requires that candidates consider the social and economic challenges faced
      by one country in central or eastern Europe from 1989 to 2000. Among the economic factors,
      candidates may examine the consequences of the dissolution of the Soviet Union and the loss of
      industrial and financial assistance. They can also consider the difficulties of changing from a
      command economy into a capitalist one, and the challenges to adapt their markets to international
      trade. Other relevant factors that candidates may examine are the struggles against unemployment
      and the fall in wages as a consequence of the end of state support. Regarding social challenges,
      candidates may examine the emergence of nationalist and ethnic movements, for example in the
      states of the former Yugoslavia. In other countries such as Romania, the loss of population due to
      migration, and the struggle to maintain public services were significant social and economic
      challenges. Candidates’ opinions or conclusions will be presented clearly and supported by
      appropriate evidence.
