 0         Answers do not reach a standard described by the descriptors below.


Examiners are reminded of the need to apply the markbands that provide the “best fit” to the responses
given by candidates and to award credit wherever it is possible to do so. If an answer indicates that
the demands of the question are understood and addressed but that not all implications are
considered (for example, compare or contrast; reasons or significance; methods or success),
then examiners should not be afraid of using the full range of marks allowed for by the markscheme:
as such, responses that offer good coverage of some of the criteria should be rewarded accordingly.

For the attention of all examiners: if you are uncertain about the content/accuracy of a
candidate’s work please contact your team leader.

Topic 1: Society and economy (750–1400)

1.   Examine changes in social structures and systems in two societies.

     The question requires that candidates consider changes in social structures and systems in two
     societies. The two societies may or may not come from the same region. Changes may extend
     beyond the timeframe, but they must be clearly linked to the issue raised by the question. There
     may be examination of the role of women in, for example, Song China, where foot-binding and
     concubinage became common. Candidates may examine the growth of city states, and a
     prosperous merchant class, on the east African coast, and the formation of Swahili culture. The
     impact of the Black Death and the growth and decline of feudalism in Western European society
     may be examined. Some societies, such as the Aztecs, became less itinerant. Candidates may
     also examine urbanization in China, where a new scholarly and bureaucratic elite emerged, and
     the development of the caste system in India. Candidates’ opinions or conclusions will be
     presented clearly and supported by appropriate evidence.


2.   Examine the reasons for the spread of religion in two societies, each chosen from a different
     region.

     The question requires that candidates consider the interrelationships between the various reasons
     for the spread of religion in two societies, which must be from different regions. Reasons may
     predate the timeframe, but they must be clearly linked to the issue raised in the question. There
     may be an examination of the roles of various rulers, for example Byzantine Emperor Michael III, in
     building on the work of earlier missionaries to Serbia and Bulgaria; or of the roles of Viking kings,
     such as Harald Bluetooth in Scandinavia. There may be an examination of the role of bad harvests
     and natural disasters in promoting the spread of religion in, for example, Mochica society. The
     spread of Islam in the ‘Abbasid kingdoms as a result of the intellectual flowering of the Islamic
     Golden Age may be examined, while trade played a vital role in spreading Islam to East Africa.
     Candidates’ opinions or conclusions will be presented clearly and supported by appropriate
     evidence.
                                                 –5–                 M22/3/HISTX/BP2/ENG/TZ2/XX/M


Topic 2: Causes and effects of wars (750–1500)

3.   Evaluate the significance of leaders to the outcomes of two wars in the period 750–1500, each
     chosen from a different region.

     The question requires that candidates make an appraisal of the significance of leaders to the
     outcome of two wars in the period 750–-1500, weighing up their significance or otherwise. The two
     wars must be from different regions, but the leaders may or may not be from the same region.
     Candidates may evaluate the leader’s personal characteristics and how these contributed in a
     positive or negative manner to the outcome of the war, for example Henry V’s courage and
     decisiveness in battle. Candidates may make an appraisal of the ability of the leaders to recognize
     able generals and follow their military advice, as done by Genghis Khan with Subutai and Jebe.
     Conversely, candidates may evaluate their willingness to follow ill-fated counsel such as Zhu
     Qizhen’s readiness to enact Wang Zhen’s advice before the Battle of Tumu, which resulted in his
     capture. Candidates may also evaluate tactical decisions made by leaders to gain an advantage
     over their enemies, for example Saladin’s selection of battlefields for the battle of Hattin. Other
     relevant factors may be addressed, for example technological advances or alliances, but with a
     focus on the issue in the question. Candidates’ opinions or conclusions will be presented clearly
     and supported by appropriate evidence.


4.   “Wars had limited long-term political impact.” With reference to two wars in the period 750–1500,
     to what extent do you agree with this statement?

     The question requires that candidates consider the merits or otherwise of the statement that wars
     had limited long-term political impact. The two wars may or may not be from the same region.
     Candidates may offer equal coverage of both wars or they may prioritize their assessment of one
     over the other. However, both wars will be a feature of the response. Candidates may disagree
     with the statement and focus on wars with significant long-term political impact via the annexation
     by foreign powers or via the achievement of independence. Appropriate examples may include the
     defeat of the Byzantine Empire in 1453, or the First War of Scottish Independence. Candidates
     may also discuss civil wars, such as the First Barons' War or the Red Turban Rebellion, and
     consider their long-term political impact for rulers. Conversely, candidates may agree with the
     statement and consider limited political changes, as seen in the Hundred Years’ War where the
     House of Valois retained the French crown, or in wars of succession with contenders from the
     same lineage. Candidates’ opinions or conclusions will be presented clearly and supported by
     appropriate evidence.
                                                  –6–                  M22/3/HISTX/BP2/ENG/TZ2/XX/M


Topic 3: Dynasties and rulers (750–1500)

5.   Compare and contrast the methods used by two rulers to maintain their rule.

     The question requires that candidates give an account of the similarities and differences between
     two rulers in terms of the methods used to maintain their rule, referring to both throughout. There
     does not need to be an equal number of each. The two rulers may or may not be from the same
     region. Candidates may refer to the steps taken by rulers to achieve a unified empire by
     establishing a common legal system, as done by the Mongol use of the Yassa code; or by
     establishing an efficient bureaucratic system as done by the Song dynasty. Other appropriate
     examples may include steps taken to address economic or social distress via monetary reforms, as
     done by Charlemagne via the introduction of livre carolienne and price controls. Additional factors
     may include the creation of a loyal army and their role in the subjugation of rebellious groups, as in
     the case of Abd al-Rahman who had to contend with challenges by the Muwallads or the
     insurgency of Umar ibn Hafsun.


6.   Examine the effects of religious and secular law on the administration of two states, each chosen
     from a different region.

     The question requires that candidates consider the interrelationship between religious and secular
     law and their effect on the administration of two states. The two states must be from different
     regions. Candidates may offer equal coverage of religious law and secular law, or they may
     prioritize their examination of one of them. However, both aspects will be a feature of the response.
     Whenever religious and secular law coexisted, candidates may wish to consider the clarity of their
     separation, and relative importance. Candidates may examine the effect of religious law on
     administration by focusing on mutual legitimization, or conversely on conflicts between rulers and
     religious leaders, as seen between Pope Innocent III and King John I over Stephen Langton. With
     regard to secular laws, candidates may wish to examine the effects of different types of laws on
     administration. Candidates may discuss traditional legal systems, such as Xeer law in Somalia, or
     uniform legal codes, such as the Mongol Yassa. It would be valid to consider the effects of secular
     law on administration by examining legal limits placed on governing bodies, for example the Magna
     Carta. Candidates’ opinions or conclusions will be presented clearly and supported by appropriate
     evidence.
                                                  –7–                  M22/3/HISTX/BP2/ENG/TZ2/XX/M


Topic 4: Societies in transition (1400–1700)

7.   Examine the impact of scientific and technological developments on two societies, each chosen
     from a different region.

     The question requires that the candidates consider the interrelationships between scientific and
     technological developments and society. The two societies must be chosen from a different region.
     Candidates may refer to developments in navigation as well as marine technology, which impacted
     the economy of both Spain and Portugal. Developments in metallurgy and rocketry in Mughal India
     may be examined in relation to its struggle against the expansion of the East India Company. Also
     of relevance would be the economic impact of developments in the production and circulation of
     silver coinage. The developments of armaments and their use to enslave communities in Africa
     may be examined. In Europe, the development of the Gutenberg press, leading to the vastly
     increased availability of printed books, may be examined and the impact this had upon the spread
     of Protestantism. Candidates’ opinions or conclusions will be presented clearly and supported by
     appropriate evidence.


8.   “Religious discrimination and persecution were the main cause of religious change.” Discuss.

     The question requires that the candidate offer a considered and balanced review of the statement
     that religious discrimination and persecution were the main cause of religious change. The
     examples chosen may or may not be from a different region and the causes outlined may predate
     or extend beyond the timeframe but must be clearly linked to the issue raised in the question.
     Candidates may discuss discrimination against and persecution of Jews during the Reconquista
     period in Spain. Although, initially, this led to the conversion of many to Christianity, persecution
     continued limiting change. Similarly, the persecution of native populations in the Spanish Empire
     may be argued to have led to religious change. Other appropriate examples may include the
     spread of Islam in India during the Mughal Empire and the conversion, as well as persecution, of
     Christians in Shogunate Japan. Other relevant factors may be addressed, such as the spread of
     literacy and the availability of printed texts as well as wars, which may have brought religious
     change in their wake. Candidates’ opinions or conclusions will be presented clearly and supported
     by appropriate evidence.
                                                   –8–                  M22/3/HISTX/BP2/ENG/TZ2/XX/M


Topic 5: Early Modern states (1450–1789)

9.    “Rulers rarely achieved their ambitions.” Discuss, with reference to two rulers, each chosen from a
      different region.

      The question requires that candidates offer a considered and balanced review of the statement
      that rulers rarely achieved their ambitions. The two rulers must be from different regions. The
      period of rule may predate or extend beyond the timeframe, but the discussion must be clearly
      linked to the issue raised in the question. The failure of George III of England to retain the 13
      colonies may be discussed as an example of thwarted ambition. It may be argued that the
      achievements of Suleiman the Magnificent did equal his ambitions although he died before
      reaching the gates of Vienna. It may be argued that the achievements of Elizabeth I of England
      kept pace with her ambition to retain control over the throne and to secure the Tudor legacy.
      Despite the cost of his military campaigns, the expansion of territory under the control of the
      Kiangsi Emperor of the Ming dynasty in China may also be used to refute the statement.
      Candidates’ opinions or conclusions will be presented clearly and supported by appropriate
      evidence.


10.   Compare and contrast the treatment of internal opposition in two states.

      The question requires that candidates give an account of the similarities and differences between
      the treatment of internal opposition in two states, referring to both throughout. The two states may
      or may not be from the same region. Candidates may refer to military methods used to treat
      opposition, which was paramount in the case of the Inca Wars; in contrast, there may be reference
      to the complexities of Elizabeth I’s “middle way” or the combination of military force with negotiation
      (Diet of Worms) which characterized Charles V’s handling of the Lutheran princes. King Wegbaja
      of Dahomey subjugated rival tribes by extending royal land ownership, taxation of agricultural
      produce and primogeniture, while Akbar, having vanquished his opponents in battle, made
      matrimonial alliances and established religious toleration. The Manchus may have killed up to 25
      million in defeating opposition in China but consolidated their rule by establishing the Confucian
      style of hierarchical government.
                                                  –9–                  M22/3/HISTX/BP2/ENG/TZ2/XX/M


Topic 6: Causes and effects of Early Modern wars (1500–1750)

11.   To what extent was foreign involvement the main factor which determined the outcome of two
      wars?

      The question requires that candidates consider the merits or otherwise of the suggestion that
      foreign involvement was the main factor which determined the outcome of two wars. The two wars
      may or may not come from the same region. Candidates may appraise the influence of the Somalis
      and Portuguese who fought on opposite sides in the Ethiopian–Adal War (1529–1543) or the role
      of the English and the French in the Dutch War of Independence. Chinese aid to the Koreans was
      arguably vital to their resistance to the Japanese in the 1590s; candidates may also appraise the
      roles of the French and British intervention in the Beaver Wars of the late 17th century or the role
      of mercenaries, such as the Swiss, who fought in numerous European wars. Other relevant factors
      may be addressed, for example the quality of leadership, geographical factors, good or ill fortune,
      weaponry and tactics, and financial and military resources. Candidates’ opinions or conclusions will
      be presented clearly and supported by appropriate evidence.


12.   Discuss the successes and failures of peacemaking after two wars.

      The question requires that candidates offer a considered and balanced review of the successes
      and failures of peacemaking. The two wars may or may not be from the same region. Successes
      and failures may extend beyond the timeframe, but they must be clearly linked to the issues raised
      in the question. Candidates may offer equal coverage of successes and failures, or they may
      prioritize their discussion of one of them. However, both aspects will be a feature of the response.
      Successes could include the establishment of peaceful relations between native American tribes
      and the French by the Great Peace of Montreal (1701) and the lasting peace between Russia and
      China achieved by the Treaty of Nerchinsk (1689). In contrast, the unequal Burmese–Siamese
      Treaty (1549) proved to be only a temporary halt to hostilities which lasted intermittently for 300
      years. There may be discussion of the great European treaties of the period, Cateau-Cambresis
      (1559) and Utrecht (1713), whose successes and failures could, perhaps, best be judged through
      the eyes of the protagonists. Candidates’ opinions or conclusions will be presented clearly and
      supported by appropriate evidence.
                                                    – 10 –                 M22/3/HISTX/BP2/ENG/TZ2/XX/M


Topic 7: Origins, development and impact of industrialization (1750–2005)

13.   To what extent was political stability the main factor which enabled industrialization in two
      countries?

      The question requires that candidates consider the merits or otherwise of the suggestion that
      political stability was the main factor which enabled industrialization in two countries. The two
      countries may or may not be from the same region. Candidates may consider the extent by which
      political stability facilitated industrialization by providing capitalists with a reasonable certainty that
      resources invested were safe from the risk of political upheaval. An appropriate example may
      include England after the Glorious Revolution, where funds were injected into an increasingly
      sophisticated finance system enabling investment in industrialization. Additionally, political stability
      may have provided the opportunity to design and implement long-term programmes that support
      industrialization, such as Witte's reforms in Russia in the 1890s or Park’s export-led model in
      Korea in 1960s. Candidates may also wish to consider how politically stable countries may become
      attractive to foreign investors and benefit from the insertion of foreign capital, for instance the
      introduction of Maquiladoras in Mexico. Other relevant factors that enabled industrialization may be
      addressed, for example the availability of human and natural resources and infrastructure, but with
      a focus on the issue in the question. Candidates’ opinions or conclusions will be presented clearly
      and supported by appropriate evidence.


14.   Examine the impact of developments in energy and power on industrialization in two countries,
      each chosen from a different region.

      The question requires that candidates consider the interrelationship between developments in
      energy and power and industrialization. The two countries must be from different regions.
      Candidates may consider the introduction of steam power during the First Industrial Revolution in
      relation to the impact of having an effective and cheap alternative to manual labour. Candidates
      may examine the links between the reduction in the price of goods, the increase in demand, and
      the impetus to industrialization. Candidates may also examine the impact of developments in
      gas and electricity in enabling mechanization, as well as in extension of working hours in better-lit
      factories. Similarly, the use of electricity to power telegraphs, telephones, radios and trams
      facilitated transport and communication in new industrialized urban centres. Candidates may
      consider the impact of developments in sources of energy in relation to the growth of possible
      markets for industrial goods. Automobiles, airplanes and ships made long-distance transport
      possible, facilitating global trade and thereby allowing industrialization to develop further.
      Candidates’ opinions or conclusions will be presented clearly and supported by appropriate
      evidence.

Topic 8: Independence movements (1800–2000)

15.   Discuss the importance of race to the origins and rise of independence movements in two states.

      The question requires that candidates offer a considered and balanced review of the importance of
      race to the origins and rise of independence movements. The two states may or may not be from a
      different region. Candidates may discuss causes that predate or extend beyond the timeframe but
      they must be clearly linked to the issue raised in the question. Candidates may discuss
      Zimbabwe/Rhodesia and the spur given to independence by the imposition of the Unilateral
      Declaration of Independence (UDI) that served to entrench racial discrimination in the form of
      apartheid. Similarly, candidates may discuss the emergence of the independence movement in
      India and the impact of events such as the Jallianwala Bagh (Amritsar) massacre, which
      highlighted a disregard for the population, and which may have been racially inspired. Haiti, where
      racial issues were central, is also appropriate as although the revolution predated the timeframe, it
      achieved independence in 1804. Other relevant factors to be discussed may include the imposition
      of sanctions or the use of force by either the supporters or opponents of independence but with a
      focus on the issue in the question. Candidates’ opinions or conclusions will be presented clearly
      and supported by appropriate evidence


16.   “Violent methods were essential to the achievement of independence.” Discuss with reference to
      two states.

      The question requires that candidates offer a considered and balanced review of the statement
      that violent methods were essential to the achievement of independence. The two states may or
      may not be from the same region. Events discussed may predate or extend beyond the timeframe,
      but they must be clearly linked to the issue raised in the question. Candidates may discuss the
      Hungarian Revolution of 1848 and how this was to influence the Historic Compromise of 1867 that
      elevated the role of Hungary within the Austrian Empire. The formation of guerrilla bands in post-
      UDI Rhodesia may also be discussed and linked to the achievement of independence in 1980. The
      failure of Cuban nationalists to achieve independence prior to the Spanish–American War of 1898
      may also be discussed to support the statement. The impact of non-violence as a method to push
      forward the campaign for independence in India may be discussed as might the granting of
      independence to colonies such as Nigeria or Ghana, which was influenced by the changing views
      of the state and society. Candidates’ opinions or conclusions will be presented clearly and
      supported by appropriate evidence.

Topic 9: Emergence and development of democratic states (1848–2000)

17.   Compare and contrast the role of leaders in the emergence of two democratic states.

      The question requires that candidates give an account of the similarities and differences between
      the role of leaders in the emergence of two states, referring to both throughout. The two states may
      or may not be from the same region. In India, Mahatma Gandhi’s civil disobedience campaigns
      were built upon by Jawaharlal Nehru, who laid down the principles which guided the new state,
      including secularism and equality before the law. In Japan after the Second World War, the role of
      the occupying power, and therefore MacArthur, was key in the emergence of democracy in the
      form of a new constitution, underpinned by, for example, educational reform and female suffrage.
      Similarly, the role of the leaders of the victorious powers in 1945 was central to the establishment
      of West German democracy, while domestic politicians such as Adenauer played their part.
      Comparison or contrast with the role of leaders such as Mandela and de Klerk, who brought about
      the emergence of a more democratic state in South Africa, would be relevant.


18.   Examine the impact of domestic crises on the development of two democratic states, each chosen
      from a different region.

      The question requires that candidates consider the interrelationship between domestic crises and
      the development of two democratic states that must be chosen from different regions. Candidates
      may examine the impact on Weimar Germany of the crises of 1919 and 1920, when the new
      democracy was confronted with violence from the Left and then the Right. The impact of the
      economic crisis of 1923 and 1929 may also be examined and arguments posited as to how these
      impacted the development of the state. Similarly, the impact of the 1929 economic crisis on Japan
      may be examined and linked to expansionist policies that may be linked to the growing influence of
      the military on the state. The policies introduced and applied by the newly democratic Republic of
      South Africa to address economic problems and the legacy of apartheid may also be examined.
      Candidates’ opinions or conclusions will be presented clearly and supported by appropriate
      evidence.

Topic 10: Authoritarian states (20th century)

19.   “Weak political systems were the most significant factor in the emergence of authoritarian states.”
      Discuss with reference to two states.

      The question requires that candidates offer a considered and balanced review of the statement
      that weak political systems were the most significant factor in the emergence of authoritarian
      states. Candidates may identify weak political systems as those that lacked political stability and
      resulted in continuous changes. They may discuss governments that failed to reach consensus
      and gain permanency thus preventing the implementation of policies. This scenario may have
      driven politicians to focus on negotiating alliances instead of addressing social or economic
      problems causing further discontent. Appropriate examples may include Liberal Italy, the Second
      Republic in Spain, and Weimar Germany. Weak political systems may also be identified as those
      manipulated to preserve a corrupt government in place. Candidates may discuss governments that
      exhibited widespread corruption, such as Batista’s or Farouk’s, and whether this may have resulted
      in the emergence of contenders for power. Other relevant factors may be addressed, for example
      economic factors, social division, and the impact of war, but with a focus on the issue in the
      question. Candidates’ opinions or conclusions will be presented clearly and supported by
      appropriate evidence.


20.   Evaluate the impact of social and cultural policies in one authoritarian state.

      The question requires that candidates make an appraisal of social and cultural policies, weighing
      up their strengths and limitations or otherwise. Candidates may offer equal coverage of social and
      cultural policies, or they may prioritize their evaluation of one over the other. However, both
      aspects will be a feature of the response. Candidates may evaluate the impact of social policies
      that had significant impact such as the Literacy Campaign in Cuba. Conversely, candidates may
      wish to evaluate social reforms with uneven impact. For example, China’s 1950 Marriage Law
      forbade arranged marriages and concubinage, yet these restrictions were often ignored in rural
      areas. It would be valid for candidates to comment on the difficulty of appraising the real impact of
      social policies, such as compulsory youth groups, where participants may have outwardly
      conformed. The role of censorship and control of the arts, such as Nyerere's ban on foreign music,
      may also provide material for discussion. Candidates may also consider the extent to which artists
      embraced states themes such as Stalin’s Socialist Realism, or Nasser’s Pan-Arabism and Anti-
      imperialism. Candidates may propose that while policies may not have achieved social and cultural
      targets, they may have met political objectives, such as China’s Cultural Revolution. Candidates’
      opinions or conclusions will be presented clearly and supported by appropriate evidence.

Topic 11: Causes and effects of 20th century wars

21.   Compare and contrast the long-term causes of two wars.

      The question requires that candidates give an account of the similarities and differences between
      the long-term causes of two wars referring to both throughout. There does not need to be an equal
      number of each. The two wars may or may not be chosen from the same region. Causes may
      predate or extend beyond the timeframe, but must be clearly linked to twentieth century war. It
      should be noted that different theatres of war in either the First World War or the Second World
      War may not be considered as two separate wars. Even so, both world wars will be popular
      choices and candidates may compare and contrast factors such as nationalism, expansionist
      policies and ideologies that may have caused one or both wars. Other relevant examples would be
      the Korean War with long-term causes dating back to the end of the Second World War or the
      Algerian War of Independence with long-term causes dating back beyond the First World War. A
      comparison of the long-term causes of the Spanish Civil War or the Chinese Civil War would also
      be appropriate.


22.   Evaluate the impact of guerrilla warfare on the outcome of two wars.

      The question requires that candidates make an appraisal of the impact of guerrilla warfare on the
      outcome of two wars. The wars may or may not be chosen from a different region. The outcome of
      the wars may extend beyond the timeframe of the question, but evaluation must be clearly linked to
      the issues raised in the question. Candidates may evaluate the impact of guerrilla warfare in
      German East Africa during the First World War which, despite extending beyond the armistice of
      November 1918, did not change the outcome of the war. The impact of the Vietminh on the
      outcome of the First Indochinese War may be evaluated or that of the National Liberation Front
      (Viet Cong) on the outcome of the Vietnam War. The role of partisans in different theatres during
      the Second World War may be evaluated and linked to regional outcomes. Candidates’ opinions or
      conclusions will be presented clearly and supported by appropriate evidence.

Topic 12: The Cold War: Superpower tensions and rivalries (20th century)

23.   “Fear, rather than aggression, was the main cause of superpower rivalry between 1943 and 1949.”
      To what extent do you agree with this statement?

      The question requires that candidates consider the merits or otherwise of the statement that fear,
      rather than aggression, was the main cause of superpower rivalry between 1943 and 1949.
      Causes may predate the timeframe, but they must be clearly linked to the issue raised in the
      question. There may be discussion of Stalin’s fear of a reunited, revived Germany, as being partly
      responsible for the Berlin Blockade. Russian fears of US expansion into Europe were also
      heightened by the Truman Doctrine and the Marshall Plan. US fears may have been stoked by
      Kennan’s Long Telegram, which greatly influenced American diplomacy. Russian actions in
      Eastern Europe, which were arguably in contravention of promises made at Yalta, were regarded
      by the US as aggressive; however, the USSR was shattered by war, and arguably more motivated
      by fear. There may be discussion of the impact of the US lead in nuclear weaponry and the failure
      of the Baruch Plan. Candidates’ opinions or conclusions will be presented clearly and supported by
      appropriate evidence.


24.   Examine the economic impact of the Cold War on two countries, each chosen from a different
      region.

       The question requires that candidates consider the interrelationship between the Cold War and
       the economies of two countries. The two countries must be from different regions. Candidates
       may refer to economies before the timeframe, but only in order to place change during the Cold
       War in context. There may be examination of the impact of defence spending in the US, which
       brought economic boom to some states, and a rise in the budget deficit in the 1980s.
       Examination of the impact on the Russian economy may focus on the arms race, which may
       have partly caused the USSR’s collapse. Cold War fears may have influenced the American
       economic reconstruction of Japan, and the trade embargo on Cuba, which turned to the USSR
       for subsidies. Cold War tensions may have prompted Russian investment in the developing
       world, for example in India and Egypt, and policy towards the economies of the Soviet bloc.
       Candidates’ opinions or conclusions will be presented clearly and supported by appropriate
       evidence.
