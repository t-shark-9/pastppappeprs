                                               Section A
1.   (a)   Describe two long-term benefits for PU of its marketing strategies (lines 60–64).            [4]

           Background given in the case study: PU’s marketing strategies are “aggressive”
           (line 60) and PU, unlike its competitors, keeps investing a lot in its marketing
           (“Adriana saw marketing expenditure as a worthwhile investment”, (lines 62-63)),
           especially in terms of promotion (communicating actively on PU’s “achievements
           both in research and teaching” (line 63) and on its “competitive fees” (line 64)).

           Long-term benefits include:

           The main anticipated long-term benefit (ie the strategic aim that justifies these
           marketing strategies) is to get more students (as they are the ‘customers’ of PU),
           both local students (as “many local students have decided to postpone their studies
           for a year”, (lines 52-53)) and international students (as they “pay higher fees to the
           university than the fees that the university receives from local student” (lines 54-55)).
           For PU, more students mean more revenue (more income), which improves the
           cash-flow situation (very important, as PU has “cash-flow problems”, as repeated
           several times, lines 57, 69 and 85).

           Other long-term benefits of PU’s marketing strategies include:
           • other external stakeholders will be aware of PU’s success – stakeholders from
             the private sector (eg Di Jones who is “director of a multinational computer
             company that is funding some of PU’s IT research”, (line 108)), or in the public
             sector (local and regional politicians, so that they remember PU and keep
             supporting it);
           • attracting new staff to PU, as its intensive promotion indirectly showcases it as a
             potential employer of choice.

           N.B. The question is not about the marketing mix (4Ps, or even 7Ps). If the answer
           is just an outline of PU’s marketing mix (describing PU’s Product (high quality
           courses), Price (competitive fees) etc); award up to [2], as it shows some
           understanding of marketing, but not of the topic of strategy, nor of the notion of long-
           term benefits. Likewise, answers about ATL and BTL forms of promotion and
           answers that use the Ansoff matrix (eg product development: PU offering new
           courses) may also be partially credited, as they display knowledge of marketing.

           Accept any other relevant long-term benefit.

           If a candidate provides context that provides a benefit, but the benefit is not explicitly
           stated, the “second” mark can be awarded i.e. [0] + [1].

           Mark as a [2] + [2].

           Award [1] for each appropriate benefit identified and [1] for some description and
           application. Award a maximum of [2] for each benefit. Maximum [4] for two benefits.
                                             –6–                M22/3/BUSMT/SP1/ENG/TZ0/XX/M



(b)   Explain the possible impacts on PU of the ethical issues it faces (lines 101–117).   [6]

      Ethical issues and impacts include:
      • Appointment of new trustee with links to slave trade: Can PU resolve? Will the
         problem go away? What impact is it having? If the trustee is sacked what are
         the implications? Loss of talented and valuable person. Reputational loss.
      • Guest speaker: That’s a matter for the students to decide. Should Adriana get
         involved? How much bad publicity will it generate? Does PU want
         confrontation with students? What about free speech? What are the laws
         covering this/university regulations? Impacts depends on what students
         decide. PU could lose some reputation if speaker comes, could seem
         authoritarian, against free speech if speaker does not attend invitation to
         speak at Politics Society.
      • Over-priced medicines to LDCs: If funding is stopped then this action could
         impact on university research.

      Accept any other relevant impact.

      Use the markbands on page 3.

      Award a maximum of [3] for a theoretical answer or for limiting answer to only
      one impact.

      Award a maximum of [5] if the answer is mainly descriptive but in context.

      Award a maximum of [6].
                                                  –7–                 M22/3/BUSMT/SP1/ENG/TZ0/XX/M


2.   (a)   Outline two steps that Adriana should take if she decides to dismiss the head of
           the Faculty of History, Jim (lines 89–100).                                          [4]

           Two steps include:
           • Tell Jim and other faculty members.
           • Follow PU’s HR procedure for dismissal.
           • May need to meet with Jim and his trade union representatives. Prepare a
             case substantiating the reasons in case Jim takes PU to court for unfair
             dismissal, exactly as Patricia is doing after her own dismissal (line 90) (as
             ‘dismissal’ is about a fault, as opposed to ‘redundancy’).
           • Ask HR to advertise for a new post, internally or externally, as Jim needs to be
             replaced
           • Review of current staffing in the History department. Assess whether Jim
             needs to be replaced.

           Accept any other relevant step, as long as they apply to what Adriana would need
           to do if she decides to dismiss Jim. Non-procedural steps can also be rewarded
           such as the department review.

           Mark as a [2] + [2].

           Award [1] for each appropriate step and [1] for application of each step.
           Maximum award, for two steps: [4].

     (b)   Explain strategies, in addition to redundancies, that PU could use to solve its
           cash-flow problems (lines 56–59).                                                    [6]

           Strategies include:
           • 20 % of staff are on part time contracts. More staff could have their hours
              reduced.
           • PU has maintained its marketing budget and this could be reduced.
           • Some facilities are underused so could be let to provide additional income.
           • Reduce overseas visits for lecturers.
           • Stop courses that are not economically viable eg history, modern languages.
           • Increase fees but these are competitive and there is a shortage of students.
           • Make more/other staff redundant.
           • Other methods which are generic include: delay payments to suppliers, reduce
              spending.
           • Short-term sources of finance. These must be appropriate to PU.

           Accept any other relevant strategy, or methods mentioned as part of an overall
           strategy.

           Use the markbands on page 3.

           Award a maximum of [3] for a theoretical answer or for limiting answer to only
           one strategy.

           Award a maximum of [5] if the answer is mainly descriptive but in context.

           Award a maximum of [6].
                                                –8–                 M22/3/BUSMT/SP1/ENG/TZ0/XX/M


3.   (a)   Outline two STEEPLE factors that influence PU’s decisions.                              [4]

           STEEPLE framework: Social, Technological, Economic, Ethical, Political, Legal, Ecological
           (‘Environmental’)

           STEEPLE factors include:
           • Activists spreading bad publicity (social)
           • Changes in artificial intelligence and other technologies (technological)
           • The accident at the chemical factory (ecological, environmental)
           • The economic recession (economic)
           • Reduction in other universities (economic)
           • Government grants and “large amount of funding from the government to
             research medicines” (lines 42-43) (political)

           If the STEEPLE factor is not explicitly stated, the “second” mark can be awarded
           i.e. [0] + [1] if it is clear from the context what factor is being referred to.

           Answers must present two separate STEEPLE factors.
           E.g. two economic factors would only be awarded a maximum of [2].

           Accept any other relevant factor.

           Mark as a [2] + [2].

           Award [1] for an appropriate factor and [1] for application. Maximum award for
           two factors: [4].

           Note: To be awarded the second mark, each factor must be explicitly linked to
           the STEEPLE framework. Some flexibility is allowed in the categorization, for
           example the economic recession could be outlined from a social perspective, or
           the governments grants could be seen as the result of a legal decision. The same
           factor; however, cannot be counted twice.
                                             –9–                  M22/3/BUSMT/SP1/ENG/TZ0/XX/M


(b)   Explain ways in which PU could achieve greater sustainability in the 2022/23
      academic year (lines 118–131).                                                       [6]

      Ways to achieve greater sustainability include:
      • Rebuilding facilities to higher sustainability standards and this could include
        building design, heating/lighting systems, furniture and equipment, use of
        space.
      • Maintain and improve on the current lower levels of waste, pollution, energy
        and consumption (these four would only be one way). This could be through
        ensuring recycling facilities, encouraging minimization of waste, finding more
        efficient uses of energy
      • Expand the use of solar and other sustainable energy sources. Available
        space?
      • Review, maintain and further develop CSR policies. Continued reduction in
        energy consumption.
      • Review online teaching provision. An increase in online teaching would help to
        reduce energy consumption at PU.

      Candidates may refer to different forms of sustainability including the triple
      bottom line; this should be awarded.

      Use the markbands on page 3.

      Award a maximum of [3] for a theoretical answer, or for limiting the answer to
      only one way, or for only copying extracts from the case study.

      Award a maximum of [6].
                                                  – 10 –              M22/3/BUSMT/SP1/ENG/TZ0/XX/M


                                               Section B
4.   (a)   Define the term performance-related pay (PRP).                                       [2]

           Performance-related pay (PRP) is a system of financial reward where the amount
           received by a worker is linked to how well they have reached targets and met
           criteria.

           PRP can be a motivator, but it is also difficult to implement, for example to
           measure and quantify performance.

           Award [1] for a partial definition which may be circular or tautological.
           Award [2] for a clear definition that shows knowledge and understanding beyond
           stating that pay is related to performance.

           Maximum award: [2].

     (b)   Explain one impact on PU and one impact on PU’s lecturers of the new
           working patterns.                                                                    [4]

           Impact on PU:
           • Home working: How to monitor? Maybe more available facilities? Costs of
             extra equipment for home?
           • Reduced vacations: Facilities better used. Possible increase in costs, though
             may help with sustainability.

           Impact on PU’s lecturers:
           • Work at home for 3 days a week. How feasible? What facilities? Less
             travelling, more time available.
           • Reductions in vacations: Unlikely to be welcomed by lecturers; less
             motivation? Leading to higher staff turnover?

           The new working patterns are about home working and reduced vacations.
           Training may be considered as it is explicitly linked to the new working patterns,
           e.g. about the fact that lecturers need specific training to adapt to the new
           working patterns.

           N.B. PRP is a type of financial reward, not a working pattern (candidates’
           knowledge of PRP has already been assessed through question Q4a).

           N.B. candidates may also explain the impacts as “long-term impact” versus
           “short-term impact”, or “positive impact” versus “negative impact”, or “financial
           impact” versus “HR impact” – all these approaches are valid, as long as they are
           about the new working patterns.

           Mark as a [2] + [2].

           Award [1] for an appropriate impact on PU’s lecturers and an additional [1] for
           application. Award [1] for an appropriate impact on PU and an additional [1] for
           application. Maximum award overall: [4].

(c)   Explain two methods of primary market research that PU could use to monitor
      the progress of each course.                                                         [4]

      Methods include:

      Award [1] for an appropriate method identified and an additional [1] for
      explanation and application to the stimulus. Maximum award overall: [4].

(d)   Recommend whether PU should open a campus in Country B.                             [10]

      Arguments for:
      • Country B has an expanding economy. Suggests potential growth in student
         numbers. Also suggests Country B can afford to pay PU.
      • Could enhance PU’s reputation further – already strong.
      • PU receives a flat fee and a payment per student who completes a degree
         course.
      • Country B will provide the campus and facilities.
      • Country B will recruit staff, saving PU the trouble.
      • PU maintains control over courses, syllabuses, training, monitoring.

      Arguments against:
      • Lots of areas PU has little control over: student numbers, quality of student
         and staff recruitment, facilities.
      • Some aspects will involve more work for PU: market research, monitoring,
         approving degrees, training, providing syllabuses.
      • Increased costs for PU. Do these match the returns?
      • There are a lot of unknowns.
      • Other major issues to contend with – falling student numbers, accident etc.
         Maybe PU should concentrate on core activities.

      Accept any other relevant argument for or against.

      Marks should be allocated according to the markbands on page 4.

      For a one-sided answer, award up to a maximum of [5].

      Both sides considered, good use of evidence, particularly from Section B, but no
      effective conclusion/evaluation award a maximum of [8].

      For full marks a fully supported conclusion/evaluation with good use of evidence,
      particularly from Section B.
