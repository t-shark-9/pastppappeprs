Prescribed subject 1: Military leaders

For the attention of all examiners: if you are uncertain about the content/accuracy of a
candidate’s work please contact your team leader.

1.   (a)   What, according to Source A, were the consequences of Richard I’s arrest?             [3]

           •   It was advantageous for King Philip of France.
           •   Philip and John came to an agreement against Richard I.
           •   Armies were raised against John.
           •   The authorities imposed a tax to pay Richard I’s ransom.

           The above material is an indication of what candidates may elect to write about in
           their responses. It is neither prescriptive nor exhaustive and no set answer is
           required. Award [1] for each relevant point up to a maximum of [3].

     (b)   What does Source B suggest about Richard I and John?                                  [2]

           • John submitted to his brother Richard I.
           • A diverse group of people accepted Richard I as king.
           • Their mother played a significant role in their relationship.

           The above material is an indication of what candidates may elect to write about in
           their responses. It is neither prescriptive nor exhaustive and no set answer is
           required. Award [1] for each relevant point up to a maximum of [2].

2.   With reference to its origin, purpose and content, analyse the value and limitations of
     Source C for an historian studying the political impact in England of Richard I’s
     absence.                                                                                    [4]

     Value:
                •   It is a 12th century chronicle which aims to depict the history of the
                    Plantagenets.
                •   As a contemporary chronicle, it is a first-hand account of Richard I’s
                    reign.
                •   It provides information about John’s actions during Richard I’s absence.

     Limitations:
                •   Since it is based on contemporary accounts it lacks the benefit of
                    hindsight.
                •   The chronicle’s scope is wide and not specifically focused on the reign
                    of Richard I.
                •   The information could have been exaggerated as Richard I was the
                    ruler at the time.

     The focus of the question is on the value and limitations of the source. If only value or
     limitations are discussed, award a maximum of [2]. Origin, purpose and content should
     be used as supporting evidence to make relevant comments on the value and
     limitations. For [4] there must be at least one reference to each of them in either the
     value or the limitations.

3.   Compare and contrast what Sources C and D reveal about the political situation in
     England during Richard I’s absence.                                                          [6]

      Marks      Level descriptor
      5–6        • The response includes clear and valid points of comparison and of contrast.
      3–4        • The response includes some valid points of comparison and/or of contrast,
                   although these points may lack clarity.
      1–2        • The response consists of description of the content of the source(s), and/or
                   general comments about the source(s), rather than valid points of comparison
                   or of contrast.
      0          • The response does not reach a standard described by the descriptors above.

     Apply the markbands that provide the “best fit” to the responses given by candidates
     and award credit wherever it is possible to do so. The following material is an
     indication of what candidates may elect to write about in their responses. It is neither
     prescriptive nor exhaustive and no set answer is required.

     Comparison:
              • Both sources mention John’s alliance with King Philip of France against
                 Richard I.
              • Both sources state that John promoted armed clashes.
              • Both sources claim that the situation in England was troubled.
              • Both sources state that John ended up requesting a truce.

     Contrast:
                 •   Source C states that the nobles of England stood against John,
                     whereas Source D mentions that some of them helped John or did not
                     get involved.
                 •   Source C claims that John’s troops were criminals, whereas Source D
                     states he was helped by people such as the bishop of Coventry.

     Apply the markbands that provide the “best fit” to the responses given by candidates
     and award credit wherever it is possible to do so. The following material is an
     indication of what candidates may elect to write about in their responses. It is neither
     prescriptive nor exhaustive and no set answer is required. While it is expected that
     there will be coverage of at least two of the sources, candidates are not required to
     refer to all four sources in their responses.

     Indicative content

     Source A             Richard I’s arrest in Germany facilitated the alliance formed by his
                          brother John and Philip to overthrow him. But John’s attempt to
                          take the throne in England failed due to the opposition of the
                          clerics.

     Source B             Richard I is pictured as the leading political authority, imposing his
                          power on his brother John, who was finally subject to his
                          command. Eleanor of Aquitaine, mother of Richard I and John,
                          was important in maintaining their relationship.
                                        –7–                  M22/3/HISTX/BP1/ENG/TZ0/XX/M


Source C        During Richard I’s absence, John disturbed the provinces of
                England with the help of troops of criminals, since the nobles of the
                kingdom opposed him. However, John’s surrender of Windsor
                Castle suggests a reduction in political turmoil.

Source D        Richard’s captivity caused a state of panic in the government in
                England. Philip took advantage of the situation by allying with John
                and planning an invasion of Richard I’s lands. But in England, John
                faced many obstacles since he was able to gather few people, and
                the need to pay Richard I’s ransom added difficulties. He finally
                accepted a truce.

Own knowledge   Candidates may consider that Richard I’s main interest was
                leading the crusade, rather than planning the future of the English
                monarchy. This had an impact on the royal treasury as well as in
                the political arena since the king sold sheriffdoms, rights and lands
                to gather resources for the enterprise in the Middle East.
                Candidates may also mention the agreement between Richard I
                and Henry VI for his release, which encompassed the formal
                surrender of his kingdom to Henry VI, taking it back as a fief.
                Candidates may discuss Richard I’s return to England and the
                political risks the kingdom underwent that forced Richard I to
                celebrate a second coronation in order to confirm his authority.
                Soon after, Richard I left for Normandy and never returned, leaving
                England under the rule of the Archbishop of Canterbury, Hubert
                Walter. Candidates may also offer information on John, who was
                banished and deprived of all his lands but later reconciled to
                Richard I, recovering some of his domains.

Prescribed subject 2: Conquest and its impact

Read sources E to H in the source booklet and answer questions 5 to 8. The sources and
questions relate to case study 1: The final stages of Muslim rule in Spain — Context and
motives: Political context in Iberia and Al-Andalus in the late 15th century; internal conflicts
and alliances in Granada in the late 15th century.

5.    (a)   What, according to Source E, was the political situation in the Iberian Peninsula
            in the late 15th century?                                                              [3]

            • The Iberian Peninsula lacked political unity.
            • The provinces of Castile and Aragon were dominant in political and economic
              terms.
            • The Castilian monarchy had more power than Aragon.
            • Civil wars debilitated the peninsula.

            The above material is an indication of what candidates may elect to write about in
            their responses. It is neither prescriptive nor exhaustive and no set answer is
            required. Award [1] for each relevant point up to a maximum of [3].

      (b)   What does Source F suggest about the Iberian Peninsula up to 1492?                     [2]

            • The Peninsula was ruled by different kingdoms.
            • Castile was the largest kingdom.
            • Granada was surrounded by the kingdom of Castile.

            The above material is an indication of what candidates may elect to write about in
            their responses. It is neither prescriptive nor exhaustive and no set answer is
            required. Award [1] for each relevant point up to a maximum of [2].

6.   With reference to its origin, purpose and content, analyse the value and limitations of
     Source G for an historian studying the unification of the Iberian Peninsula.                [4]

     Value:
                •   As a contemporary letter it is a first-hand account of the motives for the
                    Christian conquest of the Moorish territories.
                •   It shows how a contemporary writer justified the need for taking action
                    against the Moors.
                •   It shows the importance of religious motives as justification for the
                    unification.

     Limitations:
                •   As a contemporary Christian account, it may be an emotional response
                    to the events, lacking the benefit of hindsight.
                •   Christian motives for attacking the Moors could have been exaggerated
                    in order to persuade the monarchs to act.
                •   The source is focused only on Christian motives.

     The focus of the question is on the value and limitations of the source. If only value or
     limitations are discussed, award a maximum of [2]. Origin, purpose and content should
     be used as supporting evidence to make relevant comments on the value and
     limitations. For [4] there must be at least one reference to each of them in either the
     value or the limitations.

7.   Compare and contrast what Sources G and H reveal about the reasons for the
     unification of the Iberian Peninsula.                                                        [6]

     Apply the markbands that provide the “best fit” to the responses given by candidates
     and award credit wherever it is possible to do so. The following material is an
     indication of what candidates may elect to write about in their responses. It is neither
     prescriptive nor exhaustive and no set answer is required.

     Comparison:
              • Both sources reveal the leading role of the Catholic monarchs in the
                 unification process.
              • Both sources consider religion as an important reason.
              • Both sources suggest that unification was urgent.
              • Both sources suggest that fear of the Moors rallying support from
                 abroad encouraged the Christian monarchs to act.

     Contrast:
                 •   Source H describes the external rivalry with France as a motive for
                     unification whereas Source G only refers to the need to address the
                     internal threat posed by the Moors.
                 •   Source G suggests that religion was the main motive for the unification,

     Indicative content

     Source E             The peninsula lacked political unity. There were independent
                          kingdoms and the problems among nobles made the political
                          situation unstable. The provinces of Castile and Aragon were
                          dominant in political and economic terms, which may suggest why
                          they took the lead in the unification process.

     Source F             Shows the political divisions of the Iberian Peninsula, emphasizing
                          the territorial significance of the kingdoms of Castile and Aragon. It
                          also suggests the weaker political position of Granada, surrounded
                          by enemies.

Source G        Contemporaries of the Catholic monarchs were supportive of
                political unification and an expansion over the Moors’ territories.
                However, it also emphasizes the crucial role that religious reasons
                were to have in this process.

Source H        Suggests that the attack was launched out of political necessity,
                even if religion had an important role in the war against Granada.
                There was a concern that the Moors would call the Turks to their
                aid. There were geopolitical reasons too, for example the rivalry
                with France.

Own knowledge   Candidates may support the statement by referring to the
                competition among Christian kingdoms that led to the conquest of
                new lands. Candidates may also consider the internal political
                struggles affecting the kingdom of Granada and the problems
                connected to the succession to the throne, and how the vassalage
                to Castile had weakened its economy.
                Candidates may challenge the question by referring to the extent
                to which the struggle was inspired by a “crusade spirit” since a
                great stimulus to the offensive was given by the Church and the
                papacy. Candidates may state that Pope Eugenius IV (1431–1447)
                strongly encouraged the Castilian crusade, granting it the usual
                indulgence and forbidding all sale of foodstuffs and strategic
                materials to the Moors. Candidates may also consider the
                possibility of gaining access to the Mediterranean and controlling
                the Straits of Gibraltar. It could also be argued that the conquest
                had clear economic motives, such as the need for fertile lands and
                livestock, and the greed for plunder.

Prescribed subject 3: The move to global war

Read sources I to L in the source booklet and answer questions 9 to 12. The sources and
questions relate to case study 1: Japanese expansion in East Asia (1931–1941) — Events:
Pearl Harbor (1941).

9.   (a)   What, according to Source I, were the proposals made to Japan by the United
           States?                                                                              [3]

           • Conclude a multilateral non-aggression pact.
           • Reach an agreement so that the territory of French Indochina would be
             guaranteed.
           • Japan had to withdraw all military, naval, air and police forces from China and
             from Indochina.
           • That the two governments would not support any government or regime in
             China other than the national Government of the Republic of China.

           The above material is an indication of what candidates may elect to write about in
           their responses. It is neither prescriptive nor exhaustive and no set answer is
           required. Award [1] for each relevant point up to a maximum of [3].

     (b)   What does Source J suggest about the attack on Pearl Harbor?
     [2]

           • There was some form of collaboration between Germany and Japan.
           • The attack was bloody.
           • It was a part of a wider global strategy.

           The above material is an indication of what candidates may elect to write about in
           their responses. It is neither prescriptive nor exhaustive and no set answer is
           required. Award [1] for each relevant point up to a maximum of [2].

10.   With reference to its origin, purpose and content, analyse the value and limitations of
      Source I for an historian studying relations between Japan and the United States
      before the attack on Pearl Harbor.                                                          [4]


      Value:
                  •   It is the official position of the United States government at the time
                  •   It sets out the position of the United States in negotiations.
                  •   It gives detailed information on American demands.

      Limitations:
                 •    As the note is from November 1941, there is no indication of how Japan
                      reacted to these demands.
                 •    Since the aim was to pressure Japan, the demands of the United States
                      Government may not represent their actual position.
                 •    It gives no information on preceding events that led to this proposal
                      being issued.

      The focus of the question is on the value and limitations of the source. If only value or
      limitations are discussed, award a maximum of [2]. Origin, purpose and content should
      be used as supporting evidence to make relevant comments on the value and
      limitations. For [4] there must be at least one reference to each of them in either the
      value or the limitations.

11.   Compare and contrast what Sources K and L reveal about why the Japanese attacked
      Pearl Harbor in December 1941.                                                               [6]

      indication of what candidates may elect to write about in their responses. It is neither
      prescriptive nor exhaustive and no set answer is required.

      Comparison:
               • Both sources identify that the economic embargo on Japan was
                  significant.
               • Both sources indicate that the negotiations between the United States
                  and Japan were not successful.
               • Both sources indicate that the vital issue to be resolved was the
                  withdrawal of Japanese troops from China.
               • Both sources suggest the significance of weather in the planning of the
                  attack.


      Contrast:
                  •   Source K suggests that only the Japanese were preparing for war,
                      whereas Source L refers to American and British preparations for war.
                  •   Source K suggests that the embargo was imposed only by the United
                      States, whereas Source L states that economic sanctions were an
                      international response.

      Indicative content

      Source I             The terms of the proposed agreement contained measures that
                           would be completely unacceptable to the Japanese government,
                           heightening tensions.

      Source J             Indicates that Japan and Germany collaborated and that they
                           considered war as part of a wider global strategy.

Source K        The intransigent nature of United States policy led to a failure of
                negotiations. United States government demands were
                unacceptable to the Japanese government, and this hastened
                Japan’s military preparations.

Source L        The decision to attack Pearl Harbor was a consequence of
                international economic sanctions. Difficulties in the negotiations
                with the United States and no clear means of settling the China
                Incident led to the attack. In Japanese eyes, the United States
                Government was not willing to negotiate. The weather also acted
                as a catalyst for the timing of the attack.

Own knowledge   Candidates may discuss United States–Japanese relations prior to
                1941, such as the response of the United States to the Manchurian
                Crisis, tensions with regard to Japan’s war with China from 1937,
                subsequent support for the Chinese government, and the impact of
                the signing of the Tripartite Pact. The abandonment of the Strike
                North option by Japan led to a focus on the Pacific. Candidates
                could also discuss the rift in policy decision making within Japan,
                the importance of Japanese public opinion and the changing role
                of the military as Japan became more authoritarian in the lead up
                to Pearl Harbor. Candidates could also contend that the Hull Note
                of 26 November 1941 was a deliberate provocation, so that the
                United States could enter the war. However, other factors such as
                the weakness of the League of Nations, and in the short-term the
                Non-Aggression Pact with the USSR, may have encouraged
                Japanese expansionism.

14.   With reference to its origin, purpose and content, analyse the value and limitations of
      Source O for an historian studying Nelson Mandela’s role in the struggle against
      apartheid.                                                                                  [4]

      Value:
                 •   Published nearly 50 years later, this source has the advantage of
                     hindsight.
                 •   It provides an expert legal account of the Rivonia Trial.
                 •   The source quotes Mandela’s reasons for adopting violent methods.

      Limitations:
                 •   As it was written by a law professor, it only offers a legal approach to
                     the trial and struggle.
                 •   The book’s title suggests that it will be a sympathetic account of
                     Mandela’s role.
                 •   The source is focused only on Mandela’s trial.

      The focus of the question is on the value and limitations of the source. If only value or
      limitations are discussed, award a maximum of [2]. Origin, purpose and content should
      be used as supporting evidence to make relevant comments on the value and
      limitations. For [4] there must be at least one reference to each of them in either the
      value or the limitations.

      prescriptive nor exhaustive and no set answer is required.

      Comparison:
               • Both sources show Mandela as a leading member of the ANC.
               • Both sources refer to Mandela’s decision to switch to violence.
               • Both sources highlight Mandela’s role in the establishment of the MK.
               • Both sources refer to Mandela travelling abroad to get help from other
                  African countries.

      Contrast:
                  •   Source M suggests that Mandela had a significant role in convincing a
                      reluctant ANC to adopt violence, whereas Source P states that the ANC
                      had already embraced the idea of armed struggle.
                  •   Source M suggests that Mandela acted independently in the
                      organization of the MK, whereas Source P states that he did so in
                      collaboration with the Communist Party.

      Indicative content

      Source M             Mandela was significant in persuading the President of the ANC to
                           agree to the establishment of the MK. Mandela was instrumental in
                           naming the new organization and appointed his own staff. Mandela
                           was sent abroad to persuade African governments to help with
                           weapons and training.

      Source N             Mandela and his colleagues enlisted some multi-racial support
                           within South Africa. The Rivonia Trial became a focus for protests
                           against apartheid.
                                       – 22 –              M22/3/HISTX/BP1/ENG/TZ0/XX/M


Source O        Mandela was involved in planning sabotage. Due to the failure of
                nonviolent protest, Mandela supported embarking on violent
                struggle and the formation of the MK.

Source P        Mandela worked with other individuals and groups outside of the
                ANC in the struggle against apartheid. Mandela and others formed
                the High Command of the MK.

Own knowledge   Candidates may refer to the widespread international support that
                Mandela gained, especially after his speech from the dock in the
                Rivonia Trial. All over the world anti-apartheid organizations were
                set up, and another measure of Mandela’s significance was the
                Commonwealth’s vilification of the South African regime which in
                turn led to South Africa leaving the Commonwealth in 1961.
                Candidates may also mention Mandela’s inclusion of South African
                Communist Party members in the leadership of the MK opened the
                way for military support from the communist bloc.
                Candidates may evaluate also the significance of actions by
                Mandela such his involvement in the Defiance Campaign.
                On the other hand, candidates may refer to the fact that key anti-
                apartheid figures were either imprisoned or exiled in the aftermath
                of the Treason Trials of 1956. Thus, they may argue that
                Mandela’s methods had achieved little. Moreover, answers may
                refer to the fact that there were other key actors in the anti-
                apartheid struggle.
                Candidates may argue that by 1964 the South African Government
                had successfully repressed both the ANC and the MK,
                organisations in which Mandela played a leading role.

Prescribed subject 5: Conflict and intervention

Read sources Q to T in the source booklet and answer questions 17 to 20. The sources and
questions relate to case study 2: Kosovo (1989–2002) — Causes of the conflict: Role and
significance of Slobodan Milosevic and Ibrahim Rugova.

17.   (a)   What, according to Source Q, were the aims of Ibrahim Rugova’s Democratic
            League of Kosovo (LDK)?                                                              [3]

            •   To establish democracy in Kosovo.
            •   To attain republic status for Kosovo within the former Yugoslav Federation.
            •   To build an independent Kosovo.
            •   To defend the endangered Kosovar people.

            their responses. It is neither prescriptive nor exhaustive and no set answer is
            required. Award [1] for each relevant point up to a maximum of [3].

      (b)   What does Source R suggest about Ibrahim Rugova’s relationship with western
            powers?                                                                              [2]

            • Rugova was supported by Great Britain and the United States.
            • Rugova was pleased to receive the support of western powers.
            • Relations seem to be friendly.

18.   With reference to its origin, purpose and content, analyse the value and limitations of
      Source Q for an historian studying the aims and methods of Rugova’s LDK.                    [4]

      Value:
                 •   It offers first-hand information about the LDK's methods and aims from
                     Rugova himself.
                 •   It shows how Rugova justified the aims and methods of the LDK.
                 •   It offers detailed information about the peaceful and democratic actions
                     of the LDK.

      Limitations:
                 •   It is a sympathetic account by Rugova of the LDK's aims and methods.
                 •   As a statement to an international court, it may omit any reference to
                     LDK actions that contributed to the origin of conflict.
                 •   It does not offer any information on the impact of the LDK’s methods.

      The focus of the question is on the value and limitations of the source. If only value or
      limitations are discussed, award a maximum of [2]. Origin, purpose and content should
      be used as supporting evidence to make relevant comments on the value and
      limitations. For [4] there must be at least one reference to each of them in either the
      value or the limitations.

      to achieve Kosovar independence.                                                             [6]

      prescriptive nor exhaustive and no set answer is required.

      Comparison:
               • Both sources suggest that Rugova’s methods were nonviolent.
               • Both sources suggest that Rugova aimed at internationalizing the
                  conflict.
               • Both sources refer to failures in Rugova’s international strategy.
               • Both sources suggest that, in time, many Kosovo Albanians lost faith in
                  Rugova’s methods and became radicalized.

      Contrast:
                  •   Source S suggests that Rugova’s internationalization strategy was a
                      failure, whereas Source T points to some success, with the
                      announcement of plans to set up the U.S. Information Center in Pristina
                      in 1996.
                  •   Source S suggests that the situation worsened as a result of Rugova’s
                      failure to secure international support, whereas Source T also highlights
                      the importance of other contributing factors.

      Apply the markbands that provide the “best fit” to the responses given by candidates
      and award credit wherever it is possible to do so. The following material is an
      indication of what candidates may elect to write about in their responses. It is neither
      prescriptive nor exhaustive and no set answer is required. While it is expected that
      there will be coverage of at least two of the sources, candidates are not required to
      refer to all four sources in their responses.

      Indicative content

      Source Q             Suggests Serbian responsibility for the origin of conflict as Rugova
                           and the LDK proposed peaceful, diplomatic, and democratic
                           methods, which sought to avoid conflict.
      Source R             Rugova’s methods to oppose Serbian oppression were diplomatic
                           and nonviolent. Nonetheless, his policy of having western powers
                           involved may be considered a cause of conflict.
                                        – 27 –                M22/3/HISTX/BP1/ENG/TZ0/XX/M


Source S        Rugova’s strategy of internationalizing the conflict failed, leading to
                the radicalization of Kosovo Albanians, who took arms after years
                of oppression.

Source T        Although describing Rugova’s methods as nonviolent, the source
                suggests that Rugova’s lack of progress was responsible for the
                radicalization of Kosovo Albanians. Still, it also acknowledges
                other factors that contributed to radicalization including
                deteriorating economic and human rights conditions.

Own knowledge   Candidates can argue that Rugova’s definition of the conflict as a
                humanitarian crisis (rather than an intra-state conflict over borders
                and minority rights) justified NATO intervention. Candidates may
                also propose that Rugova’s stubbornness and intransigence
                pushed former LDK members into the KLA ranks, and that a lack
                of progress during 1990–1998 led many in the Albanian diaspora
                to channel funds to the guerrilla group.
                Candidates can challenge the question, arguing that Rugova’s
                actions were not significant catalysts of war: candidates can
                discuss his policy of passive resistance in further detail, claiming
                that Rugova expected to attain independence through peaceful
                means. Candidates can argue that the causes for war actually lay
                elsewhere. They may analyse the effects of Milosevic's oppressive
                policies and systematization of violence, fueled by his nationalism
                and need to maintain power in a context of economic deterioration
                after the UN imposed economic sanctions. Candidates can also
                refer to Albania's economic breakdown; the KLA’s guerrilla
                campaign through 1998; or diplomatic failures at Rambouillet as
                significant factors that contributed to the origin of war.
