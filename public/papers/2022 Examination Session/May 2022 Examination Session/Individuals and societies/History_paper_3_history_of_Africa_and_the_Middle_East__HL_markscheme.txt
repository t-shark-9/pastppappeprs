Apply the markbands that provide the “best fit” to the responses given and award credit wherever it is
possible to do so. If an answer indicates that the demands of the question are understood and
addressed but that not all implications are considered (for example, compare or contrast; reasons
or significance; methods or success), then examiners should not be afraid of using the full range of
marks allowed for by the markscheme. Responses that offer good coverage of some of the criteria
should be rewarded accordingly.

Section 1: The ‘Abbasid dynasty (750–1258)

1.   Evaluate the impact of Harun al-Rashid on the ‘Abbasid Empire.

     The question requires that candidates make an appraisal of the impact of Harun al-Rashid on the
     ‘Abbasid Empire weighing up the strengths and limitations of his rule. Impacts may extend beyond
     the timeframe but must be clearly linked to the issue raised in the question. Candidates may refer
     to his support of intellectual development including the Golden Age of Islam in which cultural and
     intellectual developments reached extraordinary levels. International influence was expanded
     through military campaigns and diplomatic relations with China and the Frankish Empire. Trade
     and industry expanded enormously and the Empire reached its highest level of prosperity. Harun
     weakened the Empire through granting more power to local rulers in exchange for money. He
     increased the power of the vizier and the bureaucracy through the Barmakid family and weakened
     the power and influence of the caliph and created factions and rivalries which weakened the
     Empire. His failure to create an orderly succession led to a civil war between his sons. Candidates'
     opinions or conclusions will be presented clearly and supported by appropriate evidence.


2.   To what extent did religious divisions cause the decline of the ‘Abbasid Empire?

     The question requires that candidates consider the merits or otherwise of the suggestion that
     religious divisions caused the decline of the ‘Abbasid Empire. Candidates may refer to powerful
     opposition from Islamic rivals such as the Fatimids and the Umayyads in Spain who controlled
     large territories and challenged the Empire. Other religious groups such as the Carmathians,
     Assassins, Almoravids and Seljuks caused disunity and internal conflicts. Other factors may
     include the size and cultural complexity of the Empire which made administration and unity difficult,
     financial mismanagement by the central government led to the surrender of central power to local
     rulers for financial considerations. Numerous invasions by groups such as the Seljuks, Crusaders,
     and the Mongols greatly weakened the Empire. Weak leadership and internal divisions in the
     central government contributed significantly to the decline in imperial power. Candidates' opinions
     or conclusions will be presented clearly and supported by appropriate evidence.
                                                  –5–                   M22/3/HISTX/HP3/ENG/TZ0/AF/M


Section 2: The Fatimids (909–1171)

3.   “Economic factors were more important than social factors to the foundation of the Fatimid
     dynasty.” Discuss.

     The question requires that candidates offer a considered and balanced review of the view that
     economic factors were more important than social factors for the foundation of the Fatimid Empire.
     Reasons may predate the timeframe but must be clearly linked to the issue raised in the question.
     Candidates may refer to Fatimid support for trade and economic development in North Africa which
     gained them the support of the expanding commercial and financial communities. The wealth
     generated allowed them to recruit powerful armies and to create a navy to further expand their
     influence. Their economic development of Egypt created a firm economic and military foundation
     and expanded their influence as missionaries accompanied merchants to the Red Sea and Indian
     Ocean. Social factors may include how the intellectual nature of the Isma'ili doctrines attracted
     many scholars and created a powerful missionary movement; the inclusive nature of their doctrines
     which brought in many talented individuals discontented with the ‘Abbasids; their focus on the arts
     helped gain support for the dynasty. Candidates’ opinions or conclusions will be presented clearly
     and supported by appropriate evidence.


4.   “Fatimid ideology had limited impact on the Muslim world.” To what extent do you agree with this
     statement?

     The question requires that candidates consider the merits or otherwise of the statement that
     Fatimid ideology had limited impact on the Muslim world. Causes/reasons may predate the
     timeframe but they must be clearly linked to the issue raised in the question. Candidates may refer
     to the short duration of the Fatimid period, the increasing power of the Sunni approach to Islam,
     which limited the spread of their influence as did their defeats by the Crusaders and Saladin.
     Internal disputes with other Shi’a groups and their internal divisions limited their ability to expand
     their influence. Candidates may note that they had considerable influence in the arts, architecture
     and intellectual pursuits through their founding of the first university. Commercial networks and
     missionary networks expanded into Asia which helped spread their version of Islam to new
     regions. Candidates’ opinions or conclusions will be presented clearly and supported by
     appropriate evidence.
                                                 –6–                  M22/3/HISTX/HP3/ENG/TZ0/AF/M


Section 3: The Crusades (1095–1291)

5.   “Religious belief was the main reason for participation in the Crusades.” Discuss.

     The question requires that candidates offer a considered and balanced review of the view that
     religious belief was the main reason for participation in the Crusades. Reasons may predate the
     timeframe but they must be clearly linked to the issue raised in the question. Candidates may refer
     to the Christian tradition of pilgrimage and the promise of personal salvation extended to all
     Crusaders, as well as the focus on the holy city of Jerusalem. Other factors such as a desire for
     land, personal wealth and position by individual Crusaders, as well as the tendency for monarchs
     to expand their power and prestige by taking part in Crusades may be discussed. Crusades were a
     method used by rulers and the Church to extract taxes, loans and other financial support from the
     populace. There were considerable commercial reasons for participation as demonstrated by the
     Italian city states. The Fourth Crusade showed that commercial not religious devotion was a crucial
     motive. Candidates’ opinions or conclusions will be presented clearly and supported by appropriate
     evidence.


6.   Evaluate the impact of the Crusades in the Middle East.

     The question requires that the candidates make an appraisal of the impact of the Crusades on the
     Middle East. Consequences may extend beyond the timeframe but they must be clearly linked to
     the issue raised in the question. Candidates may refer to the human and material costs of war on
     the region. Muslim political disunity was increased in the early stages and the power of opponents
     such as the Byzantine Empire was expanded. Ultimately, opposition to the Crusades led to an
     expansion of Muslim power under powerful leaders such as Saladin, which unified the region and
     eliminated the influence of the West and the Byzantine Empire. The Muslim world developed
     extensive commercial connections with the West, which expanded its wealth and influence. In
     addition, the Muslim world gained respect in Europe as a source of scientific and technological
     knowledge as well as other intellectual advancements. Candidates’ opinions or conclusions will be
     presented clearly and supported by appropriate evidence.
                                                 –7–                  M22/3/HISTX/HP3/ENG/TZ0/AF/M


Section 4: The Ottomans (1281–1566)

7.   Discuss the reasons for, and impact of, the Ottoman conquest of Egypt and Syria.

     The question requires that candidates offer a considered and balanced review of the reasons for,
     and the impact of, the Ottoman conquest of Egypt and Syria. Causes and consequences may
     extend beyond the timeframe but must be clearly linked to the issues raised in the question. For
     reasons, candidates may refer to the defeat of the Safavids which allowed the Ottomans to redirect
     their armies, the power of the Ottoman armies, the weakness of the Mamluks and the commercial
     and strategic importance of Egypt and Syria. For impact, candidates may refer to increased
     Ottoman influence in the Muslim world through their control of Mecca and Medina, Ottoman power
     limited Western imperialism and protected Muslim trade routes in the Red Sea and on the African
     coast. The conquest opened the way for the Ottoman conquest of North Africa and increased
     Muslim power in the Mediterranean. The conquest of Egypt secured the southern flank of the
     Empire and allowed the Ottomans to direct their armies to their principal goal of expansion into
     central and Eastern Europe. Candidates’ opinions or conclusions will be presented clearly and
     supported by appropriate evidence.


8.   “The desire for wealth was the most important reason for the Ottoman capture of Constantinople.”
     Discuss.

     The question requires that candidates offer a considered and balanced review of the statement
     that the desire for wealth was the most important reason for the Ottoman capture of
     Constantinople. Reasons may predate the timeframe but they must be clearly linked to the issue
     raised in the question. Candidates may refer to the wealth of Constantinople created by its control
     of trade routes and its position as the terminus of the Silk Road, the great wealth and treasure
     located in palaces, churches, markets and its enormous population. Other factors may include its
     strategic location between the Black Sea and the Mediterranean as well as Europe and Asia which
     challenged Ottoman control in the region. The desire to eliminate a Christian rival to Muslim power
     was important as was the prestige that would accrue from the conquest of the largest and
     wealthiest European city. The Ottoman desire to acquire a capital city which would reflect their
     power was important, as was the fact that Constantinople was militarily weak and had no allies.
     Candidates’ opinions or conclusions will be presented clearly and supported by appropriate
     evidence.

Section 5: Trade and the rise and decline of African states and empires (800–1600)

9.    Evaluate the importance of trans-Saharan trade in gold and salt to African states.

      The question requires candidates to make an appraisal of the significance of gold and salt in trans-
      Saharan trade weighing up their importance or otherwise. Candidates may refer to them as high-
      value commercial commodities and as main resources for the power and wealth of local kingdoms.
      States such as the Ghana and Mali Empires emerged and flourished due to their important
      strategic location on the trade routes, as they were able to levy taxes on the caravans carrying gold
      and salt which passed through their territories. The presence of traders from North Africa
      stimulated the spread of ideas and helped Islamify the region. Other relevant factors may be
      addressed, for example, the importance of territorial control of mines to the rise and decline of
      states, and the significance of trade to the expansion of markets and the growth of great cities such
      as Gao and Timbuktu. Gold dust was used as currency, which further facilitated the expansion of
      commerce. Candidates’ opinions or conclusions will be presented clearly and supported by
      appropriate evidence.


10.   “Political organization was the main factor in the rise and expansion of the Kingdom of Kongo.”
      Discuss.

      The question requires that candidates offer a considered and balanced review of the statement
      that political organization was the main factor in the rise and expansion of the Kingdom of Kongo.
      Reasons may predate the timeframe but they must be clearly linked to the issue raised in the
      question. Candidates may discuss the organization that linked the central power of the king, the
      Manikongo, to provincial and village powers, and the tax collection system that was the kingdom’s
      main source of income. Candidates may also refer to the limits of the kingdom’s centralized power,
      faced with provincial governors who could not always be easily controlled. Candidates may discuss
      other factors in the rise and expansion of the Kingdom, such as the importance of internal and
      external trade, the expansion of agriculture, the influence of Catholicism, and successful
      diplomacy, but with a focus on the issue raised in the question. Candidates’ opinions or
      conclusions will be presented clearly and supported by appropriate evidence.
                                                   –9–                  M22/3/HISTX/HP3/ENG/TZ0/AF/M


Section 6: Pre-colonial African states (1800–1900)

11.   Compare and contrast the rise of the Zulu under Shaka and the Sotho under Moshoeshoe.

      The question requires that candidates give an account of the similarities and differences between
      the rise of the Zulu under Shaka and the Sotho under Moshoeshoe. Candidates may compare and
      contrast in terms of military, political and social actions, referring to both throughout. Causes may
      predate the timeframe but they must be clearly linked to the issue raised in the question.
      Candidates may refer to Shaka’s actions of conquest and to Moshoshoe’s retreat to Thaba Bosiu
      to protect his people during the Mfecane/Difaqane, when wars among local communities and
      forced migratory movements developed in South African lands. They may contrast Shaka’s
      aggression with Moshoeshoe’s hospitality in offering sanctuary to refugees from conflict. Other
      aspects that can be discussed are the relevance of Shaka’s traditionally organized army, with
      around 100 000 soldiers, and the significance of the actions developed by Moshoeshoe from his
      settlement of Butha-Buthe, which became the centre of Sotho territory. Comparisons may include
      the importance of strong leadership and encouragement of intermarriage within the groups that
      they led. The importance of military abilities in the case of Shaka and diplomatic abilities in the
      case of Moshoeshoe may be also compared and/or contrasted.


12.   Evaluate the contributions of both Tewodros II and Yohannes IV to the unification of Ethiopia.

      The question requires that candidates make an appraisal of the contributions to Ethiopian
      unification of both Tewodros II and Yohannes IV weighing up the strengths and limitations of both
      individuals. Contributions to unification may predate the timeframe but they must be clearly linked
      to the issue raised in the question. Candidates may evaluate the significance of military actions
      and conquered territories, or of the process of cultural unification related to language and religion.
      Candidates may refer to the submission of peoples of different cultures under the Ethiopian state.
      Other relevant factors may be considered, for example, the link between trade with European
      countries and Ethiopian unification under Tewodros II and Yohannes IV, but with a focus on the
      issue in the question. Candidates may note that Tewodros focused on modernising Ethiopia
      through land reform and the creation of a professional army. However, his actions alienated other
      princes and elites such as the clergy and led to British armed intervention in the form of the Napier
      expedition. They may contrast this with Yohannes’s approach to domestic politics, which was more
      conciliatory. He was also successful in defending Ethiopia from external threats posed by Sudan,
      Egypt and Italy. Candidates’ opinions or conclusions will be presented clearly and supported by
      appropriate evidence.
                                                   – 10 –              M22/3/HISTX/HP3/ENG/TZ0/AF/M


Section 7: The slave trade in Africa and the Middle East (1500–1900)

13.   Evaluate the economic and social impact of the Atlantic slave trade in Africa.

      The question requires that candidates make an appraisal of the impact of the Atlantic slave trade in
      Africa weighing up the importance of the economic and social impact. Consequences may extend
      beyond the timeframe but they must be clearly linked to the issue raised in the question.
      Candidates may evaluate demographic effects and population imbalance, or they may focus on
      social disruption due to separation of enslaved Africans from their families and the preference for
      young males in Atlantic trade. Candidates may refer to the effects on the production of food and
      everyday goods, where agriculture was neglected and the slave trade was prioritized as the most
      important activity. They may also refer to the long-term legacy of rivalry and warfare between
      ethnic groups in West Africa due to slaving raids, or to the economic benefits which accrued to
      those African groups responsible for carrying out the raids and engaging in trade with the
      Europeans. Other relevant factors may be addressed, for example, the development of racism, but
      with a focus on the issue in the question. Candidates’ opinions or conclusions will be presented
      clearly and supported by appropriate evidence.


14.   To what extent did the 1807 Slave Trade Act impact the slave trade in Africa?

      The question requires that candidates consider the merits or otherwise of the suggestion that 1807
      Slave Trade Act impacted the slave trade in Africa. Consequences may extend beyond the Act’s
      enforcement timeframe but they must be clearly linked to the issue raised in the question.
      Candidates may refer to the objectives pursued by the Act and the effectiveness of British patrols
      in the ocean to bring them into force, or they may discuss successes and failures in the
      achievement of those objectives. Candidates may refer to the reasons for British interest in the end
      of the slave trade. Other relevant factors may be addressed, for example, the continuity of the
      slave trade by ships of other nationalities after the Slave Trade Act. Candidates may also refer to
      the effect of the Act on the slave trade in other parts of Africa not affected by British patrols.
      Candidates’ opinions or conclusions will be presented clearly and supported by appropriate
      evidence.
                                                    – 11 –                M22/3/HISTX/HP3/ENG/TZ0/AF/M


Section 8: European imperialism and the partition of Africa (1850–1900)

15.   To what extent was European national rivalry the main cause of the partition of Africa?

      The question requires that candidates consider the merits or otherwise of the statement that
      suggests that national rivalry was the main cause of the partition of Africa in the late 19th century.
      Reasons may predate the timeframe but they must be clearly linked to the issue raised in the
      question. Candidates may refer to European countries’ interests in Africa and the competition that
      emerged among them, or they may assess the issues that the absence of boundaries in the
      continent raised. Other relevant factors may be addressed, for example, the consolidation of
      European states and the rise of nationalism, and their concern about direct access to inland
      African resources after centuries of coastal trade. This led to the establishment of free navigation in
      the Congo and Niger Rivers during the Berlin West Africa Conference, and competition between
      explorers to sign treaties as proof of “effective occupation”. Candidates may note the significance
      of Anglo-French rivalry during the early period of the partition, with the fall-out from British military
      intervention in Egypt leading to the breakdown of the “gentleman’s agreement” in West Africa.
      They may also refer to Germany’s sudden arrival on the colonial scene in 1884, which led to sharp
      rivalry with the British in eastern and southern Africa in particular. Candidates’ opinions or
      conclusions will be presented clearly and supported by appropriate evidence.


16.   Examine the impact of King Leopold II’s activities in the Congo.

      The question requires that candidates consider the interrelationship between King Leopold II’s
      activities and their impact in the Congo region. Candidates may refer to the devastation of the
      territory along with the increasing wealth of the King during the last decades of the 19th century.
      Impacts may extend beyond the timeframe but they must be clearly linked to the issue raised in the
      question. Candidates may examine the resources that were found in the Congo territory, and their
      economic exploitation by King Leopold II through concessionary companies, or they may focus on
      the local effects of this exploitation. Candidates may refer to the political process that recognized
      the sovereignty of Leopold II on Congo territory. Other factors may be addressed, for example, the
      extended rights given to concessionary companies, that included the recruitment and control of
      forced local labour, or ways in which Leopold’s activities prompted colonial rivalry with other
      powers, but with a focus on the issue in the question. Candidates’ opinions or conclusions will be
      presented clearly and supported by appropriate evidence.

Section 9: Response to European imperialism (1870–1920)

17.   “The brutality of the colonizing powers was the main reason for resistance by African states.”
      Discuss.

      The question requires that candidates offer a considered and balanced review of the statement
      that the brutality of the colonizing powers was the main reason for resistance by African states.
      Reasons may extend beyond the timeframe but they must be clearly linked to the issue raised in
      the question. Candidates may refer to the brutal impositions of colonial powers during the process
      of establishment in Africa, and of the variety of resistances by Africans, or they may discuss the
      relationship between colonial behaviour and resistance movements. Candidates may refer to
      cultural, economic, political and religious resistance and present illustrative cases of the variety of
      responses in the different regions of the continent. Other relevant factors may be addressed, for
      example, the level of organization of resistance movements and their objectives, but with a focus
      on the issue in the question. Candidates’ opinions or conclusions will be presented clearly and
      supported by appropriate evidence.


18.   “African pragmatism was the most important factor in the decision to collaborate with European
      powers.” Discuss.

      The question requires that candidates offer a considered and balanced review of the statement
      that pragmatism was the main factor in the decision of local elites to collaborate with European
      powers. Candidates may discuss the role played by local elites during the establishment of
      colonialism in Africa and their relationship with colonial authorities, or they may focus on the
      reasons that led local elites to act as intermediaries between African people and colonial
      government. Candidates may refer to the benefits that collaborators enjoyed, but also to their
      actions for the protection of local people and the improvement of their conditions of life under
      European rule. Other relevant factors may be addressed, for example, the contribution of
      collaborators to the legitimacy of colonial powers, but with a focus on the issue in the question.
      Candidates’ opinions or conclusions will be presented clearly and supported by appropriate
      evidence.

Section 10: Africa under colonialism (1890–1980)

19.   Evaluate the economic and social developments in Angola under Portuguese rule to 1975.

      The question requires that candidates make an appraisal of the economic and social developments
      in Angola under Portuguese rule to 1975, weighing up their strengths and limitations. Candidates
      may refer to the organization and the results of the production programme promoted in Angola, or
      they may evaluate the impact of economic developments on local people. Candidates may refer to
      the organization of production, considering that Portuguese migrated to Angola to become farmers
      and that African people were employed as forced and cheap local labour. Other relevant factors
      may be addressed, for example, the industrialization growth in Portugal based on Angola’s raw
      materials and the level of dissatisfaction of the Angolan people due to exploitation and repression,
      but with a focus on the issue in the question. Candidates may also refer to the “assimilado” status,
      which was in theory accessible to all Angolans, or to the increase in institutional racism resulting
      from the influx of settlers after the Second World War, and how this discrimination contributed to
      the outbreak of liberation war. Candidates’ opinions or conclusions will be presented clearly and
      supported by appropriate evidence.


20.   “British policies were responsible for the creation of regional rivalries in Nigeria up to 1960.”
      Discuss.

      The question requires that candidates offer a considered and balanced review of the role that
      British policies played in the creation of regional rivalries in Nigeria up to 1960. Candidates may
      refer to the administrative divisions and the different modalities of rule that British colonial power
      established in Nigeria; or they may prioritize their discussion of the opposition that these divisions
      implied among Hausa-Fulani, Yoruba and Igbo, the main ethnic groups in the country. Candidates
      may refer to the characteristics of the indirect rule in the Northern region and the direct rule in the
      Southern region and examine ways in which the application of these differing administrative
      models entrenched divisions in Nigeria. Other relevant factors may be addressed, for example, the
      economic resources of Nigeria and the struggle among regional elites for the access to the benefits
      derived from their exploitation, but with a focus on the issue in the question. Candidate may argue
      that regional rivalries were always likely to have occurred in Nigeria, with fundamental cultural and
      religious differences between the Muslim north and Christian south. They may also examine the
      impact of different economic policies introduced by the colonial power in the various regions of the
      country. Candidates’ opinions or conclusions will be presented clearly and supported by
      appropriate evidence.

Section 11: 20th-century nationalist and independence movements in Africa

21.   “The Mau Mau uprising had little impact on the struggle for Kenyan independence.” Discuss.

      The question requires that candidates offer a considered and balanced review of the role that the
      Mau Mau uprising played in the struggle for Kenyan independence, which was achieved in 1963.
      Reasons that discuss this role may predate the timeframe but they must be clearly linked to the
      issue raised in the question. Candidates may refer to the process of emergence of the Mau Mau
      and the actions that developed, or they may prioritize the discussion of the main objectives that the
      movement pursued. Candidates may refer to the confiscation of most fertile lands by the colonial
      government in Kenya and the relationship of this process with the Mau Mau uprising and examine
      how the same grievances motivated others involved in the independence struggle. Candidates
      may discuss ways in which Mau Mau had a radicalising effect on the wider nationalist movement,
      with KANU leader Jomo Kenyatta spending time in jail for his alleged association with the
      movement. They may also refer to the mainly Kikuyu basis of the uprising and argue that this
      contributed to growing tensions within nationalist politics. They may note the brutal suppression of
      the uprising by the British and argue that this contributed to the colonial power’s determination to
      resist nationalist demands, or alternatively that the shock of the uprising hastened their departure
      from Kenya. Candidates’ opinions or conclusions will be presented clearly and supported by
      appropriate evidence.


22.   To what extent was nationalism the main factor in Senegal becoming independent?

      Candidates will consider the merits or otherwise of the statement that nationalism was the main
      factor in Senegal becoming independent in 1960. Reasons may predate the timeframe but they
      must be clearly linked to the issue raised in the question. Candidates may refer to the emergence
      and actions of nationalist political parties in Senegal, or they may refer to the activities and ideas of
      the main nationalist leaders, like Leopold Sedan Senghor. Candidates may refer to the relationship
      of Senegalese nationalist leaders with French colonial rule and to their participation in the French
      National Assembly. Other relevant factors may be addressed, for example, the reception of French
      assimilation policy by nationalist leaders and their position on the independence option that was
      offered in the 1958 French constitutional referendum, but with a focus on the issue in the question.
      Candidates’ opinions or conclusions will be presented clearly and supported by appropriate
      evidence.

Section 12: The Ottoman Empire (c1800–1923)

23.   Discuss the causes of the Greek War of Independence and its impact on the Ottoman Empire.

      The question requires that candidates offer a considered and balanced review of the causes of the
      Greek War of Independence and its impact on the Ottoman Empire. Causes and consequences
      may extend beyond the timeframe but must be clearly linked to the issue raised in the question.
      For causes, candidates may refer to increased Greek nationalism inspired by their increased
      wealth, the Enlightenment and nationalist movements in other states; Greek resentment of their
      position in the Ottoman Empire; financial and military support for their cause from Western Europe
      as well as Russia; a belief that the Ottomans were declining in power. For impact on the Ottomans,
      candidates may refer to a significant loss of territory and prestige; exposure of Ottoman weakness
      which encouraged further revolts in the Balkans; the emergence of Muhammad Ali in Egypt as an
      independent ruler; increased pressure from Russia on Turkish territory, which created the Eastern
      Question and forced the Ottomans into widespread reforms. Candidates’ opinions or conclusions
      will be presented clearly and supported by appropriate evidence.


24.   Evaluate the impact of the reforms implemented by the Young Turks.

      The question requires that candidates make an appraisal of the impact of the reforms implemented
      by the Young Turks. Impacts may extend beyond the timeframe but must be clearly linked to the
      issue raised in the question. Candidates may refer to improvements in government and the
      taxation system, social reforms, improving racial and gender rights and creating a secular and
      progressive society. Considerable improvements occurred in the military, transportation systems
      and urban development. Emphasis on Turkish nationalism caused dissent in minority groups
      leading to unrest. Their emphasis on Turkish nationalism led to suppression of political opposition
      and the emergence of dictatorship. Their nationalist policies led to the Balkan Wars which
      bankrupted the Ottoman Empire and prevented any further reforms and modernization. Their
      alliance with Germany led to involvement in the First World War and the collapse of the Ottoman
      Empire. Candidates’ opinions or conclusions will be presented clearly and supported by
      appropriate evidence.

Section 13: War and change in the Middle East and North Africa 1914–1945

25.   “The First World War was the most important reason for the growth of the nationalist movement in
      Egypt.” Discuss.

      The question requires that candidates offer a considered and balanced review of the statement
      that the First World War was the most important reason for the growth of the nationalist movement
      in Egypt. Candidates may refer to the wartime burdens placed on Egypt by Britain which led to
      financial hardships and growing support for independence. Woodrow Wilson’s Fourteen Points
      raised expectations for independence and resulted in an extensive uprising when Britain refused to
      allow an Egyptian delegation at Versailles or grant self-government. Britain’s arrest and deportation
      of nationalist leaders led to armed uprising and agitation in all social classes including women.
      Britain, weakened by war, lacked the strength to control the uprising and maintain control and was
      forced to enter into negotiations with the nationalists. This increased the prestige of the nationalists
      and resulted in the Constitution of 1922 in which Egypt became independent subject to certain
      conditions. Candidates may note that a powerful nationalist movement had developed prior to the
      First World War, laying the basis for eventual independence. Candidates’ opinions or conclusions
      will be presented clearly and supported by appropriate evidence.


26.   “Western influences had a significant impact on economic and social developments.” Discuss with
      reference to one of the following: Iran, Saudi Arabia or a North African state.

      The question requires that candidates offer a considered and balanced review of the statement
      that Western influences had a significant impact on economic and social developments in either
      Iran, Saudi Arabia or a North African state. Impact may extend beyond the timeframe but must be
      clearly linked to the issue raised in the question. Candidates may refer to Western influences such
      as economic and industrial development and the impact in the chosen country. The impact of
      Western development in raw materials such as oil is an example. Western ideas on education,
      politics, gender issues and religion may be considered for social impact. Candidates may explain
      reasons for the limited impact of Western influence. Responses may also show that whilst impact
      in economic areas was extensive, it was limited in the area of social development or vice-versa.
      Candidates’ opinions or conclusions will be presented clearly and supported by appropriate
      evidence.

Section 14: Africa, international organizations and the international community (20th century)

27.   Evaluate the effectiveness of the Organization of African Unity (OAU) in achieving its objectives.

      The question requires that candidates make an appraisal of the effectiveness of the Organization
      of African Unity (OAU), which was created in 1963, in achieving its objectives. Candidates may
      refer to the structure of the OAU and its main founding objectives, analysing successes and
      failures. They may evaluate the effectiveness of its actions considering that its main purposes were
      to rid the continent of any vestige of colonization, to promote cooperation among the newly
      independent African countries and to foster economic development. Candidates may refer to
      specific illustrative cases and also to OAU internal divisions, agreements and disagreements that
      obstructed or facilitated decision-making and courses of action. Other relevant factors may be
      addressed, for example, the particular economic and political interests of OAU members, but with a
      focus on the issue in the question. Candidates’ opinions or conclusions will be presented clearly
      and supported by appropriate evidence.


28.   “UN specialized agencies had a limited impact in Africa.” Discuss with reference to two agencies.

      The question requires that candidates offer a considered and balanced review of the role that
      United Nations specialized agencies played in 20th century Africa, with reference to two agencies.
      Results may extend beyond the timeframe but they must be clearly linked to the issue raised in the
      question. Candidates may focus on the impact of both chosen agencies in the continent as a
      whole, or they may discuss their impact in two specific selected cases inside Africa, that may or
      may not be from the same region. Candidates may refer to the limited or relevant consequences of
      the actions developed by agencies such as UNESCO, related to World Heritage Sites and
      education; the FAO, created to fight hunger; the UNIDO, that promotes industrial development; the
      ILO, specialized in labour international rights, or the WHO, with its focus on health, among the
      most important. Other relevant factors may be addressed, for example, the refugees’ issue and the
      effects of UNHCR actions in the continent. Candidates’ opinions or conclusions will be presented
      clearly and supported by appropriate evidence.

Section 15: Developments in South Africa 1880–1994

29.   Examine the political and economic consequences for the Boers of the discovery of gold.

      The question requires that candidates consider the interrelationship between the discovery of gold
      and its political and economic consequences for the Boers. Consequences may extend beyond the
      timeframe but must be clearly linked to the issue raised in the question. Candidates may refer to
      political consequences which involved a large influx of outsiders, who demanded political rights
      and challenged Boer power, which resulted in conflict. Boer nationalism was increased and new
      foreign policies were created to resist British pressure. Paul Kruger acquired a more authoritarian
      position as leader of the resistance to Britain. Economic consequences may include large
      increases in spending, investment and financial speculation, foreign trade increased sharply, the
      traditional agricultural economy was undermined. Government revenues increased which allowed
      for increased military expansion and infrastructure development. Wealth changed the traditional
      agricultural lifestyle, led to growing urbanization and saw the influx of many native and Asian
      workers which disrupted the social structure. The wealth of the Boers made them targets for
      imperial expansion by Britain and led to war. Candidates’ opinions or conclusions will be presented
      clearly and supported by appropriate evidence.


30.   “International opposition was the most important reason for the collapse of apartheid.” To what
      extent do you agree with this statement?

      The question requires that candidates consider the merits or otherwise of the statement that
      international opposition was the most important reason for the collapse of apartheid. Candidates
      may refer to international pressure from the 1960s onwards in sports, diplomacy and economics,
      and the role of African states in supplying bases and arms for the anti-apartheid struggle. The US
      embargo on investment post-1985 and world-wide financial and political pressure caused the
      government to make changes to end apartheid. Internal resistance to apartheid was somewhat
      effective as the Sharpeville and Soweto uprisings brought pressure for change despite strong
      military and police power; however, ANC guerrilla campaigns did cause white emigration,
      discouraged immigration and investment prior to 1985.The work of individuals such as Steve Biko
      and Desmond Tutu kept the issue of apartheid alive in the international consciousness as well as
      increasing domestic unrest and economic problems. Candidates’ opinions or conclusions will be
      presented clearly and supported by appropriate evidence.

Section 16: Social and cultural developments in Africa in the 19th and 20th centuries

31.   Examine the factors that promoted and limited the spread of Christianity in 19th century Africa.

      The question requires that candidates consider the interrelationship between the factors that
      promoted and limited the spread of Christianity in 19th century Africa. Causes may predate the
      timeframe but must be clearly linked to the issue raised in the question. Candidates may refer to
      factors which promoted Christianity such as the large expansion of the Christian missionary
      movement made possible by European wealth, exploration and the conquest of disease. European
      imperialism brought Christianity with it and pushed out or eliminated pagan and Muslim rivals.
      Christianity attracted many converts as a result of its social work in providing health care,
      education, social progress and economic opportunity. Factors inhibiting Christianity may include
      resentment at foreign conquest and Christian interference with established social customs such as
      polygamy. Areas with strong Muslim leaders and/or long-established Muslim traditions were able to
      resist the spread of Christianity. Candidates’ opinions or conclusions will be presented clearly and
      supported by appropriate evidence.


32.   Evaluate the impact of emigration on two African countries.

      The question requires that candidates make an appraisal of the impact of emigration on two
      African countries weighing up its importance or otherwise. Impacts may extend beyond the
      timeframe but they must be clearly linked to the issue raised in the question. Candidates may refer
      to the impact of emigration of educated/skilled individuals which may have a detrimental impact on
      the economy, government etc. Emigration may relieve economic or social stress, or it may relieve
      ethnic strife and rivalry through the emigration of various groups to another country. Emigration
      may allow political dissidents to locate to another country. This might be a source of difficulty for a
      country if the emigrants established political or military movements with the goal of overthrowing
      the government of their native country or creating unrest in that country. Large-scale emigration
      might be seen as a criticism of the government of the emigrants' home country and might be a
      source of political discontent. Other impacts may be considered, depending on the countries
      chosen. Candidates’ opinions or conclusions will be presented clearly and supported by
      appropriate evidence.

      Section 17: Post-war developments in the Middle East (1945–2000)

33.    “Post-war tensions and instability were the most important reasons for the origin of the state of
       Israel.” Discuss.

       The question requires that candidates offer a considered and balanced review of the statement
       that post-war tensions and instability were the most important reasons for the origin of the state of
       Israel. Reasons may predate the timeframe but they must be clearly linked to the issue raised in
       the question. Candidates may refer to Britain’s military weakness and inability to control conflict in
       Palestine after the Second World War. The inability to reach a negotiated settlement between
       Arabs and Jews led to the UN partition which recognized the creation of a Jewish state in
       Palestine. This caused further confusion and led to a power vacuum when Britain abandoned the
       mandate in 1948. Jewish armed forces and armaments had increased during the Second World
       War and allowed the Jewish population to seize control of the mandate. Candidates may refer to
       the role played by the USA and USSR in supporting Israel as well as the support from many
       countries and individuals as a result of the Holocaust. Candidates may also note the well-
       organized Jewish administrative structures that had existed pre-1939 which gave them the ability
       to quickly establish a government in the mandate. The work of leaders such as Ben-Gurion may be
       noted Candidates’ opinions or conclusions will be presented clearly and supported by appropriate
       evidence.


34.    “The Confessional state was the most important cause of the civil war in Lebanon in 1975.” To
       what extent do you agree with this statement?

       The question requires that candidates consider the merits or otherwise of the statement that the
       Confessional state was the most important cause of the civil war in Lebanon. Candidates may refer
       to the fact that Lebanon’s Confessional state was a fragile compromise to share political power
       between Christians and Muslims. The balance of power was delicate and vulnerable to change and
       there had been a number of conflicts amongst rival parties prior to 1975. The political balance was
       upset as the Muslim population increased significantly and socio-economic divisions widened
       further in 1973. Lebanese society fragmented into Christian and Muslim, left and right, all groups
       had armed militias and the state lacked power to maintain order. Further instability was caused by
       the presence of the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) in Lebanon. The civil war may be
       seen as a result of the Middle Eastern wars which led to Israeli support for the Christians and PLO
       support of the left-wing Muslims which encouraged and expanded the war. Candidates’ opinions or
       conclusions will be presented clearly and supported by appropriate evidence.

Section 18: Post-independence politics in Africa to 2005

35.   Compare and contrast the impact of civil war in two African countries.

      The question requires that candidates give an account of similarities and differences between the
      impact of two civil wars in Africa. There does not need to be an equal number of each. Impacts
      may predate the timeframe of the selected wars and they may extend beyond the timeframe but
      both must be clearly linked to the issue raised in the question. Candidates may refer to the civil
      wars political and economic background in the countries where each conflict took place and to the
      main reasons that led to the beginning of violence, considering the warring groups, their particular
      interests and the existence of foreign aid and intervention. Candidates may refer to internal
      impacts in the areas of politics, economics, religion and social structure as well as external impacts
      on alliances, foreign aid, economic development and regional relations. These consequences will
      be analysed and compared in order to produce an effective response supported by relevant
      evidence.


36.   Discuss the reasons for the establishment of single-party states in two African countries.

      The question requires that candidates offer a considered and balanced review of the reasons why
      single-party states were established in two African countries. Candidates may offer equal coverage
      of both states or they may prioritize their discussion of one. However, both aspects will be a feature
      of the response. Candidates may refer to the difficulties that new independent countries in Africa
      had to face in order to organize themselves as nation-states and why the single-party option was
      considered by nationalist leaders as the most convenient in the selected cases. Other relevant
      factors may be addressed, for example, the need for overcoming historical divisions and building
      social unity and also the ambitions of nationalist leaders who wanted to strengthen power and
      eliminate competition, but with a focus on the issue in the question. Candidates’ opinions or
      conclusions will be presented clearly and supported by appropriate evidence.
