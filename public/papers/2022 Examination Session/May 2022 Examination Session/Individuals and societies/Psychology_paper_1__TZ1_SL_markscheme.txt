                                          Section A
Biological approach to understanding behaviour

1.   Describe one effect of one hormone on behaviour, with reference to one relevant study.         [9]

     Refer to the paper 1 section A markbands when awarding marks.

     The command term “describe” requires candidates to give a detailed account of one effect of one
     hormone on behaviour, with reference to one relevant study.

     Any aspect of human behaviour (eg, aggression, attachment, sexual behaviour) is acceptable as
     long as the response focuses on how one hormone affects a particular behaviour.

     Although hormones may act as neurotransmitters by activating receptor sites within the synapse, it
     is the origin of the chemical that classifies it as a hormone. Responses that address the effect of
     neurotransmitters such as dopamine, serotonin, GABA and acetylcholine on behaviour should not
     be awarded marks.

     Relevant studies may include, but are not limited to:
     • Radke et al.’s (2015) study investigating the effect of testosterone on women’s responses to
       angry faces
     • McGaugh and Cahill’s (1995) study on the effect of adrenaline in memories linked to emotional
       arousal
     • Newcomer et al.’s (1999) study on cortisol and memory
     • Baumgartner et al.’s (2008) study on the effect of oxytocin on trust in economic behaviour.

     If a candidate describes more than one effect on more than one hormone, credit should be given
     only to the first effect or the first hormone described.

     If a candidate refers to more than one study credit should be given only to the first study.

     If a candidate describes the effect of one hormone without making reference to a study, up to a
     maximum of [5] should be awarded.

     If a candidate only describes a relevant study without describing the effect of the hormone, up to a
     maximum of [4] should be awarded.

Cognitive approach to understanding behaviour

2.   Describe one ethical consideration related to one relevant study from the cognitive approach to
     understanding behaviour.                                                                        [9]

     Refer to the paper 1 section A markbands when awarding marks.

     The command term “describe” requires candidates to give a detailed account of one ethical
     consideration related to one relevant study from the cognitive approach to understanding
     behaviour.

     The ethical consideration described can be one that was adhered to in the study (what guidelines
     were or could be followed) or one that was breached (what guidelines were not followed).

     Ethical considerations may include, but are not limited to:
     • protection of participants
     • issues of consent/assent
     • debriefing
     • right to withdraw from a study
     • use of deception
     • informed consent
     • confidentiality
     • anonymity.

     Studies related to the cognitive approach may include, but are not limited to:
     • Brewer and Treyens’ (1981) use of deception in the study of the effect of schemas on memory
     • Schacter and Singer’s (1962) use of deception in the study ofthe two-factor theory of emotion
     • Corkin et al. (1997) and lack of informed consent in the study of HM’s brain lesion in relation to
        memory
     • Loftus and Palmer’s (1974) use of deception in the study of reconstructive memory
     • Sharot et al. (2007) and protection from harm in the study of how emotion may affect memory.

     If a candidate describes more than one ethical consideration credit should be given only to the first
     description.

     If a candidate refers to more than one study, credit should be given only to the first study.

     If a candidate describes one ethical consideration without making reference to a relevant
     study, up to a maximum of [5] should be awarded.

     If a candidiate only describes a relevant study without describing one ethical consideration,
     up to a maximum of [4] should be awarded.

Sociocultural approach to understanding behaviour

3.   Describe social cognitive theory, with reference to one relevant study.                          [9]

     Refer to the paper 1 section A markbands when awarding marks.

     The command term “describe” requires candidates to give a detailed account of social cognitive
     theory in relation to one relevant study.

     The main concepts of social cognitive theory may include, but are not limited to:
     • imitation (for example, of role models)
     • vicarious learning
     • the role of attention, retention, motivation and reproduction
     • self-efficacy
     • reciprocal determinism.

     Relevant studies may include, but are not limited to:
     • Bandura et al.’s (1961) study on observational learning and aggression in children
     • Joy, Kimball and Zabrack’s (1986) study on the impact of television on children’s aggressive
       behaviour
     • Totten’s (2003) study on modelling of violent behaviour towards girlfriends
     • Sprafkin et al.’s (1975) study on children’s prosocial behaviour and television
     • Fagot et al.’s (1992) study on parental influences on gender development.

     If a candidate refers to more than one study, credit should be given only to the first study.

     If a candidate describes social cognitive theory without making reference to a study, up to a
     maximum of [5] should be awarded.

     If a candidate only describes an appropriate study without describing social cognitive theory,
     up to a maximum of [4] should be awarded.

Section B assessment criteria

A — Focus on the question

To understand the requirements of the question students must identify the problem or issue
being raised by the question. Students may simply identify the problem by restating the
question or breaking down the question. Students who go beyond this by explaining the
problem are showing that they understand the issues or problems.

 Marks    Level descriptor

    0     Does not reach the standard described by the descriptors below.


    1     Identifies the problem/issue raised in the question.


    2     Explains the problem/issue raised in the question.


B — Knowledge and understanding

This criterion rewards students for demonstrating their knowledge and understanding of
specific areas of psychology. It is important to credit relevant knowledge and understanding
that is targeted at addressing the question and explained in sufficient detail.

 Marks Level descriptor

    0    Does not reach the standard described by the descriptors below.


   1–2   The response demonstrates limited relevant knowledge and understanding.
         Psychological terminology is used but with errors that hamper understanding.

   3–4   The response demonstrates relevant knowledge and understanding but lacks detail.
         Psychological terminology is used but with errors that do not hamper understanding.

   5–6   The response demonstrates relevant, detailed knowledge and understanding.
         Psychological terminology is used appropriately
                                                   –8–                M22/3/PSYCH/SP1/ENG/TZ1/XX/M


C — Use of research to support answer

Psychology is evidence based so it is expected that students will use their knowledge of research to
support their argument. There is no prescription as to which or how many pieces of research are
appropriate for their response. As such it becomes important that the research selected is relevant
and useful in supporting the response. One piece of research that makes the points relevant to the
answer is better than several pieces that repeat the same point over and over.

 Marks Level descriptor

    0     Does not reach the standard described by the descriptors below.


   1–2    Limited relevant psychological research is used in the response. Research selected serves to
          repeat points already made.

   3–4    Relevant psychological research is used in support of the response, and is partly explained.
          Research selected partially develops the argument.

   5–6    Relevant psychological research is used in support of the response and is thoroughly
          explained. Research selected is effectively used to develop the argument.

D — Critical thinking

This criterion credits students who demonstrate an inquiring and reflective attitude to their
understanding of psychology. There are a number of areas where students may demonstrate critical
thinking about the knowledge and understanding used in their responses and the research used to
support that knowledge and understanding.

The areas of critical thinking are:
• research design and methodologies
• triangulation
• assumptions and biases
• contradictory evidence or alternative theories or explanations
• areas of uncertainty.

These areas are not hierarchical and not all areas will be relevant in a response. In addition, students
could demonstrate a very limited critique of methodologies, for example, and a well-developed
evaluation of areas of uncertainty in the same response. As a result, a holistic judgement of their
achievement in this criterion should be made when awarding marks.
                                                  –9–                 M22/3/PSYCH/SP1/ENG/TZ1/XX/M




 Marks Level descriptor

    0    Does not reach the standard described by the descriptors below.


   1–2   There is limited critical thinking and the response is mainly descriptive. Evaluation or
         discussion, if present, is superficial.

   3–4   The response contains critical thinking, but lacks development. Evaluation or discussion of
         most relevant areas is attempted but is not developed.

   5–6   The response consistently demonstrates well developed critical thinking. Evaluation
         and/or discussion of relevant areas is consistently well developed.

E — Clarity and organisation

This criterion credits students for presenting their response in a clear and organized manner. A good
response would require no re-reading to understand the points made or the train of thought
underpinning the argument.

 Marks Level descriptor

    0    Does not reach the standard described by the descriptors below.


    1    The answer demonstrates some organization and clarity, but this is not sustained throughout
         the response.

    2    The answer demonstrates organization and clarity throughout the response.

                                                Section B
4.   Discuss the relationship between genetics and behaviour.                                          [22]

     Refer to the paper 1 section B assessment criteria when awarding marks.

     The command term “discuss” requires candidates to offer a considered review of the relationship
     between genetics and behaviour.

     Candidates may address one behaviour to demonstrate depth of knowledge or may address more
     than one behaviour to demonstrate breadth of knowledge. Both approaches are equally
     acceptable.

     Relevant areas of the relationship between genetics and behaviour may include, but are not limited
     to:
     • mental health
     • intelligence
     • aggression
     • personality.

     Relevant studies may include, but are not limited to:
     • Bouchard et al.’s (1990) reports on the “Minnesota Twin Studies”
     • Plomin and Petrill’s (1997) research into the heritability of IQ in twin and adoption studies
     • Kendler et al.’s (2006) twin study on genetics and depression.
     • Caspi et al.’s (2003) study on genes and depression
     • Weissman et al.’s (2005) longitudinal family study on depression.
     • Gilbertson et al.’s (2002) study on PTSD in veterans.

     Critical discussion may include, but is not limited to:
     • methodological and ethical considerations related to research into the relationship between
        genetics and behaviour
     • how the research findings have been interpreted and applied
     • implications of the research findings
     • assumptions and biases
     • areas of uncertainty
     • supporting and/or contradictory evidence.

5.   Discuss reconstructive memory.                                                                  [22]

     Refer to the paper 1 section B assessment criteria when awarding marks.

     The command term “discuss” requires candidates to offer a considered review of reconstructive
     memory.

     Description of the nature of reconstructive memory could include, but is not limited to:
     • confabulation—a memory based on a fabricated, distorted or misinterpreted memory, often
       believed to be true in spite of contradictory evidence
     • schema processing—memory processing based on prior knowledge in the form of schemas that
       could result in distortion
     • false memories—recalling an event that never happened and believing it to be true.

     Relevant studies may include, but are not limited to:
     • Loftus and Palmer’s (1974) study into reconstructive memory (automobile study)
     • Riniolo et al.’s (2003) study in accuracy of eyewitness testimony
     • Miller and Gazzaniga’s (1998) study on creating false memories from visual scenes
     • Allport and Postman’s (1947) study in reconstructive memory for imagery
     • Yuille and Cutshall’s (1986) study of real life eye-witnesses
     • Bartlett's (1932) war of the ghosts study.

     Discussion may include, but is not limited to:
     • factors related to the false creation of memory
     • methodological and/or ethical considerations related to research into reconstructive memory
     • assumptions and biases
     • areas of uncertainty
     • supporting and/or contradictory evidence applications of the research.

6.   Discuss one cultural dimension of human behaviour.                                                 [22]

     Refer to the paper 1 section B assessment criteria when awarding marks.

     The command term “discuss” requires candidates to offer a considered review of one cultural
     dimension of human behaviour.

     Cultural dimensions may include, but are not limited to:
     • individualism/collectivism (eg Berry and Katz,1967; Kulkofsky et al., 2011 ; Wei et al., 2001)
     • power/distance (eg Zhang et al., 2010; Eylon and Au, 1999; Lynn et al., 1993)
     • long-term/short-term orientation (Confucian dynamism) (eg Chen et al., 2005; Hofstede and
       Bond, 1988)
     • masculinity/femininity (eg Vunderick and Hofstede, 1998)
     • uncertainty avoidance (eg Shane, 1995).

     Responses should present the core traits that define the chosen cultural dimension. For example,
     candidates may discuss that individualistic societies focus on uniqueness, achievement and
     freedom, whereas collectivistic societies focus on family, relationships and a common fate or
     heritage.

     Candidates may address the chosen cultural dimension generally, for example, that it is the effect
     of a culture on the beliefs and values of a society, or in a more detailed manner with explanations
     based on social mobility, agricultural versus urban, democratic principles, economic stability, etc.
     Both approaches are equally acceptable.

     Discussion may include, but is not limited to:
     • methodological related to the research into cultural dimensions
     • how the findings of research have been interpreted and applied
     • implications of the findings
     • assumptions and biases
     • areas of uncertainty
     • supporting and/or contradictory evidence
     • alternative explanations.

     If a candidate discusses more than one cultural dimension, credit should be given only to the first
     cultural dimension discussed.
