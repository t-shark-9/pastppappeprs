Critical Thinking – explanation, analysis and evaluation

These trigger words often signal critical thinking. The bold words are the key terms in the various
criteria.
Explanation – Because, as a result of, due to, therefore, consequently, for example
Analysis – Furthermore, additionally, however, but, conversely, likewise, in addition, on the other hand,
whereas
Evaluation ‫ –ؘ‬My opinion, overall, although, despite, on balance, weighing up
Examiners should be aware that in some cases, candidates may take a different approach, which if
appropriate should be rewarded. If in doubt, check with your team leader.

In the case of an “identify” question read all answers and mark positively up to the maximum marks.
Disregard incorrect answers. In all other cases where a question asks for a certain number of facts
eg “describe two kinds”, mark the first two correct answers. This could include two descriptions,
one description and one identification, or two identifications.

It should be recognized that, given time constraints, answers for part (c) questions are likely to
include a much narrower range of issues and concepts than identified in the markband. There is
no “correct” answer. Examiners must be prepared to award full marks to answers which
synthesize and evaluate even if they do not examine all the stimulus material.

(b)   (i)    The team developing the smartwatch app followed the project development
             life cycle (PDLC).

             Explain why end-users should be involved in the development of products
             such as the smartwatch app.                                                   [3]

             Answers may include:
             • End-users are able to provide an insight into how a product may function
             • … which may not be possible to obtain from in-house testing (alpha
               testing)
             • … as this may not expose the product to the range of situations it may
               be expected to function in
             • … and could be considered to be beta testing
             • … will make end-product more marketable / desirable to the end-user.

             • End-user testing can take place in the customer's environment.
             • … allowing them to use the program under normal conditions
             • … which may allow them to find ‘bugs’ / features which need improving /
               discover new features and suggest these to the developers
             • … which may lead to making the end-users more likely to use the
               finished product as they are involved in its development.

             Award [1] for identifying a reason why end-users should be involved in the
             development of products such as the smartwatch app and [1] for each
             subsequent development of that reason up to [3].

             Note to examiners: the development of one idea with two additional points
             that develop it.


      (ii)   Explain why a feasibility study would be used in the development of
             products such as the smartwatch app.                                          [3]

             Answers may include:
             • Feasibility studies can provide the parameters for the development of a
               product.
             • This may provide / set constraints that the developers can work within.
             • … and may prevent the development going in directions that may prove
               to be unsustainable.
             • Determine the technical viability.
             • Determine the economic viability.
             • Determine how much time the project may take.

             Award [1] for identifying a reason why a feasibility study would be used in
             the development of products such as the smartwatch app and [1] for each
             subsequent development of that reason up to [3].

(c)   Many people use smartwatches to monitor their vital signs and manage their
      health.

      To what extent should an individual use a smartwatch to manage their health?         [8]

      Answers may include:
      Advantages:
      • Patients will be able to keep abreast of their vital signs / medical condition
        24/7.
      • This can lead to them having less need to go to the doctors or to use valuable
        health resources if the condition is not serious.
      • All the historical data may be captured.
      • The data will be more comprehensive than if it is only collected in a
        consultation with a doctor.
      • Which may mean it is easier to spot trends / abnormalities.
      • Might allow users to better manage illnesses which can be controlled, like
        diabetes and high blood pressure.
      • Allows users to maintain a healthy lifestyle as their vital signs can show the
        benefits of healthy activity e.g., exercise, good sleep, eating well etc.

      Disadvantages:
      • The app might suggest treatments which are not appropriate if the user’s
         symptoms do not match the ‘average’ symptoms for a particular condition.
      • Users of the smartwatch may become fixated by it, which could have negative
         effects (white coat syndrome).
      • May be unreliable - may be lost or damaged or experience software bugs
         which make them unreliable.
      • Technology in a smart watch may not provide accurate enough readings for
         medical use.
      • The user may not want to use the watch because they are worried about what
         might happen to the data which the watch generates i.e. could be sold to or
         shared with third parties / used against them by insurance companies or
         potential employers etc.

      In part (c) of this question it is expected there will be a balance in the ITGS
      terminology between IT technical terminology and the terminology related to
      social and ethical impacts.

           (i)     Identify two sensors that may be used to detect data about the weather
                   conditions.                                                                     [2]

                   Answers may include:
                   • (Atmospheric) pressure
                   • Temperature
                   • Wind (speed/direction)

                   • Rain / precipitation / water level (BOD)
                   • Sunlight

                   Award [1] for identifying each sensor that may be used to detect data about
                   weather conditions up to a maximum of [2].

           (ii)    State the primary key in the Ship table in Figure 3.                            [1]

           (iii)   State the relationship between the Ship table and Accident table in Figure 3.   [1]

                   One – many

           (iv)    Outline one advantage of using a relational database rather than a flat-file
                   database.                                                                       [2]

                   Answers may include:
                   • Any item of data is only entered once.
                   • … which eliminates redundant data.

                   • Removing redundant data
                   • … reduces the amount of storage space needed for the database.
                   • … reduces the chance of an error occurring.

                   • Normalization
                   • … reduces the chance of anomalies (eg update / deletion / insertion).

                   • Improves security of the data
                   • … as different permissions can be added to different tables.

                   Award [1] for identifying an advantage of a relational database rather than
                   a flat-file database and [1] for a development of that reason up to [2].

(b)   (i)    Distinguish between data validation and data verification.                            [2]

             Answers may include:
             • Data validation is the process of ensuring the data entered is valid
               (clean, correct and useful) using computer based rules (e.g. presence
               check, length check, type check, range check etc).
             • Data verification is the process of checking what has been entered is
               correct compared to the original (integrity) or by entering the data twice
               and comparing the instances of the data entry.

             Award [1] for a definition of data validation.
             Award [1] for a definition of data verification.

      (ii)   The MADAS system uses data visualization.

             Explain why data visualization is used by the MADAS system.                           [4]

             Answers may include:
             • Visualization is story telling with images, graphs and charts.
             • It uses mathematical operations to model events.
             • This enables complex data to be presented in a way that can be easily
               understood.
             • This allows the easy identification of trends
             • … to make connections between operations and results
             • … to identify future problems which may arise / predict accidents.

(c)   To what extent can the use of simulations like the MADAS system help prevent
      future accidents?                                                                      [8]

      Answers may include:

      Advantages:
      • There is a lot of data and if this is put together usefully then the causes of the
        accident can be better understood.
      • Understanding the accident will mean that mitigation strategies can be
        developed.
      • If the simulation was part of a training program then the simulations could be
        used to teach future boat pilots how to avoid the same kind of accidents.
      • Cheaper to run a situation through a simulation to see what will happen than
        to wait for it to happen in real life.
      • The information from the model and simulation may allow the authorities to
        make changes to the regulations.
      • “What if” simulation can be easily run to observe the effects of changes in
        behaviour or conditions.

      Disadvantages:
      • Simulations are only as accurate as the data which is given to them. GIGO.
      • Simulations might be biased because they have been created by a particular
         organisation / company.
      • Simulations are not the real thing so even if a person has trained on a
         simulation, there is no guarantee that this will mean they will know what to do
         if facing a possible accident.
      • Too many variables to account for and it is unclear which of these might have
         made the accident worse or better.

      In part (c) of this question it is expected there will be a balance in the ITGS
      terminology between IT technical terminology and the terminology related to
      social and ethical impacts.

                  applications, they will need to store their data on a local file server and
                  access it through a local area network (LAN).

                  Identify two ways in which data could be secured if the school stored it
                  locally.                                                                         [2]

                  Answers may include:
                  • Different levels of access
                  • Login (username and password / biometrics)
                  • Firewalls, proxy server

(b)   The European Union’s (EU) General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) governs
      data protection and privacy in the EU. Its regulations give users certain rights in
      terms of their data.

      Explain three principles that should be included in data protection regulations
      such as GDPR.                                                                         [6]

      Answers may include:
      • The right to know who has access to my data
      • … and for the purposes it is being used for.

      • The level of security used to protect the data
      • … so only appropriate users of the data have access.

      • The purpose that the data will be used for
      • … will it be shared with third parties.

      • Data will not be processed without informed consent from the owner
      • … unless there is a legal requirement to process the data

      • Requires that the holder of the data controller provides information to the data
        subject
      • … in a concise, transparent, intelligible and easily accessible form, using clear
        and plain language.

      • The data subject has the right to be forgotten
      • … so data can be deleted after it has served its required purpose.

      • Data should be stored on a server within the same country or within a country
        with similar data protection legislation in place.
      • … so that the owner of the data is sure that its security remains protected.

(c)   A new school has opened in Switzerland and its IT Manager is considering two
      options:
      • Option 1: Using a local client–server network.
      • Option 2: Using a cloud-based service.

      Evaluate the implications of these two options for the IT Manager.                   [8]

      Answers may include:
      Option 1:
      Advantages
      • The management of the client-server network can be carried out in-house
        which will mean the way in which the network is set up can be tailored to the
        school’s needs.
      • There will be fewer costs to external agencies for the upkeep of the network
        i.e. there is no monthly fee / subscription fees etc. Which will need to be
        managed by the IT Manager.
      • The IT Manager will have complete knowledge about where their data is held.
      • A client-server network allows in-house control of backup and security (this
        could be argued from both sides depending on the competency of the IT staff).

      Disadvantages
      • The hardware costs for network infrastructure as well as software licencing
         costs will need to be paid by the school and managed by the IT manager.
      • IT manager will need to employ staff who can manage the network and
         maintain the hardware or arrange for this to be outsourced.


      Option 2:
      Advantages
      • The management of the client-server network can be carried out remotely by
        the cloud service provider which will mean that IT Manager will not have to
        carry out a number of tasks linked to the maintenance of the network.
      • The cloud-based provider will provide backing up facilities as part of the
        service so the IT Manager will not have to address this issue.
      • The cloud-based provider will be able to provide up to date versions of
        software and services more efficiently than the IT Manager who may have to
        buy them in after carrying out due diligence.

      Disadvantages
      • Increasing the storage capacity of the network would be easily done by
         requesting this from the cloud service provider. No addition hardware or
         infrastructure will be required.
      • There will still be a need to have some hardware and software on site (for
         example print servers) which will need to be purchased and maintained by the
         IT manager.

      In part (c) of this question it is expected there will be a balance in the ITGS
      terminology between IT technical terminology and the terminology related to
      social and ethical impacts.

                   Answers may include:
                   • Authentication – confirming the identity of a person/the person is who
                     they say they are.
                   • Authorization – determining the user’s access levels to computer

(b)   (i)    Other governments are considering setting up similar systems that will use
             facial recognition to gather information about the behaviour of its citizens.

             Explain why the development of a requirements specification is important in
             the development of a new facial recognition system.                             [3]

             Answers may include:
             • Sets out the key decisions that need to be made about the nature of the
               solution.
             • Identifies the potential challenges in the implementation of the facial
               recognition system.
             • Provides a list of goals/benefits/challenges.
             • Provides some indication of what may be required in a feasible solution
               such as hardware and software requirements.
             • Helps to estimate budgets to have a proper solution implementation
               based on the requirements.
             • Reduces chance of errors.
             • Reduces the need for redesigns – therefore saving money.
             • Gives a list of functional requirements against which the final system can
               be tested.

             Award [1] for identifying a reason why the development of a requirements
             specification is important and [1] for each subsequent development of that
             reason up to [2].

      (ii)   Explain why using high-resolution images could be a challenge to the
             implementation of a facial recognition system.                                  [3]

             Answers may include:
             • High resolution images may require a longer transfer time.
             • Which will require computers with high specifications to be processed in
               a timely manner.
             • May require considerable storage space.
             • May require lossy compression to transfer them quickly which may lead
               to a reduction in the quality / usefulness of the image.

             Award [1] for identifying a reason why having images with a higher
             resolution could be a challenge to the implementation of a facial recognition
             system and [1] for each subsequent development of that reason up to [2].

(c)   Discuss the advantages and disadvantages of a government using a facial
      recognition system to monitor the behaviour of its citizens.                          [8]

      Answers may include:
      Advantages:
      • May improve people’s behaviour as they will know they are being watched.
      • May stop crime before it happens meaning fewer people in jail or in court.
        Similar to a speeding camera but for people.
      • Might need fewer police to patrol and put themselves in danger.
      • Could help to improve the physical environment by catching those who litter /
        responsible for polluting the environment.
      • Could allow people to be more accurately identified leading to fewer false
        accusations/prosecutions.
      • Allows the government to track and apprehend criminals i.e., makes society
        safer as criminals are caught.

      Disadvantages:
      • Feeling of being watched will be bad for morale of population.
      • May lead to a distrust in the government.
      • Might be punished incorrectly (or rewarded incorrectly) if the facial recognition
         fails.
      • Criminals might just find other ways of committing crime (like wearing masks
         or avoiding the cameras).
      • People wear masks (against pollution) or hats which cover their faces (when it
         is very cold), won’t be recognised that easily.
      • Invasion of privacy as people are never able to not be under surveillance.
      • May take up considerable resources in developing and maintaining the data
         and hardware.
      • Facial recognition is not that accurate so there might be many false positives.
