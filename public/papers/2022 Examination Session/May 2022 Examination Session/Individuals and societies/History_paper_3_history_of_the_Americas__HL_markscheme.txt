Apply the markbands that provide the “best fit” to the responses given and award credit wherever it is
possible to do so. If an answer indicates that the demands of the question are understood and
addressed but that not all implications are considered (for example, compare or contrast; reasons
or significance; methods or success), then examiners should not be afraid of using the full range of
marks allowed for by the markscheme. Responses that offer good coverage of some of the criteria
should be rewarded accordingly.

 Marks     Level descriptor
           • Responses are clearly focused, showing a high degree of awareness of the demands
              and implications of the question. Answers are well structured, balanced and effectively
              organized.
           • Knowledge is detailed, accurate and relevant. Events are placed in their historical
              context, and there is a clear understanding of historical concepts.

Section 1: Indigenous societies and cultures in the Americas (c750–1500)

1.   Discuss the role of tribute in two indigenous societies or cultures in pre-Columbian Americas.

     The question requires that candidates offer a considered and balanced review of the role of tribute
     in two indigenous societies or cultures in pre-Columbian Americas. Candidates may offer equal
     coverage of each chosen society or culture, or they may prioritize their discussion of the role of
     tribute in one. However, both societies or cultures will be a feature of the response. Candidates
     may refer to the economic role of tribute, arguing that it led to economic growth, as it allowed for
     specialized economies, which would commercialize excess goods through the tribute. They may
     also discuss the role of tribute in terms of redistribution, as tax collection, in some societies,
     intended to meet social needs. Candidates may also argue that tribute allowed for organic political
     expansion and the exercise of control over newly acquired territories; or discuss the symbolic
     importance of tribute as a tool of foreign policy and conquest. Candidates' opinions or conclusions
     will be presented clearly and supported by appropriate evidence.


2.   Discuss the role of religion in two indigenous societies or cultures in pre-Columbian Americas.

     The question requires that candidates offer a considered and balanced review of the role of religion
     in two indigenous societies or cultures in pre-Columbian Americas. Candidates may offer equal
     coverage of each chosen society or culture, or they may prioritize their discussion of the role of
     religion in one. However, both societies or cultures will be a feature of the response. Candidates
     may argue that socially, religious beliefs were significant as they established codes of behaviour
     and legitimized social roles. Furthermore, they may discuss religion’s political role in legitimizing
     rulers’ power; or the role of religious practices such as human sacrifice as foreign policy tools, as
     they helped to enforce control over newly conquered populations. Further discussion on the role of
     religion may cover its economic role in enhancing productivity, as dictating the times and ways of
     cultivation; or in legitimizing uneven distribution of wealth. Candidates' opinions or conclusions will
     be presented clearly and supported by appropriate evidence.

Section 2: European explorations and conquests in the Americas (c1492–c1600)

3.   Compare and contrast French and British exploration and conquest in the Americas.

     The question requires that candidates give an account of the similarities and differences between
     the French and the British in terms of their exploration and conquest in the Americas, referring to
     both throughout. There does not need to be an equal number of each. Causes as well as
     consequences may predate or extend beyond the timeframe but they must be clearly linked to the
     issue raised in the question. Candidates may refer to efforts of specific explorers, for example
     Frobisher, Gilbert and Raleigh for England or Cabot, Cartier and Ribault for France. Candidates
     may also focus on comparison and contrast of the motives for both countries, for example the
     attempt to discover the Northwest Passage, establish trade monopolies, exploit natural resources
     such as gold or furs, claim specific areas of land or compete with colonial rivals. Candidates might
     also address the relative success of the French and British efforts as part of their comparison and
     contrast.


4.   Evaluate the impact of Spanish exploration and conquest on the indigenous populations in the
     Americas.

     The question requires that candidates make an appraisal of the impact of Spanish exploration and
     conquest on the indigenous populations in the Americas. Impacts may extend beyond the
     timeframe but they must be clearly linked to the issue raised in the question. Candidates may refer
     to the extensive depopulation of the Americas through disease, warfare and enslavement,
     environmental impact of natural resource exploitation, creation of a sizable Mestizo class within a
     class structure that permanently assigned those of indigenous or mixed heritage to a lower status
     and the imposition of Catholic religious culture at the expense of indigenous culture. Other relevant
     factors may be evaluated, for example the introduction of European crops and animals that
     expanded the food supply and transportation options of the indigenous people, but with a focus on
     the issue in the question. Candidates’ opinions or conclusions will be presented clearly and
     supported by appropriate evidence.
                                                   –6–                  M22/3/HISTX/HP3/ENG/TZ0/AM/M


Section 3: Colonial government in the New World (1500 –1800)

5.   Evaluate the impact of European mercantilist policies on colonial American economies.

     The question requires that candidates make an appraisal of European mercantilist policies,
     weighing up its positive and negative consequences on colonial American economies.
     Consequences may extend beyond the timeframe but they must be clearly linked to the issue
     raised in the question. Candidates may draw differences between British and Spanish mercantilist
     policies, and argue that lax British control until the Seven Years’ War allowed some industries to
     prosper, whereas Spanish excessive focus on the extraction of surface wealth led to the
     underdevelopment of agriculture, industry and commerce in the colonies. Furthermore, candidates
     can also look upon the restrictive effects of trade regulations upon economic growth in both
     Spanish and British America; evaluate the economic effects of excessive taxation by the parent
     country; or refer to the slave trade as a consequence of the implementation of mercantilist policies.
     Candidates’ opinions or conclusions will be presented clearly and supported by appropriate
     evidence.


6.   “Resistance to colonial authority was mainly motivated by political concerns.” Discuss.

     The question requires that candidates offer a considered and balanced review of the statement
     that resistance to colonial authority was mainly motivated by political concerns. Causes may
     predate the timeframe but they must be clearly linked to the issue raised in the question. To
     propose that political concerns were the main cause of resistance to colonial authority, candidates
     may refer to the impact of the ideas of the Enlightenment in mobilizing the leaders of the protest
     movements against colonial powers, given colonial restrictions to autonomous decision-making.
     Other relevant factors may be addressed, for example economic concerns generated by excessive
     taxation and regulation; or social discontent given social stratification and racial tensions, but with a
     focus on the issue in the question. Candidates may also discuss that the weakening power of the
     parent country contributed to the organization of resistance. Candidates’ opinions or conclusions
     will be presented clearly and supported by appropriate evidence.
                                                 –7–                  M22/3/HISTX/HP3/ENG/TZ0/AM/M


Section 4: Religion in the New World (1500–1800)

7.   “British North American colonies mostly practiced religious tolerance.” To what extent do you agree
     with this statement?

     The question requires that candidates consider the merits or otherwise of the statement that the
     British North American colonies mostly practiced religious tolerance. Candidates may offer equal
     coverage of evidence supporting tolerance and intolerance or they may prioritize their assessment
     of either. However, both aspects will be a feature of the response. As evidence to support
     tolerance candidates may refer to the desire by colonists to avoid the extremes of religious
     persecution and warfare experienced in Europe, the tenets of the Quaker faith that emphasized
     toleration and the Maryland Act of Toleration implemented by Catholics. As support for intolerance
     candidates might apply the theocratic practices of New England Puritans and the application of
     laws in some colonies (by Puritans and Anglicans) requiring taxes in support of an “established
     church”. Other relevant factors may be addressed, for example the rejection by European colonists
     of indigenous and African religious beliefs, but with a focus on the issue in the question.
     Candidates’ opinions or conclusions will be presented clearly and supported by appropriate
     evidence.


8.   “The impact of the Great Awakening c1720–c1760 was more social than political.” Discuss.

     The question requires that candidates offer a considered and balanced review of the statement
     that the impact of the Great Awakening was more social than political. Candidates may offer equal
     coverage of social and political impact, or they may prioritize their discussion of either. However,
     both aspects will be a feature of the response. Candidates may refer to the social impact of revival
     meetings which united people from different regions and classes, the egalitarian impact of an
     emotional conversion experience which appealed to the poor and uneducated, and the religious
     schisms created by the Great Awakening that caused a loss of power for older sects and their
     leaders. Other relevant factors may be addressed, for example the emphasis the Awakening
     placed on equality that undermined the institution of slavery as well as deference to British
     authority and the political experience gained that was used to assert power against the colonial
     elites (with both contributing to the coming of the American Revolution), but with a focus on the
     issue in the question. Candidates’ opinions or conclusions will be presented clearly and supported
     by appropriate evidence.
                                                  –8–                  M22/3/HISTX/HP3/ENG/TZ0/AM/M


Section 5: Slavery and the New World (1500–1800)

9.    “Economic factors were the main reason for the introduction of slavery in the New World.” Discuss.

      The question requires that candidates offer a considered and balanced review of the statement
      that economic factors were the main reason for the introduction of slavery in the New World.
      Causes may predate the timeframe but they must be clearly linked to the issue raised in the
      question. Candidates may refer to labour needs imposed by new production schemes in the New
      World as an economic factor leading to the introduction of slavery. They may expand, considering
      that colonizers' ill-treatment of the indigenous societies and the spread of diseases added to the
      shortage of labour needed; or may look into the failure at finding alternative sources of labour, such
      as indentured servants. Other relevant factors may be addressed, for example ideological, arguing
      that entrenched racism among Europeans facilitated its justification; or religious, developing the
      perspective that religious conversion justified enslavement of both indigenous and African people;
      but with a focus on the issue in the question. Candidates’ opinions or conclusions will be presented
      clearly and supported by appropriate evidence.


10.   To what extent was opposition to the slave trade and slavery in British America successful?

      The question requires that candidates consider the merits or otherwise of the suggestion that
      opposition to the slave trade and slavery in British America was successful. Candidates may offer
      equal coverage of successes and failures, or they may prioritize their assessment of either one.
      However, both aspects will be a feature of the response. Candidates may refer to the opposition to
      the slave trade and slavery in British America developed by the Quakers and claim that while they
      were effective at raising anti-slavery sentiment among members, their impact on legislation during
      most parts of the seventeenth and eighteenth century was minimal. Furthermore, they may also
      argue that by the end of the eighteenth century, anti-slavery sentiments among Quakers began to
      crystalize into action, evaluating, for example, the impact that John Woolman and Anthony Benezet
      had on manumissions. Candidates may also evaluate achievements that came with the ratification
      of the US Constitution; or evaluate the successes and failures of the 1739 Stono Revolt in the
      Carolinas. Candidates’ opinions or conclusions will be presented clearly and supported by
      appropriate evidence.
                                                  –9–                 M22/3/HISTX/HP3/ENG/TZ0/AM/M



Section 6: Independence movements (1763–1830)

11.   Examine the importance of foreign intervention on the success of independence movements in the
      Americas.

      The question requires that candidates consider the interrelationship between foreign intervention
      and the success of independence movements in the Americas. Results may extend beyond the
      timeframe but they must be clearly linked to the issue raised in the question. Candidates may refer
      to foreign contributions in terms of troops and navy and evaluate their impact on military
      campaigns and naval warfare. Candidates may also argue that the expansion of conflict as a result
      of foreign intervention weakened the colonial power, which was forced to over-extend its military
      forces, draining economic resources. Other relevant interrelationships may be considered, for
      example the training provided by foreign powers to local troops that impacted their success, but
      with a focus on the issue in the question. Candidates’ opinions or conclusions will be presented
      clearly and supported by appropriate evidence.


12.   Evaluate the military contributions of two of the following leaders to the process of independence:
      Washington, Bolivar or San Martin.

      The question requires that candidates make an appraisal of the military contributions of two
      leaders to the process of independence, weighing up their strengths and limitations. Candidates
      may offer equal coverage of either Washington, Bolivar or San Martin, or they may prioritize their
      evaluation of one. However, the military contributions of two leaders must be featured in the
      response. For Washington, examples of his military contributions may be taken from the period of
      July 1775 to the end of the war, including events such as Valley Forge and the siege of Yorktown.
      For San Martin, his military contributions to the independence of Argentina, Chile or Peru may be
      evaluated. For Bolivar, an evaluation of his military contributions either to New Granada or Peru’s
      independence may be proposed. Candidates’ opinions or conclusions will be presented clearly
      and supported by appropriate evidence.
                                                   – 10 –               M22/3/HISTX/HP3/ENG/TZ0/AM/M


Section 7: Nation-building and challenges (c1780–c1870)

13.   “The Articles of Confederation were largely successful in resolving the challenges that came with
      independence.” Discuss.

      The question requires that candidates offer a considered and balanced review of the statement
      that the Articles of Confederation were largely successful in resolving challenges that came with
      independence. Candidates may offer equal coverage of evidence suggesting successful resolution
      of challenges and the failure to resolve challenges, or they may prioritize their discussion of either.
      However, both aspects will be a feature of the response. Candidates may refer to the successful
      conduct of the war for independence, the implementation of the Northwest Ordinances of 1785 and
      1787, and the maintenance of sovereignty. Other relevant factors may be addressed, for example
      the inability to enforce adherence to the Treaty of Paris, the absence of taxation power contributing
      to Shay’s Rebellion and the inability to regulate commerce causing economic distress, all of which
      led to the writing of the 1787 Constitution, but with a focus on the issue in the question.
      Candidates’ opinions or conclusions will be presented clearly and supported by appropriate
      evidence.


14.   “The 1837 rebellions in Canada were caused more by political than economic factors.” Discuss.

      The question requires that candidates offer a considered and balanced review of the statement
      that the 1837 rebellions in Canada were caused more by political than economic factors. Causes
      may predate the timeframe but they must be clearly linked to the issue raised in the question.
      Candidates may offer equal coverage of political and economic factors, or they may prioritize their
      discussion of either. However, both aspects will be a feature of the response. Candidates may
      refer to the linguistic and religious divisions between the British ruling class and the French
      residents in Lower Canada, the impact of falling grain prices and the cholera epidemic unwittingly
      caused by British migrants. Other relevant factors may be addressed, for example in Upper
      Canada the abuse of political power by the “Family Compact”, discontent with the favouritism
      granted to supporters of the Church of England and the denial of political rights to Loyalist emigres,
      but with a focus on the issue in the question. Candidates’ opinions or conclusions will be presented
      clearly and supported by appropriate evidence.

Section 8: US Civil War: causes, course and effects (1840–1877)

15.   To what extent was westward expansion the main cause of the Civil War?

      The question requires that candidates consider the merits or otherwise of the suggestion that
      westward expansion was the main cause of the Civil War. Causes may predate the timeframe but
      they must be clearly linked to the issue raised in the question. Candidates may offer equal
      coverage of evidence supporting the suggestion and evidence opposed to the suggestion or they
      may prioritize their assessment of either position. However, both aspects will be a feature of the
      response. Candidates may refer to the Southern demands for westward expansion caused by “soil
      exhaustion”, the expansionist impact of the Mexican War and the effects of popular sovereignty as
      illustrated by the Kansas-Nebraska Act. Other relevant factors may be addressed, for example the
      failures of leadership as exhibited by James Buchanan, the growth of irreconcilable economic
      differences between the North and South and the impact of crisis events (for example, John
      Brown’s raid or the Dred Scott Supreme Court decision), but with a focus on the issue in the
      question. Candidates’ opinions or conclusions will be presented clearly and supported by
      appropriate evidence.


16.   “Reconstruction was an economic failure, but a political success by 1877.” Discuss.

      The question requires that candidates consider the merits or otherwise of the statement that
      Reconstruction was an economic failure, but a political success by 1877. Consequences may
      extend beyond the timeframe but they must be clearly linked to the issue raised in the question.
      Candidates may offer equal coverage of economic and political factors, or they may prioritize their
      assessment of either. However, both aspects will be a feature of the response. Candidates may
      refer to the slow recovery of the Southern economy, absent economic assistance from the national
      government and the early termination of the Freedman’s Bureau hindering the ability of freedmen
      to gain land or education. Other relevant factors may be addressed, for example the political
      achievements of freedmen in Reconstruction governments and the rights gained by passage of the
      13th, 14th and 15th amendments (though also the brief enforcement of these gains), but with a
      focus on the issue in the question. Candidates’ opinions or conclusions will be presented clearly
      and supported by appropriate evidence.

Section 9: The development of modern nations (1865–1929)

17.   “Immigration had a largely positive impact on the development of nations.” Discuss with reference
      to two countries in the Americas.

      The question requires that candidates offer a considered and balanced review of the statement
      that immigration had a largely positive impact on the development of nations. Results may extend
      beyond the timeframe but they must be clearly linked to the issue raised in the question.
      Candidates may offer equal coverage of positive and negative consequences of immigration, or
      they may prioritize their discussion of one. However, both aspects will be a feature of the response.
      Candidates may refer to immigration’s positive impact on urbanization, industrialization and rural
      production; immigrants’ cultural and religious contributions; or argue that immigration contributed to
      political development, as introducing new ideas and/or enhancing political
      organization. Alternatively, candidates may refer to the strain on urban centres that immigration
      meant in the short-term; suggest that low-skilled immigrants may have contributed to economic
      growth but not necessarily development; or argue that initially immigrants were not politically
      active. Candidates’ opinions or conclusions will be presented clearly and supported by appropriate
      evidence.


18.   Evaluate the contributions to the search for civil rights of two of the following leaders:
      Booker T Washington, W E B Du Bois or Marcus Garvey.

      The question requires that candidates make an appraisal of the contributions of two of the
      identified leaders to the search for civil rights. Candidates may offer equal coverage of the selected
      leaders or they may prioritize their evaluation of one, but both chosen leaders will be a feature of
      the response. Consequences/results may extend beyond the timeframe but they must be clearly
      linked to the issue raised in the question. Candidates may refer to Washington’s “gradualist” efforts
      to improve African American economic self-sufficiency, while accepting discrimination, as
      necessary to gain support from the white power structure of his time. They may assert that Du
      Bois’ demands for full and immediate social and political equality, while considered radical at the
      time, were crucial to the eventual end of racial discrimination. Candidates may contend that
      Garvey’s support for black nationalism and racial purity, while promoting black pride, gained little
      traction in the civil rights’ movement and was largely ineffective. Candidates’ opinions or
      conclusions will be presented clearly and supported by appropriate evidence.

Section 10: Emergence of the Americas in global affairs (1880–1929)

19.   “Political factors were the main cause of United States’ expansionist foreign policy.” Discuss.

      The question requires that candidates offer a considered and balanced review of the statement
      that political factors were the main cause of United States’ expansionist foreign policy. Causes may
      predate the timeframe but they must be clearly linked to the issue raised in the question.
      Candidates may refer to political causes such as the role of Presidents McKinley, Roosevelt and
      Taft who saw expansion as a unifying force, the popular notion of the US as an emerging world
      power, and the geo-political influence of Alfred Mahan. Other relevant factors may be addressed,
      for example economic investments in Hawaii and Cuba, the desire for expansion into Asian
      markets (leading to the Panama Canal) and the ideological contributions of Social Darwinism and
      the Christian missionary movement, but with a focus on the issue in the question. Candidates’
      opinions or conclusions will be presented clearly and supported by appropriate evidence.


20.   Examine the impact of the First World War on the foreign policy of any two countries of the
      Americas.

      The question requires that candidates consider the interrelationship between the First World War
      and the foreign policy of any two countries in the Americas. Impacts may extend beyond the
      timeframe but they must be clearly linked to the issue raised in the question. Candidates may refer
      to the idealism of US President Wilson as expressed in his 14 Points and the growth of
      disillusionment and isolationism following the negotiation of the Treaty of Versailles and Canada’s
      significant military contributions that led to the Treaty of Westminster, formalizing control over their
      own foreign policy. Other relevant interrelationships may be considered, for example the decline of
      Mexico’s relations with the US due to the Zimmerman Note and Brazil’s gaining of a seat on the
      Council of the League of Nations due to their military and food contributions to the Allies, but with a
      focus on the issue in the question. Candidates’ opinions or conclusions will be presented clearly
      and supported by appropriate evidence.

Section 11: The Mexican Revolution (1884–1940)

21.   Discuss the aims and methods of either Madero or Carranza during the Mexican Revolution.

      The question requires that candidates offer a considered and balanced review of the role of either
      Madero or Carranza during the Mexican Revolution. Candidates may offer equal coverage of aims
      and methods, or they may prioritize their discussion of one. However, both aspects will be a
      feature of the response. For the case of Madero, candidates may refer to his initial aim of
      destroying Diaz’s regime, for which he organized the Anti-Reelectionist Party, and promoted armed
      insurrection. Furthermore, candidates may include a discussion of his concept of “liberal
      democracy” but argue that only limited political reform was enacted. Candidates may also describe
      Madero’s economic and social aims as moderate and refer to his limited reforms in education or
      his refusal to enact a land reform. For the case of Carranza, candidates may refer to his aims of
      political stabilization, but argue that he aimed at limited social reform. In terms of methods,
      candidates may refer to his fighting against the Villistas and Zapatistas; the constitutional reform;
      or his reluctance to effectuate provisions of the 1917 constitution. Candidates’ opinions or
      conclusions will be presented clearly and supported by appropriate evidence.


22.   Discuss the impact of the Mexican Revolution on women and education.

      The question requires that candidates offer a considered and balanced review of the impact of the
      Mexican Revolution on both women and education. Results may extend beyond the timeframe but
      they must be clearly linked to the issue raised in the question. Candidates may offer equal
      coverage of women and education or they may prioritize their discussion of one. However, both
      aspects will be a feature of the response. Candidates may discuss if women bore a significant role
      during the Revolution, as soldaderas. Candidates may also discuss if the Revolution provided
      women with greater political, economic and labour rights; or discuss whether gender roles were
      effectively transformed during the revolution. For the case of education, candidates may argue that
      the revolution expanded secular educational opportunities to the masses; but discuss if
      achievements were long-standing after the repel of socialist education during the 1940s.
      Candidates’ opinions or conclusions will be presented clearly and supported by appropriate
      evidence.

Section 12: The Great Depression and the Americas (mid 1920s–1939)

23.   “Critics of the New Deal had a significant impact on the policies of Franklin D Roosevelt.” Discuss.

      The question requires that candidates offer a considered and balanced review of the statement
      that critics of the New Deal had a significant impact on the policies of Franklin D Roosevelt.
      Candidates may offer equal coverage of evidence supporting the impact of critics and evidence
      suggesting their impact was limited, or they may prioritize their discussion of either. Candidates
      may refer to Father Coughlin’s support for an inflationary monetary policy that may have caused
      Roosevelt to abandon the gold standard; the creation of the Works Progress Administration to
      appease supporters of Huey Long; the proposal of the Social Security Act to address the popularity
      of Doctor Townsend’s criticisms; the introduction of the “court-packing scheme” as a response to
      rulings against the New Deal by the US Supreme Court. Other relevant factors may be addressed,
      for example Roosevelt’s imposition of higher income taxes in spite of opposition from the American
      Liberty League, but with a focus on the issue in the question. Candidates’ opinions or conclusions
      will be presented clearly and supported by appropriate evidence.


24.   “Latin American responses to the Great Depression had only limited success.” Discuss with
      reference to one Latin American country.

      The question requires that candidates offer a considered and balanced review of the statement
      that Latin American responses to the Great Depression had only limited success. Responses may
      extend beyond the timeframe but they must be clearly linked to the issue raised in the question.
      Candidates may refer to Brazil or Argentina’s relative success in adopting a more centralized
      economy which promoted national industries and reduced imports; Chile’s adoption of import
      substitution industrialization (ISI) policies that improved their balance of trade; the many countries
      that abandoned the gold standard in order to increase the money supply (though at the expense of
      the poor). Other relevant factors may be addressed, for example the difficulty of obtaining foreign
      capital for countries that defaulted on their foreign debt, such as Bolivia and Columbia, but with a
      focus on the issue in the question. Candidates’ opinions or conclusions will be presented clearly
      and supported by appropriate evidence.

Section 13: The Second World War and the Americas (1933–1945)

25.   To what extent did Franklin D Roosevelt’s Good Neighbor policy improve relations between the
      USA and Latin America?

      The question requires that candidates consider the merits or otherwise of the suggestion that
      Franklin D Roosevelt’s Good Neighbor policy improved relations between the USA and Latin
      America. Results may extend beyond the timeframe but they must be clearly linked to the issue
      raised in the question. Candidates may refer to inter-hemispheric conferences to evaluate if Pan-
      American relations showed improvement. For example, they may refer to Mexican and
      Argentinean refusal to sign agreements at Montevideo (1933), as evidence of failure in improving
      relations. Candidates could also analyse the state of US–Latin American relations through Latin
      American participation in trade agreements with the US. For example, candidates may argue the
      signing of 11 tariff reduction agreements by 1939 improved relations, but highlight that Argentina,
      Mexico and Chile’s refusal to participate limited progress. Other relevant factors may be
      addressed, for example the removal of the Platt amendment in 1934 or the withdrawal of
      occupation troops from Haiti, but with a focus on the issue in the question. Candidates’ opinions or
      conclusions will be presented clearly and supported by appropriate evidence.


26.   Examine the social impact of the Second World War on one country of the Americas up to 1945.

      The question requires that candidates consider the interrelationship between the Second World
      War and its social impact on one country of the Americas. Effects should be taken from the war
      period, as the question goes up to 1945. Candidates may refer to labour issues; changes to
      women’s status (work, family, suffrage); effects on minorities (African Americans, Native
      Americans, and French Canadians); the emergence of radicalism (Communism or right-wing
      movements) and the measures taken to control them; and/or internal migration and immigration.
      With respect to women, candidates may discuss the increase in employment opportunities,
      development of new skills and entrance into the armed forces that became available due to the war
      and which contributed to demands for equality. For minorities, candidates may discuss the
      discrimination faced by people of Japanese descent, but also the increased opportunities available
      to African Americans and Latinos. Candidates’ opinions or conclusions will be presented clearly
      and supported by appropriate evidence.
                                                    – 17 –               M22/3/HISTX/HP3/ENG/TZ0/AM/M


Section 14: Political developments in Latin America (1945–1980)

27.   “Castro’s suppression of opposition was the most important factor in his maintenance of power.” To
      what extent do you agree with this statement?

      The question requires that candidates consider the merits or otherwise of the statement that
      Castro’s suppression of opposition was the most important factor in his maintenance of power.
      Candidates may consider the merits of various strategies implemented by Castro to suppress
      opposition in his maintenance of power, including, but not restricted to early violence implemented
      against Batistianos, for example at La Cabaña; early elimination of internal opposition, for example
      Huber Matos’ imprisonment; and the creation of the G2, CDRs and UMAP camps for the
      surveillance and confinement of opposition. Candidates may also challenge the assumption
      proposed by the question in that opposition was not always suppressed but offered opportunities of
      exile, mainly in the period 1969–1990, also contributing to Castro’s maintenance of power. Other
      relevant factors that contributed to Castro’s maintenance of power may be addressed, for example
      the significance of indoctrination strategies and support rallied through significant social reforms
      and rhetoric attacking US imperialism , but with a focus on the issue in the question. Candidates’
      opinions or conclusions will be presented clearly and supported by appropriate evidence.


28.   “Political factors were the main reason for the failure of elected leaders.” Discuss.

      The question requires that candidates offer a considered and balanced review of the statement
      that political factors were the main reason for the failure of elected leaders in Latin America during
      1945–1980. Reasons for failure may predate the timeframe but they must be clearly linked to the
      issue raised in the question. To argue in favour of the statement, candidates may refer to the lack
      of democratic tradition in many countries of the region, in contrast to the strength and organized
      structure of the military. They may also refer to corruption and inefficiency of elected leaders as
      political factors leading to their failure. Indeed, candidates may suggest that the military usually
      justified intervention claiming to be preserving political stability, at a time of crisis. Other relevant
      factors that contributed to such crisis may be addressed, for example economic (failure to deal with
      economic modernization), social (inequality and lack of opportunity) and ideological factors
      (influence of the Cuban Revolution), but with a focus on the issue in the question. Candidates may
      also examine USA’s role in contributing to the failure of elected leaders. Candidates’ opinions or
      conclusions will be presented clearly and supported by appropriate evidence.

Section 15: Political developments in the United States (1945–1980) and Canada (1945–1982)

29.   “President Truman failed in his attempt to establish the Fair Deal.” To what extent do you agree
      with this statement?

      The question requires that candidates consider the merits or otherwise of the statement that
      President Truman failed in his attempt to establish the Fair Deal. Candidates may offer equal
      coverage of evidence supporting successful establishment of the Fair Deal and evidence indicating
      limited establishment, or they may prioritize their discussion of either position. However, both
      aspects will be a feature of the response. Candidates may refer to Truman’s success in the
      expansion of social security and the minimum wage, passage of the Public Housing and Slum
      Clearance Act and desegregation of the armed forces. Other relevant factors may be addressed,
      for example the failure to gain approval for national health insurance and civil rights legislation or
      obtain the repeal of the Taft-Hartley Act, but with a focus on the issue in the question. Candidates’
      opinions or conclusions will be presented clearly and supported by appropriate evidence.


30.   “The domestic policies of Pearson and Trudeau resulted in limited change.” Discuss.

      The question requires that candidates offer a considered and balanced review of the statement
      that the domestic policies of Pearson and Trudeau resulted in limited change. Results may extend
      beyond the timeframe but they must be clearly linked to the issue raised in the question.
      Candidates may offer equal coverage of Pearson and Trudeau, or they may prioritize their
      discussion of either leader. However, both aspects will be a feature of the response. Candidates
      may refer to Pearson’s implementation of the Canadian Pension Plan, the Universal Medicare
      System and a higher minimum wage. For Trudeau, the passage of the 1982 Canada Act and the
      adoption of the Charter of Rights and Freedoms which broadened civil rights’ protections may be
      addressed. Other factors may be addressed, for example the criticisms of both Pearson and
      Trudeau for failure to improve economic conditions in the Western provinces or Trudeau’s failure to
      control inflation, but with a focus on the issue in the question. Candidates’ opinions or conclusions
      will be presented clearly and supported by appropriate evidence.

Section 16: The Cold War and the Americas (1945–1981)

31.   “President Truman’s containment policy damaged relations between the United States and other
      countries in the region.” Discuss.

      The question requires that candidates offer a considered and balanced review of the statement
      that President Truman’s containment policy damaged relations between the United States and
      other countries in the region. Candidates may refer to Truman’s focus on the threat of communism
      in Europe and Asia (Truman Doctrine, Marshall Plan and Korean War), rather than the economic
      needs of Latin America and the creation of the School of the Americas (SOA) in the Panama Canal
      Zone to provide anti-communism counter-insurgency training (though often through repression and
      human rights violations which damaged relations with many Latin Americans). The creation of the
      Rio Pact and the Organization of American States as hemispheric defense organizations may be
      cited as examples of limited achievement. Other relevant factors may be addressed, for example
      the containment policies of post-Truman administrations, so long as the Truman era is initially
      and adequately developed. Candidates’ opinions or conclusions will be presented clearly and
      supported by appropriate evidence.


32.   “The Vietnam War ended as a result of the domestic effects that it caused in the United States.”
      Discuss.

      The question requires that candidates offer a considered and balanced review of the statement
      that the Vietnam War ended as a result of the domestic effects that it caused in the United States.
      Candidates may refer to the shock of the Tet Offensive in 1968 leading to credibility issues for the
      Johnson administration, implementation of the draft that greatly increased opposition to the war,
      revelations of atrocities such as the My Lai Massacre, Kent State and Jackson State shootings,
      growth of anti-war protests, substantial increase in US deaths (58 000 by the end of the war), and
      the revelations of the Pentagon Papers in 1971. Other relevant factors may be addressed, for
      example awareness of the corruption of the South Vietnamese government, but with a focus on the
      issue in the question. Candidates’ opinions or conclusions will be presented clearly and supported
      by appropriate evidence.

Section 17: Civil rights and social movements in the Americas post-1945

33.   To what extent was Dr Martin Luther King Jr successful in his attempts to achieve equality for
      African Americans?

      The question requires that candidates consider the merits or otherwise of the suggestion that Dr
      Martin Luther King Jr was successful in his attempts to achieve equality for African Americans.
      Candidates may offer equal coverage of evidence supporting Dr King’s successes and failures, or
      they may prioritize their assessment of either. However, both aspects will be a feature of the
      response. Candidates may refer to examples of success as evidenced by the Montgomery bus
      boycott, the appeal to moderates through non-violent protests, increase in national awareness
      through the 1963 March on Washington and Dr King’s role in achieving passage of the Civil Rights
      Act of 1964 and Voting Rights Act of 1965. Other relevant factors may be addressed, for example
      the failure to improve socio-economic conditions (Chicago Movement) or to effectively challenge
      patterns of de-facto segregation, but with a focus on the issue in the question. Candidates’
      opinions or conclusions will be presented clearly and supported by appropriate evidence.


34.   Evaluate the effects of US immigration reform on people of Hispanic descent after 1945.

      The question requires that candidates make an appraisal of the effects of US immigration reform
      on people of Hispanic descent after 1945. Effects may extend beyond the timeframe but they must
      be clearly linked to the issue raised in the question. Candidates may refer to President
      Eisenhower’s “Operation Wetback” targeting barrios for expulsion in the southwest, the expiration
      of the guest worker program in 1964 (leading to increases in illegal immigration), passage of the
      1965 Immigration and Naturalization Act which favoured family reunification and was generally
      favoured by Hispanics, the 1966 decision to grant permanent resident status to Cubans arriving
      after 1959 and President Clinton’s “Operation Gatekeeper” (1994) increasing border security to
      reduce entry from Mexico. Other relevant factors may be addressed, for example application of the
      “wet-foot, dry-foot” policy toward Cuban migrants, but with a focus on the issue in the question.
      Candidates’ opinions or conclusions will be presented clearly and supported by appropriate
      evidence.

Section 18: The Americas (1980–2005)

35.   Evaluate the effects of Reagan’s domestic policies on the United States.

      The question requires that candidates make an appraisal of the effects of Reagan’s domestic
      policies on the United States. Candidates may offer equal coverage of positive and negative
      effects, or they may prioritize their evaluation of one. However, both aspects will be a feature of the
      response. Candidates may refer to Reagan’s supply-side economics, which reduced taxes and
      regulation, and evaluate its impact upon macroeconomics or upon individuals' lives. Socially,
      candidates can evaluate the impact of the appointment of conservative judges to the Supreme
      Court, arguing that this scaled back affirmative action and limited Roe v Wade. They may also
      examine the social impact of reducing spending on social services. Politically, candidates may
      argue that Reagan revitalized the presidency after Watergate and the tensions of the Ford and
      Carter years. Candidates’ opinions or conclusions will be presented clearly and supported by
      appropriate evidence.


36.   “Latin American countries shared similar challenges after their transition to democracy.” Discuss
      with reference to two countries.

      The question requires that candidates offer a considered and balanced review of the statement
      that Latin American countries shared similar challenges after their transition to democracy.
      Candidates may offer equal coverage of similarities and differences, or they may prioritize their
      discussion of one. However, both aspects will be a feature of the response. Candidates may refer
      to a variety of challenges, shared by most Latin American countries after transitioning to
      democracy, including: the problem of how to deal with the political influence of the military; the
      social and economic legacy of the outgoing regime (including debt); or the issue of confronting past
      human rights violations and promoting justice. Candidates can also refer to specific national
      challenges to be faced, including the social, economic and diplomatic impact of war, for the case of
      Argentina; the issue of incorporating minorities into the political process, for the case of Bolivia; or
      discussions over the role of the Church in politics, for the case of Chile. Candidates’ opinions or
      conclusions will be presented clearly and supported by appropriate evidence.
