John did not stop at this time from harassing his brother, and was a firm supporter of the king of France
in all things. For while the king of France was devastating the Norman territory, John was disturbing
the provinces of England with troops of criminals. But the nobles of the kingdom, firm in faith, and
unbroken in spirit, gathered an impressive body of soldiers. They opposed the lawless attempts of this
mad-headed youth [John]. Besieging the castle of Windsor, which had fallen under John’s power, they
compelled it to surrender. But when John saw his supporters, whom he could not assist, exposed to the
dangers of a siege, he requested a treaty for their safety, and gave up the castle.

Prescribed subject 2: Conquest and its impact

Read sources E to H and answer questions 5 to 8. The sources and questions relate to case study 1:
The final stages of Muslim rule in Spain — Context and motives: Political context in Iberia and
Al‑Andalus in the late 15th century; internal conflicts and alliances in Granada in the late 15th century.

Source E                 Max von Habsburg, an historian, writing in the school textbook Spain in the Age
                         of Discovery, 1469–1598 (2015).

The Iberian Peninsula lacked both political unity and a uniform system of government and there was
not even a willingness, let alone any attempt, to centralize the governmental systems. In fact, “Spain”
was no more than a geographical expression and the term was not used at the time. Setting aside
Portugal, which remained a separate kingdom, the provinces of Castile and Aragon were dominant in
political and economic terms and were also recognized as independent kingdoms. They contained over
75 % of the Iberian Peninsula’s population. The Castilian monarchy held greater political power than its
counterpart in Aragon. Yet in the second half of the 15th century, both provinces were weakened by civil
wars. Motivated by a disputed succession [to the thrones], powerful nobles challenged the authority of
Henry IV of Castile and John II of Aragon respectively … The marriage of Ferdinand and Isabella did not
result in an immediate end to civil war and rivalries between the nobles, leaving the Iberian Peninsula
very unstable. The power of the nobles was so strong that they tried to fill the vacuum created by political
problems and to control decisions made by the king. The nobility were powerful but remained divided.

It’s God’s hand that will give you victory because the Moors are so confident and arrogant about their
past that they will risk everything. Please remember, my King, that this is a holy and necessary war. The
enemies of our holy faith may be weakened and the land that they have seized may be taken. Where
God is now currently condemned, blasphemed and despised; he may once again be praised, adored,
and loved. Bear this in mind and keep on fighting as our former glorious kings did in long sieges and
terrible battles. But do not believe, my Lord, that these battles can wait much longer. The Moors can
survive on little bread, and find ways to grow some crops. [Furthermore] you cannot fully control the seas
and it could very well be that Moors from across the sea, feeling for the suffering of their fellow believers
in the peninsula, will come to their aid. You must be wise and prepared as a good knight would be.

                       United States and Japan.” (Known as “The Hull Note”.)

The Government of the United States and the Government of Japan will endeavor [try] to conclude a
multilateral non-aggression pact among the British Empire, China, Japan, the Netherlands, the Soviet
Union, Thailand, and the United States.

Both Governments will endeavor to conclude among American, British, Chinese, Japanese, the
Netherlands and Thai Governments an agreement in which each of the Governments would pledge itself
to respect the territory of French Indochina.

The Government of Japan will withdraw all military, naval, air and police forces from China and from
Indochina.

The Government of the United States and the Government of Japan will not support militarily, politically,
or economically any Government or regime in China other than the national Government of the Republic
of China.

                        the Pacific: From Pearl Harbor to Tokyo Bay (1995).

The [Japanese] army representatives were unanimous [united] in demanding war with the United States.
[General] Tojo [the Japanese Prime Minister] understood that Japan’s … [limited] oil supply, combined
with the notorious bad weather, would make the Pearl Harbor attack almost impossible if postponed past
the target date of …( 7 December Hawaii time) …

While high-level Japanese officials had been confronting the hard choices of peace or war and their
armed forces were preparing for conflict, … [the Americans] seemed ... [completely] unaware of the
potential consequences of President Roosevelt’s embargo … Again and again [US Secretary of State]
Hull … insisted upon a complete Japanese withdrawal from both China and Indochina. Perhaps the
[earlier] proposed meeting between … [the US and Japan would have settled nothing, as Hull claimed.
But America refused even to negotiate].

As early as his first meeting with … [the Japanese Ambassador] on 8 March, Hull was … [concerned]
that his policy might lead to war with the Japanese. Later it was obvious … that only a Japanese
withdrawal from China would have … [prevented] war.

Perhaps it is too much to say, in retrospect, that anyone in the US government wanted war with Japan,
but obviously little was done to … [prevent] it. At the same time that the hard-line diplomatic policy was
being pursued, there was … [a lack of action] at all levels in Washington and Honolulu.


Source L                David J Lu, a professor of Japanese history, writing in the academic book From
                        the Marco Polo Bridge to Pearl Harbor: Japan’s Entry into World War II (1961).

General Tojo later explained that the decision to attack was adopted in view of the tense international
situation due to the economic sanctions imposed by the United States, Britain and the Netherlands.
American and British preparations for war, difficulties in the negotiations with the United States, and no
clear means of settling the China Incident also contributed. It was therefore necessary to prepare for
war and yet continue the diplomatic conversations. The deadline for the negotiations was set because
November would be the best month for landing operations. December would be possible but difficult,
January would be impossible because of the northeast monsoons. Japan wanted the United States
to express its views regarding three major points of difference between the two governments: (1) the
withdrawal of troops from China, (2) Japan’s commitments under the Tripartite Pact, and (3) equal
access to international trade. Japan avoided specific commitments on all major issues, and so did the
United States. In Japanese eyes, the United States Government was not willing to give the specific
answers that Japan was looking for. Thus, negotiations were getting nowhere.

Apartheid South Africa (1948–1964) — The role and significance of key actors/groups: Key individuals:
Nelson Mandela.

Source M               Tom Lodge, a professor of history, writing in the academic book Mandela: A
                       Critical Life (2006).

Even though several African National Congress (ANC) leaders, including Nelson Mandela, had at
least thought about the possibility of an armed offensive against apartheid for several years, they still
encountered considerable opposition to their proposal. At the end of June 1961, Mandela argued his
case at a meeting of the ANC’s National Working Committee … Albert Luthuli was reluctantly persuaded
[by Mandela] to approve the establishment of a new military organisation called the MK (Umkhonto we
Sizwe – “Spear of the Nation”) that would function separately from the ANC, although ultimately it would
be subject to the ANC’s authority … Mandela suggested the name for the new organisation: “we must
have an African name” he said … It was agreed that Mandela would form the MK and appoint his own
staff. For the time being, it was decided, the MK would engage only in very carefully controlled sabotage
operations designed to avoid any casualties … Mandela was not a direct participant in any of the
sabotage … [The ANC decided] to send Mandela abroad to persuade African governments to help with
weapons and training facilities that the MK would need.

                         (2012).

Mandela’s defence lawyer announced: “The defence case will commence with a statement by Nelson
Mandela who personally took part in the establishment of the MK, and who will be able to inform the
court of the beginnings of that organisation.” … A few minutes after beginning his speech, Mandela made
an admission [to the court] sufficient to condemn him to death: “Some of the things so far told to the court
are true and some are untrue. I do not, however, deny that I planned sabotage”. However, he argued,
planning for it was “a result of calm and sober assessment of the political situation that had arisen after
many years of tyranny, exploitation, and oppression of my people by the Whites” … [Mandela stated
that] from its formation in 1912, the ANC had wanted political relief from the oppression of black people
in South Africa until 1961. The government rejected all of its attempts … “It was only when all else had
failed, when all channels of peaceful protest had been barred [blocked] to us, that the decision was
made to embark on violent forms of political struggle, and to form the MK.”

Prescribed subject 5: Conflict and intervention

Read sources Q to T and answer questions 17 to 20. The sources and questions relate to case study 2:
Kosovo (1989–2002) — Causes of the conflict: Role and significance of Slobodan Milosevic and
Ibrahim Rugova.

Source Q                Ibrahim Rugova, President of Kosovo from March 2002 until his death in 2006,
                        testifying before the United Nations International Criminal Tribunal for the Former
                        Yugoslavia (ICTY) (3 May 2002).

The first objective of this party [Democratic League of Kosovo (LDK)] was to establish democracy in
Kosovo, to start a democratic life for all its citizens. It aimed to give Kosovo a republic status equal to the
other republics in the former Federation, because, as I said, Kosovo had been stripped of its autonomy.
Then [after the 1991 referendum] we were striving to build an independent Kosovo — with rights for all
its citizens. This was the main and initial goal, but the main thing was to defend the Kosovar people who
were endangered at that time …

Our position was that independence should be achieved by peaceful, diplomatic, and democratic
methods and violence should not be used …

The LDK started organizing solidarity actions to help people who were left without jobs, people who were
dismissed from their jobs. It also organized society at large, keeping education and health and other
areas of life going, such as culture and sport. And at that time, we also started collecting a tax, not a
compulsory tax, but what we called a “solidarity tax”. It mainly concentrated on helping people with food,
clothing and things that they needed, because people who had worked for years were now homeless

Rugova possessed an iron [strong] determination to resist Serbian oppression. His choice of nonviolent
tactics came from a desire to avoid the bloodshed that would accompany any effort to oppose the Serbs
through violent means. Rugova himself described his approach as “a war without arms [weapons].” …

[However] Rugova’s mistake was in believing in the international community too much and especially
the United States—which had a special relationship with Kosovo because of its early support for
human rights in the province … Rugova and his Kosovo Albanian supporters experienced delay and
disappointment. Once war broke out in the rest of Yugoslavia, Kosovo virtually disappeared from the
media and the focus of international peace negotiators. Only when Kosovo Albanians had finally decided
“enough is enough” and begun to shoot back at their Serb oppressors, did the international community
refocus on Kosovo. By then it was too late for a peaceful solution.

                       Kosovo: Coercive Diplomacy and U.S. Intervention (2012).

Plans to set up a U.S. Information Center in Pristina were announced on January 9, 1996 … “This
is a historic day for Kosovo,” said Ibrahim Rugova. “We are for a peaceful solution to the Kosovo
problem based on the political will of its people …” Rugova maintained that this was a major diplomatic
success for the Democratic League of Kosovo (LDK) in internationalizing the Kosovo issue and
gaining recognition … The establishment of the U.S. Information Center was a clear result of the LDK’s
internationalization strategy. However, it did not silence Rugova’s critics. The head of the Kosovo
Students Union stated, “We thought that the LDK was too passive. It relied too much on international
factors. Rugova created the illusion that the international community would resolve the crisis and that
independence would come as a gift.” Kosovo Albanians were losing faith in the international community.
An increasing number became radicalized as social and economic conditions deteriorated and human
rights conditions worsened. It became less likely that their political objectives would be achieved by
peaceful means.
