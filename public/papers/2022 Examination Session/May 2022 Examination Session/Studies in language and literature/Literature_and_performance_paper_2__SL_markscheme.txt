                                        Assessment criteria

These notes to examiners are intended only as guidelines to assist marking and as a supplement
to the published external assessment criteria for written paper 2. They are not offered as an
exhaustive and fixed set of responses or approaches to which all answers must rigidly adhere.
Good ideas or angles not offered here should be acknowledged and rewarded as appropriate.
Similarly, answers which do not include all the ideas or approaches suggested here should not be
so heavily penalized as to distort appreciation of individuality.

With reference to criterion C, the better answers will contain examples that show an adequate
sense of stylistic features with some awareness of their effects, using critical analysis and pertinent
detail.

The best answers will show a strong sense of the stylistic and comparable features of the works,
as well as the effects of these features.

Of course, some of the points listed below will appear in weaker papers but are unlikely to
be developed.

These apply to all answers below.

A maximum of [5 marks] may be awarded for each of the five criteria.

Criteria A and B

The danger of rewarding or penalizing the use of illustration/references/quotations twice in both
these categories should be avoided.

Criterion B

“Personal response” and “independence of thought” appear as the levels of the descriptors
increase. What is sought is an engaged and individual treatment of the chosen topic. Engaged and
individual essays will usually make themselves clear by showing insight into the implications of the
question and the quality and interest of the details cited in support.

The first-person singular does not automatically constitute a personal response and conversely an
impersonal academic style does not necessarily indicate a lack of personal response.

Criterion C

It is expected that every question set will provide candidates with ample opportunities to
demonstrate their awareness of the demands of this criterion. However, where a question does not
explicitly offer such opportunities, examiners should interpret criterion C broadly, to ensure that
candidates are not unfairly disadvantaged. In such cases it would be sufficient for candidates
to show, as appropriate to the question, an awareness of how elements such as plot, character,
setting, structure, voice, etc, are used by writers to meet their purposes. No matter how the
question is phrased, candidates must also address related matters of style and technique.

“Awareness” and “appreciation” of literary features are the key elements under this criterion.
The mere labelling, without appreciation, of literary features will not score the highest marks.
On the other hand, the candidate who is attentive to literary features and deals with them in a
meaningful way, but who does not consistently use the vocabulary of literary criticism, can still be
awarded the higher achievement levels.

Reminder: the term “literary features” is broad and includes elements as basic as plot, character
etc, attention to which is valid and must be rewarded as appropriate.
                                                  –4–              M22/1/TEXTP/SP2/ENG/TZ0/XX/M


Criterion D

Any form of structuring to the essay will be rewarded if it is effective and appropriate.
Different conventions are in operation and therefore all approaches are acceptable and will be
judged on the basis of their effectiveness. Examiners should remember that structure does not
exist by itself, but any structure must be measured by appropriate reference to the terms of the
question and by its capacity to integrate these towards the development of an organized and
coherent essay.

Reminder: in this criterion, supporting examples must be evaluated in terms of how fluently they
are incorporated/integrated to shape/advance the argument, not in terms of their appropriateness
or accuracy.

Criterion E

If you have reservations about awarding a 4, you should ensure that these are well founded before
awarding a 3. The broadness of achievement in level three sometimes makes examiners reluctant
to award 4.

Judgment needs to be used when dealing with lapses in grammar, spelling and punctuation;
therefore, do not unduly penalize.

Mechanical accuracy is only part of this criterion. Ensure that all the other elements are
considered.

Examiners should be careful to avoid being prejudiced in their application of this criterion by
achievement levels in other criteria. It is possible to score highly on this criterion even if candidates
have scored in the lower levels on other criteria, and vice versa.

1.   An adequate to good answer will:
     • identify and define the values and attitudes presented in each poet’s work
     • attempt to keep the values and attitudes as the focus of consideration for each poet’s
       work
     • demonstrate sound knowledge and understanding of the selected texts through the lens of
       the focus of the question
     • provide plausible and relevant ideas that are mostly grounded in the texts
     • ensure the literary features of each poet’s work are identified (such as imagery, point of
       view and the like), some plausible interpretation is provided and some comparative
       analysis of how those features are used to present distinct values and attitudes
     • provide structure and some coherency for the ideas presented with some evidence of
       successful integration of supporting examples
     • use language that is clear and coherent with only a few lapses in grammar, spelling and
       sentence structure. Some relevant literary terminology will be used with a register that is
       mostly appropriate.

        respective use, with purpose and clarity
     • maintain values and attitudes as the central focus of consideration for both poets’ work
     • demonstrate strong knowledge and a perceptive understanding of the selected texts
        through the lens of the focus of the question
     • systematically ground the analysis in the chosen texts while integrating evidence
        seamlessly into the body of the response
     • present perceptive and insightful ideas that are well substantiated with some possible
        evidence of independent and creative thought beyond the mechanics, such as the role of
        the persona or speaker
     • produce a pointed comparative literary analysis that considers effect, specifically to reflect
        the poet’s commentary on the values and attitudes
     • provide a coherent structure for the response
     • use clear, varied and precise language with very minor to no lapses in grammar, spelling
        and sentence structure. Literary terminology will be used correctly and effectively
        throughout with an appropriate register.

2.   An adequate to good answer will:
     • identify how sound and rhythm is created in each poet’s work, and make a sound attempt
       to define the effect produced as a result
     • attempt to keep sound and rhythm as the focus of consideration for both poets’ work
     • demonstrate sound knowledge and understanding of the selected texts through the lens of
       the focus of the question
     • provide plausible and relevant ideas that are mostly grounded in the texts
     • ensure the literary features of each poet’s work are identified, some plausible
       interpretation is provided and some comparative analysis of how those features are used
       to present the ideas of the poets through the select stylistic and literary features, such as
       rhymes, repetition, alliteration, assonance, cadence and onomatopoeia
     • provide structure and some coherency for the ideas presented with some evidence of
       successful integration of supporting examples
     • use language that is clear and coherent with only a few lapses in grammar, spelling and
       sentence structure. Some relevant literary terminology will be used with a register that is
       mostly appropriate.

        through the lens of the focus of the question
     • systematically ground the analysis in the chosen texts while integrating evidence
        seamlessly into the body of the response
