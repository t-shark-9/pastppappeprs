Microeconomics

1.   (a)    Explain the relationship between the law of diminishing returns and a firm’s short-run
            cost curves.                                                                               [10]

            Answers may include:
             definitions of the law of diminishing returns, short run, costs of production, cost curves
             diagrams to show the effect of decreasing and then increasing marginal cost on the
              average total cost and on the average variable cost; marginal product increasing (total
              product rising at increasing rate) then decreasing (total product rising at decreasing rate)
             explanation of the relationship between (diminishing) marginal product, (increasing)
              marginal cost, average variable costs and average total costs
             examples of diminishing returns and their effect on short-run costs.

     (b)    Evaluate the view that monopoly is an undesirable market structure as it fails to
            achieve productive and allocative efficiency.                                         [15]

            Answers may include:
             definitions of monopoly, productive efficiency, allocative efficiency
             diagrams to show productive and allocative inefficiency under profit-maximizing monopoly
              firm, economies of scale leading to lower prices and higher output
             explanation of why the profit maximizing choices of a monopoly firm lead to productive
              and allocative inefficiency
             examples of inefficiencies in monopoly markets in practice
             synthesis or evaluation (evaluate).

            Evaluation may include: reasons why monopoly might be desirable (eg possibilities of
            economies of scale and the case of natural monopoly, the need to innovate to maintain
            economic profit, ability to finance research and development). Other reasons why monopoly
            may be undesirable (eg low quality of the products and services, x-inefficiency).

            Examiners should be aware that candidates may take a different approach which,
            if appropriate, should be rewarded.

             diagram to show differing price elasticities of demand along a straight-line demand curve
             explanation why the price elasticity of demand varies along the length of the demand
              curve, using the diagram, the elasticity formula and an economic rationale (eg when the
              price is higher the proportion of income spent on the good is higher)

(b)   Examine the significance of price elasticity of demand for the decision-making of firms
      and governments.                                                                           [15]

      Answers may include:
       definition of price elasticity of demand (PED)
       diagrams to show the relationship between PED, price changes and the total revenue of
        firms; the relationships between PED, the size of an indirect tax, tax incidence, quantity
        produced/consumed and government tax revenue
       explanations of the relationship between: PED, price changes and total revenue of firms;
        how PED affects government tax revenue, production/consumption and tax incidence
       examples of PED proving significant for firms and governments in practice
       synthesis and evaluation (examine).

      Examination may include: the differing incidence of indirect tax on consumers and firms due
      to differing price elasticities, the impact of PED on the uses of tax/subsidy to address market
      failure, the impact of time on PED (and total revenue) when price changes, the difficulty of
      estimating PED values for firms, other factors affecting demand that cause a change in total
      revenue/tax revenue.

      Award a maximum of level 2 if the response considers either the significance of PED for
      firms or for governments (but not both).

      Examiners should be aware that candidates may take a different approach which,
      if appropriate, should be rewarded.

      NB It should be noted that definitions, theory, and examples that have already
      been given in part (a), and then referred to in part (b) should be rewarded.

(b)   Using the monetarist/new classical model and the Keynesian model, discuss the view
      that increases in aggregate demand will inevitably be inflationary.                          [15]

      Answers may include:
       definitions of inflation, inflationary, aggregate demand (AD), monetarist/new classical
        model, Keynesian model
       diagrams to show the impact of an increase in AD in the two different models
       explanation why in the monetarist/new classical model an increase in AD
        will be inflationary
       examples of cases where an increase in AD either has or has not been inflationary
       synthesis and evaluation (discuss).

      Discussion may include: consideration of an increase in AD not being inflationary in the
      Keynesian model if the economy is operating with spare capacity, consideration of an
      increase in AD not being inflationary in the monetarist/new classical model if the economy is
      recovering from equilibrium below the full employment level of output, consideration of the
      impact of simultaneous improvements on the supply side of the economy as AD increases, a
      consideration of the word “inevitably”, a consideration of the word “inflationary” in the context
      of the AD/AS model.

      Award a maximum of level 2 if the response considers either the monetarist/new classical
      model or the Keynesian model (but not both).

      Opinions or conclusions should be presented clearly and should be supported by
      appropriate examples.

      Examiners should be aware that candidates may take a different approach which,
      if appropriate, should be rewarded.

4.   (a)    Explain how government spending might promote greater equity in an economy.            [10]

            Answers may include:
             definitions of government spending, equity
             Lorenz curve diagram showing a Lorenz curve shifting closer to the line of perfect income
              equality because of government spending to promote equity (or a subsidy diagram or an
              AD/AS diagram showing increasing AD and real GDP and therefore implying increased
              employment)
             explanation of the linkages between government spending (eg on merit and public goods,
              transfer payments and subsidies), taxation and equity
             examples of actual government spending measures (eg healthcare services, education,
              sanitation, water supplies, public parks, public transportation, old age pensions,
              unemployment benefits, child allowances) that have promoted equity.

(b)   Evaluate the view that government policies to promote greater equity will always
      have a negative effect on efficiency.                                                      [15]

      Answers may include:
       definitions of efficiency, equity
       an AD/AS diagram to show LRAS shifting to the left (less efficiency) or to the right (greater
        efficiency), an externalities diagram to show government policies improving allocative
        efficiency, a supply and demand diagram to show welfare loss due to government policies
        to promote equity
       explanation of how government spending and taxation might adversely impact efficiency
        (eg through the disincentive effects of progressive taxation, transfer payments, subsidized
        goods and services, through the decrease in social surplus due to taxes and price
        ceilings)
       examples of government policies having either a negative or positive impact on efficiency
       synthesis and evaluation (evaluate).

      Evaluation may include: consideration of the hypothetical trade-off between equity and
      efficiency, consideration of how government spending on socially desirable goods and
      services (eg health care services, education, sanitation, clean water supplies) might
      positively impact efficiency in the utilization of the economy’s resources in the long run (eg
      through poverty reduction and human capital formation) and in the short run (eg through the
      positive impact of government spending on AD), consideration of how automatic stabilizers
      might improve efficiency in the utilization of the economy’s resources in the short run (eg
      through the positive impact on AD during recessions), consideration of how certain kinds of
      government spending and taxation may increase allocative efficiency (eg through the
      increased consumption of merit goods and decreased consumption of demerit goods),
      government provision of merit goods may be less efficient than private provision,
      consideration of the word “always”, consideration of the meaning of the word “equity” (eg the
      difference between equity in the distribution of income and equality in the distribution of
      income, equity as equality of opportunity), consideration of the meaning of the word
      “efficiency” (eg productive and allocative efficiency in microeconomics, efficiency in the
      utilization of the economy’s factors of production in macroeconomics).
