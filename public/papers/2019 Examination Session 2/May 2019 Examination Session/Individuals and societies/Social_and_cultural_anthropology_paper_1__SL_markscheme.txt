Paper 1: Engaging with anthropology

1.   Define the term self and describe how it is understood in the context of the young people in
     California described in the text.                                                                     [4]

     This question requires candidates to demonstrate conceptual knowledge and understanding of
     the term self, and apply it in relation to the text. Stronger responses may also develop a detailed
     explanation of the concept.

     Candidates will be expected to provide any conceptualization along the lines of self as the
     culturally constructed concept of the individual human being, the view of an individual in the eyes
     of the social group, the construction of the self as the product of social interaction.

     There are many possible ways of demonstrating conceptual knowledge. For example, candidates
     may define the concept of self as a relational category how the self is defined in relation to the
     notion of other. Candidates may explain how human beings are likely to develop an understanding
     of themselves as physically distinct and separable from others; they can discuss the relationship
     between the body and the self; or, that the self can be constructed or conceptually represented in
     multiple ways.

     They may support their definition from a Durkheimian approach, understanding the category of the
     self as primarily the product of constraining social factors. Some candidates may also draw from
     Mauss’ explanation of the “person” or “self” as a historically developed and contingent concept.
     Others may choose to define this term drawing from symbolic interactionist approaches, such as
     Mead or Goffman. Also, some candidates may choose to define self by drawing from post-
     structuralist theory, such as Foucault, linked to subjectivity and power relations.

     Candidates are expected to apply this concept in relation to the provided ethnographic data in
     order to show how the concept of self derives from one’s relations with other people and social
     institutions. Candidates may demonstrate their understanding of the importance of others in
     constructing reality and regulating behaviour. These others become an integral part of the context
     to which the self is connected, and the way in which the self is constructed depends crucially on
     the nature of this context. Others thus participate actively and continuously in the definition of the
     self, as is evident in the passage.

     Drawing from this particular ethnographic case, candidates might show how the concept of self can
     be applied in this context. For example, candidates may discuss how the individuals’ subjectivities
     are shaped by the moral expectations associated with bodily appearance. In the text, individuals
     are seen to internalize social expectations and standards, and to judge themselves accordingly.
     They develop negative feelings and view themselves as failures. The text also hints at a hierarchy
     of moral referents. That is, subjects are influenced more by certain people, in particular those that
     are associated with the medical establishment, and especially by peers who are perceived as
     examples of successful achievement of body standard goals (such as John’s athletic dormmates,
     or Margaret’s brother and her female friends). Candidates may also develop discussions related to
     the specific age-range of the subjects, who are seen in a transitioning moment in their lives
     (passage into adolescence and youth) in which their successful integration into their status
     appears to depend on sexual attractiveness in order to gain social acceptance. Candidates may
     move further into more general explanations about how self is defined or influenced by broader
     societal expectations, or that judging or classifying individuals according to body characteristics
     (e.g. ethnicity/race, clothing) is a frequently recognized trait in the United States. For the highest
     marks, candidates would explain the concept of self in detail, for instance, by discussing how the
     concept is treated differently by different authors, or maybe referencing Western ethnocentric
     assumptions implicit in the concept as treated by certain authors.

2.   Explain how the key concept of social relations helps you understand the ethnographic
     data presented in the passage.                                                                       [6]

     The question requires candidates to develop an analysis and explanation of this ethnographic text
     using the key concept of social relations to help make sense of the ethnographic data. In order to
     do this, candidates are required to demonstrate an understanding of the key concept and use it to
     illuminate certain issues within the context, supporting arguments by making reference to the
     ethnographic data of the extract.

     Understanding social relations as any relationship between two or more individuals in a network of
     relationships, this key concept involves an element of individual agency as well as group
     expectations and forms the basis of social organization and social structure, pervading every
     aspect of human life. Based on this understanding, candidates may explain the young Californian
     students’ experiences and conceptualizations of their bodily perceptions through their accounts,
     and how these are part of encompassing social relationships and recognize that their behaviour is
     determined, contingent on, and, to a large extent, organized by what these actors perceive to be
     the thoughts, feelings, and actions of others.

     In the text, the informants mention specific people that influence their views of themselves, and we
     see that these are all close relationships (parents, siblings, close friends, dormmates). Thus, the
     key concept of social relations is dominant in informants’ narratives. In addition, some candidates
     may distinguish that these social relations, the relative social distance and intensity of affection has
     a different impact on the subject. Specifically, subjects are more impacted by persons with whom
     they have a closer relation. For instance, the medical discourse is embodied by the doctor, and
     John’s mother internalizes this authoritative discourse, thus changing her views and behaviour
     towards her son. John feels sad due to his mother’s change towards him and her new constant
     demands placed upon him.

     The text also exemplifies that subjects name specific individuals who influence them, and there is
     only one allusion to the “nation” as a generic structure which has potential influence on the subject.
     Again, this implies that from the perspective of the subjects, social relations are more relevant than
     social structures in their self-perception. Thus, candidates may notice that informants are not
     aware of the structural constraints and pervasive discourses addressed by the researcher’s
     (Greenhalgh) theoretical claims.

     Candidates may also explain how agents in social relations convey moral and aesthetic discourses
     and use them to classify and qualify one another. From the last paragraph of the text, it can be
     inferred that according to the author these discourses normalize prejudice and constitute a socially
     legitimized basis on which to pursue continuing forms of discrimination and inequality. While
     certain prejudices are no longer discursively sustainable in the context of the society studied, the
     “fat discourse” is acceptable and hegemonic.

     Other candidates may focus on how power is embedded in social relations. For instance, sexual
     attractiveness is viewed as a source of influence on other people, and thus individuals with certain
     body types are more able to exert this type of power. More generally, with reference to the context
     of this passage, candidates may discuss the extent to which markers of identity constrain or enable
     agency, drawing on the debate between agency and structure in terms of explanations of social
     and cultural life.

        There is an attempt to relate the key concept to the text, and some ethnographic
        examples are presented but these are only partially relevant.

        There is an analysis of the text using the key concept, although there are some
3–4     inconsistencies.

        Relevant ethnographic examples from the text are presented to support the analysis.
        The response demonstrates a clear understanding of the key concept, discussing this in
        the context of the text.

5–6     There is a clearly explained analysis of the text using the key concept and a detailed
        interpretation of the ethnographic data.

        Clear and explicit ethnographic examples from the text support the analysis.

3.    Compare and contrast the way in which the concept of power or belief and knowledge is
      evident in this passage with how it is evident in one other ethnographic example you have
      studied.

      The target societies for this comparative question are varied and many. Candidates are expected
      to show an ability to think about the text in relation to other contexts and draw explicit comparisons.
      In order to do this, responses must demonstrate an understanding of how either the key concept of
      power or belief and knowledge relates to this ethnographic context. They should be able to
      establish a relevant comparison with any other group or society based on any of these concepts.
      The response should be structured as a comparison and contrast, highlighting similarities and
      differences.

      This passage focuses on how social structures create subjectivity. More specifically, it examines
      suffering and other harming effects on subjectivity in relation to cultural discourses and social
      relations and how a group of people narrate their past experiences on these. Candidates are
      expected to show an ability to think about the text in relation to other contexts and to draw explicit
      comparisons and contrasts. Either of the two key concepts chosen on which such comparison may
      be drawn should be made explicit and clearly linked to any anthropological issues raised by the
      text. Candidates must situate the comparative case in terms of place, author and historical context.

      Additional guidance:
      The question is broad and allows for a wide array of responses. Some candidates may choose to
      use belief and knowledge to explain this ethnographic account. This key concept – a set of
      convictions, values and viewpoints regarded as “the truth” and shared by members of a social
      group, underpinned and supported by known cultural experience – may be addressed from
      different approaches. Terms such as discourse, ideology, hegemony, resistance, socialization,
      morality, classification, consensus, social control, medicalization may come into play. Candidates
      can explain how the young students in California internalize their subordinated position by
      reference to cultural understandings and beliefs and establish relevant comparisons based on
      other groups and their cultural knowledges and beliefs.
                                                 –7–                M19/3/SOCAN/SP1/ENG/TZ0/XX/M



     Candidates may recognize the complex interplay between social institutions and individual agency
     in the production of knowledge and belief. Students may refer to the power of the biomedical
     discourse – as a knowledge/power dyad – to dominate perceptions and understandings of health
     and the body and its centrality on how people experience and make sense of their worlds.
     Alternatively, candidates may discuss issues of morals, classifications, systems of value, and
     meanings.

     Those candidates who choose to support their answers by analyzing the ethnographic data
     through the lens of the key concept power, will likely consider the suffering and discrimination of
     these young Californian students from the understanding of power as an essential feature of social
     relations and may analyze the association between power, authority and legitimacy. Similarly,
     candidates may stress the authority position of certain actors to pronounce legitimate discourses.

     Candidates may work with diverse concepts from multiple analytical approaches, such as social
     control, structural power, hegemony, discourse, discipline, biopolitics, violence, habitus,
     embodiment, inequality to explain the ethnographic data of the passage and relate it to other
     contexts. Responses may focus on how power is expressed practically and symbolically in ideas,
     values, emotions and actions of individuals and groups. In this passage, the interweaving of
     morality, power, knowledge and social positions make for complex and diverse levels of analysis.

     Some responses may compare this ethnographic passage to other ethnographic accounts based
     on group or personal experiences of suffering and pain, or the subaltern condition, or may focus
     their comparison and contrast on the body. Other topics for comparison and contrast are also
     possible.

4.   Compare and contrast the approaches to research adopted by the anthropologist in this
     passage to the approaches to research used by another anthropologist you have studied.
     Make reference to concepts and ethnographic material in your answer.                           [10]

     While in the previous question the stress of the comparison and contrast needs to be drawn on the
     key concepts which would help to frame the responses, here candidates are expected to show an
     ability to think about the text with emphasis on the approaches of the anthropologists as the main
     principle on which such comparisons and contrasts should be established.

     For example, candidates may note how the author of this extract investigates the ways in which a
     group of young students from California experience intense socioemotional suffering and
     discrimination by approaching research with a focus on their written narratives and memories,
     based on these individuals’ accounts about themselves. The author explains that the topic cannot
     be approached with more commonly used methods. Better responses would make explicit this
     methodological concern and discussion. Candidates can then compare and contrast this with how
     another anthropologist has approached issues of feelings, experiences, inequality, discrimination,
     group identity or any other ethnographic issue, focusing on the approaches.

     Also, candidates may highlight how the author’s approach focuses on agency and structure, with
     an emphasis on the structural influences that shape the subject. Or, for instance, how the author
     demonstrates how societal forces produce and disseminate cultural values. Candidates would
     compare these approaches with the approaches used in another ethnographic work.

5.    What does it mean to be a person? Discuss with reference to at least two sources of
      ethnographic material and examples from the passage.                                       [10]

      This question requires candidates to develop an argument which is built on an understanding of
      the following “big anthropological question”: what does it mean to be a person? This
      argumentative response includes discussion and analysis that should be supported by relevant,
      detailed ethnographic material that gives evidence of the understanding of this big question in
      different cultural contexts.

      This “big anthropological question” should be the very backbone of the response, and be informed
      by the ethnographic material studied. The aim of this question is to facilitate students to think with
      and through ethnographic material; to explore these materials analytically, aided by the focus on a
      “big anthropological question”. A broad variety of ethnographic data can be put forward in order to
      create meaningful responses.
