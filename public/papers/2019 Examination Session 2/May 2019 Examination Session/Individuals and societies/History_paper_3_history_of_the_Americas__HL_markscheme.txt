Apply the markbands that provide the “best fit” to the responses given and award credit wherever it is
possible to do so. If an answer indicates that the demands of the question are understood and
addressed but that not all implications are considered (for example, compare or contrast; reasons
or significance; methods or success), then examiners should not be afraid of using the full range of
marks allowed for by the markscheme. Responses that offer good coverage of some of the criteria
should be rewarded accordingly. If you are uncertain about the content/accuracy of a candidate’s
work please contact your team leader.

Section 1: Indigenous societies and cultures in the Americas (c750–1500)

1.   “Warfare was essential to the maintenance and expansion of political organization.” Discuss with
     reference to one pre-Columbian society.

     The question requires that candidates offer a considered and balanced review of the statement
     that warfare was essential to the maintenance and expansion of political organization. Candidates
     may offer equal coverage of warfare's contributions to maintenance of power and to its role in
     terms of expansion, or they may prioritize the discussion of either one. However, both aspects will
     be a feature of the response. Candidates may refer to warfare as a means to legitimize leaders
     through the acquisition of sacrificial victims to offer to Gods (for example, the Flower Wars of the
     Aztecs). They could also discuss warfare's role in suppressing internal rebellions that challenged
     established authority and to accessing economic resources to prevent internal rebellions.
     Candidates may also refer to warfare in its ability to expand the political organization, subjugating
     neighbours and achieving military dominance. To illustrate, they may refer to the struggle between
     Mayan city states Calakmul and Tikal.


2.   Examine the religious significance of the relationship between man and nature in two indigenous
     societies.

     The question requires that candidates consider the interrelationship between religion, man and
     nature in two indigenous societies. The two societies may or may not have been contemporaneous
     with each other. Candidates may offer equal coverage of the two societies, or they may prioritize
     their discussion of one over the other. A comparative approach may or may not be used. Nature
     played an important role in the religious explanations of the creation of Earth and of mankind; gods
     and other divine creatures were represented by animals, plants and other natural elements.
     Indigenous societies attributed animals and plants healing to supernatural powers. Candidates
     may also discuss the significance of animal sacrifices to gain the favour of gods and/or may
     discuss the interpretations of natural phenomenon as indications of the will of the gods or omens.
                                                 –6–                M19/3/HISTX/HP3/ENG/TZ0/AM/M


Section 2: European explorations and conquests in the Americas (c1492–c1600)

3.   Examine the consequences of Cortés’s conquest of the Aztecs for Spanish exploration of Latin
     America.

     The question requires that candidates consider the interrelationship between Cortés’s conquest of
     the Aztecs and Spanish exploration of Latin America. Consequences may extend beyond the
     timeframe but they must be clearly linked to the issue raised in the question. Candidates may
     address consequences by examining the ways in which the swiftness of the conquest of Mexico
     was interpreted by Spaniards as proof of their superiority and, thus, encouraged further
     explorations. Additionally, the wealth found in the Aztec Empire made the Spaniards eager for
     further exploration of Yucatan, Honduras and Guatemala. Cortés’s conquest encouraged further
     exploration of the Mexican Pacific coast to find a strait connecting the Atlantic and the Pacific
     oceans. This led to the exploration of Baja California. Candidates may refer to the ambition of
     explorers and how it led to conflict. For example, Captain Cristobal de Olid, who explored West
     Mexico and Honduras by order of Cortés, defied him in 1524.


4.   Discuss the impact of the Law of Burgos (1512) on the indigenous peoples of Spanish America.

     The question requires that candidates offer a considered and balanced review of the impact of the
     Law of Burgos on the indigenous people of Spanish America. The impact of the law may extend
     beyond the timeframe but it must be clearly linked to the issue raised in the question. Candidates
     may refer to the 35 laws of Burgos as the first attempt of the Spanish government to regulate the
     treatment of indigenous people in the Americas. The laws set regulations for working and living
     conditions as well as prohibiting the punishment of indigenous peoples by the encomenderos.
     Dominicans sought the reduction of maltreatment but saw the laws as inadequate and
     unenforceable. Abuses led to the New Laws of the Indies (1542). However, colonial opposition led
     to a form of the repartimiento being restored after 1550. Arguments may address the disparity
     between the language of the laws and the extent of implementation, depending upon time, place
     and circumstance.
                                                  –7–                 M19/3/HISTX/HP3/ENG/TZ0/AM/M


Section 3: Colonial government in the New World (1500–1800)

5.   Compare and contrast political organization in Spanish America and British North America.

     The question requires that candidates give an account of the similarities and differences between
     Spanish and British colonial governments in North America, in terms of political organization,
     referring to both throughout. The two colonial governments may or may not have been
     contemporaneous with each other. Candidates may refer to how both Spain and Britain held
     ultimate authority over their colonies. Still, they may argue that political organization in Spanish
     America was directed from the Council of the Indies in Spain, while greater decentralization in
     British North America resulted in greater local political participation. Candidates may nevertheless
     address some local political organization in Spanish America with adelantados and cabildos.
     Candidates may also argue that there was division of power in British America, while power in
     Spanish America was more concentrated. Still, British property or royal colonies saw less division
     of power, and justice systems were set up in both British and Spanish America. Both similarities
     and differences must be clearly indicated but there does not need to be an equal number of each.


6.   Evaluate the importance of plantations in colonial American economies.

     The question requires that candidates make an appraisal of colonial plantations, weighing up their
     importance or otherwise to colonial economies. A comparative approach between countries may or
     may not be used. Candidates may refer to the role of plantations in stimulating colonial economies
     by producing large volumes of cash crops and increasing trade volumes. Plantations promoted the
     development of transport infrastructure to allow export. On the other hand, candidates may
     evaluate the role of plantations in the development of monoculture economies, for example sugar
     in the Jamaican economy. Small farmers were displaced, land was taken over by entrepreneurs
     and economic and social inequalities arose. Candidates may also consider the volatility of the
     prices of the products. Both importance and limitations may be evaluated, but there does not need
     to be equal focus on each. Other relevant factors, for example the development of the slave trade
     to support the demand for labour, may also be addressed.
                                                 –8–                  M19/3/HISTX/HP3/ENG/TZ0/AM/M


Section 4: Religion in the New World (1500–1800)

7.   Evaluate the impact of religious orders in Spanish America.

     The question requires that candidates make an appraisal of the impact of religious orders in
     Spanish America. Effects may extend beyond the timeframe of the section, but they must be
     clearly linked to the impact of religious orders. A comparative approach between orders and/or
     countries may or may not be used. Jesuits and Franciscans founded some of the first education
     centres in the region and taught indigenous peoples to read and write. Dominicans, (for example,
     de Las Casas), advocated for more humane treatment of indigenous populations. Candidates may
     appraise the economic and social impact of reductions and missions and/or evaluate their
     contribution to the struggle against slavery. Candidates may argue that the orders forced religious
     conversions and destroyed indigenous cultures and languages. Either for context or to illustrate
     limitations, candidates may refer to other relevant factors, for example the challenge to Spanish
     colonial authority by Jesuits, Dominicans or Franciscans.


8.   Discuss the reasons for the emergence of syncretism in the Americas.

     The question requires that candidates offer a considered and balanced review of the reasons for
     the emergence of syncretism in the Americas. Causes may predate the timeframe but they must
     be clearly linked to the issue raised in the question. Candidates may refer to syncretism as relevant
     to the contact between all European colonial elements and their relationship with indigenous
     populations and African slaves, whether in Spanish, Portuguese, French or British colonial
     settlements. Syncretism included the mixing of Amerindian, African, Catholic and Protestant
     religious culture. Latin American Catholic colonies were more accepting of syncretism while North
     American Protestants resisted syncretism. African slaves and indigenous people disguised their
     beliefs in the form of Orishas (spirits of lesser deities) in the form of Catholic saints. Candidates
     may also discuss the attempts by religious and political officials to suppress syncretism.
                                                  –9–                  M19/3/HISTX/HP3/ENG/TZ0/AM/M


Section 5: Slavery and the New World (1500–1800)

9.    Evaluate the importance of the asiento system in the establishment and expansion of slavery.

      The question requires that candidates make an appraisal of the importance of the asiento system
      in the establishment and expansion of slavery. Knowledge applied may predate the timeframe but
      must be clearly linked to the issue raised in the question. Candidates may refer to the demand for
      African slaves to provide labour on the sugar and tobacco plantations and in the mines of colonial
      America that resulted from the high mortality rates of the indigenous population. The Spanish
      attempted to fill this need by assigning asientos (contracts) from 1517. Given the prohibition of
      direct Spanish trade with Africa, Spain sold contracts to both individuals and companies from
      Portugal, Britain, Holland, Germany and France. After the 1713 Treaty of Utrecht, Britain acquired
      the asiento (and sold it to the British South Sea Company). A variety of factors, including the fact
      that the asiento accounted for a rather small portion of the slave trade, may be referenced to
      contextualize importance.


10.   Discuss the reasons why Quakers and other early abolitionists opposed slavery.

      The question requires that candidates offer a considered and balanced review of the reasons why
      Quakers and other early abolitionists opposed slavery. Reasons may predate the timeframe but
      they must be clearly linked to the issue raised in the question. Candidates may offer equal
      coverage of Quakers and other early abolitionists, or they may prioritize their discussion of one.
      However, both groups will be a feature of the response. A comparative approach may or may not
      be used. Candidates may refer to Quakers’ belief that human beings, regardless of their ethnicity,
      were equal and, consequently, slavery was immoral. Discussion may include references to the
      “Germantown Quaker Petition Against Slavery” (1688). Candidates may also discuss the violent
      capture of slaves, the conditions of the Middle Passage and the separation of slave families as
      factors contributing to early abolitionist reasons for opposition to slavery.
                                                  – 10 –               M19/3/HISTX/HP3/ENG/TZ0/AM/M


Section 6: Independence movements (1763–1830)

11.   “The influence of ideas was the most significant factor that led to the US Declaration of
      Independence.” Discuss.

      The question requires that candidates offer a considered and balanced review of the role of ideas
      in bringing about US Independence. Causes of US Independence may predate the timeframe but
      they must be clearly linked to the issue raised in the question. Candidates may refer to the
      influence of the Enlightenment as supporting the existence of certain inalienable rights. Concepts
      such as freedom, equality before the law or the right to rebel against tyrannous governments were
      incorporated into the US Declaration of Independence. Candidates may discuss the influence of
      liberalism and republicanism. Other relevant factors, for example the discontent against British rule
      based on economic arguments may be referred to, but with a focus on the issue in the question.


12.   Evaluate the impact of independence on the economy of one country of the Americas.

      The question requires that candidates weigh up the strengths and weaknesses of the economic
      impact of independence on one country of the Americas. Candidates may refer to economic
      stagnation following independence, or the emergence of national conflicts. They may also argue
      that new governments lacked administrative skill, while self-government implied higher costs.
      Candidates may also refer to newly-set trade restrictions with former colonizers, affecting trading
      opportunities. Still, candidates may argue upon positive economic effects brought by the end to
      external trade monopoly with the colonizer, by opportunities now open to international capital
      markets, and by freedom from taxation and extractions by colonizers. While other relevant factors,
      for example social impact of independence, may be referred to for context, the evaluation of the
      impact of independence on the economy is the principal focus of the question.
                                                   – 11 –               M19/3/HISTX/HP3/ENG/TZ0/AM/M


Section 7: Nation-building and challenges (c1780–c1870)

13.   “The War of 1812 had a greater impact on British North America than it did on the US.” Discuss.

      The question requires that candidates offer a considered and balanced review of the statement.
      Discussion may extend beyond the timeframe but it must be clearly linked to the issue raised in the
      question. Candidates may offer equal coverage of British North America and the US or they may
      prioritize their evaluation of either. However, both aspects will be a feature of the response.
      Candidates may refer to the fact that the Treaty of Ghent (1814) brought no territorial change and
      did not address the main issues which had led to war. With the defeat of Tecumseh’s
      confederation, the Creek confederation and Britain’s military withdrawal, the path was opened for
      expansion into territory held by indigenous tribes. It may be asserted that, by their defence efforts,
      residents of Upper Canada ended the possibility of Canada being annexed by the US. Candidates
      might contest the premise by arguing that the war caused a surge in US manufacturing and
      contributed to a growth in nationalism.


14.   Examine the conditions that led to the establishment of caudillo rule in one Latin America country.

      The question requires that candidates consider the interrelationship between the rise to power of
      caudillos and the conditions that may have facilitated such rise. Candidates may refer to political
      conditions, including political instability after independence; centralist/federalist conflicts;
      regionalism; tradition of authoritarian rule; and/or support of powerful institutions such as the
      Church. Candidates may also refer to economic conditions, including debts arising from
      independence wars and stagnation in economic activity after independence. Social conditions may
      also be considered, including illiteracy; social inequality and lack of opportunity (especially for
      natives and marginalized rural workers); and/or existence of regional elites that could empower
      caudillos. Candidates might also explore the role of caudillos’ personal attributes and abilities that
      contributed to the establishment of caudillo rule. Examples may include Juan Manuel de Rosas in
      Argentina, José Antonio Paez in Venezuela, José Antonio López de Santa Ana in Mexico, among
      others.
                                                  – 12 –               M19/3/HISTX/HP3/ENG/TZ0/AM/M


Section 8: United States' Civil War: causes, course and effects (1840–1877)

15.   Discuss the arguments for and against slavery in the US.
      The question requires that candidates offer a considered review of arguments made for and
      against slavery in the US during the period. Discussion may predate the timeframe but must be
      clearly linked to the issue raised in the question. Candidates may offer equal coverage of
      arguments for and arguments against that were made at the time, or they may prioritize their
      discussion of either. Religious arguments that were made for slavery might include the Biblical
      failure to condemn slavery and the conversion of slaves to Christianity; legal arguments that were
      made might emphasize the protection of property rights; economic arguments that were made may
      assert the alleged economic necessity of slavery to the Southern economy. Arguments against
      may include Enlightenment ideals embodied in the Declaration of Independence as an ideological
      element; the many immoralities associated with slavery as a basis for religious opposition; the
      mistreatment of people held as slaves; the boom–bust nature of the slave labour economy for
      economic opposition and the inherently unequal chattel slavery laws as a legal argument.


16.   To what extent did the North and South regard the compromise of 1850 as harmful to their
      interests?

      The question requires that candidates consider the merits or otherwise of the suggestion that the
      North, the South or both regarded the Compromise of 1850 as harmful to their interests. While
      some content may predate the timeframe to provide context, it must be clearly linked to the issue
      raised in the question. Candidates may offer equal coverage of the North and the South, or they
      may prioritize their assessment of either. However, both aspects will be a feature of the response.
      Key elements of the Compromise of 1850 included the passage of a more stringent fugitive slave
      act, the addition of California as a “free” state, the application of popular sovereignty in two
      territories and the abolition of the slave trade in Washington DC. Candidates may emphasize the
      emotional impact of the Fugitive Slave Act on both North and South, the political effect of increased
      congressional representation for the North, the differing positions on the impact of popular
      sovereignty in the territories and the extreme tension between the two regions over the slave trade
      in the nation’s capital. In general, the South regarded the compromise as possessing more
      potential for harm to their interests, but Northern abolitionists and Free Soil elements were also
      highly critical of the compromise.

Section 9: The development of modern nations (1865–1929)

17.    “Industrial growth was the main reason for economic modernization in the Americas.” Discuss with
      reference to one country.

      The question requires that candidates offer a considered and balanced review that includes a
      range of arguments as to whether industrial growth was the main contributor to the economic
      modernization of one country of the region. Candidates may refer to how industrial growth brought
      modern features to the economy, such as railroad construction that facilitated the economic
      integration of regions and systematic organization in factories facilitated by the use of machinery
      and/or introduction of new production strategies, including scientific management and assembly
      lines. Candidates may also argue that the second industrial revolution brought the need for modern
      economic reform to break up monopolies and improve working conditions. Candidates may refer to
      the relative significance of industrial growth in its contribution to economic modernization, arguing
      that other factors had greater impact. These could include: supportive government policies;
      adoption of export-led economies; communication advances, internal migrations, liberal
      immigration policy and the exploitation of natural resources.


18.   Evaluate the impact of the Great Migration and the Harlem Renaissance on the condition of African
      Americans.

      The question requires that candidates make an appraisal of the impact of the Great Migration and
      the Harlem Renaissance weighing up the benefits and costs these may have brought to African
      Americans. Candidates may offer equal coverage of the impact of the Great Migration and the
      Harlem Renaissance, or they may prioritize their evaluation of either one. However, both aspects
      will be a feature of the response. Candidates may argue that the Great Migration improved the
      socio-economic condition of African Americans, as northern cities offered better educational
      opportunities, greater freedoms, and decreased racial violence. Still, social hardships persisted,
      including decreased community life, housing problems, and discrimination. Candidates may
      describe improvements in employment; but argue that jobs were low-paid and unskilled, and
      workers were generally not protected by unions. Candidates may also argue that with the cultural
      explosion of the Harlem Renaissance, the image of African Americans changed into one of greater
      sophistication and that the movement gave rise to early self-determination claims and militancy.
      Both positive and negative effects must be clearly indicated but there does not need to be an equal
      number of/focus on each.

Section 10: Emergence of the Americas in global affairs (1880–1929)

19.   “Ideology was the main reason for the expansionist foreign policies of the US.” Discuss.

      The question requires that candidates offer a considered and balanced review that includes a
      range of arguments as to the suggestion that ideology was the main reason for the expansionist
      foreign policies of the US. In respect to ideology, candidates may refer to the significance of ideas
      relating to Manifest Destiny and expansionism as a moral duty linked to the tenets of Social
      Darwinism. Economic causes for expansionist policies could also be explained, including the need
      for resources and markets given industrial growth and the impact of the 1870s Depression. Social
      factors might include the influence of Christian missionaries. Geopolitical causes for expansionist
      policies could be explained including the need to secure control over strategic sites, such as the
      Panama Canal, Hawaii, and the Samoan islands. Other political causes for expansionist policies
      could also be addressed, including the need to expand influence given European competition, as in
      Venezuela or Cuba.


20.   To what extent were President Wilson’s peace ideals responsible for the failure of the US to ratify
      the Treaty of Versailles?

      The question requires that candidates consider the merits or otherwise of the suggestion that
      President Wilson’s peace ideals were responsible for the failure of the US to ratify the Treaty of
      Versailles. Causes/reasons may predate the timeframe but they must be clearly linked to the issue
      raised in the question. Candidates may offer equal coverage of arguments that peace ideals were
      responsible for the failure of ratification and alternative theories as to the failure, or they may
      prioritize their assessment of either argument. However, both aspects will be a feature of the
      response. Candidates may apply “peace ideals” by reference to Wilson’s idealistic
      pronouncements, his plans for peace (as expressed in the Fourteen Points), and the post-war
      disillusionment regarding many of Wilson’s war aims not being reflected in the Treaty of Versailles.
      Other relevant factors, for example Wilson’s physical incapacity, long-standing US isolationist
      sentiment, and concerns over sovereignty, (associated with Article X), may be referred to, but with
      a focus on the issue in the question.

Section 11: The Mexican Revolution (1884–1940)

21.   “Porfirio Diaz’s loss of political control was due to social inequality.” To what extent do you agree
      with this statement?

      The question requires that candidates consider the merits or otherwise of the statement that
      Porfirio Diaz’s loss of political control was due to social inequality. Reasons may predate the
      timeframe but they must be clearly linked to the issue raised in the question. Candidates may offer
      equal coverage of social inequality and other factors, or they may prioritize their assessment of the
      former. However, both aspects will be a feature of the response. Candidates may refer to the
      widespread poverty, unequal land distribution, poor living and working conditions of Mexican
      peasants and workers. Other relevant factors, for example economic factors, Diaz’s advanced age,
      and the lack of social mobility of the bourgeoisie, local and provincial elites may be referred to, but
      with a focus on the issue in the question.


22.   Examine the reasons for, and methods of, foreign intervention in the Mexican Revolution.

      The question requires that candidates consider the interrelationship between the reasons for and
      methods of foreign intervention in the Mexican Revolution. Reasons may predate the timeframe
      but they must be clearly linked to the issue raised in the question. As Mexico’s neighbour, the US
      was concerned about the impact of unrest on its own territory and intervened to restore the rule of
      law and protect their economic interests. Candidates may discuss the use of diplomatic methods,
      for example the placement of an embargo in 1912 and/or US refusal to recognize Huerta as
      president. Candidates may also refer to military intervention in Veracruz and/or General Pershing’s
      expedition to capture Pancho Villa.

Section 12: The Great Depression and the Americas (mid-1920s–1939)

23.   Compare and contrast the nature and efficacy (effectiveness) of one US president’s and one
      Canadian prime minister’s solutions to the Great Depression.

      The question requires that candidates give an account of the similarities and differences between
      the nature and efficacy of solutions offered in response to the Great Depression by one US
      president and one Canadian prime minister, referring to both throughout. When addressing
      efficacy, candidates may go beyond the timeframe but the points made must be clearly linked to
      the issue raised in the question. Candidates may refer to each leader’s economic and political
      philosophy as well as the actions taken. Issues that might be raised for comparison and contrast
      include tariffs, the extent of government relief, unemployment efforts, civil works projects, deficit
      spending and the effectiveness of the leader’s communication with the masses. Candidates may
      also apply data as to the extent of economic restoration or discuss the role of the Second World
      War in aiding economic recovery. Both similarities and differences must be clearly indicated but
      there does not need to be an equal number of each.

24.   Discuss the economic and social challenges of the Great Depression in one Latin American
      country.

      The question requires that candidates offer a considered and balanced review of the economic and
      social challenges of the Great Depression in one country of Latin America. Challenges may extend
      beyond the timeframe but they must be clearly linked to the issue raised in the question.
      Candidates may offer equal coverage of economic and social challenges, or they may prioritize
      their discussion of one of them. However, both aspects will be a feature of the response.
      Candidates may refer to economic challenges such as the loss of external markets and foreign
      investments; the fall of international prices of commodities; inflation and/or new restrictions to
      international credit. Candidates may refer to social challenges such as the impact of internal
      migration and urbanization, and/or social tensions among the urban working classes because of
      rising unemployment.

Section 13: The Second World War and the Americas (1933–1945)

25.   “The desire to defeat Japan was the main reason for the use of atomic weapons by the US.”
      Discuss.

      The question requires that candidates offer a considered and balanced review of the statement.
      Candidates may refer to US officials believing that a costly invasion would be required before
      Japan surrendered, thus weapons were dropped to shorten the war and save American lives. The
      battles on Iwo Jima and Okinawa may be examined to reflect the kind of defence the Japanese
      could make. Candidates may also refer to multiple opportunities for surrender offered to Japan,
      which had not been accepted. Other relevant factors, for example the US’s desire to display power
      over the USSR; the expense of the Manhattan Project and/or retaliation for Pearl Harbor, may be
      referred to, but with a focus on the issue in the question.


26.   Examine the economic effects of the Second World War on two countries of the Americas.

      The question requires that candidates consider the economic effects of the Second World War on
      two countries of the Americas. Candidates may offer equal coverage of effects on both countries,
      or they may prioritize their discussion of either one. However, both aspects will be a feature of the
      response. A comparative approach may or may not be used. Candidates may refer to a wide range
      of effects of war on domestic economics including inflation, end of the Depression, changes in
      trade patterns, industrialization, changes in the economic role of government, economic integration
      of markets, and promotion of technology. The examination of economic effects is relevant up to
      1945. Answers will vary according to the selected case study. Within Latin America some possible
      countries could be Brazil, Argentina or Mexico; Canada and the US might also be popular choices.
      While other relevant factors, for example social effects, may be referred to, they would be relevant
      mainly as context for the issue raised in the question.
                                                   – 18 –               M19/3/HISTX/HP3/ENG/TZ0/AM/M


Section 14: Political developments in Latin America (1945–1980)

27.   Evaluate the contribution of social and cultural policies to Fidel Castro’s rule to 1980.

      The question requires that candidates make an appraisal of Castro’s rule as indicated in the
      specified timeframe. Policies may extend beyond the timeframe but they must be clearly linked to
      the issue raised in the question. Candidates may offer equal coverage of social and cultural
      policies, or they may prioritize their discussion of one of them. However, both will be a feature of
      the response. Candidates may refer to the Literacy Campaign (1961) and other policies to improve
      access to education. They may discuss health programmes that reduced infant mortality and/or
      policies towards women. Cultural policies applied propaganda to exaggerate the success of
      programmes and promote nationalism, reflecting the spirit of the revolution. Other relevant factors,
      for example the role of the secret police to control dissent, may be referred to, but with a focus on
      the issue in the question.


28.   “Economic rather than social policies were responsible for the crisis of democracy in Latin
      America.” Discuss.

      The question requires that candidates offer a considered and balanced review of the statement.
      Causes may predate the timeframe but they must be clearly linked to the issue raised in the
      question. Candidates may offer equal coverage of economic and social policies, or they may
      prioritize their discussion of economic policies. However, both aspects will be a feature of the
      response. For economic policies, candidates may refer to the limited success in controlling
      unemployment or inflation; the rise of public deficit; nationalization. Candidates may discuss the
      extent to which policies to achieve greater social equality, such as agrarian reforms, led to protests
      against the democratic governments. Other relevant factors, for example, the role of foreign
      intervention, may be referred to, but with a focus on the issue in the question.
                                                  – 19 –              M19/3/HISTX/HP3/ENG/TZ0/AM/M


Section 15: Political developments in the United States (1945–1980) and Canada (1945–1982)

29.   Compare and contrast the domestic policies of Nixon and Ford.

      The question requires that candidates give an account of the similarities and differences between
      Nixon and Ford in terms of domestic policy, referring to both throughout. Candidates may refer to
      Nixon and Ford having inflation and deficit spending as main macroeconomic concerns, but may
      contrast Nixon's unorthodox policies such as freezes on wages and prices to deal with inflation
      with Ford's non-interventionist “Whip Inflation Now” (WIN) campaign. Both adopted tax cuts (1972
      and 1975) to boost the economy when facing recession, disregarding fiscal deficit. Both believed
      that states should be granted increased economic powers. Still, unlike Nixon's ideas under
      revenue sharing, Ford denied federal bailout to New York City. Socially, although both enacted
      policies that improved women's condition, Nixon publicly opposed the Equal Rights Amendment
      (ERA). Candidates may discuss greater achievements under Nixon for African Americans (school
      desegregation in the South, Philadelphia Plan), even if Ford was said to have a more liberal stand
      on civil rights. Both opposed federal bussing programmes. Electorally, candidates may contrast
      Nixon's Southern Strategy with Ford's attempt to capture the African American vote and refer to
      challenges faced by both administrations due to Democratic majorities in the House of
      Representatives. Both similarities and differences must be clearly indicated but there does not
      need to be an equal number of each.


30.   Discuss the reasons for the rise of nationalism in Quebec.

      The question requires that candidates offer a considered and balanced review of the reasons for
      the rise of Quebec nationalism. Candidates may refer to the Quiet Revolution's contribution to the
      formulation of a national identity in Quebec, as identity moved from French Canadian to
      Québécois, and goals of Quebecers started to differ from those of the francophone minority that
      also lived in Canada. Nationalism grew stronger as Lesage's government promoted social and
      economic reforms, which empowered the Quebec society. Candidates may examine the impact of
      the implementation of a welfare state in Quebec in the formulation of a social democratic form of
      nationalism. Contributions in the expansion of civil service, educational reform, nationalization of
      business and government sponsoring of the arts may be examined. Candidates may also argue
      that the rise of the Quebec sovereignty movement was a consequence of the Quiet Revolution,
      examining the creation of the sovereigntist Parti Québécois in 1968 or actions by the Front de
      libération du Québec. Both importance and limitations must be clearly indicated but there does not
      need to be an equal number of/focus on each. Other relevant factors, for example the contribution
      of the Great Depression and/or the Second World War, may be referred to, but with a focus on the
      issue in the question.

Section 16: The Cold War and the Americas (1945–1981)

31.   Examine the social and cultural impact of the Cold War on the US during Truman’s presidency.

      The question requires that candidates consider an argument in a way that uncovers the
      assumptions and interrelationships of the social and cultural impact in the US resulting from the
      Cold War during the Truman administration. Consequences may extend beyond the timeframe but
      they must be clearly linked to the issue raised in the question. Candidates may offer equal
      coverage of social and cultural impact, or they may prioritize their assessment of either. However,
      both aspects will be a feature of the response. Candidates may refer to the psychological impact of
      events, such as the Rosenberg case and the accusations of McCarthy. The impact of the Cold War
      on Hollywood and the mass media might be explored due to the emphasis on anti-Communist
      themes. Support for the civil rights movement to avoid claims of hypocrisy may also be advanced.


32.   Discuss the reasons for, and characteristics of, Eisenhower’s New Look policy.

      The question requires that candidates offer a considered and balanced review of the reasons for
      and characteristics of Eisenhower’s New Look policy. Causes/reasons may predate the timeframe
      but they must be clearly linked to the issue raised in the question. Candidates may offer equal
      coverage of the reasons for and characteristics of the policy, or they may prioritize their discussion
      of either. However, both aspects will be a feature of the response. As to reasons, candidates may
      refer to the rising costs of conventional warfare, concerns over inflation and deficits, and the
      corrupting nature of the military–industrial complex (as expressed in Eisenhower’s farewell
      address). As to characteristics, candidates may develop the reduction of conventional forces, the
      expansion of the air force and the Strategic Air Command (SAC), the emerging ballistic missile
      programme, as well as the increased use of covert operations (for example in Guatemala).
                                                  – 21 –               M19/3/HISTX/HP3/ENG/TZ0/AM/M


Section 17: Civil Rights and social movements in the Americas post-1945

33.   To what extent did the civil rights movement in the US end segregation in the South between 1955
      and 1980?

      The question requires that candidates consider the merits or otherwise of the suggestion that the
      Civil Rights movement in the US ended segregation in the South by 1980. Factors that led to the
      end of segregation in the South and that occurred outside the timeframe may be included, but they
      must be clearly linked to the issue in the question (for example, paving the way for the civil rights
      movement). Candidates may refer to Brown I and Brown II as Supreme Court cases that both
      challenged yet perpetuated segregation. The attempt to integrate Central High in Little Rock,
      Arkansas or the James Meredith effort to enrol in the University of Mississippi may be addressed to
      illustrate the limited extent of integration. They may also discuss the Montgomery bus boycott for
      its impact on integration of transportation. The extent to which public school closures and their
      replacement with private schools limited educational integration in elementary and secondary
      schools may also be applied. Other relevant factors, might include the extent of southern de facto
      segregation, as illustrated by such factors as housing patterns and church and social club
      membership which was largely unchanged into the 1970s and beyond.


34.   “Youth protests of the 1960s and 1970s successfully challenged established authority.” Discuss.

      The question requires that candidates offer a considered and balanced review of the statement
      that youth protests of the 1960s and 1970s successfully challenged established authority.
      Candidates may place emphasis on protests in the US, but accept any country where youth
      protests occurred. Candidates may argue that youth protest successfully challenged Nixon to
      change US policy in Vietnam through anti-war protest, for example the 1969 Moratorium. However,
      they may discuss that US withdrawal from Vietnam was not necessarily an achievement of youth
      protest. Candidates may also argue that student protesters challenged university authorities, and
      refer to their successes at the University of California or Berkeley's Free Speech Movement. Still,
      they may discuss that change was not radical, as slogans questioning authority alienated those in
      a position to enact change. Candidates may argue that students were successful at challenging
      political authority, when the Democratic Party reformed the nomination process in 1972 to
      maximize youth participation. Students in Mexico protested against their government and in favour
      of land reform. Youth protests also occurred in Argentina, Brazil and Chile with varying causes and
      results.

Section 18: The Americas (1980–2005)

35.   “The policies of Mulroney (1984–1993) were effective in addressing Canada’s domestic issues.”
      Discuss.

      The question requires that candidates offer a considered and balanced review of the statement.
      The discussion of domestic issues may extend beyond the timeframe but it must be clearly linked
      to the policies of Mulroney. Candidates may refer to Mulroney presiding over a period of strong
      economic growth with high job creation and low inflation, as well as his strong environmental
      record, which included negotiation of the Acid Rain Accord. Limitations that may be addressed
      include Mulroney’s passage of the unpopular Goods and Services Tax and the North American
      Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) or the failed efforts toward constitutional revision.


36.   Discuss the domestic impact of terrorism.

      The question requires that candidates offer a considered and balanced review of the domestic
      impact of terrorism. A comparative approach may or may not be used. Candidates may refer to
      increased security measures, such as border control. They may discuss domestic concerns about
      individuals’ right to privacy, for example, with the Patriot Act passed after 9/11. In some countries,
      terrorism had a negative impact on political institutions. For example, in 1992, Peruvian President
      Alberto Fujimori suspended the Constitution and dissolved the Congress, claiming to be fighting
      against terrorism. In other countries, for example Colombia, terrorism increased social conflicts as
      it forced internal migrations. Candidates may discuss the economic cost of terrorism: damage to
      life and infrastructure; impact on tourism and transport industries; increased costs of national
      security.
