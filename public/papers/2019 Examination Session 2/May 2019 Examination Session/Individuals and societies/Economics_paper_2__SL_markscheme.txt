           some way OR for an explanation that in the domestic market,
           there is a disequilibrium because there is one of the following:
             a shortage of 0.9 million tons
             demand of 2.1 million tons and supply of only 1.2 million tons

           shift of the world supply curve, an increase in price, and a fall in
           the level of imports OR for an explanation that a tariff will result
           in an increase in the price of tinplate steel and hence a fall in the
           quantity of imports due to an increase in the domestic quantity
           supplied (and/or decrease in quantity demanded).

Responses may include:
 definition of tariff
 international trade diagram to explain impact of the requested tariff on consumers,
  producers, government, importers and efficiency (paragraph ).

Possible impacts:
 some candidates may question the claims of the CMI, noting that they have a vested
  interest in tinplate steel being exempted from a tariff (paragraph )
 severe economic impacts on the tin can manufacturing industry (paragraph )
 job losses and potential structural unemployment in the tin can industry (paragraphs
   and )
 inefficient domestic tinplate steel producers are supported (paragraph ), causing a
  misallocation of resources
 the inferior “quality of domestically-produced tinplate steel” (paragraph ) may
  result in a decline in quality and higher price of final products
 tariff allows domestic steel tinplate producers to maintain higher revenues / incomes
  to allow them to compete with higher quality imports (paragraph )
 higher input prices for can manufacturers may force closures of some can producers
  and a consolidation within the tin can industry (paragraph )
 tariff will increase input costs for can manufacturers requiring tinplate steel as an
  input (paragraph )
 tin can producers disadvantaged when substitute packaging is not exposed to a
  tariff (paragraph )
 impact on economic growth in communities dependent on tin can manufacturing
  (paragraph )
 impact on low-income households as tariffs are regressive taxes and food is a
  staple; low income households spend a higher proportion of their income on canned
  food (paragraph )
 trading partners might retaliate by imposing their own protectionist measures
 tariffs provide a source of tax revenue that can be reinvested
 as domestic production can only meet 57% of domestic demand, it might take
  a substantial increase in price to resolve the shortage (paragraph )
 may affect the competitiveness of US exports, which require tin-plate steel as
  a factor input.

           market.
  2        There is a correct diagram AND an accurate written response.             3–4
           An exchange rate diagram showing a shift of the supply curve to
           the right and a fall in the value of the rupee AND an explanation
           that a fall in the interest rate will make saving abroad a better
           option, so increasing the demand for foreign currencies and
           increasing the supply of the rupee on the foreign exchange
           market.

      Candidates may state that reducing interest rates means that overall there has
      been less demand for the rupee because foreign depositors have less incentive
      to deposit their money in Indian banks, thus causing a shift in the demand curve
      to the left and a fall in the value of the rupee. If properly explained, with a correct
      diagram, then this approach may be fully rewarded.

      Candidates who incorrectly label diagrams can be awarded a maximum of [3].

      For an exchange rate diagram, the vertical axis may be exchange rate, price of
      rupee in another currency, other currency/rupee or other currency per rupee. The

      Command term
      “Discuss” requires candidates to offer a considered and balanced review that
      includes a range of arguments, factors, or hypotheses. Opinions or conclusions
      should be presented clearly and supported by appropriate evidence.

      Responses may include:
       definitions of appreciation, inflation, employment, economic growth, current
        account.

      Inflation rate:
       the inflation rate may decrease due to cost-push deflation caused by lower
         prices of imported goods (paragraph )
       the inflation rate may decrease due to cost-push deflation caused by lower
         prices of imported raw materials and semi-finished goods (paragraph )
       the central bank may reduce interest rates to lower the value of the rupee
         (paragraph ), causing an expansion of AD and demand-pull inflation
       the above points may have an off-setting effect on the level of inflation
       excess liquidity in the financial markets (paragraph ) may also be inflationary
       demand-pull inflation falls due to lower AD since net exports fall.

      Employment:
       increased export prices (paragraph ) may lead to falling demand for exports
        (paragraph  and paragraph ) and so an increase in unemployment in
        export industries and in industries that compete with imports (due to lower
        import prices)
       decreased import prices (paragraph ) may lower costs for firms using
        imported raw materials and semi-finished goods, thus lowering prices,
        increasing demand, and leading to higher employment.

Economic growth:
 the overall effect of higher export prices and lower import prices (paragraph
  ) might lead to a fall in net exports, as explained in (b), causing a fall in
  growth
 strong capital inflows (paragraph ) might offset the above if the funds are
  used for investment in capital goods as increased investment shifts AD to the
  right, causing growth
 a slowdown in exports has slowed economic expansion and real GDP growth
  has fallen to 5.7%, the lowest for more than three years (paragraph ).

Current account balance:
 purchase of reserve assets might be necessary to compensate for the current
  account deficit (paragraph )
 higher export prices may lead to reduced export revenue and lower import
  prices to increased import expenditure harming the current account balance
 if the central bank reduces the value of the rupee (paragraph ), then the US
  may retaliate with protectionist measures that would harm the current account
  balance (and employment/economic growth)
 the capital inflows that caused the appreciation (paragraph ) will lead to
  future debits under the current account (income flows).

Responses may include:
 definition of economic growth.

Factors affecting economic growth:
 deregulation should increase investment (paragraph ) and so will lead to an
  increase in AD and thus economic growth, however, there are the dangers of
  pollution and poorer working conditions (paragraph )
 growth could be limited if loose environmental regulations cause, for example,
  pollution that harms health and therefore workers' productivity (paragraph )
 growth in employment and income (paragraph ) should lead to increases in
  consumption and so AD, however, this will only continue if the economy keeps
  growing
 higher mining export volumes (paragraph ) should continue to provide
  economic growth, however, this will be dependent on continued growth in the
  global economy
 FDI (paragraph ) could fill the investment gap, shifting AD and increasing
  economic growth, however, FDI has several negative aspects and its
  continuation will be dependent on the situation in the economies providing it,
  eg “deceleration of China’s economic growth (paragraph )
 free trade (paragraph ), with continued trade surpluses, will provide
  continued economic growth, but is once again dependent on the state of the
  world economy and on the trade policies of other countries
 increased public investment (paragraph ) should create economic growth,
  but will it be enough to outweigh “the lower growth rate in the mining sector
  and weak private investment” (paragraph )
 external shocks in commodities prices (paragraph ) could negatively affect
  future export earnings
 a further deceleration of China’s economic growth (paragraph ) could affect
  demand for commodities from the main trading partner and FDI (paragraph )
 unpredictability in world capital markets (paragraph ) could affect investment
 the threat of tight (contractionary) monetary policy in the US (paragraph )
  could lead to a slowdown in the US economy and hence reduce the demand
  for commodities from the second main trading partner (paragraph )
 tight (contractionary) monetary policy in the US (paragraph ) could lead to
  an outflow of savings to the US, reducing funds available for investment in
  Peru.

To reach level 3, students must be aware of the particular situation in the
economy of Peru, not just present a discussion of growth factors in general.
