Critical Thinking – explanation, analysis and evaluation

These trigger words often signal critical thinking. The bold words are the key terms in the various
criteria.
Explanation – Because, as a result of, due to, therefore, consequently, for example
Analysis – Furthermore, additionally, however, but, conversely, likewise, in addition, on the other hand,
whereas
Evaluation ‫ –ؘ‬My opinion, overall, although, despite, on balance, weighing up

Examiners should be aware that in some cases, candidates may take a different approach, which if
appropriate should be rewarded. If in doubt, check with your team leader.

In the case of an “identify” question read all answers and mark positively up to the maximum marks.
Disregard incorrect answers. In all other cases where a question asks for a certain number of facts
eg “describe two kinds”, mark the first two correct answers. This could include two explanations, two
descriptions, one description and one identification, or two identifications.

• It should be recognized that, given time constraints, answers for part (c) questions are likely to include
  a much narrower range of issues and concepts than identified in the markband. There is no “correct”
  answer. Examiners must be prepared to award full marks to answers which synthesize and evaluate
  even if they do not examine all the stimulus material.

                                               Section A

1.   Parents “cyber-spying” on their children

     Note to examiners:
     • All part (a) questions are marked using ticks and annotations where appropriate.
     • Part (b) and part (c) are marked using markbands. Use annotations and text comments to
       provide a rationale behind the marks you awarded. Do not use ticks.

     (a)   (i)    Identify two features of spyware.                                                    [2]

                  Answers may include:
                  • spyware collects data/information about a person, such as internet surfing
                    habits, passwords, log in details, monitors keystrokes / keylogger, accesses
                    data stored on the device
                  • spyware is hidden from the user/is anonymous - the user is not aware of its
                    presence (hence the name: it is like a spy) and has not given consent
                  • spyware can have different functions
                     o some spyware only collects data and monitors what the user does
                     o others can install additional software
                     o start controlling the computer (for example hijacking the modem,
                        controlling the camera etc.)
                     o can weaken the computer security by disabling firewalls and antivirus
                        software
                     o can detect when the user is engaged in suspicious activity
                     o can access the content of emails sent and received
                  • spyware can take different forms such as adware or trojan horses
                  • spyware is usually regarded as malicious and harmful, but not always, for
                    example when used by law enforcement and security/intelligence agencies
                  • spyware is installed on a user’s computer without their knowledge.

                  Note to examiners: The question stem does not make a clear distinction between
                  “spyware” and “monitoring software”. The terms should therefore be regarded as
                  equivalent/synonymous in candidates’ responses.

                  Award [1] for identifying each feature of spyware up to a maximum of [2].

           (ii)   Identify the steps taken by a GPS device to determine its location.                  [4]

                   Answers may include:
                   • GPS device gets signal from the first satellite
                   • uses radio signals
                   • GPS device calculates how far it is this first satellite (based on how long it took
                     for the signal to travel)
                   • GPS device does the same for 2-3 (or more) other satellites (minimum total
                     number is 3 satellites. At least 4 satellites are required for accurate location.)
                  • GPS device calculates the distance from the 3 or more satellites (called
                     triangulation)
                  • GPS device uses this calculation to determine the latitude, longitude and altitude of
                     its current position
                  • GPS device takes this location information and displays it on map files stored in
                     its memory.

                  Award [1] for identifying each step taken by a GPS device to determine its
                  location up to a maximum of [4].

 (b)    The developers of Qustodio decided to use automated keyword detection to monitor for
        signs of cyber-bullying.

        Analyse this decision.                                                                        [6]

        Answers may include:

        Advantages of using automated keyword detection
        • the suspicious message could be stopped even before it appears on the child’s
          device
        • automated keyword detection is immediate and can instantaneously draw parents’
          attention to suspicious messages and their authors
        • there is no need for parents to read through all the messages
        • the system may help discourage children who know they are being monitored from
          sending suspicious messages.

        Disadvantages of using automated keyword detection
        • some terms may be wrongly detected as sign of cyberbullying when in fact they are
           innocuous in context
        • some people may use alternative spelling or leetspeak to go around this issue, for
           example “I8u” for “I hate you”. Teenage language evolves more rapidly than the
           software could incorporate new keywords
        • cyberbullying is not just about words but also tone, style, intention, sarcasm, which
           automated keyword detection could not spot
        • not all cyberbullying is carried out through text (e.g. image-based) so a keyword
           detector would not be effective in these cases
        • the software might only be able to detect keywords in certain commonly-spoken
           languages.

          No knowledge or understanding of ITGS issues and concepts. No use of appropriate
  0
          ITGS terminology.

          A limited response that indicates very little understanding of the topic or the reason is not
 1–2      clear. Uses little or no appropriate ITGS terminology. No reference is made to the
          scenario in the stimulus material. The response is theoretical.

          appropriate ITGS terminology in the response.

          A balanced and detailed analysis of the relative advantages and disadvantages of the
          use automated keyword detection to monitor for signs of cyberbullying. Explicit and

(c)   To what extent is it acceptable for parents to use apps such as Qustodio and TeenSafe
      to monitor their child’s online activities?                                                  [8]

      Answers may include:

      Reasons why it is acceptable
      • parents may want to control the contents of websites that their child is going to
        access
      • parents may be worried about who contacts their child online and what messages
        they exchange/gives parents a sense of relief of knowing what their child is up to
      • parents are responsible for the safety and wellbeing of their child and feel it is their
        duty, as parents, to monitor their child’s online activities
      • parents pay for the mobile devices, in most cases, so they feel that have the right to
        know how, when and for what purpose the devices are used.

      Reasons why it is not acceptable
      • children have a right to privacy, which these apps refute and deny
      • the use of apps could involve data being sent to the app developers which
        potentially introduces new privacy issues
      • children may not know that their parents monitor their messages and online
        activities, which can be detrimental to trust and honesty within the family
      • there is no consent: the children may not be asked whether they agree or not
      • younger children may need to be protected, but teenagers may feel they have a
        right to exchange messages in all confidentiality with other people, without their
        parents spying on them.

      Marking note: Do not accept references to hacking. The question is about the
      acceptability of parents monitoring their child’s online activities

2.   Braille keyboards

     Note to examiners:
     • All part (a) questions are marked using ticks and annotations where appropriate.
     • Part (b) and part (c) are marked using markbands. Use annotations and text comments to
       provide a rationale behind the marks you awarded. Do not use ticks.

     (a)   (i)    Identify two features of American Standard Code for Information
                  Interchange (ASCII).                                                                 [2]

                  Answers may include:
                  • ASCII is the standard system to encode and represent English characters as
                    numbers, (for example, upper case L is 76
                  • ASCII code numerically represents alphabet letters, but also signs such as “%”
                    or “@” or even some actions such as “backspace” or “delete”
                  • ASCII is a simple “raw” format that any computer can understand (plain text,
                    no formatting)
                  • the standard ASCII character set uses 7 bits for each character (though some
                    non-English letters and graphic symbols use 8 bits)
                  • ASCII has 128 characters (each character is assigned a number from 0 – 127
                    e.g. L is 760.

                  Award [1] for identifying each feature of ASCII up to a maximum of [2].

           (ii)   Describe two methods that Umair could have used to gather data from visually
                  impaired people during the development of his system.                                [4]

                  Answers may include:

                  One-to-one interviews
                  Umair could have spoken with visually impaired people, individually, asking them
                  about their experience or about their own particular needs from a Braille
                  keyboard. At the very beginning of the development of his system, this could
                  have helped him define and refine the specification, as they are the target users.

                  Focus groups
                  Umair could have spoken with a small group of visually impaired people, asking
                  them to test and compare different versions of the overlay he was producing,
                  discussing their advantages and advantages at the same time, encouraging them
                  to share ideas and speak with one another.

                  Surveys
                  Umair could have carried out some quantitative research, with questionnaires in
                  Braille, asking questions to a number of visually impaired people in order to
                  collect data from a larger sample, more representative of the population of
                  visually impaired people who may be the end users of his Braille keyboard.

                  Direct observation
                  Umair could have visited a place where visually impaired individuals use the
                  system to observe how it is used, how it can be improved and make notes on
                  what features would be appropriate for the new system. In other words, observe
                  people using a braille keyboard
                                                –8–                 M19/3/ITGSX/HP1/ENG/TZ0/XX/M


             Award [1] for identifying each method Umair could have used to gather data from
             visually impaired people during the development of his system and [1] for
             description of that method up to a maximum of [2].

             Mark as [2] + [2].

 (b)    Umair has decided to release his Braille software as open source software, rather
        than proprietary software.

        Explain why Umair took this decision.                                                         [6]

        Answers may include:
        • Umair seems more motivated by “doing good” and helping visually impaired people
          than by making a profit
        • the software could be gradually and freely improved by other experts, for example
          creating versions in different languages
        • open source community is more active than a company’s helpdesk, offering
          accessible and timely support
        • the software may evolve/update more rapidly than if it was a commercial product
        • the time taken to register the software and gain patents may lead to other software
          developers creating similar software that would reduce the impact of Umair’s
          software if it became proprietary
        • open source software is generally supplied free of charge making it more accessible
          to a wider range of people (e.g. schools, charities, people on low incomes etc.)
        • open source software can be published under one of the Creative Common
          licenses, which are free to use. Proprietary software may require more complex and
          costly methods (e.g. patenting) to protect Umair’s intellectual property rights.

(c)   Umair has two options:
      • Option 1: he could continue to develop his software and Braille keyboard by using
        crowdfunding.
      • Option 2: he could sell the intellectual property rights to AssistivIT, a large company
        that develops software.

      Evaluate these two options.                                                                 [8]

      Answers may include:

      Reasons for Umair continuing to develop the software for his Braille keyboard
      using crowdfunding
      • the Braille keyboard and associated software is very much Umair’s vision and he
        may not want to relinquish control of it as he may have an emotional attachment to
        the software
      • using crowdfunding would allow Umair to remain true to his principles such as using
        open source software
      • Umair may be able to develop working relationships with other like-minded
        individuals who may be willing to fund his development work without him having to
        change his vision
      • the use of crowd funding may lead to a relatively cheap product which may help to
        reduce the digital divide between sighted and visually impaired people
      • crowdsourcing may enable more rapid development of the software and overlay
      • Umair would lose any revenue from the software
      • AssistivIT may increase the price of the software and make it inaccessible to many
        of the potential customers Umair was intending his low-tech solution for.

      Reasons for Umair selling the IP for his software and keyboard to AssistivIT
      • Umair may have gone as far as he can with developing the software and overlay
        and
        may realise that investing any more of his time and money in the venture will bring
        little additional benefits
      • developments in both hardware and software may lead to solutions of a similar
        standard being developed more cheaply than Umair will be able to
      • Umair may realise that his strengths lie in the development of innovate solutions
        rather than selling them, so he may have to accept that his head must rule his heart
      • Umair may see the payment from AssistivIT as funding to start his next initiative
      • AssistivIT will be able to provide reliable ongoing funds (e.g. for development /
        maintenance)
      • AssistivIT may have a larger development team that can develop the software more
        rapidly than Umair would be able to do so alone.

      Note to examiners: The bullet points above concentrate mostly on positive reasons for
      each decision. Examiners should give credit for valid reasons expressed as negatives.

                   Award [1] for identifying each file type that could be used to show the potential
                   tracks of Hurricane Irma up to a maximum of [2].

           (ii)    Outline the difference between data and information.                                     [2]

                   Answers may include:
                   • “data” is simply a list of facts or figures/raw data
                   • “information” is “data” which has a context/has been processed/analysed.

                   Award [1] for a definition of either data and information, and [1] for a definition of
                   the other up to a maximum of [2].

           (iii)   Outline why visualization is used to present data.                                       [2]

                   Answers may include:
                   • visualization presents the data in a form that is easily understandable such as
                     images and charts
                   • therefore, it can be presented to audiences who may not have the specialist
                     knowledge required to understand the information in its raw form/aids the
                     prediction of future events

                   • visualization may synthesise the data
                   • so it can be presented in a simplified, yet understandable, manner.

                   Award [1] for identifying a reason why visualisation is used and [1] for a
                   development of that reason up to a maximum of [2].

(b)   (i)    Distinguish between a model and a simulation.                                           [2]

             Answers may include:
             • a model is a simplified version of reality/a program to replicate a real-life
               system
             • a simulation is the operation of the model over time/uses a model to study a
               real-world system under certain conditions/allows the variables within the
               model to be changed over time and a series of “what-if” scenarios can be run
               to see the effects of these changes.

             Award [1] for a definition of either a model or a simulation and [1] for a definition
             of both up to a maximum of [2].

      (ii)   Different weather variables such as wind speed and temperature need to be
             collected in order to predict the track of a hurricane. Wind speed data is sampled
             more frequently than temperature data in a hurricane.

             Explain one reason why wind speed data would be sampled more frequently than
             temperature data in a hurricane.                                                        [2]

             Answers may include:
             • the faster a variable such as wind changes
             • the more frequently it must be sampled.

             • wind speed is the critical and rapidly changing variable in the hurricane
             • therefore, it needs to be sampled as regularly as possible to be able to monitor
               the possible trends

             • sampling the wind speed frequently
             • enables the track of the hurricane and its effects to be predicted more
               accurately.

             • temperature data does not change as rapidly as wind speed
             • therefore the sample rate can be lower.

             Award [1] for identifying each reason why wind speed data would be sampled
             more frequently than temperature data in a hurricane and [1] for a development
             of that reason up to a maximum of [2].

(iii)   Explain why the data collected about Hurricane Irma was not encrypted prior to
        being transmitted.                                                                 [2]

        Answers may include:
        • the data being collected is not sensitive in nature
        • therefore, there is no need to encrypt the data as a data breach would not
          cause an issue

        • as data encryption is not a necessary measure
        • the IT requirements to ensure
          the transmission of data are reduced so resources can be allocated
          elsewhere.

        • not encrypting /decrypting the data will speed up processing
        • in a time-critical scenario.

        • not encrypting the data makes it immediately available to the wider scientific
          community
        • which allows them to improve their hurricane models.

        Award [1] for identifying a reason why the data being collected about the
        hurricane does not need to be encrypted and [1] for a development of that reason
        up to a maximum of [2].

(c)   Panasonic does not make its PWS model available to governments, as the company
      says that doing so would compromise its commercial interests.

      Discuss whether governments should make private companies such as Panasonic
      share their data.                                                                              [8]

      Answers may include:

      It is acceptable for governments to make private companies such as Panasonic
      share their data
      • with its PWS, Panasonic has proved better than the American and European models
          at predicting the path of Hurricane Irma, so Panasonic should share its data, not
          only to help the government, but also to help people, rather than keeping vital
          information private and confidential
      • hurricanes may have devastating consequences for people and property, so in such
          a situation of crisis, the government should have the power and the right to access
          any data, even private data, that can save life
      • there is no issue of individual/personal privacy or confidentiality, so this is not a case
          where the government would infringe on people’s rights or liberty.

      It is not acceptable for governments to make private companies such as
      Panasonic share their data
      • Panasonic has invested a lot of money and other resources (such as engineers’
          time) to develop its PWS model, so it is not fair towards the owners, shareholders
          and even workers that suddenly the government gets access for free to all the data
          collected
          by Panasonic
      • if governments believe they should use data from aircraft and similar sources, like
          Panasonic, they should develop such programmes of weather predictions, rather
          than relying on weather balloons
      • as a principle, governments should respect the private nature of data that belongs to
          independent companies, otherwise this could open the gate to many other cases in
          scientific research (eg with pharmaceutical drugs) where the governments overstep
          their boundaries and their rights
      • if the data from the company is incorrect and there are serious repercussions as a
          result, who is accountable?

     Note to examiners:
     • All part (a) questions are marked using ticks and annotations where appropriate.
     • Part (b) and part (c) are marked using markbands. Use annotations and text comments to
       provide a rationale behind the marks you awarded. Do not use ticks.

     (a)   (i)     Identify two characteristics of an algorithm.                                       [2]

                   Answers may include:
                   • step by step instructions for performing an action or solving a problem
                   • set of rules that that precisely define a sequence of operations
                   • used by computers to process data
                   • order of the steps is important
                   • often includes decision trees
                   • has a finite number of steps.

                   Award [1] for identifying each characteristic of an algorithm up to a maximum
                   of [2].

           (ii)    Identify two types of logic that would be used in a machine learning algorithm.     [2]

                   Answers may include:
                   • Decision trees
                   • If-then rules
                   • Probabilistic rules
                   • Statistical rules
                   • Fuzzy logic
                   • Boolean logic

                   Award [1] for identifying each type of logic a natural language processor may use
                   up to a maximum of [2].

           (iii)   Outline why human testers are required during the testing phase of the automated
                   journalism software.                                                                [2]

                   Answers may include:
                   • humans read the information through a variety of perspectives
                   • so, the text may need to be adapted for a specific audience

                   • the computer is unable to test its own output
                   • so, there is no guarantee it is appropriate

                   • humans are the end-users
                   • so, the text needs to be appropriate for their needs.

                   Award [1] for identifying a reason why human testers are required during the
                   testing phase of the automated journalism software and [1] for a development of
                   that reason up to a maximum of [2].

(b)   Developers of automated journalism software need to understand how human
      journalists work.

      Two methods of gathering this information from journalists are:
      • Interviews
      • Literature searches of existing work

      Analyse these two methods of gathering information about how human journalists work.      [6]

      Answers may include:

      Advantages of interviews
      • allows a more in-depth discussion about the work
      • this may allow the reasons behind the decisions made to be explored in more depth
        than if there is no real time face-to-face interaction
      • may reduce the time required to carry out the investigation as the discussion
        is synchronous
      • may be able to discuss work that is not available in Internet searches or in
        publications the researcher may not be aware of.

      Disadvantages of interviews
      • the quality of answers depends on the quality of the questions
      • can take a long time to conduct
      • collect a lot of information which needs to be analysed.

      Literature search

      Approach 1 – using a literature search to find out about what experts are saying
      about how people write

      Advantages
      • can be done objectively
      • a literature search would offer multiple points of view
      • the journalist would be unable to influence the researcher by focusing the discussion
        on areas they want to discuss
      • can be carried out at a convenient time for the researcher
      • may be easier to analyse the information gathered as analytics may be available, for
        example, using comparison features in software such as Word.

      Disadvantages
      • does not allow for follow-up questions.

      Approach 2 – using a literature search to analyze samples of how journalists
      write

      Advantages
      • analysis of the article can provide information to teach the software how to generate
        similar kinds of work

      Disadvantages
      • variety of styles and approaches make it difficult to generalize
      • This kind of analysis takes a great deal of time

        Candidates may take either approach one or approach two when discussing the literature
        search. Both are acceptable.

(c)   To what extent should newspapers rely on automated journalism software
      to create stories?                                                                          [8]

      Answers may include:

      Reasons why automated journalism software should be used
      • the paper can generate many more articles using this method
      • articles can be generated faster – this is important for breaking news
      • the error rate is much lower in some instances
      • it allows papers to reach a lot of niche audiences therefore increasing its reach.
      • it can give reporters more time to do in-depth analysis
      • it can provide information ie data analysis that can enable reporters to see trends,
        for example, in elections
      • it can provide background information for their reports
      • it can free up reporters for stories that require human thought
      • it can eliminate some of the more mundane/boring jobs and allow reporters to focus
        on more thought-provoking stories – this may improve the quality of their writing
      • it can’t deal with subjective material so reporter’s jobs are not at risk.

      Reasons why automated journalism software should not be used
      • it takes time and money to train the software
      • robots can provide statistics but not analysis
      • robots can’t provide the human perspective that makes articles interesting.
      • robots can create and promulgate “fake news”
      • robots can’t discover news stories; they are restricted to information available online
      • robots are designed by human and humans make mistakes so robots can make
        mistakes too
      • the accuracy of the underlying data still matters
      • newspapers will need to disclose what they are doing
      • data will have to be constantly checked to make sure it is up to date
      • journalists, especially inexperienced ones who are still learning will lose jobs.

                   a maximum of [2].

           (ii)    The developers of the AI software created a data flow diagram as part of the
                   development process.

                   Identify two features of a data flow diagram.                                            [2]

                   Answers may include:
                   • visualizes the flow of data through an information system
                   • does not show types of relationships between types of data
                   • shows type of input and output
                   • shows where the data will be stored
                   • shows where the data will come from and go to.

                   Award [1] for identifying each feature of a data flow diagram up to a maximum
                   of [2].

           (iii)   The developers of the AI software carried out an economic feasibility study.

                   Identify two other feasibility studies that should have been carried out at this time.   [2]

                   Answers may include:

 (b)    The developers of the AI software decided to use machine learning instead of an
        expert system.

        Explain this decision.                                                                       [6]

        Answers may include:

        Reasons why machine learning is suitable
        • when exposed to large amounts of data, machine learning can provide new and
          better results
        • machine learning is not restricted to inference rules so it is more flexible and allows
          for complexity
        • machine learning does not rely on exact matches.

        Reasons why expert systems are not suitable
        • inference rules are based on two possible outcomes, “Yes” or “No”
        • inference rules are based on exact matches rather than a range of possible
          responses
        • expert systems can fail when the situation isn’t in their knowledge base
        • a chain of if/then rules is too restrictive and does not allow for complexity which is

(c)   To what extent should the decisions of judges be based on algorithms rather than
      their knowledge and experience?                                                             [8]

      Answers may include:

      Arguments for using algorithms
      • we don’t know what is going on inside a judge’s mind so it’s a black box too
      • judges can be biased
      • this would be a more standardized process ie more uniform and logical
      • risk assessment tools could lead to less incarceration and less crime
      • this software could be used in conjunction with a judge’s decision ie to provide
        guidance
      • it could be one factor among many ie not the determinative factor
      • the software could be used to identify outliers ie people very likely to commit a crime
        or people very unlikely to commit a crime
      • the software could be based on the experience of many judges/experienced experts
        in this field, so it could be more reliable that the judgement of a single person.

      Arguments against using algorithms
      • the algorithms should not be “black boxes” ie they should be revealed
      • it’s almost impossible to define “fairness,” so how can the algorithm be “fair”
      • biases could be incorporated into the software because of the attitudes of the
        human beings who created it
      • the value of the algorithm depends on the data it uses and criminal justice data is
        often unreliable
      • algorithms look at group behaviour not individual behaviour
      • algorithms don’t look at how different factors interact (at least not yet).

     (a)   (i)     Sally uses pattern recognition to tell the difference between the burgers and
                   the buns.

                   Identify two characteristics of pattern recognition.                            [2]

                   Answers may include:
                   • uses training data
                   • learns from examples
                   • once trained the software can identify new examples of the items it has
                     “learned”
                   • gives an estimate of the accuracy of the identification
                   • recognizes shapes within an image.

                   Award [1] for identifying each characteristic of pattern recognition up to
                   a maximum of [2].

           (ii)    Identify two characteristics of machine learning.                               [2]

                   Answers may include:
                   • built on the examination of large amounts of data
                   • learns from examples
                   • able to react to new inputs
                   • builds a general model from the training examples
                   • learns without human intervention.

                   Award [1] for identifying each characteristic of machine learning up to
                   a maximum of [2].

           (iii)   Prototypes will be created during the development of Sally.

                   Identify two reasons why a prototype would be used.                             [2]

                   Answers may include:
                   • show the client what to expect
                   • reduce revising the project
                   • test the design (allows clients to make changes)
                   • clarify costs
                   • fail cheaply and early
                   • eliminate approaches that don’t work
                   • get feedback to help improve the product.

                   Award [1] for identifying each reason why a prototype would be used up to
                   a maximum of [2].

(b)   The developers of Sally can choose to use a Pert chart or a Gantt chart to guide
      the project.

      Analyse these two options.                                                                     [6]

      Answers may include:
      Advantages of a Pert chart
      • easy identification of order of precedence of the activities
      • shows relationships between tasks
      • easy identification of the critical path
      • shows early start, late start and slack for each activity
      • can show slack time so resources can be moved to more critical activities
      • shows which tasks must be completed in sequence
      • shows which tasks can be done in parallel I.e. not part of a sequence.

      Disadvantages of a Pert chart
      • charts can be very complicated
      • can underestimate completion time particularly if delays occur
      • inaccurate time estimates can make the entire plan incorrect
      • can be difficult to interpret, especially with complex projects.

      Advantages of a Gantt chart
      • use of a Gantt chart visualizes the process eg helps to maintain organization
      • it illustrates which tasks must be completed before the next one can begin
      • task can be viewed against a calendar showing start and end dates
      • resources required for tasks can be linked to the tasks on the chart
      • shows how long a project should take to be completed.

      Disadvantages of a Gantt chart
      • it’s a linear i.e. step-by-step process so it is very inflexible. Changes are difficult to
         make/errors are difficult to correct
      • changes could result in significant costs
      • chart can be too simplistic i.e. does not provide enough detail for a complex project
         i.e. this chart leaves out the construction of the database
      • it is difficult to show where there is slack time in the project
      • inaccurate time estimates can make the entire plan incorrect
      • on a large project they can become unmanageable
      • the time for each task must be estimated before the chart can be completed.

(c)   The initial version of Sally follows a fixed set of procedures, and can only make
      hamburgers. Bruce Velison is already thinking about the second version of Sally
      (version 2.0). He would like Sally 2.0 to make a variety of foods. He would also like to
      use machine learning to create these foods and cloud computing to connect all 5000
      Sallys with each other.

      Evaluate Bruce’s decision to improve Sally.                                                [8]

      Answers may include:

      Reason why this is not a good idea
      • could be expensive, i.e. the initial cost of the robots
      • will require staff to clean and repair
      • customers might react against the food being prepared by a robot ie lacks the
        human touch
      • could increase the price of the food to cover the cost of the robots
      • may eliminate jobs thus increasing unemployment
      • staff could be blamed if Sally breaks down or doesn’t provide what is expected
      • if a robot fails, it will require time and staff to fix it
      • the variety of dishes could be limited as the robot still needs to be programmed
        for each one
      • since all Sallys are connected to the same network, security issues could occur.
      • Bruce needs to deal with/decommission the old Sally 1.0s.
      • may require more staff training if Sally 2.0 is not user friendly/intuitive
      • might need to hire more technicians as the technology of Sally 2.0 is more complex
      • Sally 2.0 may rely on the internet access.

      Reasons why this is a good idea
      • better quality food as it will be consistent
      • faster, more efficient service because the robot can work faster than people
      • saves money on staffing, etc
      • might attract new customers who are interested in the robots
      • could lead to better, new products
      • will make the staff’s job easier
      • will provide new jobs in cleaning and repairing the robot
      • kitchen work is dangerous so robots help eliminate the chance of being injured
      • connecting all 5000 Sallys will make it very easy to share new programming
        for new products
      • connecting all 5000 Sallys will make it easy to share what one robot has learned
        with all the others
      • machine learning will enable Sally to learn from its mistakes
      • because no employees touch the burgers, they will be more sanitary
      • turnover in the fast food industry is huge; this could solve that problem
      • storing data in the cloud ensures that it is secure even if the Sallys break down.
