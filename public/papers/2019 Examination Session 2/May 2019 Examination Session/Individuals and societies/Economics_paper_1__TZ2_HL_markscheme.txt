Microeconomics

1.   (a)   Using an appropriate externalities diagram, explain why a government might decide
           to impose a price floor on a demerit good.                                              [10]

           Answers may include:
            definition of demerit good, price floor
            diagram to show a negative externalities of consumption diagram with a price floor
             (minimum price) shown
            explanation of why a government might place a price floor above the equilibrium
             price in the market for a demerit good, in terms of negative externality arguments,
             and reducing consumption
            examples of price floors being imposed on demerit goods in practice.

           NB If students attempt to provide two different diagrams, one for a price floor and
           one for negative externalities, they should be credited in the same way one diagram
           might be.

     (b)   Examine the role of barriers to entry in making monopoly a less desirable market
           structure than perfect competition.                                                      [15]

           Answers may include:
            definition of market structure, monopoly, perfect competition, barriers to entry
            diagram to illustrate economic/abnormal profit under monopoly in the short and long
             run, diagram to show abnormal profit in the short run, normal profit in the long run
             under perfect competition
            explanation that without barriers to entry, monopolies could not earn
             economic/abnormal profit in the long run, whereas firms in perfect competition can
             earn only normal profit in the long run because of the absence of barriers to entry
            examples of barriers to entry sustaining monopolies
            synthesis and evaluation (examine).

           output, abuse of monopoly power.

           and the inflation rate.                                                                     [15]

            explanation of the view in terms of the short-run Phillips curve relationship
            examples of such a trade-off and/or absence of such a trade-off
            synthesis and evaluation (discuss).

           Discussion may include: the view that there is no trade-off in the long-run (the long-run
           Phillips curve), the importance of supply-side improvements to the economy in

4.   (a)   Explain the various phases of the business cycle.                                         [10]

           Answers may include:
            definition of business cycle
            diagram to show the different phases of the business cycle and possible trend line
            explanation of the business cycle in terms of the different short-run phases ie boom,
             recession, depression/slump and recovery, and long-term trend
            examples of specific countries being in different phases of the business cycle.

           NB Examiners should be aware of variations in the business cycle diagrams
           candidates might draw and should be flexible in crediting the diagrams drawn
           by candidates.

     (b)   Discuss the view that economies will always return to the full employment level of
           output in the long run.                                                                  [15]

           Answers may include:
            definition of full employment, full employment level of output
            diagrams to show the two different views of the economy
            explanation of the monetarist/new classical view that the economy will always return
             to the full employment level of output in the long run, and long-term trend and its
             meaning as potential output
            examples of situations where economies either have or have not returned to full
             employment in the long run
            synthesis and evaluation (discuss).

           Discussion may include: consideration of the Keynesian view that an economy can
           remain stuck in a deflationary gap, consideration of the role of government,
           consideration of the word “always”.
