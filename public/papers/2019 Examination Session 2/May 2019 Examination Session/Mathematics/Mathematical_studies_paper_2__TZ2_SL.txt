     An archaeological site is to be made accessible for viewing by the public. To do this,
     archaeologists built two straight paths from point A to point B and from point B to point C as
     shown in the following diagram. The length of path AB is 185 m, the length of path BC is 250 m,
     and angle AB̂C is 125.
