     Olivia’s house consists of four vertical walls and a sloping roof made from two rectangles.
     The height, CD, from the ground to the base of the roof is 4.5 m.

     The base angles of the roof are AB̂ C = 27 and AĈB = 26 .

     Each panel is 1.6 m long and 0.95 m wide. All the panels must be arranged in uniform rows,
     with the shorter edge of each panel parallel to AB or AC. Each panel must be at least
     0.3 m from the edge of the roof and the top of the roof, AF.

     (c)   Find the maximum number of complete panels that can be fitted to the whole roof.              [3]

     Olivia estimates that the solar panels will cover an area of 29 m2.

     Olivia investigates arranging the panels, such that the longer edge of each panel is parallel
     to AB or AC.

     Bridges are located where the highway crosses the river.

     (c)   Find the coordinates of the bridges relative to the centre of Orangeton.                  [4]

     A straight road is built from the centre of Orangeton, due north, to connect the town to
     the highway.

     (d)   Find the distance from the centre of Orangeton to the point at which the road meets
           the highway.                                                                              [2]

     This straight road crosses the highway and then carries on due north.

     (e)   State whether the straight road will ever cross the river. Justify your answer.           [2]

     John purchases a new bicycle for 880 US dollars (USD) and pays for it with a Canadian
     credit card. There is a transaction fee of 4.2 % charged to John by the credit card company
     to convert this purchase into Canadian dollars (CAD).

     The exchange rate is 1 USD = 1.25 CAD .

     (a)   Calculate, in CAD, the total amount John pays for the bicycle.                            [3]

     John insures his bicycle with a US company. The insurance company produces the following
     table for the bicycle’s value during each year.

                                  Year     Value of the bicycle (USD)

                                   1st                 880
                                   2nd                 704

                                    …                    …

     The values of the bicycle form a geometric sequence.

     (b)   Find the value of the bicycle during the 5th year. Give your answer to two decimal places.[3]

     (c)   Calculate, in years, when the bicycle value will be less than 50 USD.[2]

     During the 1st year John pays 120 USD to insure his bicycle. Each year the amount he pays
     to insure his bicycle is reduced by 3.50 USD.

     (d)   Find the total amount John has paid to insure his bicycle for the first 5 years.          [3]

     John purchased the bicycle in 2008.

     (e)   Justify why John should not insure his bicycle in 2019.[3]
