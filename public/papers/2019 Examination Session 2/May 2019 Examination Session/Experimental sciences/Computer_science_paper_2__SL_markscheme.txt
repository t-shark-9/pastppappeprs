Subject details:        Computer science SL paper 2 markscheme

Mark allocation

Candidates are required to answer all questions in one Option. Total 45 marks.

General

A markscheme often has more specific points worthy of a mark than the total allows. This is intentional.
Do not award more than the maximum marks allowed for that part of a question.

When deciding upon alternative answers by candidates to those given in the markscheme, consider the
following points:

• Each statement worth one point has a separate line and the end is signified by means of
  a semi-colon (;).

• An alternative answer or wording is indicated in the markscheme by a “/”; either wording can be
  accepted.

• Words in ( … ) in the markscheme are not necessary to gain the mark.

• If the candidate’s answer has the same meaning or can be clearly interpreted as being the same as
  that in the markscheme then award the mark.

• Mark positively. Give candidates credit for what they have achieved and for what they have got
  correct, rather than penalizing them for what they have not achieved or what they have got wrong.

• Remember that many candidates are writing in a second language; be forgiving of minor linguistic
  slips. In this subject effective communication is more important than grammatical accuracy.

• Occasionally, a part of a question may require a calculation whose answer is required for subsequent
  parts. If an error is made in the first part then it should be penalized. However, if the incorrect answer
  is used correctly in subsequent parts then follow through marks should be awarded. Indicate this
  with “FT”.


General guidance

 Issue          Guidance
 Answering      • In the case of an “identify” question, read all answers and mark positively up to the
 more than        maximum marks. Disregard incorrect answers.
 the quantity   • In the case of a “describe” question, which asks for a certain number of facts
 of               eg “describe two kinds”, mark the first two correct answers. This could include two
 responses        descriptions, one description and one identification, or two identifications.
 prescribed     • In the case of an “explain” question, which asks for a specified number of
 in the           explanations eg “explain two reasons …”, mark the first two correct answers.
 questions        This could include two full explanations, one explanation, one partial explanation etc.

     (c)   Award [1 max].
           Seeking the truth;                                                                [1]

     (d)   Award [4 max].
           Award [1] for selection of both Publisher_Name and Book_Title from the two

           Award [1] for making INNER JOIN of the Publisher_Name from both tables-
           Publisher and Author.
           Award [1] for the correct test ON Author_Num from both tables-Author and Book.
           Award [1] for the correct test of equity of Publisher_Name.

           SELECT Publisher.Publisher_Name, Book.Book_Title FROM Author
           INNER JOIN Book ON PUBLISHER. Publisher_Name =
           Author.Publisher_Name, ON Author.Author_Num = Book.Author_Num
           WHERE Publisher.Publisher_Name = "Orlando Crux";                                  [4]

     (e)   Award [2 max].
           Helps the searching of a family name for example rather than a “like” name
           search;
           So, making data into the smallest possible unit helps quicker searches;           [2]

     (f)   Award [2 max].
           Each user sees a fixed view of the data;
           This may include visible changes made by the user / the user's own transactions
           and transactions of other users;                                                  [2]

     (g)   Award [2 max].
           When a field value changes multiple occurrences must be updated;
           For example, if a publisher moves, we’ll need to change the values for City and
           Country in multiple records;
           Problem occurs if we forget to change the values in any of the records;
           The database would then have data inconsistency;                                  [2]

2.   (a)   Award [3 max].
           The ability of a database to allow multiple teachers to affect multiple transactions;
           Allowing concurrent processing while ensuring transaction isolation;
           Thus, ensuring the update of one teacher does not affect the update of another
           teacher;
           While one transaction (by a teacher) is accessing a resource from a shared
           folder, it places a lock, an access restriction, on the resource, controlling the level
           of access allowed by another transaction by another teacher;                              [3]

     (b)   Award [4 max].
           Award [1] for identifying a way of maintaining data security and [1] for a
           development up to [2 max]
           Mark as [2] and [2]

           Minimizing permissions;
           Restrict users to have permission only to the means to do their job. Some can
           view, modify and insert some only view etc;

           Auditing changes;
           Log changes made to teachers and permissions through auditing. This gives a
           trail to follow should you have problems. Without authorization no one gets grant
           of permissions;

           Minimizing table access;
           Isolate the teachers from the data tables they do not need / Create views and
           user defined functions to support user access requirements and not give access
           to the tables;                                                                            [4]

     (c)   (i)   Award [2 max].
                 Award [1] for identifying a way of maintaining data security and [1] for a
                 development up to [2 max].

                 Deferred update;
                 does not physically update the database on disk until a transaction has
                 reached its commit point/if a transaction fails before reaching its commit
                 point, it will not have changed the database in any way so UNDO is not
                 required;

                 Shadow paging;
                 When a page is to be modified, a shadow page is allocated in which
                 changes are made;
                 When it is ready to become durable, all pages that refer to original are
                 updated to refer new replacement page;

                 Back-up;
                 Back-up copies of the entire database is done to ensure the database is at
                 the most updated version of the original;                                           [2]

(ii)   Award [3 max].
       Award [1] for the method, award [1] for the explanation and [1] for the
       example up to [3 max].

       Data masking or data obfuscation;
       is the process of hiding original data with random characters;
       eg: suppressing certain characters in the student address, student id etc;

       Data encryption;
       Conversion of data into non-readable gibberish creates highly secure
       results such as scrambling the student_ID;
       The only way to gain access to the data is to unlock it with a key or
       password which only those authorized can access;                             [3]

3.   (a)   Award [4 max].
           Applications interacting with the database are minimally affected;
           When a fully normalized database structure is extended, to accommodate new
           types of data, database structure can remain largely or entirely unchanged;
           So, the applications interacting with the database are minimally affected;

           Key dependent;
           Every non-key column in every table is directly dependent on the key, the whole
           key and nothing but the key;
           Thus making reduced redundancies, lesser anomalies and better efficiencies;
           Mark as [2] and [2].                                                                 [4]

     (b)   Award [2 max].
           For First Normal Form, each attribute value should be atomic;
           In the given example product_Num, Pro_Name, Unit_Price and Qty is
           multivalued / All 4 tuples shown have multiple values in their first 4 attributes;   [2]

     (c)   Award [8 max].
           Award [1] for each correct table up to [4 max].
           Award [1] for each correct primary key up to [4 max].

     (d)   Award [2 max].
           You can enter foreign keys that do not match the corresponding primary key in
           the related table;
           This could cause a lot of problems such as mismatched customer data and
           mismatched transaction records;

           Cascading update;
           If the primary key for a record in the Managers table changes, all corresponding
           records in the Employees table are modified;

           Cascading delete;
           If a record in the Managers table is deleted, all corresponding records in the
           Employees table are deleted;                                                         [2]

     (e)   Award [2 max].
           The combination of the two provides unique identifiers for the records of the
           table;
           And that there is no single attribute that is able to uniquely identify a record;
           In a manner that will not lead to potential duplication of records;
           It identifies exactly one record of the table, then that record shows the single
           value of each of the non-key attributes;
           That is associated with the unique combination of the key attributes;                [2]

           input values;
           To look at the predicted spread of outcomes over time (consider the use of
           simulation in the analysis of queues);

           A simulation is considered to be a representation of a model over time;
           This means that the simulation can be used over a longer period of the
           development life cycle;

           The characters are defined as mathematical models;
           They will need rendering to give a 3D effect;

           Rendering for non-interactive media such as animations is a much slower
           process than for interactive media/games;
           Rendering times for individual frames may vary from a few seconds to days
           depending on the complexity of the scene;
           Rendered frames are stored to a hard disk and then transferred to other media
           for playback;
           3D rendering is computationally resource hungry;
           Computer processing power has increased rapidly and greatly over the years;
           Allowing a much higher degree of photorealism / realistic rendering;              [6]

           Lossy compression
           Reduces the file-size by removing some of the data in the file;
           Once removed, the data cannot be recovered;
           This generally results in a loss of quality (eg picture resolution, audio frequency
           range);
           Files compressed using lossy compression are used in their compressed form
           (eg images, video, audio);

           Lossless compression
           Reduces file size by looking for repeated patterns of data / redundant data and
           replacing those with a single shorter "token";
           The tokens are associated with the data they represent by using a dictionary
           added to the file;
           Flies must be decompressed before they can be used;
           Decompression software reads the dictionary and replaces all the tokens with the
           original data They represent;
           Files do not lose any of the data they contain when compressed / decompressed;

      Lossless compression reduces file size while preserving all the data;
      Once decompressed, the pdf document will contain all the data in the original
      document;
      Some pdf software allows for the automatic lossless compression of the
      document / the developers would not have to apply compression retrospectively;
      It would be hard for a lossy compression algorithm to distinguish between data
      that can be removed (eg reducing the resolution of the images) and data that is
      necessary for the pdf documents to make sense (eg parts of the text);
      Using lossy compression may result in an unusable/unreadable document;
      Accept answers that focus on why lossy compression would be unsuitable for the
      pdf files.

                  to defined rules;
                  This process continues until either an IP address is passed back to the
                  starting DNS or an error message is returned;
                  The IP address (or error message) is sent back to the client that initiated

           Multiple copies of all or part of the data can be kept at different sites;
           This ensures that there is no single point of failure;
           and the redundant data helps to ensure against data loss;

           Different computers on the grid can use different analysis and data visualization
           tools;
           This allows scientists to run whatever analysis tools best suit their own
           specialism/area of interest;
           Rather than being limited to the tools provided by CERN;

           Analysis can be performed using distributed processing time/capacity;
           This reduces load and/or reliance on a centralized system;
           Allowing a greater number of processes to be run concurrently;

           Computers on the grid can be in multiple time zones;
           This gives scientists more equitable access to data;
           And facilitates round-the-clock monitoring and the availability of expert support;

           Resources can be distributed across the world rather than being held in one
           country;
           This may attract funding from governments for their own locally-based research;
           As they may see the benefits of international cooperation;

(c)   Award [6 max].
      Benefits of CC licensing:
      CERN want their experimental results to be freely accessible (within specified
      limits);
      Allows for the more rapid dissemination of data/information while preventing
      people from repackaging them and selling them as a commercial product;
      May further the advance of scientific knowledge / be seen as an altruistic gesture;
      No need to contact CERN about using the work / allows CERN to focus on their
      primary function, ie scientific research;

      Limitations of copyright:
      May be impossible to enforce;
      Enforcement would require significant costs associated with hiring of lawyers etc;
      It may not be possible to find all cases where work has been used without
      copyright permissions;
      Plagiarism may occur outside of Switzerland where different copyright laws may
      exist;

             Include a flag “swapped”;
             That can help stop the outer loop if there is a pass through the inner loop
             with no swap;
             Limit the inner loop by deducting the outer loop counter;
             So that the sorted elements are no longer compared;                           [4]

(d)   Award [6 max].
      Award [1] for correctly instantiating variables.
      Award [1] for correct loop condition (count < 8).
      Award [1] for checking for a 0 time (or null entry).
      Award [1] for correctly copying.
      Award [1] for incrementing count in the right place.
      Award [1] for incrementing k in the right place.

      Example answers:
      int k = 0;
      int count = 0;
      while(count < 8) && (k < 16){
        if(tempSwim[k] != 0){
           finals.swimmer[count] = tempSwim[k];
           count++;
        }
        k++;
      }

      Note: Do not penalize for not including loop condition (k < 16)                      [6]
