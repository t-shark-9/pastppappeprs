yy The Coral Triangle is an area of approximately 6 million square kilometres in South-east Asia.
yy It is the most biodiverse marine ecosystem in the world.
yy Its habitats include coral reefs, seagrass beds and mangroves.
yy The Coral Triangle provides a range of ecosystem goods and services, and supports the livelihoods of
   over 120 million people.
yy It provides an important spawning area to the largest tuna fishery in the world.
yy In 2014, capture fisheries within the Coral Triangle were valued at US$9.9 billion representing over
   10 % of the world market.
yy Income in the area is also generated through a growing recreation and tourist industry.

Some ecosystems are very effective at absorbing carbon dioxide from the atmosphere and storing this
carbon either within their living biomass or in the soil below ground.

            Figure 7: Threats to biodiversity and ecosystems within the Coral Triangle

yy Coral reefs and mangroves in the Coral Triangle have declined by over 40 % since the 1970s.
yy Over 85 % of coral reefs are under threat from population growth and human activity.
yy Mangroves have commonly been removed to make way for agriculture, aquaculture or urban
   development.
yy Increase in unsustainable fishing practices, because of the demand for marine resources, has led
   to the decline of many species, such as bigeye tuna (Thunnus obesus) and yellowfin tuna (Thunnus
   albacares).
yy Destructive fishing methods that impact marine habitats have been used throughout the region, such
   as use of dynamite and cyanide.
yy Demand for wildlife goods such as turtle products and shark fins (used to make shark-fin soup) has
   caused a reduction in population numbers of some species.
yy Land-based pollution from agriculture, logging, mining and urban development has damaged habitats
   within the Coral Triangle.

Large-scale tourism development also threatens the Coral Triangle through:
  ◦◦ pollution produced by tourists, such as sewage effluent, plastic waste materials
  ◦◦ coral trampling by snorkelers and divers
  ◦◦ physical damage caused by boat anchors ripping up corals and seagrass
  ◦◦ stress to marine wildlife caused by tourists following them too closely
  ◦◦ collection of wildlife souvenirs, such as corals, shellfish or turtle shells.

Climate change is a major threat to the Coral Triangle. The World Wide Fund for Nature (WWF)
estimates that at current rates of global temperature increase, most coral reefs could be destroyed
by 2050.

                         Figure 8(a): Conservation within the Coral Triangle

yy The Coral Triangle Initiative on Coral Reefs, Fisheries and Food Security (CTI-CFF) is an agreement
   between all six nations in the area with the objectives of:
   ◦◦ ensuring food security and a sustainable livelihood of residents of the Coral Triangle
   ◦◦ protecting the unique ecosystem and marine species within the Coral Triangle.
yy Conservation projects in the Coral Triangle involve collaboration between national governments,
   regional organisations, non-governmental organisations, private companies and local communities.
yy Popular approaches to encourage sustainable use of the sea and its resources include creation of
   Marine Protected Areas (MPAs) and networks of Locally Managed Marine Areas (LMMAs).
yy MPAs are usually managed by national and local government whereas LMMAs are more likely to be
   managed by the local community.
yy These designated areas are often classified according to their use or the restrictions placed on them,
   such as “no-take zones” where no fishing is allowed or “tourism zones” that can be used for recreation
   but where other activities such as fishing are banned.
yy Some zones allow restricted activity, such as use by local fishermen using only traditional fishing
   methods or during certain times of the year.
yy Research has shown that over time in a well-managed MPA there is an increase in fish size, fish
   numbers and overall biodiversity.
yy There are currently over 1000 MPAs within the Coral Triangle.
yy The Coral Triangle Initiative aims to designate 20 % of each of the main habitats within the Coral
   Triangle as MPAs by 2020.
