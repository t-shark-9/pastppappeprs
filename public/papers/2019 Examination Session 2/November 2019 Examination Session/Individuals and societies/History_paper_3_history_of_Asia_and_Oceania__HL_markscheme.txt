Apply the markbands that provide the “best fit” to the responses given and award credit wherever it is
possible to do so. If an answer indicates that the demands of the question are understood and
addressed but that not all implications are considered (for example, compare or contrast; reasons
or significance; methods or success), then examiners should not be afraid of using the full range of
marks allowed for by the markscheme. Responses that offer good coverage of some of the criteria
should be rewarded accordingly. If you are uncertain about the content/accuracy of a candidate’s
work please contact your team leader.

Section 1: Trade and exchange: The Silk Road in the medieval world (750–1500)

1.   Discuss the reasons for the development of the Silk Road under the Tang Dynasty.

     The question requires that candidates offer a considered and balanced review of the reasons why
     the Silk Road developed under the Tang Dynasty. Candidates may refer to the military strength of
     the Tang Dynasty and how successful military campaigns at this time had led to the acquisition of
     more land and the establishment of stable trade routes. The Tang rulers were also more open to
     developing relations with other countries, assimilated foreign ideas and welcomed foreign
     merchants. Candidates may also consider factors not directly linked to the Tang Dynasty that led to
     the development of the Silk Road. For example, the states to the west of the Tang Empire were
     relatively stable at this time so they were also more open to developing trade routes.


2.   Discuss the impact of the Silk Road on the transmission of religious ideas.

     The question requires that candidates offer a considered and balanced review of the impact of the
     Silk Road on the transmission of religious ideas. Candidates may refer to how traders built shrines
     and temples of their own faiths along the Silk Road to practise their own beliefs. Missionaries also
     accompanied the caravans on the Silk Road and would spread their own religious beliefs and
     make converts. Buddhism was the first of the faiths to use the Silk Road to extend its reach from
     India to China. The Silk Road also increased conversions to Islam with Muslim traders spreading
     their faith. Eastern Christians succeeded in major conversions between the 7th and 11th centuries
     and were seen as a faith of foreign travelling merchants.

Section 2: Japan in the Age of the Samurai (1180–1333)

3.   “The establishment of the Kamakura Shogunate was the most significant consequence of the
     Gempei War.” Discuss.

     The question requires that candidates offer a considered and balanced review of the statement
     that the establishment of the Kamakura Shogunate was the most significant consequence of the
     Gempei War. Candidates may argue the war resulted in real power now being in the hands of the
     Kamakura Shogunate and the gradual decline of the emperor. Emperors would continue to rule
     Japan for the next 650 years but without any real political or military power. Candidates may
     challenge the statement by arguing that the war also led to the rise of the samurai, a warrior class,
     which would be highly influential in society. The dominance of the capital was also reduced and
     more power given to provincial leaders to collect taxes and manage these areas. Candidates may
     agree, partly agree or disagree with the statement.


4.   “Samurai women were influential in Japanese society.” To what extent do you agree with this
     statement?

     The question requires that candidates consider the merits or otherwise of the statement that
     samurai women were influential in Japanese society. Candidates may refer to how samurai women
     were held in high regard. Samurai women could hold significant influence over the political process
     and were sometimes used as negotiators and peacemakers. Samurai women were often the wives
     of the daimyo and would be entrusted with the protection of the castle during the daimyo’s
     absence. Samurai women were highly trained in martial arts and did engage in battles, particularly
     in the defence of their castles. Candidates may challenge the statement by arguing that samurai
     women were only a small group in society and few took part in battles. While other relevant factors,
     for example the influence of samurai men, may be referred to, the bulk of the response will remain
     on the issue raised in the question. Candidates may agree, partly agree or disagree with the
     statement.

Section 3: Exploration, trade and interaction in East Asia and South-East Asia (1405–1700)

5.   “The voyages of Zheng He were the most important reason for China’s increased overseas trade.”
     Discuss.

     The question requires that candidates offer a considered and balanced review of the statement
     that the voyages of Zheng He were the most important reason for China’s increased overseas
     trade. Candidates may refer to how Zheng led seven naval expeditions throughout South-East
     Asia, India, Arabia and even reaching the coast of Africa. Zheng was a Muslim convert and this
     helped him to establish good relations with Muslim trading communities. Candidates may
     challenge the statement by arguing that for the most part Zheng was not discovering new trade
     routes and, in fact, his fleets would use well mapped routes that had been used since the Han
     Dynasty. Also, much of the crew on these ships were military personnel, which candidates may
     argue suggests these expeditions were more about political control than trade. Candidates may
     agree, partly agree or disagree with the statement.


6.   Evaluate the impact of missionaries on Japanese society and trade.

     The question requires that candidates make an appraisal of the impact of missionaries on
     Japanese society and trade, weighing up the positive and negative impact. Candidates may refer
     to how the arrival of the Portuguese Catholics marked the beginning of organised Christianity in
     Japan. Japanese converts to Christianity were encouraged to take Portuguese names and adopt
     western culture. This led to a fear that the missionaries were undermining Japanese society and
     culture. The Catholic missions carried out trade to pay for their missionary work. They became
     involved in the silk trade, but their corrupt nature led to their eventual banning from Japan.
     Candidates may offer equal coverage of society and trade, or they may prioritize their evaluation of
     one. However, both aspects will be a feature of the response. Both the positive and negative
     impact must be clearly indicated but there does not need to be an equal focus on each.
                                                  –7–                 N19/3/HISTX/HP3/ENG/TZ0/OC/M



Section 4: The rise and fall of the Mughal Empire (1526–1712)

7.   “Military policies rather than economic policies consolidated Mughal rule.” Discuss.

     The question requires that candidates offer a considered and balanced review of the statement
     that Mughal rule was consolidated by its military rather than economic policies. Candidates may
     offer equal coverage of military and economic policies, or they may prioritize their discussion of
     one of these aspects. However, both will be a feature of the response. Candidates may refer to the
     military successes of Babur at the battles of Panipat and Khanua and his use of artillery, but they
     may also discuss Humayun’s military defeat and exile by Sher Shah. Economic policies may
     include the taxes collected by Babur and Humayun such as the land taxes as well as the Jizya tax.
     While other relevant factors, for example Babur’s and Humayun’s administrative policies, may be
     referred to, the bulk of the response will remain on the issue raised in the question. Candidates
     may agree, partly agree or disagree with the statement.


8.   Discuss the role of internal factors in the decline of the Mughal Empire up to 1712.

     The question requires that candidates offer a considered and balanced review of the role of
     internal factors in the decline of the Mughal Empire up to 1712. Candidates may refer to
     inadequate leadership, internal rebellions, weak succession plans, drain of the treasury and
     infighting among the nobility. Many ambitious provincial governors like Nizam-ul-Mulk and Ali Vardi
     Khan declared themselves independent. Aurangzeb’s policies of religious persecution led to revolts
     by the Jats, Marathas, Sikhs and Rajputs. Aurangzeb’s Deccan Policy drained the finances. While
     other relevant factors, for example the arrival of the British and the military growth of the Sikhs,
     may be referred to, the bulk of the response will remain on the issue raised in the question.

Section 5: Colonialism and the development of nationalism in South-East Asia (c1750–1914)

9.    Discuss the factors that led to the formation of French Indo-China in 1887.

      The question requires that candidates offer a considered and balanced review of the factors that
      led to the formation of French Indo-China in 1887. Candidates may refer to the French desire to
      colonise Indo-China in order to benefit from the country’s natural resources. They also needed
      treaty ports for trade and markets for finished goods. There was competition from other European
      powers to establish strongholds in Asia. France was also heavily involved in Vietnam in the
      nineteenth century, protecting the work of the Paris Foreign Missions Society. While other relevant
      factors, for example the fact that the Cambodian King Norodom had requested the establishment
      of a French protectorate, may be referred to, the bulk of the response will remain on the issue
      raised in the question.


10.   “External rather than internal factors maintained Siamese independence.” To what extent do you
      agree with this statement?

      The question requires that candidates consider the merits or otherwise of the statement that it was
      external rather than internal factors that maintained Siamese independence. Candidates may offer
      equal coverage of external and internal factors or they may prioritize their assessment of one of
      these aspects. However, both aspects will be a feature of the response. Candidates may refer to
      the fact that it suited both British and French interests in the region to maintain an independent
      Siam. When the Europeans came, King Mongkut ceded portions of present day Cambodia, Burma,
      Vietnam and Malaysia to them, keeping the Europeans satisfied and the heart of his kingdom
      intact. Internally, Siam was well governed and avoided the internal splits that destroyed some other
      kingdoms in the Age of Imperialism. The Siamese kings, when faced with European expansion,
      started to morph their state into the model of European nation-states for example, they centralised
      their administration in Bangkok. Candidates may agree, partly agree or disagree with the
      statement.

Section 6: India, Afghanistan and Burma (1750–1919)

11.   Compare and contrast the impact of the policies of Bentinck and Dalhousie in India.

      The question requires that candidates give an account of the similarities and differences between
      the impact of the policies of Bentinck and Dalhousie referring to both throughout. Candidates may
      refer to socio-cultural, political, economic, military and religious similarities and differences. For
      example, Dalhousie followed expansionist military policies as seen through aggressive wars in
      Punjab and Burma whereas Bentinck reduced the military budget. Inspired by the philosophy of
      utilitarianism, Bentinck carried on social reforms such as the abolition of Sati and Thuggee.
      Dalhousie introduced the Caste Disabilities Act, reflecting discrimination to non-Christians and the
      Doctrine of Lapse, which unfairly annexed territory if a local ruler died without a natural heir. Both
      believed in modernization: Dalhousie supported developments in transport and communication and
      Bentinck reformed the court system and encouraged western-style education. Both similarities and
      differences must be clearly indicated but there does not need to be an equal number of each.


12.   Discuss the economic impact of the British Raj in India between 1858 and 1914.

      The question requires that candidates offer a considered and balanced review of the economic
      impact of the British Raj. The impact may extend beyond the timeframe but must be clearly linked
      to the issue raised in the question. Candidates may refer to changes in agriculture, industry and
      commerce. For example, there was pressure on the peasants to grow cash crops to suit the
      colonist’s needs. This along with the growth of absentee landlordism led to the impoverishment of
      the peasantry. New tariffs and taxes were introduced which favoured the British. The impact was
      felt on all sections of Indian society resulting in the drain of wealth and famines. The uneven
      development of Indian industry using British capital may also be discussed.
                                                  – 10 –               N19/3/HISTX/HP3/ENG/TZ0/OC/M


Section 7: Challenges to traditional East Asian societies (1700–1868)

13.   With reference to the period up to 1856, discuss the consequences for China of their defeat in the
      First Opium War.

      The question requires that candidates offer a considered and balanced review of the
      consequences for China of their defeat in the First Opium War. Candidates may refer to the effects
      of the Treaty of Nanjing which resulted in China being forced to open up ports for trade and
      relinquish Hong Kong. It could be argued that the most damaging consequences were the loss of
      extraterritoriality clauses that saw China lose sovereignty. The issue of opium had also not been
      resolved with devastating social consequences for China and the arrival of missionaries led to the
      introduction of Christianity. The outbreak of the Taiping Rebellion can be seen as a consequence
      of China’s defeat in the war and this civil conflict led to the deaths of millions of Chinese people.
      China’s defeat also led to a series of unequal treaties which further undermined their sovereignty.


14.   “Internal challenges were the greatest threat to the Tokugawa Shogunate.” Discuss.

      The question requires that candidates offer a considered and balanced review of the statement
      that internal challenges were the greatest threat to the Tokugawa Shogunate. Candidates may
      refer to a range of social and economic problems including peasant uprisings, the pressures of the
      alternate attendance system and financial strain experienced by the samurai because of long
      periods of peace. The political movement Sonno Joi may also be discussed to demonstrate that
      there was a desire amongst many Japanese to restore the power of the emperor. Candidates may
      challenge the statement by arguing that it was external factors such as the influence of Dutch
      learning and the arrival of Perry that undermined the shogun. Candidates may agree, partly agree
      or disagree with the statement.
                                                  – 11 –                N19/3/HISTX/HP3/ENG/TZ0/OC/M


Section 8: British colonialism and emerging national identities in Oceania (1788–1919)

15.   Compare and contrast the impact of early colonial settlements on the indigenous people in
      Australia and New Zealand.

      The question requires that candidates give an account of the similarities and differences between
      the impact of early colonial settlements on the indigenous people in Australia and New Zealand,
      referring to both throughout. Candidates may refer to how in both countries indigenous people
      were initially used as guides to help in land selection. Another comparison may be that language
      and cultural differences often caused misunderstandings, particularly over issues of land. In both
      countries these tensions led to violence. Contrasts may include the signing of the Treaty of
      Waitangi in New Zealand; however, the Australian Aboriginals never sanctioned British
      colonisation. There was also significantly more violence in Australia and there were massacres in
      Pinjarra and Myall Creek. Both similarities and differences must be clearly indicated but there does
      not need to be an equal number of each and there may also be a stronger focus on one of the
      countries.


16.   To what extent do you agree with the view that Gallipoli marked the emergence of a national
      identity in either Australia or New Zealand?

      The question requires that candidates consider the merits or otherwise of the suggestion that
      Gallipoli marked the emergence of a national identity in either Australia or New Zealand.
      Candidates may refer to the legend of the ANZAC soldier and the stories of heroism that emerged
      from the battle to form the ANZAC spirit. The realisation amongst the men that they were not the
      same as British soldiers helped a national identity to form. Heavy casualties at Gallipoli, and in the
      war overall, also created resentment that their foreign policy was so closely tied to the UK’s despite
      being on the other side of the world. Candidates may challenge the question by identifying ways
      that national identity had already developed within their chosen country. These could include arts
      or sport and, in Australia, the creation of the Federation of Australia in 1901. Candidates may
      agree, partly agree or disagree with the statement.

Section 9: Early modernization and imperial decline in East Asia (1860–1912)

17.   “The Self-Strengthening Movement (1861–1894) was a complete failure.” Discuss.

      The question requires that candidates offer a considered and balanced review of the statement
      that the Self-Strengthening Movement (1861–1894) was a complete failure. Consequences of the
      movement may extend beyond the timeframe but they must be clearly linked to the movement.
      Candidates may refer to the fact that the Self-Strengthening Movement proved to be short-lived,
      ending in a coup by powerful conservative opponents led by Cixi. It was generally unsuccessful as
      new developments were loyal to provincial rather than national interests. Chinese military defeat by
      France and Japan proved that the Self-Strengthening Movement failed to strengthen Qing rule or
      China’s military power. Due to the Qing court weaknesses, foreign powers claimed different parts
      of China as spheres of influence. However, there were some successes, key figures associated
      with the movement such as Zeng Guofan and Li Hongzhang initiated successful developments in
      shipbuilding, armament production and maritime customs services. The creation of a foreign
      ministry also helped centralize communications between the Qing government and foreign powers.
      Candidates may agree, partly agree or disagree with the statement.


18.   Discuss the impact of the Boxer Rebellion (1900–1901) on China.

      The question requires that candidates offer a considered and balanced review of the impact of the
      Boxer Rebellion on China. The impact may extend beyond the timeframe but must be clearly linked
      to the Boxer Rebellion. Candidates may refer to the ultimate suppression of the Boxers by the
      Eight-Nation Alliance of foreign powers severely weakening the Qing dynasty and its defence
      capabilities. The Chinese were forced to accept the garrisoning of foreign troops within their
      borders, which helped fuel the growing nationalist fervour. Politically, it became a key component
      in governmental change in 1911. Economically, China had to carry the indemnity burden placed on
      it by the Eight-Nation Alliance for 39 years using money that was desperately needed for other
      development purposes. Taxes had to be raised which was resented by all sections of society.

Section 10: Nationalism and independence in India (1919–1964)

19.   Evaluate the contribution of Gandhi to the achievement of Indian independence in 1947.

      The question requires that candidates make an appraisal of Gandhi’s contribution to the
      achievement of independence in India weighing up the strengths and limitations of his actions and
      methods prior to Indian independence in August 1947. Candidates may refer to the fact that he
      brought the masses into the national movement. His concepts of non-violence and passive
      resistance based on truth and fairness, gave his movements a universal, legitimate appeal. He
      gave people new tools for resistance through satyagraha, boycotts and courting arrest. His
      movements helped repeal unjust taxes such as the salt tax. The Non-Cooperation, Khilafat and the
      Quit India movements had both successes and failures. He could not stem communalism and was
      unable to placate the Muslims. Candidates may also argue that independence may have come
      anyway due to the Atlantic Charter and the decision taken by colonists, after the end of the Second
      World War, to give up their colonies. Both strengths and limitations must be clearly indicated but
      there does not need to be an equal number of each.


20.   Discuss the impact of ethnic and religious conflicts on post-independence India.

      The question requires that candidates offer a considered and balanced review of the impact of both
      ethnic and religious conflicts on post-independent India. Candidates may offer equal coverage of
      ethnic and religious conflicts or they may prioritize their discussion of one of these aspects.
      However, both aspects will be a feature of the response. The impacts may extend beyond the
      timeframe but they must be clearly linked to the issues raised in the question and should not go
      much beyond 1964 (death of Nehru). Candidates may refer to the partition and the situation of the
      Muslims that remained in India. After 1947, the Hindu-Muslim riots predominately occurred in
      urban centres, while villages remained largely undisturbed. Ethnic conflicts mainly took place in
      Punjab, Assam and Kashmir. The conflict in the Punjab had a dominant linguistic thrust during the
      mid-1960s. In Assam, the migration from East Pakistan put pressure on the Assamese residents.
      In Kashmir, militancy arose with demands for Islamic separatism. There were tribal insurgencies in
      the north-eastern states. Language was an emotive issue as demonstrated by the Dravida
      Kazhagam movement in Tamil Nadu when violence broke out on the adoption of Hindi as the
      national language. Caste-based reservations in jobs and educational institutions led to heightened
      tension among different castes.

Section 11: Japan (1912–1990)

21.   Discuss the reasons for Japan’s failure to maintain a successful democratic system of
      parliamentary government up to 1931.

      The question requires that candidates offer a considered and balanced review of the reasons for
      Japan’s failure to maintain a successful democratic system up to 1931. Candidates may refer to
      the problems facing Prime Minister Hara including inflation, the influx of foreign ideas and an
      emerging labour movement. Hara, who was assassinated in 1921, was followed by a succession of
      non-party prime ministers and coalition cabinets. The public grew disillusioned with the growing
      national debt and the new election laws, which retained the old minimum tax qualifications for
      voters. Fear of a broader electorate, left-wing power and the growing social change due to the
      influx of western popular culture led to the passage of the Peace Preservation Law in 1925 which
      forbade any change in the political structure or the abolition of private property. By 1931,
      constitutional government was usurped by aggressive, militarist expansionist leaders. The rise of
      the zaibatsu whose influence and size allowed control over significant parts of the Japanese
      economy may also be discussed.


22.   Evaluate the impact of the political and cultural changes that took place in Japan during the US
      occupation (1945–1952).

      The question requires that candidates make an appraisal of the political and cultural changes in
      Japan during the US occupation, weighing up the strengths and limitations of these changes.
      Candidates may offer equal coverage of political and cultural changes or they may prioritize their
      evaluation of one. However, both aspects will be a feature of the response. Candidates may refer
      to the adoption of a new constitution that declared that sovereignty rested with the people, not the
      emperor. Local governments were strengthened to include grassroots-level political participation.
      The powers of the police were reduced and new civil liberties such as the right of free speech were
      established. However, the US’s intention of breaking up the zaibatsu was not implemented.
      Demilitarization included abolishing the armed forces and dismantling the military industry. Women
      were given the right to vote. Moral education in schools was abolished. Farmers became more
      independent economically as land was taken away from big landlords and redistributed to the
      farmers. Both strengths and limitations must be clearly indicated but there does not need to be an
      equal focus on each.

Section 12: China and Korea (1910–1950)

23.   To what extent can domestic policies during the Nanjing decade (1927–1937) be considered a
      failure?

      The question requires that candidates consider the merits or otherwise of the suggestion that
      domestic policies during the Nanjing decade can be considered a failure. Candidates may refer to
      a range of economic problems including high inflation, unemployment and poor conditions in the
      countryside. Positive economic developments may include the establishment of infrastructure in
      the cities. Political weaknesses such as corruption, nepotism and the oppressive nature of regime
      may be discussed. Attempts to modernise/westernise Chinese society through the New Life
      Movement could be seen as both a failure and a success. While other relevant factors, for example
      Jiang Jieshi’s failure to respond to the Japanese threat, may be referred to, the bulk of the
      response will remain on the issue raised in the question. Candidates may agree, partly agree or
      disagree with the suggestion.


24.   Evaluate the impact of the First United Front on the Guomindang and the Chinese
      Communist Party.

      The question requires that candidates make an appraisal of the impact of the First United Front on
      the Guomindang (GMD) and the Chinese Communist Party (CCP), weighing up the strengths and
      limitations. Candidates may offer equal coverage of the GMD and the CCP, or they may prioritize
      their evaluation of one. However, both aspects will be a feature of the response. Candidates may
      refer to the military advice and equipment the GMD received from the Comintern and how under
      their influence it became a more disciplined and organised party. The GMD was also able to use
      CCP support amongst the peasantry to eliminate the warlords and to increase their control. The
      CCP also benefited from the First United Front as they gained support from the peasants during
      the Northern Expedition. Candidates may refer to the White Terror and the Encirclement
      Campaigns as examples of the negative impact the United Front had on the CCP. Both strengths
      and limitations must be clearly indicated but there does not need to be an equal focus on each.
                                                  – 16 –               N19/3/HISTX/HP3/ENG/TZ0/OC/M


Section 13: Impact of the world wars on South-East Asia

25.   “The First World War and the Treaty of Versailles were significant factors in the spread of
      nationalism in South-East Asia.” To what extent do you agree with this statement?

      The question requires that candidates consider the merits or otherwise of the statement that the
      First World War and the Treaty of Versailles were significant factors in the spread of nationalism.
      Candidates may offer equal coverage of the First World War and the Treaty of Versailles, or they
      may prioritize their assessment of one. However, both aspects will be a feature of the response.
      Candidates may refer to local rebellions against the French and British authorities during the war or
      the economic pressure of war on the region. Versailles and, particularly, Wilson’s ideas of self-
      determination had created high hopes in the region for independence but disappointment led to
      further resentment of colonisation. Candidates may challenge the question by arguing nationalism
      had spread before the First World War or that nationalism did not develop until the Second World
      War. However, the bulk of the answer will remain focused on the issue raised in the question.
      Candidates may agree, partly agree or disagree with the statement.


26.   Compare and contrast the response to Japanese occupation in the Dutch East Indies and
      Indochina.

      The question requires that candidates give an account of the similarities and differences between
      the response to Japanese occupation in the Dutch East Indies and Indochina, referring to both
      throughout. Candidates may refer to how in both countries there was a feeling that an Asian
      colonial power would be preferable to a European one. However, resistance increased as the
      Japanese introduced harsher methods of control. In both countries, there were groups who
      collaborated with the Japanese and groups who resisted them. In the Dutch East Indies, the
      Japanese took direct control of most senior administrative posts whereas in Indochina the French
      authorities remained in control. In the Dutch East Indies, the strongest figure, Sukarno,
      collaborated with the Japanese, but in Indochina the most prominent figure, Ho Chi Minh, resisted
      them. Both similarities and differences must be clearly indicated but there does not need to be an
      equal number of each.

Section 14: The People’s Republic of China (1949–2005)

27.   Discuss the social and political impact of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution on China
      up to 1976.

      The question requires that candidates offer a considered and balanced review of the social and
      political impact of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. Candidates may offer equal coverage
      of social and political, or they may prioritize their discussion of one. However, both aspects will be
      a feature of the response. Candidates may refer to the destruction of the Four Olds and the
      decimation of China’s cultural heritage. Religion was undermined and temples, mosques and
      churches were destroyed. Schools and universities were closed creating the Lost Generation.
      Regular mass meetings were held to denounce people creating a state of fear and thousands
      committed suicide to avoid the shame. Politically, a cult of personality was established; the Red
      Guards seized control of local government and in Shanghai they created the Shanghai People’s
      Commune. Party members were targeted notably Deng Xiaoping and Liu Shaoqi. The power of the
      Gang of Four and the PLA increased significantly at this time.


28.   To what extent did the successes of Jiang Zemin’s leadership outweigh the failures?

      The question requires that candidates consider the merits or otherwise of the suggestion that the
      successes of Jiang Zemin’s leadership outweighed the failures. Candidates may offer equal
      coverage of successes and failures, or they may prioritize their assessment of one. However, both
      aspects will be a feature of the response. Candidates may refer to a range of successes including
      the summit meetings with the US, which gradually led to improved relations between the two
      countries. Candidates may also discuss how the economy continued to steadily grow under Jiang
      as China developed their Special Economic Zones and joined the World Trade Organization.
      Failures could include tensions with the US over Taiwan, including the Third Taiwan Strait Crisis.
      Economically, rural poverty remained an issue. Increasing crime rates and environmental issues
      were also problems under Jiang’s leadership. Candidates may agree, partly agree or disagree with
      the question.

Section 15: Cold War conflicts in Asia

29.   Discuss the economic and political impact of the Korean War on the Korean peninsula.

      The question requires that candidates offer a considered and balanced review of the economic and
      political impact of the Korean War. The impact may extend beyond the Korean War but must be
      clearly linked to the issue raised in the question. Candidates may offer equal coverage of economic
      and political impact or they may prioritize their discussion of one. However, both aspects will be a
      feature of the response. Candidates may refer to the fact that North Korea remained a communist
      nation while South Korea became a free republic. Neither side achieved a military victory. Political
      interference from the US in South Korea and the USSR in North Korea continued after the war.
      South Korea saw the destruction of industrial facilities, hyperinflation and the discontinuance of two
      national economic reform policies: the farmland reform and privatization policies on confiscated
      enemy properties. In North Korea, destruction was more severe with the total damage estimated at
      420 billion won. Factories, state enterprises, housing units and schools disappeared. Agricultural
      lands were in a state of devastation. While other relevant factors, for example the psychological
      issue of families and homes being divided may be referred to, the bulk of the response will remain
      on the issue raised in the question.


30.   Discuss the domestic impact of the Khmer Rouge’s regime in Cambodia.

      The question requires that candidates offer a considered and balanced review of the domestic
      impact of the Khmer Rouge’s regime in Cambodia. Candidates may offer equal coverage of the
      social, political and economic impact or they may prioritize their discussion of one of these aspects.
      However, all aspects of domestic policy will be a feature of the response. Candidates may refer to
      the social issues of orphans, forced marriages, loss of culture and the lost generation. Survivors
      faced psychological trauma due to sexual violence and a number of women became sex slaves
      prostituting themselves for survival in exchange for food or medicine. Health problems occurred
      due to injuries that remained untreated over a long period. The regime killed about two million
      people. Politically, the authoritarian structure ensured that people had no civil rights. They were
      forced to show loyalty to the regime often reporting and killing even their parents and neighbours.
      There was economic decline and extreme poverty as farmers lost their farmlands.

Section 16: Developments and challenges in South Asia after 1947

31.   Discuss the social and economic challenges facing Pakistan following its independence.

      The question requires that candidates offer a considered and balanced review of the social and
      economic challenges facing Pakistan. Candidates may offer equal coverage of social and
      economic challenges or they may prioritize their discussion of one. However, both aspects will be a
      feature of the response. Candidates may refer to the loss of lives and property during partition and
      the refugee crisis as several million Muslims fled from India into Pakistan. Pakistan did not have
      the necessary facilities to house so many new citizens. The provinces were mostly
      underdeveloped, with very little industry. Agriculture did not produce a sufficient surplus to create
      the wealth needed for industrialization. Landlessness and agrarian poverty remained significant
      economic challenges. There were several ethnic groups with their own traditions and cultures such
      as Punjabis, Pakhtuns and Bengalis. National language also became an issue. Literacy levels
      were low and public health was a challenge as were cholera, malaria and several other diseases
      which affected the population. While other relevant factors, for example demarcation of boundaries
      and control over Kashmir, may be referred to, the bulk of the response will remain on social and
      economic challenges.


32.   Discuss the causes of the civil war in Sri Lanka.

      The question requires that candidates offer a considered and balanced review of the causes of civil
      war in Sri Lanka. Candidates may refer to the continuous political rancour between the majority
      Sinhalese and the minority Sri Lankan Tamils before and during the early part of colonial rule by
      Europeans. Christian missionary activity led to Hindu Tamils building their own schools and
      temples and publishing literature to counter the missionaries. This prepared the way for a cultural,
      religious and linguistic community of Tamils by the mid-19th century. After independence in 1948
      the Sinhala-only language policy was introduced, which was discriminatory towards the Tamils.
      Indian Tamils were denied jobs and citizenship. The Tamil United Liberation Front (TULF) began
      demanding a separate state. The Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) pushed this demand
      further through militancy and guerrilla warfare, leading to ethnic riots and insurgency. Indian and
      UN intervention to disarm the Tamil Tigers annoyed the Tamils and led to increased conflict.

Section 17: Developments in Oceania after the Second World War (1945–2005)

33.   Evaluate the impact of increased immigration on either Australia or New Zealand following the
      Second World War.

      The question requires that candidates make an appraisal of the impact of increased immigration on
      either Australia or New Zealand following the Second World War, weighing up the strengths and
      limitations. In Australia and New Zealand, the number of white migrants reduced and migrants
      coming from Asian countries significantly increased. Australia and New Zealand became more
      multi-cultural and there was a growth in new cultural activities. However, racial tensions also
      increased in both countries as it was clear that assimilation was not always effective. In both
      countries migrants provided a much-needed labour force for huge government building projects
      and this significantly contributed to their industrial development. Both strengths and limitations
      must be clearly indicated but there does not need to be an equal focus on each


34.   Discuss the factors that led to a change in either Australia’s or New Zealand’s international
      alignments.

      The question requires that candidates offer a considered and balanced review of factors that led to
      a change in either Australia’s or New Zealand’s international alignments. Candidates may refer to
      how both countries had been closely tied to the UK prior to the Second World War, but the fall of
      Singapore resulted in them looking to the US for protection. This resulted in the ANZUS Treaty
      being signed between Australia, New Zealand and the US in 1951. Close ties with the US resulted
      in both countries’ involvement in the Vietnam War. New Zealand felt uneasy about this and began
      to question US policies. The UK’s membership of the EU led to a strengthening of relations
      between Australia and New Zealand. Both countries also developed closer links with Asia through
      ASEAN, APEC, the Asian Development Bank and the Colombo Plan.

Section 18: Social, cultural and economic developments in Asia (excluding China, Japan
            and India) (1980–2005)

35.   Examine the impact of globalization in two Asian countries (excluding China, Japan and India).

      The question requires that candidates consider the interrelationship between globalization and the
      domestic developments in two countries, referring to both countries throughout. The impact may
      extend beyond the timeframe but must be clearly linked to the issue raised in the question.
      Candidates may refer to the impact of globalization on the social, cultural and economic
      developments in two countries; for example the changes in social structures that took place
      including the growth of the middle class and the replacement of cultural traditions with modern
      western values. Changes took place in dress, food, religious beliefs and ways of living.
      Urbanization, demographic changes and the creation of new jobs impacted standards of living.
      While other relevant interrelationships, for example the impact of globalization on the relationship
      with other countries may be considered, the bulk of the response will remain on the impact of
      globalization within two countries.


36.   Evaluate the changes in social structure in two Asian countries (excluding China, Japan and
      India).

      The question requires that candidates make an appraisal of changes in social structure of two
      countries weighing up the strengths and limitations of these changes referring to both countries
      throughout. Changes may extend beyond the timeframe but they must be clearly linked to the
      issue raised in the question. Candidates may refer to changing gender roles and movements for
      equality among genders including access to new careers and inheritance rights for women. The
      changing role of the family, urbanization, rural transformation and ethnic conflict may be discussed
      with respect to strengths and limitations. The rapid growth of the middle class changed the
      relationship between the majority and minority. Changes in cultural symbols, rules of behaviour,
      social organizations and value systems may be evaluated. Both strengths and limitations for two
      countries must be clearly indicated but there does not need to be an equal number of each.
