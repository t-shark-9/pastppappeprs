                                               Section A

1.   (a)   Outline two advantages to Accord of using job/customized production.                 [4]

           Advantages could include:
           • Product: adjusting recipes to meet customer needs.
           • Packaging: producing individually designed packaging for each customer.
           • Marketing: could reinforce USP, which is not strong as Aran does not have it
             right.

           Accept any other reasonable description.

           Award [1] for each advantage up to a total of [2].

           Award [1] for putting the advantage into context up to a total of [2].

     (b)   Explain how Accord can differentiate Enrich from the products of its competitors.    [6]

           Key aspects:
           • The product is aimed at the specialist “gym” market rather than the mass
             market.
           • Greater emphasis on natural, healthy ingredients.
           • More intimate relationship with customers as it is small.
           • Positive features of small versus multinational.

           Explanation/analysis should come from discussing these in relation to the
           situation that Accord is in.

           Marks should be awarded according to the mark bands on page 3.

           Award maximum [3] for a theoretical answer or for only analysing one feature.

           Award maximum [5] if the analysis of two features or more is mainly descriptive
           but in context.
                                                   –6–                  N19/3/BUSMT/SP1/ENG/TZ0/XX/M


2.   (a)   Describe two reasons why secondary market research may not be useful to
           Accord.                                                                               [4]

           Secondary market research – exploring data that has been already collected for a
           different purpose.
           • Data may not be quite what is required – most likely for the mass market.
           • Data likely to be dominated by large businesses rather than by small
               businesses.
           • Data likely to be for mass market rather than niche market.
           • Data may be out of date.

           Accept any other reasonable reason.

           Award [1] for each reason up to a total of [2].

           Award [1] for putting the reason into context up to a total of [2].

     (b)   Explain possible economies of scale that may apply to ABC but not to Accord.          [6]

           Economies of scale: Reduction in the average costs of a business as the scale of
           production increases. In this context, “scale” means productive capacity (ie, the
           physical size of the business) rather than the actual level of production.

           ABC is a large multinational so it can:
           • afford the best and most efficient equipment, whereas Accord will be very
             basic
           • direct effective marketing based on a whole range of products, whereas
             Accord only has a limited portfolio and little budget
           • employ a range of professionals and managers, whereas Accord only has the
             two owners so its skills and time are limited
           • access to a wide range of sources of finance, hence cheaper finance than
             Accord, which, as a partnership is limited.

           Accept any other reasonable explanation/application of EOS.

           Marks should be awarded according to the mark bands on page 3.

           Award a maximum of [2] if the discussion is only about ABC or Accord but not
           both.

           Award maximum [3] for a theoretical answer.

           Award maximum [5] if the analysis is mainly descriptive but in context.

           N.B. Some textbooks refer to average costs going down when production goes
           up (because of fixed costs being spread out more). Technically this is incorrect,
           as this is about production efficiency rather than scale so should not be allowed.

3.   (a)   With reference to Accord, outline two possible steps for Aran and Kayla in
           starting the business.                                                                [4]

           It is a partnership, so needs to incorporate:
           • finding finance – needed for premise, equipment
           • identifying/researching the market – it seems Aran has already done some of
               this but flawed
           • building a customer base – gyms, etc
           • creating a business plan.

           Accept any other reasonable step.

           Award [1] for each step up to a total of [2].

           Award [1] for putting the step into context up to a total of [2].

     (b)   Other than a business angel (line 108), explain methods of external finance that
           Accord could use to increase production capacity (line 108).                          [6]

           • New partner. Realistic? Anyone suitable? May upset existing partnership.
           • Bank loan. Difficult for small businesses, does not have much of a track
             record. Assets for security?
           • Working capital sources (debt factors, reducing stocks, creditors/debtors)
             likely to be insufficient for the expansion.
           • Grants/subsidies. Unlikely to be available.
           • Lease rather than buy: often used for premises, so promising.
           • Do not accept share capital – it is a partnership.

           Explanation should come from how relevant the sources are.

           Marks should be awarded according to the mark bands on page 3.

           Award a maximum of [2] if the source chosen is internal.

           Award maximum [3] for a theoretical answer.

           Award maximum [5] if the answer is mainly descriptive but in context.
                                                    –8–                 N19/3/BUSMT/SP1/ENG/TZ0/XX/M


                                                Section B
4.   (a)   Define the term batch production.                                                                 [2]

           Producing a defined number of identical products – each item in the batch
           passes through one stage of production before passing on to the next stage. An
           example, which is not necessary, is the commercial manufacture of biscuits.

           Award [2] for a complete definition.

           Award [1] for some understanding.

     (b)   For the first year of the production of Detox calculate:

           (i)    the gross profit generated by Detox;                                                       [2]

                  Gross profit = revenue − cost of goods sold
                  = $160 000  $2.50 − $160 000 = $240 000

                  Award [2] if correct answer and working shown.

                  Award [1] if correct answer but no working, or a reasonable attempt with
                  errors.

           (ii)   the net profit margin of Detox.                                                            [2]

                  Net profit before tax, interest = Gross profit − operating costs before tax and interest
                  = $240 000 − $20 000 = $220 000
                  so
                          Net Profit before tax and interest
                  NPM =                                       100 %
                                    sales revenue
                      220
                  =        100 = 55 %
                      400

                  Award [2] if correct answer and working shown.

                  Award [1] if correct answer but no working, or a reasonable attempt with
                  errors.
                                           –9–                 N19/3/BUSMT/SP1/ENG/TZ0/XX/M


(c)   With reference to Accord, explain one advantage and one disadvantage of an
      organizational structure based on product.                                        [4]

      Advantages:
      • Simple.
      • Can have different strategies for each product.
      • Markets different, so works well.

      Disadvantages:
      • May duplicate functions.
      • Small business, so does not want too many departments.

      Any other reasonable explanation

      Award [1] for each advantage/disadvantage up to a total of [2].

      Award [1] for putting each advantage/disadvantage into context up to a total
      of [2].
                                           – 10 –              N19/3/BUSMT/SP1/ENG/TZ0/XX/M


(d)   Discuss Kayla’s plan to produce a range of snack bars.                               [10]

      Arguments for:
      • There are problems with Enrich, so maybe diversify.
      • Good profits.
      • Massive growth (34 %).
      • Returns seem good (candidates may do payback, ARR).
      • Small businesses have successfully entered the market.

      Arguments against:
      • Aran does not like idea.
      • Very competitive.
      • Dominated by large companies.
      • May not match large advertising spending.
      • Would be better to spend money advertising Enrich?

      Recommendation not needed, but rewardable if supported by analysis.

      Accept reasonable alternative answers.

      Marks should be allocated according to the mark bands on page 4.

      Award a maximum of [4] for a purely theoretical answer, or with no effective use
      of case (eg, only repeating case material without development).

      Award a maximum of [6] if culture change is considered but there is limited use of
      data, or if there is good analysis of data with limited consideration of culture
      change.

      Award a maximum of [8] if culture changes are considered and there is good use
      of data but there are no significant judgements.
