                                          Section A
Biological approach to understanding behaviour

1.   Describe neuroplasticity, with reference to one relevant study. [9]

     Refer to the paper 1 section A markbands when awarding marks.

     The command term “describe” requires candidates to give a detailed account of
     neuroplasticity with reference to one relevant study. Descriptions of neuroplasticity may
     show conceptual understanding of long-term potentiation, neurogenesis and/or synaptic
     pruning.

     Responses should describe neuroplasticity indicating how the neural connections in the
     brain change with regard to a specific behaviour or cognitive process. Animal research is
     acceptable.

     Relevant studies could include but are not limited to:

     • Rosenzweig, Bennett and Diamond’s (1972) study on the role of environmental factors
       on neuroplasticity
     • Bremner et al.’s (2008) study on plasticity of the human brain in post-traumatic stress
       disorder
     • Dragansky’s (2004) study of neuroplasticity in jugglers
     • Maguire et al.’s (2000) study on navigation (related structural change in the hippocampi
       of taxi drivers)
     • Tierney et al.’s (2001) study using PET scans to investigate language development.

     If a candidate describes more than one study related to neuroplasticity, credit should be
     given only to the first study.

     If a candidate describes a relevant study, but neuroplasticity is not addressed, apply the
     markbands up to a maximum of [4].

     If a candidate describes neuroplasticity but does not describe an appropriate study, apply
     the markbands up to a maximum of [5].

Cognitive approach to understanding behaviour

2.   Describe one study related to one model of memory.           [9]

     Refer to the paper 1 section A markbands when awarding marks.

     The command term “describe” requires candidates to give a detailed account of one study
     related to one model of memory. The description of the study should include the aim,
     procedure and findings of the chosen study.

     Appropriate models of memory may include, but are not limited to:
      • Flashbulb memory
      • Levels of Processing Model.
      • Multi-Store Model of Memory
      • Schema theory
      • Working Memory Model

     Relevant studies could include but are not limited to:

     •   Baddely and Hitch’s (1974) study on the Working Memory Model
     •   Bartlett’s (1924) study of the effect of schema on memory storage
     •   Craik and Lockhart’s (1972) study on the Levels of Processing Model.
     •   Glanzer and Cunitz’s (1966) study on the primacy and recency effects in free recall
     •   Milner’s (1966) case study of HM.

     If a candidate describes more than one study, credit should be awarded only to the first
     study.

     If a candidate describes an appropriate model of memory but does not refer to a relevant
     study, apply the markbands up to a maximum of [4].
                                                   –6–     N19/3/PSYCH/HP1/ENG/TZ0/XX/M


Sociocultural approach to understanding behaviour

3.   Outline social cognitive theory with reference to one relevant study.    [9]

     Refer to the paper 1 section A markbands when awarding marks.

     The learning outcome “outline” requires candidates to give a brief account of social
     cognitive theory in relation to one relevant study.

     The main aspects of social cognitive theory include:
     • imitation of role models
     • the role of attention, retention, motivation and reproduction.
     • self-efficacy
     • vicarious learning

     Responses may refer to studies such as, but not limited to:
     • Bandura et al.’s studies on aggression
     • Joy, Kimball and Zabrack (1986) on aggression from television viewing
     • Totten’s (2003) study on modelling of violent behaviour towards girlfriends
     • Sprafkin et al.’s (1975) study on children’s prosocial behaviour and television model
     • Fagot et al.’s (1992) study on parental influences on gender development.

     If a candidate refers to more than one study, credit should be given only to the first study.

     If a candidate outlines social cognitive theory without making reference to a relevant
     study, up to a maximum of [5] should be awarded.

     If a candidate describes a relevant study without outlining social cognitive theory, up to a
     maximum of [4] should be awarded.

Section B assessment criteria

A — Focus on the question

To understand the requirements of the question students must identify the problem or issue
being raised by the question. Students may simply identify the problem by restating the
question or breaking down the question. Students who go beyond this by explaining the
problem are showing that they understand the issues or problems.

 Marks    Level descriptor


    0     Does not reach the standard described by the descriptors below.


    1     Identifies the problem/issue raised in the question.


    2     Explains the problem/issue raised in the question.


B — Knowledge and understanding

This criterion rewards students for demonstrating their knowledge and understanding of
specific areas of psychology. It is important to credit relevant knowledge and understanding
that is targeted at addressing the question and explained in sufficient detail.

 Marks                                          Level descriptor


    0    Does not reach the standard described by the descriptors below.


   1–2   The response demonstrates limited relevant knowledge and understanding.
         Psychological terminology is used but with errors that hamper understanding.

   3–4   The response demonstrates relevant knowledge and understanding but lacks detail.
         Psychological terminology is used but with errors that do not hamper understanding.

   5–6   The response demonstrates relevant, detailed knowledge and understanding.
         Psychological terminology is used appropriately
                                                   –8–      N19/3/PSYCH/HP1/ENG/TZ0/XX/M


C — Use of research to support answer

Psychology is evidence based so it is expected that students will use their knowledge of research to
support their argument. There is no prescription as to which or how many pieces of research are
appropriate for their response. As such it becomes important that the research selected is relevant
and useful in supporting the response. One piece of research that makes the points relevant to the
answer is better than several pieces that repeat the same point over and over.

 Marks Level descriptor


    0     Does not reach the standard described by the descriptors below.


   1–2    Limited relevant psychological research is used in the response. Research selected serves to
          repeat points already made.

   3–4    Relevant psychological research is used in support of the response, and is partly explained.
          Research selected partially develops the argument.

   5–6    Relevant psychological research is used in support of the response and is thoroughly
          explained. Research selected is effectively used to develop the argument.

D — Critical thinking

This criterion credits students who demonstrate an inquiring and reflective attitude to their
understanding of psychology. There are a number of areas where students may demonstrate critical
thinking about the knowledge and understanding used in their responses and the research used to
support that knowledge and understanding.

The areas of critical thinking are:
• research design and methodologies
• triangulation
• assumptions and biases
• contradictory evidence or alternative theories or explanations
• areas of uncertainty.

These areas are not hierarchical and not all areas will be relevant in a response. In addition, students
could demonstrate a very limited critique of methodologies, for example, and a well-developed
evaluation of areas of uncertainty in the same response. As a result, a holistic judgement of their
achievement in this criterion should be made when awarding marks.
                                                  –9–      N19/3/PSYCH/HP1/ENG/TZ0/XX/M



 Marks Level descriptor


    0    Does not reach the standard described by the descriptors below.


   1–2   There is limited critical thinking and the response is mainly descriptive. Evaluation or
         discussion, if present, is superficial.

   3–4   The response contains critical thinking, but lacks development. Evaluation or discussion of
         most relevant areas is attempted but is not developed.

   5–6   The response consistently demonstrates well developed critical thinking. Evaluation
         and/or discussion of relevant areas is consistently well developed.

E — Clarity and organisation

This criterion credits students for presenting their response in a clear and organized manner. A good
response would require no re-reading to understand the points made or the train of thought
underpinning the argument.

 Marks Level descriptor


    0    Does not reach the standard described by the descriptors below.


    1    The answer demonstrates some organization and clarity, but this is not sustained throughout
         the response.

    2    The answer demonstrates organization and clarity throughout the response.

                                               Section B

4.   Discuss one evolutionary explanation of one behaviour.    [22]

     Refer to the paper 1 section B assessment criteria when awarding marks.

     The command term “discuss” requires candidates to offer a considered review of one
     evolutionary explanation of one behaviour.

     Relevant behaviour that could be discussed includes, but is not limited to:
     • human mating behaviours (Buss, 1990)
     • emotions (for example, disgust, Fessler, 2006; universality of emotional expressions,
       Ekman and Frieson, 1971)
     • abnormal behaviour (for example, depression, Andrews and Thompson, 2009; phobias,
       Seligman, 1971)
     • prosocial behaviour (Dawkins, 1976).

     Discussion points may include, but are not limited to:
     • examining the underlying assumptions
     • the validity of evidence in support of the explanation
     • discussion of its strengths and limitations
     • the difficulties of carrying out empirical research
     • the debate of generalizing from animals to human behaviour
     • the role of culture in behaviour
     • limitations of a reductionist argument

     Candidates may discuss a specific emotional or dysfunctional behaviour such as disgust
     or depression or may discuss emotional or dysfunctional behaviour in general. Both
     approaches are equally acceptable.

     If a candidate addresses more than one specific behaviour, credit should be given only to
     the first behaviour addressed.

     If a candidate addresses more than one evolutionary explanation of behaviour, credit
     should be given only to the first discussion. However, candidates may address other
     explanations of the same behaviour and be awarded marks for these as long as they are
     clearly used to discuss the evolutionary explanation addressed in the response.
                                                  – 11 –   N19/3/PSYCH/HP1/ENG/TZ0/XX/M


5.   Discuss two or more ethical considerations related to one study investigating the
     reliability of one cognitive process. [22]

     Refer to the paper 1 section B assessment criteria when awarding marks.

     The command term “discuss” requires candidates to give a considered review of ethical
     considerations related to one study investigating the reliability of one cognitive process.

     Cognitive processes may include, but are not limited to, memory, thinking and decision-
     making.

     Ethical considerations may include, but are not limited to:
     • anonymity
     • debriefing
     • deception
     • informed consent
     • right to withdraw
     • undue stress or harm

     The reliability of a cognitive process is the extent to which it is open to distortion. Some
     schema studies are appropriate (eg Bartlett’s (1932) War of the Ghosts), whereas others
     do not address distortion (eg Bransford and Johnson, 1972).

     Relevant studies may include but are not limited to:
     • Brown and Kulik’s (1977) study on flashbulb memory
     • Loftus and Palmer’s (1974) study on reconstructive memory in relation to eyewitness
       testimony
     • Tversky and Kahneman’s (1974) study on heuristics and biases.
     • Yuille and Cutshall’s (1986) study on stress and eyewitness testimony

     Discussions may include, but are not limited to:
     • The justification of how ethical considerations were resolved – for example, why was deception
        used?
     • How ethical considerations may limit the ability to carry out research
     • Why ethical considerations are important – for example, with regard to a specific study, why is
        the anonymity of the participants important?
     • Using a cost/benefit analysis when undertaking research
     • How ethical considerations/guidelines have changed over time.

     If a candidate only discusses one ethical consideration, the response should be awarded
     up to a maximum of [3] for criterion B: knowledge and understanding. All remaining
     criteria should be awarded marks according to the best fit approach.

     If a candidate uses a study that is not relevant to the reliability of one cognitive process,
     then [0] should be awarded for criterion C. All remaining criteria should be awarded marks
     according to the best fit approach.

     If a candidate addresses more than one study, credit should be given to the first study
     addressed.

     If a candidate addresses more than one cognitive process, credit should be given to the
     first cognitive process addressed.

6.   Discuss how globalization may influence behaviour. [22]

     Refer to the paper 1 section B assessment criteria when awarding marks.

     The command term “discuss” requires candidates to offer a considered review of the
     influence of globalization on behaviour.

     Behaviour in this instance may include attitudes, identities or any other accepted
     behaviour.

     Relevant research may include, but is not limited to:
     • Adams (2003) on cultural values in the USA and Canada converging over time
     • Buchan et al. (2009) on globalization and cooperation
     • Gupta’s (2011) research on the effect of globalization in consumer behaviour
     • Jensen, Arnett and McKenzie’s (2011) research on globalization and cultural identity,
       which explains that globalization has fostered the occurrence of a new period of life,
       emerging adulthood, related to issues of identity
     • Ogihara & Uchida (2014) on the effects of globalization on subjective well-being
     • Norasakkunkit & Uchida (2014); Becker et al. (2002) on the effects of globalization on
       mental health.

     Candidates may discuss acculturation to the global culture or the role of contact with other cultures
     as a means of changing local culture; however, it is not relevant to discuss acculturation research
     based on immigrants moving to a new culture and the level to which one assimilates to the culture
     of a new country.

     Discussion may include, but is not limited to:
     • methodological difficulties in measuring and testing the effect of globalization.
     • the inability to establish a cause and effect relationship
     • studies of the effects of globalization are relatively recent and often have not been replicated
     • the difficulty of generalizing the findings of such studies
     • the reliance on self-reported data is open to demand characteristics.
