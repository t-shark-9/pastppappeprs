                      Japan–European Union Economic Partnership Agreement (JEEPA)

          In July 2017, the Japan–European Union Economic Partnership Agreement (JEEPA) was
           announced and it may come into force in 2019. Jointly, Japan and the European Union (EU)
           currently account for 28 % of global gross domestic product (GDP). The trade agreement
           could raise the EU’s exports to Japan by 34 % and Japan’s exports to the EU by 29 %.
           Economists say that this trade agreement marks a determined effort to combat rising
           protectionism and sends a powerful signal that cooperation, not trade protection, is the way
           to tackle global challenges.

          The largest benefit to Japan will be for Japanese car manufacturers, as Europe will gradually
           lower tariffs from 10 % on Japanese cars. Car tariffs are a big concern for Japanese car
           manufacturers, who struggle to compete with South Korean car manufacturers. South
           Korean cars are sold to the EU tariff-free thanks to a free trade agreement signed in 2011.
           Within Europe, car manufacturers are one of the largest sources of jobs. Car manufacturers
           in the EU are concerned that cutting tariffs on car imports from Japan may lead to a large
           increase of Japanese cars into the European market.

          The trade agreement will also resolve non-tariff barriers, such as technical requirements and
           regulations. More importantly, however, the EU and Japan will make their environmental and
           safety standards on cars the same, which will make trade easier.

          Japanese politicians have been defending their relatively inefficient farmers for a long
           time. Now, Japan will lower tariffs on European meat, dairy products and wine, cutting
           85 % of the tariffs on food products coming into Japan. This includes removing the current
           30 % tariff on some European cheeses, such as cheddar and gouda cheese. However,
           imported camembert cheese will face a quota. This may be because Japan produces some
           camembert cheese.

          JEEPA is particularly alarming for United States (US) beef and pork farmers because Japan
           has been the biggest export market for US beef and the second biggest export market for US
           pork. Any preferential tariff that EU farmers receive will make it much tougher for American
           farmers to sell meat in Japan.

          With this trade agreement, the EU and Japan are trying to promote the values of economic
           cooperation and environmental conservation, which are both important for long-term
           economic growth and sustainability. However, JEEPA faces significant challenges because
           it will have to be passed by the Japanese Parliament, the European Parliament and
           European national governments. There is no guarantee that all governments will agree to the
           economic partnership.

2.       Study the following extract and data and answer the questions that follow.


                      Bank of Canada raises interest rates for the first time in seven years

          For seven years Canada’s central bank, the Bank of Canada, kept its official interest rate at
           0.5 %. This period of easy monetary policy may be coming to an end. The Bank of Canada
           has just raised its official interest rate from 0.5 % to 0.75 %, claiming that there is new
           confidence in the Canadian economy. Figures show that the 3.5 % growth in gross domestic
           product (GDP) in the first quarter of 2017 is above its potential. In addition, the Bank of
           Canada expects growth in consumer spending, exports and business investment to stimulate
           economic growth in the months ahead. Such factors might contribute to inflationary pressure
           in the future.

          One of the issues that might have delayed the interest rate increase in Canada is that the
           inflation rate is still low and falling. Central banks typically raise interest rates when inflation
           is rising. That is not the problem in Canada, where the consumer price index (CPI) has been
           rising at well below the Bank of Canada’s 2 % inflation target. However, the governor of the
           Bank of Canada says that he is looking at forecasts of future inflation rates, noting that the
           data suggest the interest rate increase is necessary. An official statement from the Bank
           of Canada notes that growth is increasing across all industries and regions and that the
           economy has started to improve. There is no longer a need for the low interest rate.

          Positive economic growth figures, the optimism shown by the Bank of Canada, and the
           recent interest rate increase have caused a rapid appreciation of the Canadian dollar against
           the United States (US) dollar over recent months. There are now expectations that the Bank
           of Canada will raise the interest rate once or possibly twice more before the end of the year,
           as signs continue to point to a healthy economy. This would likely cause further strengthening
           of the Canadian dollar against the US dollar.

          An economist has said that the gain in the Canadian dollar against the US dollar may have
           a large effect on importers and exporters, although it will likely be months before consumers
           see the effects. She further noted that the effects would vary across different industries.
           There is some concern about the consequences for the Canadian current account. Currently
           the current account deficit is at 3.6 % of GDP.

          A stronger currency is also likely to encourage more Canadians to travel south to the US.
