Option A — Freshwater

1.   (a)   (i)    Estimate the percentage of rainfall shown as surface storage at the start of the rainfall
                  event.                                                                               [1]

                  Around 40 (accept 39 to 41)

     (a)   (ii)   Estimate the number of hours during which overland flow is present in the drainage
                  basin.                                                                            [1]

                  10 (hours )15 (minutes) (allow 10 to 10 hours 30 minutes)
                  Accept answers in decimal points (10.0 – 10.5)


     (b)   Outline one reason why interception decreases over time during the rainfall event shown in
           the diagram.                                                                              [2]

           There is a limit to how much water can be stored on leaf surfaces / on vegetation
           [1], and after a few hours of rainfall no more interception storage can occur [1].

     (c)   Explain three possible ways in which urban development might change how rainwater
           moves through a drainage basin such as this.                                    [2+2+2]

           Award [1] for each valid effect and [1] for further development of how this might
           change the movement/flow/storage of rainwater.

           For example: Urbanization would remove vegetation and thus interception storage
           [1]; as a result, more rain will flow through the drainage basin [1].

           Do not accept reference to dams and reservoirs.

           Other possibilities include:
           • May be more surface storage, as rainwater cannot drain away due to impermeable
              surfaces.
           • Little infiltration of rainfall due to impervious concrete surfaces, increasing run-off
           • Small soil storage, as little rainwater will filter downwards from the surface.
           • Altered overland flow of rainfall due to drainage channels and gutters.

2.   (a)   Evaluate the strategies used to manage the growing pressures on one named
           major wetland.                                                                       [10]

           Marks should be allocated according to the markbands.

           The focus of the response should be on the varied pressures on one named
           wetland ecosystem, and the relative success of strategies.

           Possible applied themes (AO2) demonstrating knowledge and understanding
           (AO1):
           •   The importance of wetlands as major ecosystems; a critical part of the natural
               environment; eg. water stores, reducing the impact of floods, improving water
               quality, rich biodiversity.
           •   Increasing pressures on wetlands include: water abstraction, land drainage,
               chemical and physical pollution, eutrophication, growing populations,
               reclamation, dam construction, conversion for aquaculture
           •   Strategies for management of wetlands, including the roles of international
               (eg, Ramsar Convention), national and local stakeholders.
           •   The purpose of management from different perspectives – eg, biodiversity,
               water security, tourism.

           Good answers may be well-structured (AO4) and may additionally offer a critical
           evaluation (AO3) that examines the different perspectives and relative success of
           different management strategies, and the varying power of stakeholders. Wetlands
           continue to be of significant environmental, economic and social importance, and
           management may partly depend on the scale of the issues. Another approach
           might be to critically evaluate the strengths of management using a sustainability
           framework.

           For 5–6 marks, expect some weakly evidenced outlining of some pressures on a
           wetland.

           For 7–8 marks, expect a structured account that includes:
           •   either an evidenced explanation of the pressures and strategies for one
               named wetland
           •   or a discursive conclusion (or ongoing evaluation) grounded in geographical
               concepts and/or perspectives.

           For 9–10 marks, expect both of these traits.
                                                  –7–                 N19/3/GEOGR/BP1/ENG/TZ0/XX/M


2.   (b)   Examine the relative severity of the different effects of agriculture on freshwater
           quality.                                                                       [10]

           Marks should be allocated according to the markbands.

           The response should focus on environmental consequences of agricultural
           intensification, such as pollution of water supplies, eutrophication and
           salinization, and the role of different stakeholders in their management.

           Possible applied themes (AO2) demonstrating knowledge and
           understanding (AO1):
           • Intensification of agriculture has significant impacts on both surface and
             groundwater quality, including direct run-off of chemical pesticides and
             nutrients, slurry from animals, and sediments from soil erosion. This has
             resulted in pollution of water supplies, affecting water security and biodiversity
             through eutrophication.
           • Also important is increased irrigation and groundwater abstraction, resulting in
             salinization of soils, especially in semi-arid regions.
           Good answers may be well-structured (AO4) and may additionally offer a
           critical evaluation (AO3) that examines the relative importance of different
           impacts, or possible spatial interactions between them, and the possible
           conflicting views from different stakeholders.

           For 5–6 marks, expect some weakly evidenced outlining of some environmental
           effects of agriculture on freshwater quality.

           For 7–8 marks, expect a structured account, which includes:
           • either an evidenced examination of the relative severity of different
             environmental consequences of agriculture on water quality
           • or a discursive conclusion (or ongoing evaluation) grounded in geographical
             concepts and/or perspectives.

           For 9–10 marks, expect both of these traits.

Option B – Oceans and coastal margins

3.   (a)   (i)    State the six-figure grid reference of the Dawlish Warren railway station.             [1]

                  969787 (allow 968 / 786 or 788) (accept 979 787 due to map error)

           (ii)   Estimate the distance, in km, between X and Y on the map.

           1.5 (allow 1.4 to 1.6)



     (b)   Outline two physical reasons why urban development has not occurred in area A.             [2+2]

           In each case, award [1] for a valid physical reason and [1] for further
           development using applied knowledge of coastal margins.

           For example: This may be an area of sand / spit [1] as the sand is too unstable to
           support buildings / longshore drift processes make it too mobile [1].

           Other possible physical reasons include:
           • Possible flood risk, as the land is very low-lying [1] and subject to storm surges / at risk of
              sea level changes [1].
           • recognition of Nature Reserve [1]; building not permitted as it would destroy the
              landscape/biodiversity in the area [1].

     (c)   Explain two ways in which vegetation contributes to the development of sand dunes in
           coastal areas such as this.                                                          [2+2]

           In each case, award [1] for a valid way and [1] for further development.

           For example: Vegetation traps sand blown by the wind [1] because it reduces wind speed
           (and therefore the ability to transport sediment) [1].


           Other possible ways include:
           • Vegetation decay and humus development [1], which is a source of nutrients for further
              plant growth on sand dunes [1].
           • Root systems stabilize the dune system [1] and allow embryo dunes to develop into fore
              dunes [1].
           • Alteration of the environment by pioneer/early stage species [1], allowing colonization by
              further species further fixing the dunes [1].
           • Vegetation protects sand dunes from rainfall during tropical storms [1] as vegetation
              intercepts rainfall protecting the dune from erosion [1].

4.   (a)   Examine why the management of coral reefs and mangrove swamps can become a source
           of conflict.                                                                    [10]

           Marks should be allocated according to the markbands.

           Coral and mangrove ecosystems are under increasing pressure, partly from the
           adverse effects of climate change but also from human activities. Different
           stakeholders may have conflicting perspectives regarding the use and value of
           coral reefs and mangroves. These demands must be carefully managed to
           ensure a sustainable future.

           Possible applied themes (AO2) demonstrating knowledge and understanding
           (AO1):
           •   Conflicting pressures include tourism, fishing, transport, energy exploration
               and settlement.
           •   Environmental impacts include mangrove and reef destruction, pollution,
               damage to fragile ecosystems and loss of fisheries. Social and economic
               impacts include decline of tourism and the fishing industry, and pollution of
               coastal margins. Coastal margins may also become more vulnerable to
               erosion by wave action associated with tropical storms.
           •   Management strategies may be small scale, such as the establishment of
               protected marine areas, conservation areas, fisheries management,
               ecotourism, land use zoning, and research and education. They may also be
               large scale, involving international agreements.
           •   Tensions and conflicts may arise between different stakeholders, eg
               environmentalists, local people, fishermen, tourists and tour operators.

           Good answers may be well-structured (AO4) and may additionally offer a critical
           evaluation (AO3) that examines a variety of conflicting pressures on coral reefs
           and mangroves by different stakeholders, in varying places and at different scales.
           These conflicts are likely to increase, resulting in irreversible damage to
           ecosystems, unless management strategies for a sustainable future can be
           formulated.

           For  5–6 marks, expect           some weakly evidenced outlining                  of
           management/conflicting pressures on mangrove and/or coral reefs.

           For 7–8 marks, expect a structured account which includes:
           •   either evidenced explanation of conflicting pressures on both ecosystems
               (balance not required) and relevant management strategies
           •   or a discursive conclusion (or ongoing evaluation) grounded in geographical
               concepts and/or perspectives regarding the success of management
               strategies.

           A response that omits one of the two ecosystems may score up to 7 marks if the
           evaluation is done well.

           For 9–10 marks, expect both of these traits.

4.   (b)   Evaluate the success of actions to reduce overfishing.                                  [10]

           Marks should be allocated according to the markbands.

           Overfishing has resulted in a dramatic depletion of fish stocks, extinction of prized
           species, reduced catches, decline of fishing industry, and unemployment. Various
           policies have been put forward to reduce overfishing and introduce possible
           alternatives. These include management of fishing areas, establishment of
           conservation areas, the introduction of quotas, and fish farming (aquaculture).

           Possible applied themes (AO2) demonstrating knowledge and
           understanding (AO1):
           • Causes and consequences of overfishing.
           • Conflicts over fishing rights and competing perspectives over ownership of a
             resource that forms part of the “global commons”.
           • Need for international agreements.
           • Management of fishing areas, eg quotas, limits on fleet and net sizes, effective
             monitoring.
           • Establishment of protected marine areas and conservation areas; research.
           • Development of sustainable fish farming (aquaculture).
           • Actions by individuals (eg, eating less fish / choosing eco-friendly options).

           Good answers may be well structured (AO4) and may additionally offer a
           critical evaluation (AO3) that examines the statement in a way that considers
           the varying perspectives on the costs/benefits and effectiveness of management
           strategies, and considers the different scales of dispute or conflict between
           different nations or places.

           For 5–6 marks, expect some weakly evidenced outlining of two actions to reduce
           overfishing.

           For 7–8 marks, expect a structured account that includes:
           • either an evidenced examination of two or more actions to reduce overfishing
           • or a discursive conclusion (or ongoing evaluation) grounded in geographical
             concepts and/or perspectives regarding the viability of suggested strategies
             for sustainable fishing.

           For 9–10 marks, expect both of these traits.

Option C – Extreme environments

5.   (a)   Briefly describe two main features of the pattern of the gas and oil extraction sites shown on
           the map.                                                                                  [1+1]

           Award [1] for each valid feature.

           Possibilities include:
           • Two major concentrations (in Russian Federation, and Canada and USA /
             Alaska).
           • Often found close to coastline but also penetrating inland in Russia / Canada.
           • Found inside and outside the Arctic Circle / north and south of the Arctic Circle
           • Not found at/beside the North Pole.
           • Few in the ocean(s) – Arctic and Atlantic but not Pacific.
           • Major concentrations in northern North America, and northern Eurasia /
             Europe / Asia
           • Country with the greatest number is the Russian Federation.

           Do not credit just a list of countries.


     (b)   Outline one physical reason why permafrost causes challenges for the industries shown on
           the map.                                                                            [2]

           Award [1] for a valid physical reason and [1] for further development or
           explanation using applied knowledge of extreme environments.

           Heat from the extraction process / building of settlements/infrastructure/pipelines
           can cause thawing of the permafrost [1], which can lead to subsidence [1].

           Other possibilities include:
           • Frozen ground [1] drilling can cause frictional heat which can melt the
             permafrost [1]. (Do not accept it is too hard to drill through.)
           • Pipelines can fracture in extreme cold [1], leading to the expense of heating
             the pipes / raising them above the permafrost layer [1].
           • Frost heave [1] means piles for pipelines are buried deep to avoid mass
             movement [1].

     (c)   Explain three possible conflicts over the use of cold environments (such as the Arctic) for
           mineral extraction.                                                                   [2+2+2]

           These should relate directly to mineral extraction and not to global climate
           change causing melting of the ice.

           Award [1] for a conflict related to mineral extraction and [1] for further
           development or explanation using applied knowledge of extreme environments.

           For example: There may be loss of the unique ecosystems due to drilling and
           infrastructure construction [1]; tundra species are fragile/highly vulnerable to
           change [1].

           Other possibilities include:
           • Loss of indigenous cultures due to increasingly lucrative jobs in the mining
             industries.
           • Resource nationalism – conflicting claims between competing countries.
                                                   – 12 –              N19/3/GEOGR/BP1/ENG/TZ0/XX/M


           • Protected wildlife areas versus further oil drilling.
           • Presence of a large number of military bases – future unrest in area – loss of
             sea passage for tankers.

6.   (a)   Examine the opportunities and challenges associated with tourism in hot,
           arid environments.                                                                       [10]

           Marks should be allocated according to the markbands.

           The focus of the response should be on hot, arid environments and the
           opportunities and challenges they pose for tourism. The opportunities and
           challenges are environmental, economic and social, and involve a variety of local
           and global stakeholders.

           Possible applied themes (AO2) demonstrating knowledge and understanding
           (AO1):
           • Opportunities for tourism include physical characteristics of the landscape and
             environment that give rise to a variety of different tourist activities and types of
             recreation.
           • Other opportunities include economic gains (multiplier effects), employment
             and protection of fragile areas.
           • Challenges include:
                o Environmental:
                       - pressures on local resources, especially water resources and
                       groundwater.
                       -possible destruction of fragile habitats ; land degradation.
                       -pollution and waste disposal.
                o Economic: land ownership and where the benefits go – local versus
                     international stakeholders.
                o Social: conflicts between locals and tourists and management of sites
                     of cultural and religious significance.

           Good answers may be well structured (AO4) and may additionally offer a
           critical evaluation (AO3) that examines the variety of environmental, economic
           and social opportunities and challenges in different places and scales, and in
           varying different contexts. They may also examine the varying perspectives of
           different stakeholders.

           For 5–6 marks, expect some weakly evidenced outlining of opportunities and/or
           challenges.

           For 7–8 marks, expect a structured account that includes:
           • either evidenced explanation of a variety of opportunities and challenges (do
             not expect balance)
           • or a discursive conclusion (or ongoing evaluation) grounded in geographical
             concepts and/or perspectives.

           For 9–10 marks, expect both of these traits.

           A response that omits challenges or opportunities may score up to 7 marks if the
           evaluation is done well.

6.   (b)   Examine possible ways of managing the impacts of global climate change on local
           populations in hot, arid environments.                                                    [10]

           Marks should be allocated according to the markbands.

           There is much concern regarding the possible impacts of climate change on local
           inhabitants of extreme environments. While the nature and severity of climate
           change might be debated, it is acknowledged that local inhabitants will be
           especially vulnerable. There has been relatively little agreement regarding how
           these impacts might be managed.

           Possible applied themes (AO2) demonstrating knowledge and understanding
           (AO1):
           •   Likely impacts of climate change in hot, arid areas, including increasing rainfall
               variability, soil erosion and desertification.
           •   Threats to water supply, including groundwater and irrigation.
           •   Potential loss of grazing land and decline of fuelwood resources.
           •   Threats to agriculture and effects on food systems; crop failures; increasing food
               shortages.
           •   Rural–urban migration by local populations.
           •   Possible management strategies might include:
                   o Management of impacts will involve local, national and international
                        stakeholders; possible national development plans.
                   o Possible adaptations might include: sustainable irrigation, small-scale water
                        management systems; soil conservation measures; desert “greening”.
                   o Agricultural research – drought-tolerant plants and animals.
                   o Role of NGOs/international aid.

           Good answers may be well-structured (AO4) and may additionally offer a
           critical evaluation (AO3) in a way that examines the varied effects of climate
           change on local populations together with possible adaptation and management
           strategies. Another approach might be to compare places and examine the
           varying strategies for management at different scales or economic contexts (high
           income versus low income).

           For 5–6 marks, expect some weakly evidenced outlining of the impacts of
           climate change on local peoples.

           For 7–8 marks, expect a structured account that includes:
           • either evidenced explanation of impacts of climate change on local people and
             a variety of possible management strategies
           • or a discursive conclusion (or ongoing evaluation) grounded in geographical
             concepts and/or perspectives.

           For 9–10 marks, expect both of these traits.

Option D – Geophysical hazards

7.   (a)   (i)    Estimate the number of internally displaced persons (IDPs) moving to Artibonite.   [1]

                  125 000 persons (accept 100 000–150 000).

           (ii)   Estimate the furthest distance, in km, from Port-au-Prince at which very strong
                  earthquake intensity was experienced.                                              [1]

                  80 (allow 70–90).

     (b)   Outline how the distance from the epicentre of an earthquake can determine the severity of
           two associated secondary hazards.                                                     [2+2]

           In each case, award [1] for recognizing a valid secondary hazard, and [1] for
           further development showing applied knowledge of geophysical hazards.

           For example: The further from the epicentre, the fewer landslides [1]. This is
           because shaking is less severe, which can cause instability of slopes [1].

           Do not double credit less severe / more severe shaking

           Other possibilities include:
           • tsunamis
           • liquefaction
           • fires
           • collapse of infrastructure
           • disease.

     (c)   Explain two reasons why internally displaced persons may have to wait a long time to return
           home after a major earthquake event such as this.                                      [2+2]

           In each case, award [1] for a valid reason and [1] for further development
           showing applied knowledge of geophysical hazards.

           For example: Large scale of devastation [1] means an enormous
           cost/undertaking to reconstruct housing/infrastructure [1].

           Other possibilities include:
           • aftershocks
           • infrastructure destroyed
           • weak government
           • lack of funding
           • pollution (atmospheric or terrestrial)
           • lack of insurance
           • wealth/poverty levels
           • lack of resources/materials/workers/aid for reconstruction
           • fear of returning.

8.   (a)   Examine pre-event management strategies designed to reduce human vulnerability to mass
           movement hazards.                                                                   [10]

           Marks should be allocated according to the markbands.

           The focus of the response should be on management strategies that might be
           implemented to reduce vulnerability prior to a mass movement hazard event.
           Vulnerability includes economic and social factors, such as damage to buildings
           and infrastructure, loss of life and injury, and decline of living standards. Mass
           movement hazards are often the product of other hazard events, such as tectonic
           activity and storms.

           Possible applied themes (AO2) demonstrating knowledge and understanding
           (AO1):
           • Understanding of physical and human causes of mass movement, eg tectonic
             activity, storms, deforestation, construction of infrastructure.
           • Geophysical surveys, hazard prediction, records of type, frequency and
             location of past large-scale mass movement events.
           • Hazard risk-mapping of hazard-prone areas; government planning and land-
             use zoning.
           • Slope stabilization measures, including terracing, re-vegetation, slope
             drainage, gabions, etc.
           • Need for decision making at various scales: local, national and international.

           Good answers may be well-structured (AO4) and may additionally offer a
           critical evaluation (AO3) of the effectiveness and cost of management
           strategies in relation to different places and at varying spatial scales, and the
           different perspectives on how the risks should be managed.

           For 5–6 marks, expect some weakly evidenced outlining of some pre-event
           management strategies.

           For 7–8 marks, expect a structured account that includes:
           • either evidenced explanation of a range of management strategies to reduce
             human vulnerability
           • or a discursive conclusion (or ongoing evaluation) grounded in geographical
             concepts and/or perspectives.

           For 9–10 marks, expect both of these traits.

8.   (b)   Examine the relative importance of economic and social factors in the vulnerability of local
           communities to geophysical hazards.                                                        [10]

           Marks should be allocated according to the markbands.

           The vulnerability of people to geophysical hazards is affected by a variety of
           economic and social factors, including variations in wealth and education, past
           experience, personal knowledge and the perception of hazard risk. These will
           vary between and within different communities.

           Possible applied themes (AO2) demonstrating knowledge and understanding
           (AO1):
           • Geophysical hazards represent a significant threat to many communities
             around the world; many large cities are located on plate margins, close to
             active volcanoes and earthquake zones.
           • Vulnerability is a product of the likelihood/probability of a hazardous event
             occurring and the consequences in terms of injury, death and destruction.
           • Economic factors affecting vulnerability include wealth and infrastructure and
             communications; planning.
           • Social factors include perception of the risk, population characteristics,
             education and literacy levels.
           • Perception of the hazard will affect management and levels of preparedness
             to reduce risk from future events.

           Good answers may be well-structured (AO4) and may additionally offer a
           critical evaluation (AO3) that examines the statement in a way that shows
           understanding of how economic and social factors affect vulnerability of people in
           different communities/countries.

           Accept discussion beyond local scale to communities within countries.

           For 5–6 marks, expect some weakly evidenced outlining of some social and
           economic factors that might affect vulnerability of communities.

           For 7–8 marks, expect a structured account that includes:
           • either evidenced explanation of how a variety of economic and social factors
             affect vulnerability in different communities
           • or a discursive conclusion (or ongoing evaluation) grounded in geographical
             concepts and/or perspectives.

           For 9–10 marks, expect both of these traits.

Option E – Leisure, tourism and sport

9.   (a)   (i)    Estimate the number of hours per day that people aged 65+ spend watching TV.       [1]

                  About 4.5 (allow 4.4 to 4.6). Accept 4 hr 20 min to 4 hr 40 min

           (ii)   Estimate the percentage of leisure time that 15–24-year-olds spend on non-screen
                  activities.                                                                        [1]

                  33.3% (allow 33.0 to 34.0%).

     (b)   Outline one possible reason why people in this high-income country have a large amount of
           leisure time.                                                                           [2]

           Award [1] for a valid reason and [1] for further development.

           For example: People in HICs are usually expected to work only 7–8 hours per
           day [1] because laws have been established regarding working conditions [1].

           Other possibilities include:
           • Larger numbers of retired people
           • High income means more people can work from home or part time.
           • High unemployment rates.

     (c)   Explain three factors not shown in the graph that may affect the amount of leisure time for
           different groups of working people in a country like this.                            [2+2+2]

           Award [1] for identifying the factor and [1] for further development using applied
           knowledge of leisure, tourism and sport.

           Do not credit mirror responses, or anything to do with education or stages of life
           cycle.

           Factors can be socio-economic (who the groups are), or geographic (where they
           live).

           For example: Place of residence – living at the edge of an urban area [1] may
           leave people with less leisure time because of commuting [1].

           Other possibilities include:
           • Affluence/income – people on a low rate of pay may need to work longer
             hours to meet living costs.
           • Gender – some women may find there is a cultural expectation for them to
             care for children and/or the elderly in addition to working.
           • Culture – some cultural ethnic groups may have differing attitudes towards
             leisure/work time balance.
           • Health/mobility – some working people may have health issues that restrict
             leisure participation.

10.   (a)   Examine reasons why the growth of tourism hotspots can become unsustainable.       [10]

            Marks should be allocated according to the markbands.

            The focus of the response should be on the problems associated with the recent
            rapid growth of tourism in rural and urban hotspots.

            Possible applied themes (AO2) demonstrating knowledge and understanding
            (AO1):

            • Rapid growth of tourism has focused on rural and urban hotspots. Urban
              hotspots include cultural tourism, such as museums, art galleries and
              architecture; rural hotspots include areas of outstanding landscape value,
              national parks and wildlife parks.
            • Considerable increase in tourist numbers, often for short periods of time,
              results in the environmental and perceptual carrying capacity being exceeded
              in both rural and urban areas.
            • Problems include various types of stress: overcrowding and congestion, noise,
              loss of amenity, litter and pollution and environmental damage.
            • These are unsustainable in the long-term, and there needs to be management
              strategies for a more sustainable future.

            Good answers may be well-structured (AO4) and may additionally offer a
            critical evaluation (AO3) of reasons for the growth of tourist hotspots, and how
            this might have adverse consequences and become unsustainable. They may
            show understanding that perspectives of various stakeholders may differ on the
            costs and benefits of urban and rural tourism.

            For 5–6 marks, expect some weakly evidenced outlining of problems associated
            with tourist growth in urban and/or rural areas.

            For 7–8 marks, expect a structured account that includes:
            • either evidenced examination of a range of issues/costs associated with the
              growth of tourism in rural and/or urban areas, and how growth might become
              unsustainable
            • or a discursive conclusion (or ongoing evaluation) grounded in geographical
              concepts and /or perspectives.

            For 9–10 marks, expect both of these traits.

10.   (b)   Examine ways in which international sporting events have become more inclusive
            over time.                                                                               [10]

            Marks should be allocated according to the markbands.

            Political and cultural influences are of importance in the increasing participation in
            international sport by different individuals and societies. For example, there has
            been a significant increase in the inclusion of numbers of disabled athletes, from
            a variety of countries, participating in the Paralympics. The focus of the response
            should be on the various reasons for, and dimensions of, this inclusion. Another
            approach might be to look at how more countries have been included over time,
            and why.

            Possible applied themes (AO2) demonstrating knowledge and understanding
            (AO1):
            • The growing importance of the Paralympic Games, and similar international
              sporting events; numbers of athletes, from an increasing number of countries.
            • Cultural influences include: changing public attitudes towards disability and
              gender roles; recognition that participation in sport is a human right;
              acceptance of wider issues regarding equality – religious, gender, sexual
              orientation or race.
            • Increasing media coverage, national and international.
            • Political influences include the role of the IOC and IPC. Chosen cities should
              host both the Olympic and Paralympic Games Funding, training facilities and
              support given by national governments.
            • At the national scale of inclusion, more countries are participating in events
              than in the past, linked with trends in development.

            Good answers may be well structured (AO4) and may additionally offer a
            critical evaluation (AO3) of the statement in a way that reaches evidenced
            judgment and shows understanding that perspectives of different stakeholders
            may differ on who is allowed to participate in sporting activities. Another approach
            might be to evaluate the spatial or temporal scale over which participation has
            changed and the differing perspectives of stakeholders.

            For 5–6 marks, expect some weakly evidenced outlining of changing inclusion
            over time.

            For 7–8 marks, expect a structured account that includes:
            • either evidenced explanation of changing inclusion over time in international
              sport
            • or a discursive conclusion (or ongoing evaluation) of the success of these
              influences grounded in geographical perspectives.

            For 9–10 marks, expect both of these traits.

Option F — Food and health

11.   (a)   (i)    Identify the percentage of people affected by diabetes in Europe in 2000.      [1]

                   3–5 (Only range from the key is correct.)

            (ii)   State the region with the highest rate of increase in diabetes between
                   2000 and 2030.                                                                 [1]

                   Middle East.

      (b)   Suggest two reasons, other than population growth, why the number of people suffering
            from diseases of affluence is projected to increase globally.                       [2+2]

            In each case, award [1] for a possible reason linked to affluence and [1] for
            further development showing applied geographical knowledge of food and health.

            For example: The spread of popularity of fast food outlets [1], meaning more
            saturated fats are consumed, resulting in increased risk of heart disease [1].

            Other reasons include:
            • More sedentary lifestyle / lack of exercise [1] leads to increased risk of heart
              disease [1].
            • Greater use of computers/laptops/smartphones.
            • Longevity.
            • Lifestyle choices.

      (c)   Explain one global and one local action that could be undertaken to manage a pandemic
            such as diabetes.                                                                  [2+2]

            Award [1] for each of one global and one local action managing the pandemic
            and in each case a further [1] for further development/explanation showing
            applied geographical knowledge of food and health.

            For example (global): The 2009 influenza pandemic led to new vaccinations
            being created [1], which were then distributed around the world by the WHO [1].

            For example (local): Campaigns / raising awareness [1] for example, introducing
            a sugar tax on soft drinks in order to reduce the incidence of diabetes [1].

            Other actions include:
            • airport screening
            • vaccinations and immunizations
            • surveillance and monitoring by WHO
            • organized plans by health boards
            • risk management plans.

12.   (a)   Examine how different factors have contributed to famine in one or more
            countries or areas.                                                                     [10]

            Marks should be allocated according to the markbands.

            A variety of environmental, economic, political and social factors are responsible
            for famine, and their importance will vary spatially and temporally.

            Possible applied themes (AO2) demonstrating knowledge and understanding
            (AO1):
            • Famines are particularly severe in low-income countries and poverty-stricken
              regions.
            • The severity or onset of famine is affected by a variety of factors, including
              natural hazards like earthquakes or droughts, but also social, economic and
              political factors, such as warfare.
            • Access to international aid may alleviate the severity or onset of famine. In the
              short term, the focus will be on food shortages, medical assistance, water
              supplies and shelter. In the long term, aid is often criticized for not focusing on
              long-term sustainability; it may fuel corruption, fall into the wrong hands, or
              weaken the economies of recipient countries, increasing reliance and
              undermining domestic agriculture.

            Good answers may be well-structured (AO4) and may additionally offer a
            critical evaluation (AO3) that examines the statement in a way that shows
            understanding of the various factors that have contributed to the severity of
            famine(s), and the role of international aid in alleviating the effects of famine.

            For 5–6 marks, expect some weakly evidenced outlining of the role of some
            different factors in the severity or onset of famine.

            For 7–8 marks, expect a structured account that includes:
            • either evidenced explanation of the role of different factors affecting the
              severity or onset of famine.
            • or a discursive conclusion (or ongoing evaluation) grounded in geographical
              concepts and/or perspectives.

            For 9–10 marks, expect both of these traits.

12.   (b)   Examine possible ways to improve food availability in different places.               [10]

            Marks should be allocated according to the markbands.

            Modern techniques, such as GMOs, in vitro meat and vertical farming, have
            focused on the application of science to increasing agricultural productivity. Such
            ways are seen by some as a means of feeding a rapidly growing population
            within the background of environmental impacts of global warming.

            Possible applied themes (AO2) demonstrating knowledge and understanding
            (AO1):
            • Bio-engineering is used to create a variety of genetically modified crops that
              have higher yields, a greater resistance to insects and diseases, and are less
              affected by the effects of climate change, such as soil infertility, drought and
              salinization.
            • Other modern farming techniques include in vitro meat and vertical farming.
            • Mainly focused on a few crops, such as soya beans, corn, rapeseed, cotton,
              and to a lesser extent on animals.
            • There is considerable debate surrounding the wisdom of producing GM crops,
              involving a variety of stakeholders: farmers, consumers, environmentalists,
              bio-tech companies.
            • Among issues of concern are food safety, environmental impacts, habitat
              diversity, ownership of seeds, land ownership, the role of agribusiness in food
              production, future sustainability.
            • Issues regarding rich versus poor farmers and growing economic and social
              inequality.

            Good answers may be well structured (AO4) and may additionally offer a
            critical evaluation (AO3) that examines the statement in a way that shows
            understanding of the issues surrounding new techniques and the often-competing
            views of various stakeholders. Perspectives may differ on whether new
            techniques/ways are viewed positively or negatively depending on the importance
            various stakeholders attach to issues such as food safety, biodiversity and
            increasing food production. Another approach might be to think critically about
            whether some ways are better suited to some places than others.

            For 5–6 marks, expect some weakly evidenced ways of increasing food
            availability.

            For 7–8 marks, expect a structured account that includes:
            • either evidenced explanation of ways of increasing food availability in specific
              places
            • or a discursive conclusion (or ongoing evaluation) grounded in geographical
              concepts and/or perspectives.

            For 9–10 marks, expect both of these traits.

Option G — Urban environments

13.   (a)   (i)    Using map evidence, identify one factor that has limited the expansion of Lagos
                   towards the west.                                                                   [1]

                   River

            (ii)   Estimate how far (in km) Lagos has grown along the southern part of the lagoon
                   between points X and Y from 1984 to 2013                                            [1]

                   25 (allow 23-27)

      (b)   Suggest two social reasons for the rapid growth of a megacity such as Lagos.             [2+2]

            Award [1] for a valid social reason and [1] for further development.
            Do not credit economic reasons.

            For example: A high rate of natural increase [1] as fertility rates are high in
            countries such as Nigeria [1].

            Other possible reasons include:
            • Migration – as pull factors such as education, universities, hospitals (do not
              double credit two urban social pull factors).
            • Push factors in rural areas, such as militia groups/civil war or land reforms.
              Must be distinctly different from the pull factor.

      (c)   Explain two reasons why the informal economic sector is important in a megacity such as
            Lagos.                                                                                [2+2]

            In each case, award [1] for a reason, and [1] for relevant explanation.

            For example: The rapid growth of the mega-city/ the scale of the rural-urban
            migration into Lagos, means that many formal jobs are not available [1]
            therefore, people must rely on small-scale, labour-intensive activities to survive
            [1].

            Other possibilities include:
            • Informal self-employment, eg new technology industries may offer greater

14.   (a)   Examine the varying impact of human activity on urban microclimates and air pollution.   [10]

            Marks should be allocated according to the markbands.

            The focus of the response should be on the modification of urban microclimates
            by human activity. This includes patterns and sources of air pollution, and the
            causes and effects of urban heat islands. Other aspects of urban microclimates
            that might be considered include wind strength and variability and precipitation
            types and amounts. Consideration might be given to management strategies to
            reduce adverse effects of air pollution.

            Possible applied themes (AO2) demonstrating knowledge and understanding
            (AO1):
            • The various causes and patterns of air pollution within cities, including the role
              of transport and industry, and types of pollution varying with combustion of
              fossil fuels.
            • The environmental impact and the social and economic costs of air pollution,
              including health issues and social stress.
            • Causes of urban heat islands and the spatial and temporal variations in
              intensity.
            • Atmospheric pollution, heat islands and the nature of built-up areas might also
              affect wind and precipitation in cities.
            • Strategies to improve air quality are of increasing importance in many cities.
              These include use of alternative energy, such as electric vehicles,
              development of public transport and reducing traffic congestion.
            • The relative success of strategies to improve air quality may vary with context:
              rapidly growing megacities in low-income countries, compared with cities in
              high-income countries.

            Good answers may be well-structured (AO4) and may additionally offer a
            critical evaluation (AO3) of the statement in a way that shows understanding of
            the causes, spatial variation and impacts of human activity on urban
            microclimates. One approach might be to examine the challenges faced by
            governments and urban planners to improve air quality in different places and
            contexts. There may be an evaluation of the relative success of strategies in the
            context of ensuring a sustainable urban future. Another approach might be to
            consider the perspectives and power of different stakeholders.

            For 5–6 marks, expect some weakly evidenced outlining of the impact of human
            activity on urban microclimates and/or air pollution.

            For 7–8 marks, expect a structured account that includes:
            • either evidenced examination of varying impacts of human activity on urban
              microclimates and air pollution (do not expect balance)
            • or a discursive conclusion (or ongoing evaluation) grounded in geographical
              concepts and/or perspectives.

            For 9–10 marks, expect both of these traits.

14.   (b)   Examine the interrelationships between the growth of cities and their infrastructure
            development.                                                                           [10]

            Marks should be allocated according to the markbands.

            The focus of the response should be on different types of urban infrastructure,
            including transport, waste disposal and provision of clean water and how the
            development of infrastructure has or has not kept pace with urban growth.
            Consideration may be given to the various challenges and opportunities faced by
            decision-makers and urban planners.

            Possible applied themes (AO2) demonstrating knowledge and understanding
            (AO1):
            • The development of adequate infrastructure is essential for the success of
              economic activity, living standards and quality of life of urban dwellers.
              Different types of urban infrastructure should be considered in the context of
              one or more cities.
            • Rapid urban growth puts strain and pressures on infrastructure. The problems
              are acute in large cities, especially megacities in lower-income countries,
              which are facing a dramatic increase in population. This is reflected in poor
              transport systems, congestion and a lack of basic facilities in large areas of
              slums. In addition, higher-income countries suffer from aging infrastructure in
              need of repair and replacement, together with congested transport networks.
              Although population growth may be relatively small, the cost of renewal and
              repair of infrastructure is high.
            • There are significant challenges to urban planners and different stakeholders.
              Solutions should be designed for the future sustainability of urban systems,
              possibly involving an integrated approach combining transport, energy, water
              and waste.

            Good answers may be well-structured (AO4) and may additionally offer a
            critical evaluation (AO3) of the statement in a way that shows understanding of
            the issues and interrelationships surrounding the development of infrastructure in
            relation to urban areas and communities. One approach might be to critically
            examine how possibilities for further urban growth rely on perpetual infrastructure
            development and improvement. Another approach might be to consider the
            power of different stakeholders, such as national and local governments, urban
            planners and local people.

            For 5–6 marks, expect some weakly evidenced outlining of the relationship
            between urban growth and infrastructure development.

            For 7–8 marks, expect a structured account that includes:
            • either evidenced examination of issues / problems concerning the relationship
              between urban growth and infrastructure development in different
              geographical contexts
            • or a discursive conclusion (or ongoing evaluation) grounded in geographical
              concepts and perspectives.

            For 9–10 marks, expect both of these traits.
