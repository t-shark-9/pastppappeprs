      inflation).

      The horizontal axis may be unemployment rate (Ue %). A title is not necessary.

(c)   Given that Mexico has a current account deficit, explain why "a rapid rise in foreign
      direct investment (FDI) reduced Mexico's reliance on portfolio investment, which
      has been diminishing" (paragraph ).                                                            [4]

              investment are part of the financial account on the balance of
              payments
              OR that if portfolio investment is falling there could be an
              increase in FDI to finance the deficit on Mexico’s current
              account.

      Command term
      “Discuss” requires candidates to offer a considered and balanced review that includes a
      range of arguments, factors or hypotheses. Opinions or conclusions should be presented
      clearly and supported by appropriate evidence.

      Economic analysis may include:
      • AD/AS
      • Marshall Lerner
      • J-curve
      • Elasticities.

      To explore the impact on:

      Inflation rate:
      • The peso has been undervalued, making imported factors of production more expensive,
         which results in a fall in SRAS and increases cost-push inflationary pressure.
      • The undervalued currency makes exports more competitive and may result in an increase
         in AD, which results in an increase in demand-pull inflationary pressure.
      • The inflation rate has been above 4% since January (2017; Figure 2), which is higher than
         its 3% target (paragraph ).
      • Due to inflation concerns (Figure 2), interest rates rose from 3% in December 2015 to 7%
         in June 2017 (Figure 3) – this may strengthen the currency and make it less undervalued,
         possibly reducing the inflationary pressure.
      • The central bank’s governor is optimistic that the inflation rate will fall towards the 3%
         target (paragraph ), but if the currency remains weak then this is unlikely to happen.
                                     –6–                N19/3/ECONO/HP2/ENG/TZ0/XX/M

Economic growth:
• The Mexican economy is slowing down. Its annual GDP growth slowed to 2.3% in 2016,
  down from 2.6% in 2015 (paragraph ) and the undervalued peso might lead to an
  increase in net exports, thus increasing AD and reviving growth.

Employment:
• The undervalued currency makes exports more competitive, therefore possibly raising
  employment in export industries.
• Imports become more expensive due to the undervalued currency, which may increase
  employment in industries that compete with imports.
• The unemployment rate fell, in comparison to figures from last year (Figure 1).

Balance of payments:
• Increased international competitiveness from currency depreciation has not yet led to an
  effective expansion of exports (paragraph ) and has not (yet) had a positive impact on
  the trade balance, suggesting that demand for exports is price inelastic.
• The undervalued currency increases the value of workers’ remittances, which helps the
  current account (paragraph ).
• The effect on net exports depends on the price elasticity of demand for both exports
  and imports.

Any reasonable discussion.

      Command term
      “Discuss” requires candidates to offer a considered and balanced review that includes a
      range of arguments, factors, or hypotheses. Opinions or conclusions should be presented
      clearly and supported by appropriate evidence.

      Responses may include:
      • Definition of current account deficit.

      Economic analysis may include:
      • AD/AS theory.
      • Exchange rate market.
      • Elasticities.

      To explore the impact on:
      • Current account is expected to grow to 5.6% of GDP and is seen to be Turkey’s biggest
        economic problem (paragraph ).
      • Could become even worse if the current security and political problems continue and the
        tourism industry continues to suffer, affecting net exports negatively.
      • Causing a depreciation of the lira (paragraph ), which could worsen cost-push
        inflationary pressures (Figure 1).
      • The deficit has to be financed on the financial account of the balance of payments
        (paragraph ).
      • If the current account deficit is financed through FDI, it means greater foreign ownership of
        Turkish assets, which may be a threat to sovereignty.
      • Turkey is vulnerable to outflows of investment (paragraph ).
      • Turkey may need to increase interest rates to attract foreign savings (paragraph ) but
        this may further damage the economy through a possible fall in AD.

• Turkey may need to borrow money to finance the current account deficit, leading to
  increased indebtedness.
• The current account deficit may have contributed to the worsening in the credit rating
  (paragraph ), which will make it more difficult for Turkey to attract investment, and make
  it more costly to borrow.
• Falling currency due to current account deficit will make it more expensive to
  repay debts.

Any reasonable discussion.

                     (Since Ghana’s GDP is greater than its GNI), the net income
                     from abroad must be negative.

      Command term
      “Compare and contrast” requires the candidate to give an account of similarities and
      differences of two situations, referring to both of them throughout.

      Responses may include:
      • definition of economic development.
      • references to the Sustainable Development Goals (or MDGs) as a way of measuring
        achievements towards development goals.

      Economic analysis, focusing on economic development, may include:
      • Lorenz curve
      • poverty cycle
      • long run / short run
      • elasticities relating to commodities.

      To explore the impact on:
      Similarities between Ghana and Nigeria:
      • Both are dependent on commodities, which makes them vulnerable, and may impact on
        economic development through unstable government revenues.
      • Both are low-income countries, which implies a low level of development.
      • In both countries, the GNI per capita is lower than their GDP per capita (Table 1), which
        means that there is a net outward flow of income, possibly reducing economic growth and
        development opportunities.
      • There is some indication of some good governance in both Ghana (paragraph ) and
        Nigeria (paragraph ). Good governance/accountable governments are more likely to
        pursue pro-poor development strategies.

• Both countries are similar in terms of income distribution (Table 1), though this figure is
  quite high. A more equitable distribution of income is a development objective, so both are
  doing rather poorly.
• Both countries have cut fuel subsidies (paragraph ), which had negative impacts for low-
  income households, who may now not be able to afford other necessities.

Differences between Ghana and Nigeria:
• Although both are dependent on commodities, Ghana seems more diversified (paragraph
   ), and so may be less vulnerable than Nigeria to swings in oil prices.
• Paragraphs  and  suggest several factors leading to good governance and security in
   Ghana. There is incomplete information to judge governance in
   both countries.
• Although Nigeria’s GNI per capita is higher than Ghana’s (Table 1), its HDI is lower than
   Ghana’s, suggesting that the benefits of Nigeria’s higher level of economic activity are not
   being used to achieve development objectives.
• A higher proportion of people are living in poverty in Nigeria, as measured by people
   earning less than PPP US$1.90 per day (Table 1), although this figure does not
   necessarily indicate the number of people living near to this poverty line.
• The health indicators for Ghana are all more favourable in terms of economic
   development, showing that people are healthier and living longer lives (Table 1).
• The education indicators are all more favourable for Ghana, indicating that more people
   have access to an education, and that this has favourable implications for future
   development (Table 1).
• The data given provide a small picture of development in Nigeria and Ghana and more
   information would be useful. However, it appears that Ghana is more economically
   developed than Nigeria, despite its lower average national income.

Any reasonable evaluation.

Responses may include:
• definition of export promotion
• definition of economic development.

Economic analysis, focusing on economic development, may include:
• AD/AS theory
• poverty cycle
• comparative advantage
• FDI role.

To explore the impact on:
Strengths of export promotion:
• Export promotion has helped Cambodia’s economy to grow (paragraph ) by producing
   manufactured products using its low-cost workers.
• Cambodia has a comparative advantage in the production of garments and footwear
   because it has a large supply of low-skilled, inexpensive labour (paragraph ); this has
   allowed it to specialize.
• There has been an increase of 10.2% exports of garments and footwear (paragraph ).
• It has attracted much foreign direct investment (paragraph ).
• Manufacturing jobs have lifted millions of people out of poverty in Asia; Cambodia hopes
   to benefit in the same way (paragraph ).
• Creation of employment leads to higher incomes and can lead to higher standards of
   living.
• 30 000 young Cambodians enter the labour force each year and could find jobs in the
   export industries.
• Net exports is a component of AD; if exports increase then this will result in an increase in
   RGDP, which may be used for development objectives.
• Transfer of technology as a result of FDI.
• Foreign firms in the export industries may provide training for the workers, helping them to
   become more productive.
• As a way to encourage exports, Cambodia is supporting diversification with supply-side
   policies (paragraph ) that could enhance the opportunities for small and medium-sized
   enterprises, which could bring about
   economic development.

Limitations of export promotion:
• Over-specialization is a risk for Cambodia, making it vulnerable to forces outside of its
  control.
• If minimum wages in Cambodia continue to increase, foreign investors may move to
  cheaper places (paragraph ).
• Export centres are likely to locate in urban areas, worsening rural–urban inequality, which
  is already high (paragraph ).
• Women may be more likely to be workers in the garment industry and may be trapped in
  low-wage jobs, worsening gender inequality (paragraph ).
• The garment and footwear industries create air and water pollution, threatening
  sustainability (paragraph )

Any reasonable evaluation.
