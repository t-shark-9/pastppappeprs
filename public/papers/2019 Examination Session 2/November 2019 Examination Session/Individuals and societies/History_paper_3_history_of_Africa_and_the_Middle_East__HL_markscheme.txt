Apply the markbands that provide the “best fit” to the responses given and award credit wherever it is
possible to do so. If an answer indicates that the demands of the question are understood and
addressed but that not all implications are considered (for example, compare or contrast; reasons
or significance; methods or success), then examiners should not be afraid of using the full range of
marks allowed for by the markscheme. Responses that offer good coverage of some of the criteria
should be rewarded accordingly.

 Marks     Level descriptor

Section 1: The ‘Abbasid dynasty (750–1258)

1.   Discuss the reasons for the fall of the Umayyads.

     The question requires that candidates offer a considered and balanced review of the reasons for
     the fall of the Umayyad dynasty. Causes may predate the timeframe but must be clearly linked to
     the issue raised in the question. Candidates may refer to the rise of military opposition within the
     empire, including rebellions by Syrian contingents in the Umayyad army; conflicts with religious
     leaders and other religious tensions, especially discontent among the Shia; difficulties posed by
     ethnic rivalries between Arabs and non-Arabs; the weakness of dynastic leaders such as Al-Walid
     II; as well as other social and economic issues. While other relevant factors, for example, long-term
     resentment dating back to the Umayyad seizure of power may be discussed, the bulk of the
     response will remain on the issue raised in the question.


2.   Evaluate the importance of Harun al-Rashid to the development of science and philosophy during
     the Golden Age of Islam.

     The question requires that candidates make an appraisal of the importance of Harun al-Rashid in
     the stated context, weighing up the strengths and limitations of his contributions. Candidates may
     refer to his foundation of the House of Wisdom, his economic support of scholarship and his
     enthusiasm for innovation. Limitations of his importance may encompass the general support
     enjoyed by scholarship in the Islamic world, the importation of knowledge from conquered areas
     such as India, Egypt and Iran, as well as the political unity of the Islamic world and the ease of
     communication. Other individuals such as al-Ma’mun may be mentioned to provide context to the
     importance of Harun al-Rashid; however, the focus of the response must remain on him. Both
     science and philosophy must be referred to but there does not have to be an equal emphasis on
     each.
                                                 –5–                  N19/3/HISTX/HP3/ENG/TZ0/AF/M


Section 2: The Fatimids (909–1171)

3.   Discuss the reasons for, and the results of, the Fatimid conquest of Egypt.

     The question requires that candidates offer a considered and balanced review of both the reasons
     for and the results of the Fatimid conquest of Egypt. The causes may predate and the results may
     go beyond the timeframe but they must be clearly linked to the issue raised in the question.
     Candidates may offer equal coverage of causes and results or they may emphasize their
     discussion of one of these; however, both aspects will be a feature of the response. Candidates
     may refer to a range of reasons such as weakening ‘Abbasid power, strong Fatimid military forces
     and the popularity of Fatimid policies. For results, candidates may refer to Cairo becoming a
     cultural and economic centre, subsequent territorial expansion across North Africa and the Middle
     East, and the development of an extensive network of trade in the Mediterranean and Indian
     Ocean.


4.   “The decline of the Fatimids was the result of external challenges.” To what extent do you agree
     with this statement?

     The question requires that candidates consider the merits or otherwise of the argument that
     external challenges led to the decline of the Fatimids. These military challenges to the caliphate
     contributed to its territorial contraction and eventual demise; they may include those posed by the
     Seljuk Turks, the Crusades and Saladin. Candidates may also stress the rebellion of the Zirids,
     who pledged allegiance to the rival empire of the Abbasids. However, to balance their arguments,
     candidates may argue that internal challenges such as dynastic disputes and rivalries, racial and
     doctrinal conflicts, as well as economic weakness were contributory factors. Candidates may also
     refer to the growing independence of army generals from the caliph. Candidates may agree, partly
     agree or disagree with the statement.
                                                  –6–                   N19/3/HISTX/HP3/ENG/TZ0/AF/M


Section 3: The Crusades (1095–1291)

5.   Discuss the reasons for the failure of the Second Crusade (1145–1149).

     The question requires that candidates offer a considered and balanced review of the reasons for
     the failure of the Second Crusade. Candidates may refer to the reduced size of the Crusading
     forces prior to the conflict; the division of Crusader armies, with different crusades led by Louis VII
     and Conrad III; the disagreements amongst military leaders; poor relations with the Byzantine
     Empire; the lack of understanding of the nature and strength of Muslim opposition; the weakness of
     the Crusader states; and poor strategy such as the decision to attack Damascus. While other
     relevant factors such as the reasons for the failure of crusades more generally may be referred to,
     the bulk of the response will remain on the issue raised in the question.


6.   Evaluate the role of Godfrey de Bouillon in the First Crusade (1096–1099) and
     Richard I of England in the Third Crusade (1189–1192).

     The question requires that candidates make an appraisal of the role of Godfrey de Bouillon (1096–
     1099) and Richard I (1189–1192) in the crusading movement, weighing up their strengths and
     limitations. Candidates may offer equal coverage of Godfrey de Bouillon and Richard I, or they may
     emphasize their evaluation of one of them; however, both individuals will be a feature of the
     response. A comparative approach may or may not be used. Candidates may refer to their military
     tactics and strategy, influence on the crusading movement, impact on the military and political
     situation in the region and their effect in the West. While other relevant factors, for example the
     importance of other military leaders, may be referred to, the bulk of the response will remain on the
     issue raised in the question.
                                                  –7–                  N19/3/HISTX/HP3/ENG/TZ0/AF/M


Section 4: The Ottomans (1281–1566)

7.   Compare and contrast the impact of the foundation of the Ottoman Empire on Europe and Muslim
     lands.

     The question requires that candidates give an account of the similarities and differences in the
     impact on the stated areas of the foundation of the Ottoman Empire, referring to both areas
     throughout. The impact may extend beyond the timeframe of the section; however, it must be
     clearly linked to the foundation of the Ottoman Empire. Candidates may refer to territorial and
     demographic changes; legal and administrative effects; religious changes and conflicts; economic
     effects with respect to employment in trade and industry; emergence of different social structures;
     military effects and changes in various aspects of culture. Both similarities and differences must be
     clearly indicated but there does not have to be an equal number of both.


8.   To what extent did economic weakness lead to the fall of the Mamluks?

     The question requires that candidates consider the extent to which economic weakness led to the
     fall of the Mamluks. Candidates may refer to economic issues such as the expansion of
     Portuguese trade in the Indian Ocean, a factor that strangled Mamluk commerce in the region, the
     financial mismanagement of the sultanate, and agricultural failures that weakened the economy
     and reduced government income. As a counter argument, candidates may refer to non-economic
     matters such as the effect of war against Tamerlane and internal rivalries in government.
     Candidates may stress the rising military power of the Ottoman Empire in the region, with the
     Ottoman–Mamluk War of 1515–16 being particularly significant in bringing about the final collapse
     of the sultanate.
                                                  –8–                   N19/3/HISTX/HP3/ENG/TZ0/AF/M


Section 5: Trade and the rise and decline of African states and empires (800–1600)

9.    To what extent did changes in trade patterns lead to the decline of the Mali Empire?

      The question requires that candidates consider the extent to which changes in trade patterns led to
      the decline of the Mali Empire. Candidates may refer to the ways in which control over the gold and
      salt trade routes were crucial to the rise of the empire, and how the emergence of rival empires—
      such as the Songhay, which sought to wrest away this control—together with the discovery of new
      goldfields outside of the Mali Empire, were integral to its demise. While other relevant factors, for
      example dynastic rivalries and weak leadership following the death of Mansa Musa, may be
      referred to, the bulk of the response will remain on the issue raised in the question.


10.   Examine the role of the Indian Ocean trade in the rise and growth of the Swahili city states.

      The question requires that candidates consider the interrelationship between the Indian Ocean
      trade and the rise and growth of the Swahili city states. Candidates may refer to ways in which
      entrepot ports such as Kilwa, Malindi and Zanzibar emerged in response to emerging maritime
      trade networks, as well as how wealth generated by the trade promoted territorial expansion along
      the coast, and how its economic influence penetrated the interior as demand grew for goods such
      as ivory and slaves. While other relevant interrelationships, for example the impact of cultural
      factors such as the Islamic faith and Swahili lingua franca on the growth of the city states, may be
      considered to provide context, the bulk of the response will remain on the role of the Indian Ocean
      trade.
                                                  –9–                   N19/3/HISTX/HP3/ENG/TZ0/AF/M


Section 6: Pre-colonial African states (1800–1900)

11.   “Nana was more successful than Jaja in his response to the intrusions of outsiders.” Discuss.

      The question requires that candidates offer a considered and balanced review of the statement.
      Candidates may offer equal coverage of Nana and Jaja, or they may emphasize their discussion of
      one of them; however, both leaders will be a feature of the response. Candidates may refer to
      Nana’s negotiations with the British and his two treaties of protection, to Jaja’s continued exercise
      of a monopoly over the palm oil trade in the Niger Delta, or to the eventual capture by the British of
      both leaders. While other relevant factors—for example the successes of Nana and Jaja as
      effective state-builders whose efforts may have repelled intrusions—may be referred to, the bulk of
      the response will remain on the issue raised in the question. Candidates may agree, partly agree
      or disagree with the statement.


12.   Evaluate the role of economic factors in the unification and expansion of the Ethiopian state under
      Tewodros II.

      The question requires that candidates make an appraisal of the role of economic factors in the
      unification and expansion of the Ethiopian state under Tewodros II, weighing up their individual
      and/or collective importance. Candidates may refer to early expansion and the absorption of
      neighbouring agricultural economies by Tewodros, the integration of his economy with those of his
      subjugated rivals in Shewa and Gojjam, the introduction of a modern tax code and confiscation of
      church lands, and the establishment of an armaments workshop. While other relevant factors, for
      example the role of military factors and diplomacy in his early success, or of the role of economic
      factors in his later decline, may be referred to, the bulk of the response will remain on the issue
      raised in the question.
                                                  – 10 –                N19/3/HISTX/HP3/ENG/TZ0/AF/M


Section 7: The slave trade in Africa and the Middle East (1500–1900)

13.   Examine the role of technological factors and the growth of maritime commerce in the rise of the
      Atlantic slave trade.

      The question requires that candidates consider the interrelationship between technological factors
      and the growth of maritime commerce in the rise of the Atlantic slave trade. Factors may predate
      the timeframe but they must be clearly linked to the issue raised in the question. Candidates may
      offer equal coverage of technological factors and the growth of maritime commerce, or they may
      emphasize their examination of either; however, both aspects will be a feature of the response.
      Candidates may refer to improvements in marine technology, with larger craft allowing for the mass
      transportation of Africans in the Middle Passage, as well as developments in firearms that made it
      possible to undertake larger-scale slaving expeditions. While other relevant interrelationships, for
      example between economic changes and increasing demand for plantation labour in the rise of the
      trade, may be considered, the bulk of the response will remain on those raised in the question.


14.   “Nineteenth century anti-slavery Acts had a limited impact on Africa.” Discuss.

      The question requires that candidates offer a considered and balanced review of the statement
      that 19th century anti-slavery Acts had a limited impact on Africa. Candidates may refer to the
      impact on Africa of specific legislation such as the 1807 Slave Trade Act, the 1833 Abolition of
      Slavery Act, the 1885 Berlin Act, or other legislation introduced by powers other than Britain. They
      may also refer to the expansion of the Indian Ocean slave trade following the crackdown on slaving
      in the Atlantic, and to the enduring prevalence of slavery in the Ottoman Empire and the growth of
      slavery in areas such as Ethiopia. While other relevant factors, for example the role of colonial rule
      as a factor in eliminating slavery, may be referred to, the bulk of the response will remain on the
      issue raised in the question. Candidates may agree, partly agree or disagree with the statement.
                                                  – 11 –                N19/3/HISTX/HP3/ENG/TZ0/AF/M


Section 8: European imperialism and the partition of Africa (1850–1900)

15.   To what extent did chartered companies play an important role in the partition of Africa?

      The question requires that candidates consider the merits or otherwise of the suggestion that
      chartered companies played an important role in the partition of Africa. Candidates may refer to the
      role of chartered companies such as Goldie’s Royal Niger Company, Rhodes’s British South Africa
      Company and Mackinnon’s Imperial British East Africa Company as forward agents of imperialist
      expansion, and analyse the activities of these companies in areas such as exploration, mineral
      exploitation, warfare, treaty-making and the negotiation of protectorates. While other relevant
      factors, such as the role of explorers and missionaries in the partition, and general economic and
      strategic causes, may be referred to, the bulk of the response will remain on the issue raised in the
      question.


16.   Discuss the impact of the Berlin West Africa conference on the partition of Africa.

      The question requires that candidates offer a considered and balanced review of the impact of the
      Berlin West Africa conference on the partition of Africa. Its impact may extend beyond the
      timeframe of the section but any such references must be clearly linked to the issue raised in the
      question. Candidates may refer to Leopold II’s success in persuading other powers to confirm his
      claims to the Congo region, confirmation by those powers that Germany had arrived in the colonial
      game, and the need for “effective occupation” as a precondition for the recognition of any claims of
      sovereignty, a factor which set off a “second scramble” as European explorers clamoured to agree
      treaties with African leaders in the interior of the continent. While other relevant factors, for
      example other causes of the partition that predated the Berlin conference, may be referred to in
      order to contextualize the impact of the conference, the bulk of the response will remain on the
      impact of the conference itself.

Section 9: Response to European imperialism (1870–1920)

17.   “Military strength was the main factor in the decision of African states to resist imperialism.”
      Discuss.

      The question requires that candidates offer a considered and balanced review of the importance of
      military strength in the decision of African states to resist imperialism. Candidates may refer to the
      presence of military strength in states such as Ethiopia, the Zulu Empire and the Mandinka Empire
      which encouraged them to resist and also consider the measures taken against European
      imperialists. Other relevant factors such as the desire to maintain their religious beliefs; the pride
      and determination of individual leaders; opposition to cultural and economic changes brought on by
      European imperialists, may be referred to, but the bulk of the response will remain on the issue
      raised in the question. The existence of alliances with other African states or external forces may
      also be considered. Candidates may agree, partly agree or disagree with the statement.


18.   To what extent was Apolo Kagwa’s collaboration with the British beneficial for Buganda?

      The question requires that candidates consider the effects for Buganda of Apolo Kagwa’s
      collaboration with the British. While assessment of the consequences of his collaboration may
      extend beyond the timeframe, points made must be clearly linked to the issue raised in the
      question. Candidates may refer to the 1900 Uganda Act, in which Kagwa accepted a protectorate
      and loss of independence in return for limited Bugandan autonomy, Buganda’s subsequent
      exercise of sub-imperialism over rival groups, and Britain’s continued dependence on the
      administrative abilities of the Protestant Bakungu chiefs. While other relevant factors, for example
      the failure of Kabaka Mwanga’s earlier policies of resistance, may be referred to, the bulk of the
      response will remain on the issue raised in the question.

Section 10: Africa under colonialism (1890–1980)

19.   Discuss the reasons for, and the results of, the Unilateral Declaration of Independence in Southern
      Rhodesia.

      The question requires that candidates offer a considered and balanced review of the reasons for,
      and the results of, the Unilateral Declaration of Independence in Southern Rhodesia. Results may
      extend beyond the timeframe of the section but they must be clearly linked to the issue raised in
      the question. Candidates may offer equal coverage of reasons for and results of, or they may
      emphasize their discussion of one of them; however, both aspects will be a feature of the
      response. Candidates may refer to the dissolution of the Central African Federation and majority
      rule in Zambia and Malawi, the power of the settler lobby and victory for Ian Smith’s Rhodesia
      Front party, the creation of the Zimbabwe African National Union (ZANU) and the Zimbabwe
      African People’s Union (ZAPU) and the Bush War, and negotiations leading to independence.


20.   Compare and contrast the colonial administrations of Senegal and the Gold Coast.

      The question requires that candidates give an account of the similarities and differences between
      the colonial administrations of Senegal and the Gold Coast, referring to both throughout.
      Candidates may refer to the fact that Britain and France each promoted, with varying degrees of
      success, the economic development of their colonies, with a stress on cash crop production. They
      may also look at how each permitted some measure of constitutional reform leading to self-
      government, and how both identified nationalist leaders with whom they could work (Senghor and
      Nkrumah). On the other hand, the two colonies followed contrasting administrative models, with
      Britain exercising political power through the traditional chiefs and France ruling more directly,
      while Senegal was administered as part of French West Africa and the Gold Coast as a single
      colony. Both similarities and differences must be clearly indicated but there does not need to be an
      equal number of each.

Section 11: 20th-century nationalist and independence movements in Africa

21.   Compare and contrast the contributions made by the Popular Movement for the Liberation
      of Angola (MPLA) and the National Union for the Total Independence of Angola (UNITA) to
      independence in Angola.

      The question requires that candidates give an account of the similarities and differences between
      the contributions of the MPLA and UNITA to the achievement of independence in Angola, referring
      to both throughout. Candidates may refer to similarities such as the fact that the two fought as
      allies during the independence war, with leaders Agostinho Neto and Jonas Savimbi directing
      guerrilla campaigns before jointly negotiating the Alvor Agreement which lead to independence
      from Portugal in 1975. They may also refer to differences such as the fact that the MPLA initiated
      the independence war in 1961 while UNITA took up arms only in 1966, and the differing
      geographical and ethnic powerbases of each movement: the MPLA predominated among the
      Mbundu in the north and in Luanda, while UNITA were stronger in the south among the
      Ovimbundu. Both similarities and differences must be clearly indicated but there does not need to
      be an equal number of each.


22.   Evaluate the role of trade unions in the achievement of independence in Kenya.

      The question requires that candidates make an appraisal of the role of trade unions in the
      achievement of independence in Kenya, weighing up their importance or otherwise. Candidates
      may refer to the significance of industrial strike action in the early days of the nationalist
      movement, the links forged with international trade unionism that helped raise the global profile of
      the nationalist struggle, post-war union agitation leading to a protective labour code, and the
      emergence of union leader Tom Mboya as a leading nationalist politician, especially during
      Kenyatta’s imprisonment and at the Lancaster House conferences. Both importance and limitations
      must be clearly indicated but there does not need to be an equal focus on each. While other
      relevant factors, for example the role of other leaders and groups unconnected to the trade unions,
      may be referred to in order to contextualize the role of trade unions, the bulk of the response will
      remain on that factor.

Section 12: The Ottoman Empire (c1800–1923)

23.   Discuss the reasons for the decline of Ottoman power in the Middle East and North Africa.

      The question requires that candidates offer a considered and balanced review of the reasons why
      Ottoman power declined in the Middle East and North Africa. Causes may predate the timeframe
      of the section but they must be clearly linked to the issue raised in the question. Candidates may
      offer equal coverage of the Middle East and North Africa, or they may emphasize their discussion
      of one of them; however, both aspects will be a feature of the response. A comparative approach
      may or may not be used. Candidates may refer to the difficulties in governing a large and diverse
      empire, incursions of powerful European states, increasing desire for independence by ethnic
      groups, financial and political weakness of the Ottoman government, defeat in wars with various
      states, and developments in Egypt relating to growing autonomy under Muhammed Ali followed by
      British military occupation in the 19th century.


24.   Discuss the reasons why the Ottoman Empire attempted to introduce internal reform in the 19th
      century.

      The question requires that candidates offer a considered and balanced review of the reasons for
      Ottoman attempts to introduce internal reforms during the stated period. Reasons may predate the
      section’s timeframe but they must be clearly linked to the issue raised in the question. Candidates
      may refer to pressures arising from military defeats and loss of territory, economic weakness of the
      Empire, the importation of new intellectual, political and economic ideas, rise of political parties
      demanding reform, more progressive imperial leadership, changing economic and technological
      developments leading to increased interaction with progressive societies in Europe, the need to
      satisfy the demands of national and ethnic minorities. While other relevant factors such as the
      attitudes of foreign powers may be referred to, the bulk of the response will be on the issue raised
      in the question.

Section 13: War and change in the Middle East and North Africa (1914–1945)

25.   Discuss the importance of the First World War to the nationalist movement in Egypt.

      The question requires that candidates offer a considered and balanced review of the issue raised
      in the question. Candidates may refer to British support of the Arab Revolt which encouraged
      nationalists in Egypt, the economic and military burden of the First World War which increased
      Egyptian resentment of Britain, the Fourteen Points which encouraged Egyptian nationalists,
      British suppression of the nationalist movement and leaders, which caused resentment and
      uprisings, and British weakness after First World War which made it difficult for them to control
      Egypt and encouraged them to allow greater independence. While other relevant factors, for
      example revolts in other parts of the Middle East, and personalities such as TE Lawrence, may be
      referred to in order to contextualize the importance of the First World War to the Egyptian
      nationalist movement, the bulk of the response will remain on that issue.


26.   “The Arab–Jewish dispute, up to 1945, was a consequence of British policies.” To what extent do
      you agree with this statement?

      Candidates will consider the merits or otherwise of the statement. Some of the causes of the
      dispute may predate the timeframe of the section but they must be clearly linked to the dispute
      itself. Candidates may refer to the Balfour Declaration and its impact on Arabs and Jews; British
      ignorance of the complexity of the situation in Palestine; British support for Jewish immigration and
      land purchases in Palestine; Palestinian responses such as the Arab Revolt; the fears of both
      sides that they would lack political power; the policies of Nazi Germany, which increased Jewish
      immigration; and the religious, economic and cultural gaps between the two sides that were major
      causes of friction. Candidates may agree, partly agree, or disagree with the statement.

Section 14: Africa, international organizations and the international community (20th century)

27.   Discuss the successes and failures of the East African Community (EAC) (1967–1977).

      The question requires that candidates offer a considered and balanced review of the achievements
      of the East African Community (EAC). Successes and failures may extend beyond the timeframe
      stated but they must be clearly linked to the issue raised in the question. Candidates may offer
      equal coverage of successes and failures, or they may emphasize their discussion of either;
      however, both aspects will be a feature of the response. Candidates may refer to successes such
      as the Community’s moves towards a common market and customs union, to failures such as its
      inability to reconcile the different economic systems of Tanzania and Kenya, and to growing
      political tensions within the EAC emerging from the rise of Idi Amin’s dictatorship in Uganda,
      particularly between Uganda and Tanzania.


28.   “The impact of the Cold War on Africa was positive.” With reference to two African countries, to
      what extent do you agree with this statement?

      The question requires that candidates consider the merits or otherwise of the statement that the
      impact of the Cold War on Africa was positive. Candidates may offer equal coverage of each
      country, or they may emphasize their assessment of either; however, two countries must feature in
      the response. Candidates may refer to economic assistance offered in return for superpower
      alignment (even though assistance often took the form of military equipment), to ways in which
      problems such as corruption were ignored by superpowers, and to the risk of involvement in proxy
      Cold War conflicts. While other relevant factors, for example other causes of conflict between
      states, may be referred to, the bulk of the response will remain on the issue raised in the question.
      Candidates may agree, partly agree or disagree with the statement.

Section 15: Developments in South Africa (1880–1994)

29.   “The Act of Union (1909) benefitted the Boers more than it did the British.” To what extent do you
      agree with this statement?

      The question requires that candidates consider the merits or otherwise of the statement.
      Candidates may refer to the victory of the South African Party in the 1910 elections and
      subsequent political hegemony of Afrikaners; South African involvement in the First World War,
      which led to the Afrikaner Rebellion of 1914 and enduring divisions in Boer society; the
      implementation of segregationist policies that benefited both communities; and the fact that South
      Africa remained part of the British Empire while Anglophone business interests continued to
      dominate the economy. While other relevant factors, for example the impact on the majority non-
      white population, may be referred to, the bulk of the response will remain on the issue raised in the
      question. Candidates may agree, partly agree or disagree with the statement.


30.   Examine the reasons for, and the impact of, township unrest in the 1980s.

      The question requires that candidates consider the interrelationship between the reasons for and
      impact of township unrest in South Africa in the 1980s. Impact may extend beyond the timeframe
      but must be clearly linked to the issue raised in the question. Candidates may offer equal coverage
      of reasons for and impact of, or their response may favour one of the two; however, both aspects
      will be a feature of the response. Candidates may refer to economic distress and the radicalization
      of Africans following the Soweto Uprising; popular disaffection with the Botha government and its
      failure to reform apartheid; the orchestration of demonstrations by groups such as the Congress of
      South African Trade Unions (COSATU); the police crackdown on violence; international outrage
      and the eventual demise of apartheid. While other relevant interrelationships, for example other
      factors leading to the end of apartheid, may be considered, the bulk of the response will remain on
      those raised in the question.

Section 16: Social and cultural developments in Africa in the 19th and 20th centuries

31.   With reference to two African countries, to what extent did colonialism change the role of women?

      The question requires that candidates consider the impact of colonialism on women’s roles in two
      African countries. Candidates may offer equal coverage of two countries or they may emphasize
      their assessment of one; however, two countries must be dealt with. A comparative approach may
      or may not be used. Candidates may refer to how colonialism reduced the prevalence of polygamy;
      increasing access to education; increased economic opportunities, especially in markets; new
      social and cultural roles for women such as in the mission churches. Candidates may also mention
      the increasing burden that fell on women in some areas resulting from the absence of men due to
      the migrant labour system. Candidates may note the limited impact of colonialism in some
      countries due to local factors and the resistance of some African societies to changes introduced
      by colonial powers.


32.   “Colonialism had a limited impact on African art and culture.” Discuss with reference to two
      African countries.

      Candidates will offer a considered and balanced review of the statement. They may offer equal
      coverage of the two countries or they may emphasize one of them in their discussion. However,
      two countries must be dealt with in the response. A comparative approach may or may not be
      used. Candidates may refer to the introduction of new idioms such as the novel as well as new art
      forms such as photography and cinema; new styles such as jazz music and ballroom dancing; the
      impact of Western art schools such as modernism. Anti-colonialism became a major theme in
      African art, especially in literature. Candidates may note that the impact may have been limited due
      to strong traditions, western respect for African styles and the shortness of the colonial presence in
      the countries.

Section 17: Post-war developments in the Middle East (1945–2000)

33.   Compare and contrast the political developments that occurred in Egypt under the leadership of
      Sadat and Mubarak.

      Candidates will give an account of the similarities and differences between Sadat and Mubarak in
      terms of political developments that occurred under their leadership, referring to both leaders
      throughout. Candidates may refer to economic and social developments as a consequence, but
      the main focus should be on political developments. Candidates may refer to their attitudes
      towards democratic rule; the ideological direction of their policies; their policies with respect to
      opposition groups; the area of focus of their policies, for example, economic versus
      military/diplomatic; the degree of authoritarian control they exercised; the direction of their foreign
      policies. Both similarities and differences must be clearly indicated but there does not need to be
      an equal number of each.


34.   Discuss the effects of the Iran–Iraq War on Iran.

      The question requires that candidates offer a considered and balanced review of the effects of the
      Iran-Iraq War on Iran. The discussion of the impact may extend beyond the timeframe but it must
      be clearly linked to the issue raised in the question. Candidates may refer to the extent of the
      physical and human destruction; the economic impact; political and religious issues including the
      entrenchment of the Islamic Revolution and the clerical rule of Khomeini and his successors; the
      social and economic impact on individuals; the consequent territorial changes; the impact on Iran’s
      international position including its relations with the United States as well as other states in the
      region. While other issues unrelated to the war also impacted Iran during this period, the bulk of
      the response will remain on the issue raised in the question.

Section 18: Post-independence politics in Africa to 2005

35.   “Ideology was the main cause of ethnic conflict.” Discuss with reference to two African states.

      Candidates will offer a considered and balanced review of the statement with regard to two post-
      independence African states. Candidates may offer equal coverage of both states or they may
      emphasize their discussion of one over the other; however, both states will be a feature of the
      response. A comparative approach may or may not be used. Candidates may refer to religious or
      political ideologies; social ideology such as ideas of racial superiority, as may have been the case
      with Hutu–Tutsi rivalry in Rwanda and Burundi. While other factors may be referred to such as
      economic rivalries, as was the case in the Nigerian Civil War; external influences and conflict
      resulting from political crisis situations or ecological change; the bulk of the response will remain on
      the issue raised in the question. Candidates may agree, partly agree, or disagree with the
      statement.


36.   “Neo-colonial economic exploitation was the most significant challenge to post-independence
      African states.” Discuss with reference to two African states.

      The question requires that candidates offer a considered and balanced review of the
      statement with regard to two post-independence African states. Candidates may offer
      equal coverage of both states, or they may emphasize their discussion of one over the
      other; however, both states will be a feature of the response. A comparative approach
      may or may not be used. Candidates may refer to colonial-era economic policies that
      focused on production and export of cash crops and minerals and import of manufactured
      goods; political interference by former colonial powers and others in order to dictate terms
      of trade; interference by global organisations such as the World Bank and IMF through
      structural adjustment policies. While other relevant factors, for example illiteracy and
      disease may be referred to, the bulk of the response will remain on the issue raised in the
      question. Candidates may agree, partly agree or disagree with the statement.
