Answer two questions. Each question is worth [20 marks].

1.    Biometric authorization
      Bright Creativa is an advertising company with approximately 100 employees, who work in
      their head office in Seattle. The company has decided to introduce a biometric authorization
      system using fingerprint scanners (see Figure 1). This enables the employees to gain
      access to the company’s resources, for example to enter the building, log on to the company
      network and even purchase items from the company cafe.
                      Figure 1: An employee using biometric authorization to access
                                       the office at Bright Creativa

      The system is linked to the company database. The employee’s identification number
      (employee ID) is the primary key field in the Employee table, which stores their personal
      details. The company database includes other tables that store data on when they access
      the building, the frequency that they log on to the network and the items they purchase from
      the cafe. Some employees are concerned about the increased level of surveillance within the
      company, but the company has reassured these employees that a privacy policy has been
      developed.

      (a)    (i)     Identify two fields that could be in the Employee table of the database.                           [2]

             (ii)    Identify two characteristics of a relational database.                                             [2]

             (iii)   Identify two methods that could be used to ensure that the data input to the
                      database is accurate.                                                                             [2]

      (b)    As part of the implementation of the biometric authorization system, Bright Creativa has
             written a privacy policy.

             Explain three features that Bright Creativa would need to include in a privacy policy
             linked to the company’s biometric authorization system.                                                    [6]

      (c)    To what extent is the employees’ improved access to company resources outweighed
              by their concerns about the level of surveillance by the company?                                         [8]

2.   Wildfire modelling

     The fire control centre in the Kinakora National Park in New Zealand often has to cope with
     the natural phenomenon of wildfires. Staff have been collecting data about wildfires since 1970.

     The size of each fire is measured and the vegetation types affected are recorded. Data on
     the weather conditions is collected from sensors in the park. The staff at the fire control
     centre use this information to fight the fire.

     A new computer modelling system is being developed using the product development life
     cycle (PDLC). With data collected from previous fires, this new system will improve the
     quality of the information available when fighting future fires.

     The new system will enable staff at Kinakora National Park to send information to tourists in
     the park to warn them when they are in danger from a fire.

                              [Source: © International Baccalaureate Organization 2019]


     (a)   (i)     Identify two stages of the product development life cycle (PDLC).                    [2]

           (ii)    Identify two methods that could be used to train the staff to use the new
                   modelling system.                                                                    [2]

           (iii)   Identify two measurements that could be taken by the weather sensors in the
                   Kinakora National Park.                                                              [2]

     (b)   Two methods for informing tourists about wildfires in Kinakora National Park are:
            y Short Message Service (SMS) texting/text messaging
           y Posting information on the Kinakora National Park website.

           Analyse these two methods.                                                                   [6]

     (c)   Evaluate Kinakora National Park’s decision to use computer modelling to develop
           strategies for dealing with wildfires.                                                       [8]

3.   Online learning

     TailorEd is a free online learning system that personalizes students’ learning by providing
     teachers with data about how students are progressing in their courses. Students create a
     personal profile and work through the assignments at their own pace. Teachers can log in to
     the learning system to see how the students are progressing. However, concerns have been
     expressed about the amount of data that is being collected.

     The school has found that when students access the course platform some content is being
     blocked by the school firewall. The network administrator has been asked to investigate the
     situation. Teachers believe that it would be more appropriate to train the students to use the
     platform responsibly, rather than use technology to block their access to certain websites.

                              [Source: © International Baccalaureate Organization 2019]


     (a)   (i)     Identify two ways that the TailorEd system could provide feedback to the students. [2]

           (ii)    Identify two ways that the data collected about students’ academic progress
                   could be used by TailorEd.[2]

           (iii)   Outline how a firewall functions.                                                    [2]

     (b)   There are two possible methods for ensuring students use the TailorEd online learning
           system responsibly. They are:
           y Restrict access to sites that may be considered inappropriate.
           y Educate the students about acceptable use.

           Analyse these two options.                                                                   [6]

     (c)   To what extent do the benefits of collecting students’ progress data outweigh the
           concerns of the students, teachers and parents?                                              [8]

4.   Sharing dashcam* footage with police

     Many police departments have started campaigns to encourage members of the public to
     upload footage of possible offences committed by drivers to police websites. The police are
     looking for footage of activities such as dangerous driving and driving whilst talking on a cell/
     mobile phone (see Figure 2).

     Members of the public can create an account on the police website to upload footage from
     their dashcam (Figure 3). They can also upload their dashcam footage anonymously.

  used to continuously record activity through the vehicle’s windshield/windscreen

     (a)   (i)     Identify one video file type that could be uploaded to the police department server.    [1]

           (ii)    Calculate how long it would take to upload a 1 gigabyte (GB) video file to the
                   police website using 80 million bits per second (Mb/s) internet connection.

                   1 gigabyte (GB) = 1000 megabytes (MB).                                                  [2]

           (iii)   Identify three steps that the public will need to take to upload their footage to the
                   police website.                                                                         [3]

     (b)   (i)     Distinguish between privacy and anonymity.                                              [2]

           (ii)    The police websites include help pages that give the public guidance on files and
                   on how to upload them.

                   Explain why the help pages should provide guidelines about the file format and
                   the file resolution.                                                                    [4]

     (c)   The police are considering using dashcam footage uploaded by the public as part of
           their attempt to reduce the number of accidents caused by dangerous driving.

           Discuss whether this dashcam footage should be used by the police as part of their
           attempt to reduce the number of accidents caused by dangerous driving.                          [8]
