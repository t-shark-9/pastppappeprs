Prescribed subject 1: Military leaders

1.   (a)     What, according to Source A, was the Yassa?                                        [3]

     •     The Yassa was a code of law.
     •     It was intended to be binding on Genghis Khan’s people and their descendants.
     •     It included old traditions, customs, laws and ideas of the Mongols.
     •     It consisted of laws of Genghis Khan’s own devising.

     The above material is an indication of what candidates may elect to write about in their
     responses. It is neither prescriptive nor exhaustive and no set answer is required.
     Award [1] for each relevant point up to a maximum of [3].


     (b)     What does Source B suggest about Genghis Khan’s administration?                    [2]

     • Genghis Khan was central to Mongol administration.
     • In his presence, other Mongols were respectful and submissive.
     • Genghis Khan was an itinerant ruler travelling from place to place with his wife.

     The above material is an indication of what candidates may elect to write about in their
     responses. It is neither prescriptive nor exhaustive and no set answer is required.
     Award [1] for each relevant point up to a maximum of [2].
                                                  –4–                  N19/3/HISTX/BP1/ENG/TZ0/XX/M


2.   With reference to its origin, purpose and content, analyse the value and limitations of
     Source D for an historian studying the role of Genghis Khan in establishing the Yassa.            [4]

     Value:
     • It provides a mid to late 13th century perspective on Mongol history from a Muslim
       historian.
     • As it intends to give a history of Ghengis Khan’s rule it can examine the significance of his
       role in establishing the Yassa in a broader context
     • It reveals that Genghis Khan had successfully established and codified the Yassa.

     Limitations:
     • Because of the broad nature of the chronicle, treatment of the establishment of the Yassa
       may be limited.
     • As an historian who lived in the 13th century, Juvaini had limited access to reliable
       sources.
     • The title of the chronicle [History of the World Conqueror ] may suggest that Genghis
       Khan’s role in the establishment of the Yassa could have been exaggerated.

     The focus of the question is on the value and limitations of the source. If only value or
     limitations are discussed, award a maximum of [2]. Origins, purpose and content should be
     used as supporting evidence to make relevant comments on the values and limitations.
     For [4] there must be at least one reference to each of them in either the values or the
     limitations.

3.   Compare and contrast what Sources A and C reveal about the Yassa.                              [6]

     Apply the markbands that provide the “best fit” to the responses given by candidates and
     award credit wherever it is possible to do so. The following material is an indication of
     what candidates may elect to write about in their responses. It is neither prescriptive nor
     exhaustive and no set answer is required.

     Comparisons:
     • Both sources indicate that the Yassa was codified during the rule of Genghis Khan.
     • Both sources indicate that Genghis Khan had an active role adding laws and/or comments
       (Bilik) to the Yassa.
     • Both sources indicate the Yassa was kept in the treasuries of Mongol princes.
     • Both sources assert that the Yassa existed as a codified document but no complete copy
       is known to still exist.

     Contrasts:
     • Source A suggests the Yassa was a codification of old Mongol customs (to which Genghis
       Khan added further laws) whereas Source C implies that laws and ordinances were
       mainly promulgated by Khan with the aid of his secretaries.
     • Source A suggests that it is possible to recover the Yassa by assembling fragments from
       various sources whereas Source C is more circumspect in this regard.

     what candidates may elect to write about in their responses. It is neither prescriptive nor

     responses.

     Indicative content

     Source A             The Yassa promulgated by Genghis Khan was a codification of ancestral
                          traditions, customs and laws. However, Genghis Khan played a
                          significant role by adding further laws of his own devising.

     Source B             Genghis Khan was central to Mongol administration of the law. The tent
                          in which he sits represents the nomadic nature of Mongol life and the
                          itinerant nature of his rule may have helped establish the Yassa.
                                        –7–                  N19/3/HISTX/BP1/ENG/TZ0/XX/M


Source C        The Yassa was the code of laws promulgated by Genghis Khan who
                added further suggestions or comments to the Yassa known as Bilik
                (knowledge), thus indicating his involvement in the establishment of the
                law. Nevertheless, there is some doubt as to whether the laws were
                written down during Ghengis Khan’s lifetime, and thus it may be difficult
                to assess his direct contribution.

Source D        Genghis Khan established rules and regulations for every circumstance
                and penalties for every crime. He ordered that these ordinances be
                written down on rolls. These were kept in the treasuries of the chief
                princes. Mongol princes acted in accordance with the Yassa.

Own knowledge   Candidates may provide examples of some of the norms included in the
                Yassa and consider its origins as a set of rules created during times of
                war, which aimed to bind together the nomad clans. These
                characteristics, and the fact that the Yassa was kept in secrecy, allowed
                Genghis Khan to make changes to the law as per his needs. Candidates
                may also refer to the appointment of members of Genghis Khan’s family
                as judges to keep the Yassa under his control, as in the case of his son
                Chaghatai who was a significant supporter of Genghis and the Yassa.
                Candidates may consider Genghis Khan’s role in developing and
                keeping the Yassa by discussing its disappearance by the end of the
                13th century.
                Candidates may discuss the impact of other law codes in the Mongol
                Yassa. The expansion into Chinese, Russian and Persian territories, and
                encounters with those peoples’ high cultural standards and legal
                systems, may possibly have influenced Mongol law.

Prescribed subject 2: Conquest and its impact

5.   (a)   What, according to Source E, happened during the meeting between Moctezuma II
           [Motecusuma] and Hernán Cortés?                                                             [3]

           • Moctezuma welcomed Cortés in a respectful manner and/or gave Cortés an
             elevated seat at his right hand.
           • Cortés outlined the Spaniards’ Christian faith and/or was critical of the Aztecs’ gods.
           • Moctezuma reaffirmed the Aztecs’ religious beliefs.
           • Moctezuma indicated his desire to send gifts to the Spanish emperor.

     The above material is an indication of what candidates may elect to write about in their
     responses. It is neither prescriptive nor exhaustive and no set answer is required.
     Award [1] for each relevant point up to a maximum of [3].


     (b)   What does Source F suggest about the relationship between the Spanish and
           the Aztecs during the conquest?                                                             [2]

           • Malinche facilitated a peaceful first encounter between the Spanish and the Aztecs.
           • The Spanish were militarily prepared.
           • The Aztecs treated Cortés with deference/respect

6.   With reference to its origin, purpose and content, analyse the value and limitations of Source E
     for an historian studying cultural interaction between the Spanish and the Aztecs during the
     conquest of Mexico.                                                                              [4]

     Value:
     • The author served under Cortés during the conquest of Mexico and it may be implied
       from the source that the author was present at the meetings.
     • It offers a full account of the conquest of Mexico, therefore detail can be expected.
     • It provides information on how the two sides perceived the other’s belief systems.

     Limitations:
     • The memoirs were written many years after the conquest of Mexico.
     • The author’s Christian faith may have affected how he described the Aztec culture
       and beliefs.
     • It only gives the Spanish perspective of the meeting between themselves and the Aztecs.

     The focus of the question is on the value and limitations of the source. If only value or
     limitations are discussed, award a maximum of [2]. Origins, purpose and content should be
     used as supporting evidence to make relevant comments on the values and limitations.
     For [4] there must be at least one reference to each of them in either the values or the
     limitations.

     • Both sources suggest that the Spanish had superior military technology.
     • Both sources claim that the Spanish considered themselves superior to the Aztecs.
     • Both sources claim that religion played a role in the interactions between the Aztecs and
       the Spanish.

     Contrasts:
     • Source G states the power of the Spanish lay in their military superiority whereas
       Source H claims that their advantage was defined by their self-confidence and ambition.
     • Source G states that the Aztec Empire was at its climax whereas Source H states that it
       was young and still evolving and thus less able to resist the Spanish.

     Indicative content

     Source E             The Spanish wished to convert the Aztecs to Christianity, but the Aztecs
                          were not prepared to abandon their beliefs and accept Christianity. This
                          may have been significant in provoking disagreement.

     Source F             There was a seemingly peaceful encounter between the Aztecs and the
                          Spanish in which the religions of both groups played a significant role.
                          However, the Spanish were prepared to use military force in the
                          conquest of Mexico.

     Source G             The Aztecs interpreted the arrival of the Spanish as the return of their
                          gods. The Spanish considered themselves superior to the Aztecs and,
                          given their significant dissimilarity, there was potential for a cultural clash
                          between the two groups.

     Source H             The Spanish considered the Aztec way of life to be inferior to their own
                          and decided to conquer it in the name of Christianity. Cultural issues
                          played a large role in the defeat of the Aztecs.

Own knowledge   Candidates may discuss the significance of the cultural confrontation
                with further reference to some practices/rituals (for example, the use of
                human sacrifices) and its impact on the conquest. There may be further
                discussion of the effect of Aztec prophecies on their understanding of
                the conquest. There may be further detail on the role of Malinche, who
                played a significant part as translator of Cortés. There may be additional
                details on the role of the Catholic Church, which forced the destruction of
                idols and the conversion of indigenous people during the conquest.
                Candidates may approach this question by discussing the role of factors
                such as economic gain in motivating the Spanish conquest of Mexico.
                Alternatively, candidates may argue that factors such as Spanish
                military/technological advantages, use of horses and the impact of
                disease were more important in the conquest of Mexico.

Prescribed subject 3: The move to global war

9.   (a)   Why, according to Source I, would it be difficult for Japan to defeat China?         [3]

           •   China’s territory could not be completely occupied.
           •   It would be impossible for Japan to seize all of China’s arsenals.
           •   It would be impossible to isolate/blockade all of China.
           •   The Japanese could not prevent the Chinese from taking arms from them.

     The above material is an indication of what candidates may elect to write about in their
     responses. It is neither prescriptive nor exhaustive and no set answer is required.
     Award [1] for each relevant point up to a maximum of [3].


     (b)   What does Source L suggest about Japan’s expansion into China?                       [2]

           • The Japanese army forcibly rolled over everything ahead of it.
           • Britain, France and the US were unprepared/unwilling to prevent the Japanese
             invasion/occupation of China.
           • Japan’s expansion into China was part of their plan to become a world power.

10.   With reference to its origin, purpose and content, analyse the value and limitations of Source I
      for an historian studying the Second United Front in China.                                        [4]

      Value:
      • It was an interview with the leader of the Communist Party Mao Zedong in 1936 and
        contemporary with events.
      • It indicates how Mao wanted China and the Second United Front to be perceived.
      • It details the advantages China would have in a conflict with Japan and the benefits of
        forming a United Front.

      Limitations:
      • The interview was conducted through an interpreter and was not a direct conversation.
      • Mao, aware that his words would be published, may have attempted to garner support for
        the struggle against Japan.
      • It only gives Mao’s perspective on the situation in China.

      The focus of the question is on the value and limitations of the source. If only value or
      limitations are discussed, award a maximum of [2]. Origins, purpose and content should be
      used as supporting evidence to make relevant comments on the values and limitations.
      For [4] there must be at least one reference to each of them in either the values or the
      limitations.

      exhaustive and no set answer is required.

      Comparisons:
      • Both sources maintain that Jiang Jieshi was taken prisoner.
      • Both sources indicate that Zhang Xueliang was negotiating with the Chinese Communist
        Party (CCP).
      • Both sources indicate the involvement of the Soviet Union.
      • Both sources claim that an agreement was reached that Jiang and his government would
        assume the leadership of China in the struggle against the Japanese with the backing of
        the CCP.

      Contrasts:
      • The tone of Source J is optimistic that China was moving towards national unity with the
        formation of the Second United Front whereas Source K is pessimistic, maintaining that
        the Second United Front would collapse once the Japanese had been defeated.
      • While Source K mentions Soviet influence in discussions with the Communists over
        Jiang’s kidnapping, Source J suggests Stalin played a coercive role in resolving the Xian
        Incident.

      Indicative content

      Source I             The Second United Front would make it difficult for Japan to defeat
                           China, however other factors would pose key challenges: China’s size,
                           the location of its arsenals and the advantages of its regionally
                           fragmented economy.

      Source J             The failure to form a Second United Front between the Guomindang
                           (GMD) and the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) risked alienating the
                           Soviet Union and Stalin, who threatened not to recognize Mao and
                           renounce the CCP as bandits. The United Front also brought an end to
                           the Civil War between Jiang and Mao and allowed the GMD and the
                           CCP to combine forces against the Japanese invasion of China rather
                           than fight each other.

      Source K             The United Front would solidify an effective resistance against the
                           Japanese; for it to succeed, Jiang would have to lead it, with the GMD
                           becoming the legitimate government of China. The Soviet Union would

                also support the United Front by resuming military aid to China.
                However, the source is pessimistic on its ability to endure.

Source L        In 1935, there was no resistance to the Japanese occupation of China
                either internally or externally and implies that a new course of action was
                needed to attempt to slow the Japanese advance.

Own knowledge   The Second United Front was significant as it was the first combined
                attempt by the GMD and the CCP to fight Japan. Neither Mao nor Jiang
                were in complete command of the CCP and GMD respectively and the
                creation of the Second United Front came about from the need to
                attempt to reconcile these internal power struggles. With the conclusion
                of the Second United Front, Mao consolidated his position as leader of
                the CCP. Some observers have identified the creation of the Second
                United Front as being the turning point in the history of the CCP in
                China. Following the Xian Incident and the formation of the Second
                United Front, Jiang was re-established as the leader of a unified GMD,
                which was recognized as being the national government of China.
                Militarily, the joining of the forces in the Second United Front slowed the
                Japanese advance initially although not significantly enough to prevent
                Japan invading China in July 1937. The GMD and the CCP retreated
                into the interior to Chongqing and Yenan, forcing Japan to waste
                significant resources in an attempt to defeat them.
                Candidates may suggest that the Second United Front was not
                significant and offer further detail on the continued conflict between CCP
                and GMD. Furthermore, candidates could develop the significance of
                other factors such as Soviet support and the role of US assistance /
                intervention in the war with Japan.

Prescribed subject 4: Rights and protest

13.   (a)   Why, according to Source M, did the opposition resort to violence?                   [3]

            • Peaceful protest had failed.
            • Government actions had become increasingly oppressive.
            • People were frustrated and demanded that their leaders take a more militant
              approach.
            • ANC leaders were concerned that there would be random and uncontrolled unrest
              if they did not organize the violent struggle.

      (b)   What does Source N suggest about the situation of the ANC in 1964?                   [2]

            •   The ANC had to contend with state repression.
            •   The ANC was weakened by the Rivonia Trial.
            •   The ANC could not be held down for long.

14.   With reference to its origin, purpose and content, analyse the value and limitations of Source P
      for an historian studying the Rivonia Trial (1963–1964).                                         [4]

      Value:
      • Written by a person who witnessed the trial at first hand, it provides vivid understanding of
        the circumstances surrounding the trial.
      • As a despatch to a newspaper, it is written to provide a daily account of the events during
        the trial.
      • It reveals the concerns that were felt about the outcome of the trial and what its impact
        may be.

      Limitations:
      • Written during the trial, it does not have an overview of the trial itself, nor of its outcome
        and impact.
      • As a friend of Mandela, Sampson may not be offering an objective view.
      • Written for a British newspaper, it may reflect or foster the pro-Mandela sympathies that
        the source suggests existed in Britain.

      The focus of the question is on the value and limitations of the source. If only value or

      Comparisons:
      • Both sources indicate that the trial was a turning point after a period of growing
        anti-apartheid protest.
      • Both sources suggest that the trial was a setback for the ANC.
      • Both sources indicate that there was international interest in the trial.
      • Both sources emphasize the role of Nelson Mandela in the struggle against apartheid.

      Contrasts:
      • Source P argues that political opposition within South Africa, although diminished, would
        continue to exist whereas Source O states that such opposition was silenced.
      • Source O suggests that the plight of Mandela was public knowledge only in Britain
        whereas Source P suggests this knowledge may have troubled those in the US too.

      Indicative content

      Source M             The ANC had failed in its campaigns of peaceful protest: not only had
                           the movement failed to win any concessions from the South African
                           government but also the government’s crackdown had forced the
                           opposition to go underground and to adopt violent methods.

      Source N             The trial was a setback to the anti-apartheid struggle. Additionally, or
                           alternatively, the government’s attempt to tie down and repress the anti-
                           apartheid movement was ineffectual.

Source O        The government was successful in silencing political protest within
                South Africa—a success achieved through the application of repressive
                measures and actions. However, as a consequence of the Rivonia Trial
                and Mandela’s testimony, the ANC received international attention.

Source P        The Rivonia trial was a severe setback for the anti-apartheid movement,
                but resistance would continue, though in a simpler, more extreme and
                underground form. In addition, the trial received international attention.

Own knowledge   Candidates may argue that by the end of 1964 the movement was
                weakened due to the impact of repressive legislation including “Baaskap”
                laws (1948–1958) and the Treason Trials of 1956, when many leaders of
                the anti-apartheid movement were put on trial for treason. In 1959, the
                South African government outlawed both the ANC and the PAC (Pan-
                African Congress) and in 1962 Mandela was arrested and given a five-
                year prison sentence.
                Candidates may also refer to the potential weakening of the movement
                before 1964 when the anti-apartheid movement split in 1959, when Robert
                Sobukwe formed the PAC after breaking away from the ANC because he
                was opposed to the ANC’s multiracial nature.
                Candidates may also argue that the movement had been weak throughout
                the 1950s due to the ineffectiveness of peaceful mass protests such as
                the opposition to the Pass Laws which resulted in Sharpeville massacre.
                However, candidates may suggest that the movement was strengthened
                by the signing of the Freedom Charter in 1955 which demonstrated
                some white support. In addition, the MK (“Umkhonto we Sizwe”) and
                “Poqo” were formed in 1961 and there was support for MK from the
                Soviet Union and other African countries.

              to support the tribunal.
            • Russia’s view was that it was “politicized” and that it complicated negotiations.
            • Bosnian officials believed that it would end the tragedy in the region.
            • China’s view was that it may damage peace talks.

      (b)   What does Source T suggest about the indictment of Slobodan Milosevic?                   [2]

            • There was a long road of death and destruction leading to the trial of Milosevic.
            • The indictment would lead to Milosevic being tried in The Hague.
            • Milosevic was unconcerned by the indictment and the impending trial.

      Value:
      • The author is an expert in war studies.
      • It aims to consider the role and practice of the International Criminal Tribunal for the
        Former Yugoslavia, ICTY (the tribunal).
      • It provides detail about the events that led to the arrest and extradition of Milosevic to
        the tribunal.

      Limitations:
      • Given its publication date, the source has limited hindsight on events.
      • It is a general book on the tribunal.
      • It focuses on international pressure for the arrest and transfer of Milosevic to the
        tribunal following the indictment and lacks balance on internal factors leading to his arrest
        in Serbia.

      The focus of the question is on the value and limitations of the question. If only value or
      limitations are discussed, award a maximum of [2]. Origins, purpose and content should be
      used as supporting evidence to make relevant comments on the values and limitations.
      For [4] there must be at least one reference to each of them in either the values or the
      limitations.

        extradition.
      • Both sources refer to the role of international pressure in his extradition.
      • Both sources agree on the date that Milosevic was ultimately transferred to The Hague.

      Contrasts:
      • Source R places greater significance on the domestic situation in Serbia whereas
        Source S attributes the arrest more to the actions of the US.
      • Source R suggests that the Serbian people turned against Milosevic, allowing for his
        arrest, whereas Source S highlights the role of ICTY prosecutor del Ponte in gaining
        momentum for the arrest.
      • Source R refers to an aid package of $40 million that was provided to Serbia, whereas
        Source S states that $1.3 billion in aid was pledged.

      Indicative content

      Source Q             The international reaction to the International Criminal Tribunal for the
                           Former Yugoslavia’s (ICTY’s) indictment of Milosevic was mixed; the US
                           and Bosnia viewed its action as a positive move toward peace in the
                           region whereas Russia and China deemed it politically damaging to
                           peace talks.

      Source R             The indictment by the tribunal made Milosevic more vulnerable in Serbia
                           and helped the Serb people realize that a Milosevic regime meant
                           corruption, oppression, death, and a future of international isolation and
                           economic desolation.

      Source S             A success was that the indictment of Milosevic was pursued by the
                           tribunal prosecutor Carla del Ponte. However, his extradition to
                           The Hague was only realized after the US imposed conditions for a
                           US$100 million aid package and set a deadline of 31 March 2001.

                eventually transferred to The Hague to stand trial.

Own knowledge   Candidates may argue that the tribunal had some success from its
                establishment in May 1993 under UN Resolution 827. The establishment
                of the tribunal and its subsequent indictments may have deterred further
                atrocities in Kosovo. In April 1999, the US referred to the tribunal when it
                stated that any army commander who encouraged or was involved in a
                war crime would be held personally responsible. The tribunal indicted
                four other Serbs alongside Milosevic. His indictment may have been a
                factor in Milosevic’s move towards settling the conflict.
                Candidates may refer to the limitations of the tribunal’s response, noting
                that Milosevic ignored the tribunal until his indictment. In 1998, the
                Yugoslav government refused to cooperate with the tribunal as it
                claimed it was dealing with terrorism in Kosovo. It was not the tribunal’s
                actions but the NATO bombing campaign that led to the end of the
                conflict. The tribunal was also criticized for being under the control of
                NATO and lacking a broad international base. The link between handing
                over indicted individuals in exchange for financial rewards also
                undermined its credibility.
