Instructions
Section B is assessed by the assessment criteria found below and published in the subject guide.

Criterion A (Range of evidence) assesses to what extent the evidence represents both prescribed
passages and supplementary reading. A candidate is expected to:
• use relevant examples from the prescribed passages to support the response (candidates are not
   expected to provide exact quotes)
• demonstrate knowledge of historical, political and cultural contexts beyond those embedded in the
   prescribed passages.

Criterion B (Understanding and argument) assesses how well the response demonstrates understanding
of the chosen option. Ideally, a candidate will:
• build a critical analysis that responds directly to the prompt in a clear, logical and imaginative way
• fully address the contexts and background knowledge pertinent to the examples related to the chosen
    option.
                                                                                                   Total: [12]

Criterion A: Range of evidence
• To what extent does the evidence represent both prescribed passages and supplementary reading?

         Marks           Level descriptor

           0             The work does not reach a standard described by the descriptors below.

           1             The response includes weak evidence from the prescribed passages only.

           2             The response includes specific evidence from the prescribed passages only.

           3             The response includes evidence from both the prescribed passages and
                         supplementary reading.

           4             The response includes specific evidence from both the prescribed passages
                         and supplementary reading.

Criterion B: Understanding and argument
• How well does the response demonstrate understanding of the chosen option?
• How well is the argument constructed?

       Marks         Level descriptor

          0          The work does not reach a standard described by the descriptors below.

         1–2         The response demonstrates a limited understanding of the chosen option
                     without addressing contexts and background knowledge pertinent to the
                     examples.
                     The argument has limited focus, coherence and development.

         3–4         The response demonstrates limited understanding of the contexts and
                     background knowledge pertinent to the chosen examples.
                     The argument has focus but has limited coherence and is not developed.

         5–6         The response demonstrates an understanding of the chosen option by
                     addressing contexts and background knowledge pertinent to the examples in a
                     limited way.
                     The argument has focus and coherence but is not developed.

         7–8         The response demonstrates an understanding of the chosen option by
                     addressing contexts and background knowledge pertinent to the examples.
                     The argument has focus and coherence, and is developed.
