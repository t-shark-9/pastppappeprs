                                              Section A
1.   (a)   State two elements, other than a cash flow forecast, of a business plan.                      [2]

           •   An executive summary
           •   A business description
           •   A market analysis
           •   Financial forecasts
           •   Marketing strategies
           •   Organization strategies
           •   Business objectives
           •   Mission/vision statement
           •   Human resources plan
           •   Type of organization
           •   Analysis, provided the candidate gives some specifics (PESTLE, SWOT, ratio, etc)
           •   Forecasted: profit and loss and balance sheet

           Accept any other relevant, meaningful element (eg product portfolio).

           N.B. If a candidate states mission and vision statements, award [1]. If a candidate states
           either vision or mission statement, award [1]. If a candidate states forecasted profit and loss
           account or forecasted balance sheet, award [1]. If a candidate states both forecasted profit
           and loss account and forecasted balance sheet, award [1].

           Do not award a mark for information such as table of contents, name and address of
           business, index, etc. Also, do not accept executive personnel introduction, as in this case
           that would be totally irrelevant.

           Award [1] for stating an appropriate element of a business plan (application not
           required), up to a maximum of [2].

           Accept slightly different headings / format.

           N.B. Allow candidate own figure rule (OFR): if a candidate makes an error in one
           row and carries it through the remainder of the forecast that is only one error. This
           provision includes both mathematical errors and conceptual errors (for example, if a
           candidate has the interest in the incorrect month then candidates should only lose
           [1] for that error.

           If a candidate misclassifies an item, like salary, as an inflow, consider that one error.
           Award [1] if the candidate conveys some understanding of what a cash flow forecast
           is, but otherwise the forecast is largely inaccurate, incomplete, or illegible.

           If the candidate produces a cash flow as below:


                                         Month 1      Month 2     Month 3     Month 4

            Closing Balance                (300)          (655)     325         1350


           Award a maximum of [5] if otherwise fully correct. Deduct any further marks
           according to the guidance above for mathematical and conceptual errors.
                                      –8–                  M19/3/BUSMT/SP2/ENG/TZ0/XX/M


Award [2–3] if a cash flow forecast is drawn, but either it is not in a generally
accepted format or it is untidy, and/or the forecast contains three or more errors,
which could include, in addition to number placement problems and mathematical
errors, conceptual errors (using the word “profit” rather than “net cash flow”) or
omissions, such as not having a line like “closing balance” or totals.

Award [4–5] if the cash flow forecast is drawn essentially correctly and neatly in a
generally accepted format, but there is one error for [5] or two errors for [4].

Award [6] if the cash flow forecast is drawn accurately and neatly in a generally
accepted format, and is error free. If the candidate provides a heading of total
inflow/outflow without using another heading above of inflow or outflow – do not
penalise as an omission.

If the candidate omitted both headings of outflow/inflow  one error substituting the
term “net profit in the cash flow forecast for “net cash flow” is inaccurate and [1]
should be deducted. If the candidate has only one row for all cash outflows, deduct
[1] from the total mark awarded.

Full working is not expected.

(c)   Explain one problem that Las Migas may experience as a new business.                     [2]

      • Banks and suppliers are sometimes reluctant to give credit to new businesses
        with no trading records. The local bank may not lend Carolina the money she
        needs to set up the bakery, especially if the market is already very competitive.
        Her personal savings, as for many start-up owners, are insufficient.
      • Many start-up owners may lack management skills, leadership skills, etc.
        Carolina has no experience with financial records, account and estimates, which
        are vital for business survival. Carolina’s lack of managerial skills can be risky
        and jeopardize Las Migas’ survival.
      • Las Migas will have to face competition from established bakeries. In a small
        town, will demand be enough for another bakery? As a start-up, Las Migas will
        have to find a USP to survive and build its own customer base.
      • One problem that Las Migas could face is that the salary expected is low relative
        to her rent as she tries to establish her business. She might have a personal cash
        flow issue.

      N.B. Accept cash flow problems/a need for finance, referring to the cash flow forecast
      constructed.

      Do not accept “legal issues”, as it is a reasonable assumption that Carolina is
      operating within the law.

      Award [1] for a relevant generic problem identified or described and [1] for any
      additional explanation in context.

      [2] cannot be awarded for the problem if the response lacks either explanation
      and / or application.

      For example: for identification or a description of the problem with or without
      application [1].

      For explanation of the problem with no application [1].

      For explanation of the problem and application [2].

2.   (a)   Define the term trade credit.                                                           [2]
           Trade credit is an important source of short-term finance available to businesses. It
           allows a business to buy goods and/or services on account without making
           immediate cash or cheque payments.

           Candidates are not expected to word their definition exactly as above.

           Award [1] for a basic definition conveying the idea that it allows a business to buy
           goods/services without making immediate cash or cheque payments Award an
           additional [1] for stating that it is a short-term source of finance [2].

     (b)   Using the financial data for DuffJD for 2018, calculate:

           (i)    the contribution per unit per item laundered (no working required);              [1]

                  sales price per unit – variable costs per unit  contribution
                         $2.00         –         $0.50            $1.50

                  contribution = $1.50

                  Award [1] for the correct response. No working required.

           (ii)   the margin of safety (no working required).                                      [1]

                  number of units sold – break-even number of units  margin of safety

                  margin of safety  150 000 units

      Award marks as follows:
      [1] for a correctly labelled and accurately drawn total revenue (TR) line – can be TR
      or revenue (but not “Sales” on its own).
      [1] for a correctly labelled and accurately drawn total cost (TC) line.
      [1] for identifying the break-even point. Ideally, the candidate will draw an arrow
      pointing to the break-even point and label the arrow. However, accept as an
      accurately labelled break-even point a vertical line from the x-axis to the break-even
      point, provided that the line is labelled “break-even point”.
      [1] for correctly labelling BOTH axes – x-axis must have both costs and revenue;
      y-axis must have some indication of quantity, eg, units/quantity/items laundered.

A break-even chart that is not drawn to scale can be awarded a maximum of [2].

The break-even chart below should be awarded [2]. The candidate has correct TR,
TC, both axes, and BEP. However, the chart is not to scale. Therefore, the award is
capped at [2] because the x-axis is not to scale.




Be mindful of positive marking. If a candidate mislabeled one axis and the TC line
(called it VC), the response would still receive [2] because the candidate had gotten
correct the TR line and the BEP.

Also, be mindful that the own figure rule (OFR) applies. If a candidate incorrectly
calculates the break-even quantity when determining the margin of safety (question
(b)(ii) above) and then uses that incorrect break-even quantity when drawing their
break-even chart, accept the break-even quantity in the chart. The candidate will have
already lost marks for the incorrect calculation in (b)(ii). Do not double penalize.

(d)   Explain how an increase in competition may affect DuffJD’s margin of safety.                  [2]

      An increase in competition may have two effects on DuffJD – they may lose a contract
      with one or more of its current three clients and thus will sell less laundry services. A
      loss of sales will reduce DuffJD’s margin of safety. The increase in competition may
      also force down prices. A decrease in price will increase the break-even level of output
      and thus reduce the margin of safety.

      Award [1] for a candidate displaying a sound understanding of the term margin of
      safety.

      Award a further [1] if the candidate identifies that the margin of safety is likely to fall
      for either of the two reasons indicated above.

           Features of batch production include:
           • Limited quantity produced according to specific specifications.
           • Non-continuous: batches are produced at intervals.
           • Batches more from stage to stage of production together (in other words, stage 1,
             one process occurs. Then, the batch moves to the next stage, where another
             process is done, etc).

           Accept any other relevant feature.

           Award [1] for each feature identified up to [2].

     (b)   Draw a possible organizational chart for a manufacturing firm like AI if it is organized by
           function.                                                                                     [2]




           The organizational chart does not have to appear exactly as above. Award [1] if the
           candidate demonstrates some understanding of an organizational chart. Award [2] if
           the candidate draws an organizational chart that is organized by function and has at
           least three functional areas labelled (operations, marketing, accounting and finance,
           HR, etc).

(d)   Explain how delegation might help AI improve its delivery times.                           [2]

      Delegation occurs when authority and responsibility are passed down the chain of
      command and subordinates are empowered to make decisions. When properly
      done, delegation leads to more effective decision making by subordinates, as they
      now feel the weight and bear the responsibility for their decisions. In the case of AI,
      if employees who deal with the customers’ orders and manage the operations line
      had greater authority, they could better align customized sales, which requires some
      reconfiguration of tooling for each batch, with capacity and availability.

      Award [1] for some understanding of delegation and award an additional [1] for an
      explanation of how delegation could improve delivery time.

(e)   With reference to AI, discuss Lloyd’s view that being a small organization has merits.    [10]

      Advantages of being a small business include:
      • can implement change quickly (flexibility)
      • can maintain relationships with customers and employees
      • can maintain consistency of brand identity
      • management can focus, including having tight control over operations
      • there are fewer risks associated with overtrading.

      Disadvantages of being a small business include:
      • less recognition/awareness in the market place
      • fewer opportunities for economies of scale
      • less ability to compete on price
      • lesser access external sources of finance.

      AI is transitioning into a large organization, but its growth affects the business. AI,
      for example, is not delivering orders on time, customers are complaining about
      product quality, and the company is not making the same margins it previously was.
      Unless AI can specifically pinpoint benefits from higher market share, which
      presumably explains the rapidly rising sales, the company may want to consider
      whether its sales growth is worth the problems.

4.   (a)   Define the term revenue streams.                                                        [2]

           Revenue streams refer to the different sources of sales revenue that a firm may
           have. Often, as firms grow, they attempt to diversify revenue streams as a way to
           find sales growth in saturated markets or as a way to offset risk (if sales revenue
           from one revenue stream declines, perhaps it can be offset by sales growth in
           another revenue stream).

           Award [1] for a partial answer that conveys some understanding and [2] for a
           complete response that shows full understanding. Candidates do not have to word
           exactly as above. Simple exemplification is insufficient for a second mark. There
           must be some definition or description.

     (b)   Explain one advantage and one disadvantage of WE changing its legal status to a
           public limited company.                                                                 [4]

           Advantages of changing legal status to a public limited company include:
           • Access to greater sources of finance, either debt or equity, which WE may well
             want given its plan to grow externally through acquisition.
           • Greater prestige and name recognition, which may help WE as it approaches and
             acquires additional business.

           Disadvantages of changing legal status to a public limited company include:
           • The initial and ongoing cost of being a public company, which requires extensive
              paperwork and filings with the government, as well as regular communication
              with shareholders. As WE is struggling to maintain margins, having additional
              expenses may further contribute to lower profitability.
           • Public disclosure to shareholders and media prevent WE from being more private
              in how it operates. Greater privacy with respect to strategy and direction could
              help WE more easily implement its strategies.

           Accept any other relevant advantage or disadvantage.

           Mark as 2 + 2.

           For [2], candidates must identify an advantage or disadvantage, explain it, and
           apply it to the stimulus.

     (c)   With reference to WE, distinguish between internal and external growth.                 [4]

           Internal growth occurs when a business increases sales revenue through expansion
           of current operations, typically by building more capacity, hiring more sales people,
           or having more channels of distribution. WE’s growth, up until it decided on a
           programme of external growth, was always internal and in the carpet industry.

           External growth occurs when business grows through some activity related to
           another business external to the original one. When WE decided to purchase
           additional companies, it was acquiring revenue streams and operations from other
           firms, which allowed for rapid growth.

           Accept any other relevant advantage or disadvantage.

           Mark as 2 + 2.

           For [2], candidates must identify an advantage or disadvantage, explain it, and

(d)   Discuss whether WE should retain its programme of corporate social responsibility
      (CSR).                                                                                      [10]

      Much debate exists around the question of CSR. Some companies advocate it,
      arguing that CSR is a way to balance corporate power with corporate responsibility
      despite the fact that having a programme of CSR increases costs in the short term
      and that there is no certainty that it will enhance business performance in the long
      run (though a slight positive correlation appears to exist).

      Others argue that a company’s only responsibility, other than obeying the law, is
      increasing profits for shareholders. CSR makes a company less efficient. If all
      businesses in an economy are operating at less than optimal efficiency, the
      economy as a whole will suffer (just as each individual business will).

      In the case of WE, the question of CSR is complicated. On the one hand, the brand
      identity of WE was built first on ecological sustainability and, later, on a full
      programme of CSR (thus economic and social sustainability as well). To suddenly
      change focus and adopt a totally profit-oriented mentality, as Milton Friedman
      argues, could hurt WE’s brand identity in the marketplace.

      On the other hand, WE has experienced a steady erosion in margins (and, thus,
      profitability). Were the company to continue to allow this to occur, in the long run,
      WE would put itself at risk. Some disagreement internally exists, with the CEO
      believing the issue is the costs of expansion while the CFO has suggested that it is
      the costs of CSR.

      WE should undertake a full marketing audit to determine the impact of CSR on its
      brand identity, as well as a thorough financial and managerial costing analysis to
      determine the true source of declining profitability. Without that investigation, WE will
      have difficulty knowing whether it should continue with CSR.

      For a balanced argument, a candidate must have two arguments for and two
      arguments against CSR. At least one of the arguments for and against can be
      purely theoretical, while at least one argument for and one argument against must
      be based upon application to the stimulus. If the candidate does not make
      judgments on conclusions, maximum award: [6].

5.   (a)   Define the term retained profit.                                                             [2]

           Retained profit is profit that is not given to shareholders in the form of dividends but
           is held back as part of shareholder equity to provide a source of funds for possible
           future activities.

           Accept any other relevant definition.

           N.B. no application required. Do not credit examples.

           Award [1] for a basic definition that conveys partial knowledge and understanding.

           Award [2] for a full definition that conveys knowledge and understanding similar to
           the answer above. A candidate must demonstrate an understanding that retained
           profit is part of shareholder equity and that it can be used as a source of funds for
           possible future business activities.

     (b)   Explain one advantage and one disadvantage for CH of having a mission statement.             [4]

           Advantages for CH of having a mission statement include:
           • Provides an example of where a business currently sits in the eyes of its
             stakeholders, such as customers, employees and managers. CH produces vital
             anti-venom vaccines, but its mission statement demands that CH carry out its
             operations in a socially responsible manner. Mission statements can have an
             influential role in setting organizational objectives.
           • CH’s mission statement may act as a motivating force for employees and could
             lead to low staff turnover and/or benefits for the recruitment of new employees.

           Disadvantages include:
           • Some mission statements may be written as vague statements of intent. It can be
              difficult to ascertain exactly what the business stands for in terms of setting
              sustainable business objectives. This may discourage some investors. CH is
              stating that profitability is secondary after CSR. Yet this profitability is being used
              to finance future growth and research. Investors may not commit funds given this
              perceived confusion from the mission statement.

           Accept any other relevant advantage/disadvantage.

           Mark as 2 + 2.

           • For an identification or a description of one advantage/disadvantage with or
             without application [1].
           • For explanation of one advantage/disadvantage with no application [1].
           • For explanation of one advantage/disadvantage and application [2].

           Application must refer to the issues around CH having a mission statement.

(c)   Explain two possible external sources of finance CH could use to continue production
      of anti-venom vaccines.                                                                     [4]

      The question is sufficiently broad to allow candidates to explain a range of possible
      sources of finance, but any candidate who looks at internal organic sources, such as
      increasing sales/profits, must be not given credit.

      Possible external sources include:
      • As CH is a private limited company, the decision could be taken to raise funds
        through an initial public offering. CH could be “floated or listed” on the appropriate
        local share market to raise funds.
      • Angel investors who have strong ethical/CSR intent could provide funds.
      • The NGO has demanded action. Given the number of deaths and injuries from
        snakebites, the NGO could be approached to provide new finance or
        governments in those countries predominantly affected. There could be the
        possibility of a private public partnership.

      Accept any other relevant possible source.

      Mark as 2 + 2.

      • For an identification or a description of one possible source of external finance
        with or without application [1].
      • For explanation of one source with no application [1].
      • For explanation of one source and application [2].

      Application must refer to the possible sources of finance for production of anti-
      venom vaccines of anti-venom vaccines.

(d)   Discuss CH’s decision to stop producing anti-venom vaccines.                               [10]

      Answers at the top level will look at the ethical arguments of retaining the production
      of anti-venom vaccines versus the final implications for doing so.

      CH’s mission statement alludes to “putting customers first and profits second”. The
      decision to stop producing the anti-venom vaccines will be viewed as hypocritical by
      stakeholders and will lead to a loss of its market leader status. There could be a
      consumer backlash/boycott, and this will hamper marketing attempts for any new
      life-saving vaccines. The drop in revenue could be considerable and as a result
      there may be no profits to finance research and development. The comments from
      the NGO are unhelpful and will bring increased scrutiny and further unwelcome
      publicity. Stopping production may damage the economic sustainability of CH to the
      point where they may cease to exist.

      However, the increased competition and wave of price reductions cannot be
      ignored. We must assume that this new competition has a product that competes
      with CH on price because, as the market leader, we would assume CH has a certain
      degree of brand loyalty. Clearly, consumers see the competition from Brazil, Mexico
      and India as a substitute, and unit sales of CH’s vaccine have fallen significantly. If
      CH does not stop production and cut its losses now, it may not have time or finance
      to develop new life-saving vaccines, through which it may be able to recreate its
      market leader status.
                                       – 23 –              M19/3/BUSMT/SP2/ENG/TZ0/XX/M


The profit motive is the reward for entrepreneurial initiative and risk. CH is quite
within its rights to stop production of a loss-making vaccine and switch to a market
that may be underdeveloped, albeit one with considerably more risk. Ironically, if the
decision to stop production is made quickly, CH may be the beneficiary of some
panic buying, boosting short-term revenues before the anti-venom vaccine is
withdrawn from the shelves.

Given the ethical and moral issues in this case, CH may be wise to wait and carry
out some further market research on the competition. It is indicated that for two
years, the new competition will be unable to fill the gap left by CH if it decides to
leave this market. CH is still the market leader. Possibly CH could emphasize its
product quality over the competition and see if this acts as a spur.

A conclusion with judgment is expected.

A balanced response is one that covers at least two arguments for and at least two
arguments against.

                                           Section C
Questions 6–8. Please mark the candidate response using the assessment criteria on
pages 6–7.

6.    With reference to an organization of your choice, discuss the ways in which ethics can
      influence innovation in an organization.                                                 [20]

7.    With reference to an organization of your choice, examine the impact of culture on
      organizational strategy.                                                                 [20]

N.B. Although the question asks for the application of one concept on another, it is still
expected that Business Management content will be aligned with the concepts especially the
second concept (the one being acted on).

Please note that candidates can conclude that there was a minimal impact, however it has to
be based on balanced arguments and evaluation.

Additional guidance in relation to the assessment criteria
For each criterion, the aim is to find the descriptor that conveys most accurately the level
attained by the candidate, using the best-fit model. It is not necessary for every single
aspect of a level descriptor to be met for that mark to be awarded.

• The highest level descriptors do not imply faultless performance and should be achievable
  by a candidate.
• A candidate who attains a high level of achievement for one criterion will not necessarily
  reach high levels of achievement for the other criteria and vice versa.

If only one concept is addressed:
• Criteria A, B, C and E: award up to a maximum [3].
• Criterion D: full marks can be awarded.

Where the question asks for impacts of two concepts on content, examiners must allow for
unbalanced treatment of the two concepts throughout a candidate’s response. One concept
may be more significant than the other.

Criterion B
For [2]: “…connection is not developed” should be treated the same as superficial.


Criterion C
1  1 arguments are expected per concepts.
• Questions 6 to 8 require consideration of the impact of one concept on a second concept
   – therefore accept 2  2 arguments for a balanced response.
• Justification is through logic or data.
• For [2] there is no balance as there are no counter arguments at all, or the arguments are
   all one-sided then this would be unjustified.
• For [3] there are some balanced arguments – some of which are justified.


Criterion D
• Introductions need to be concise and related to the question.
                                                     – 26 –             M19/3/BUSMT/SP2/ENG/TZ0/XX/M


• The candidate’s response does not to have explicit headings for each structural element.
• A body is the area in which the substance of arguments occurs. It is usually located
  between the introduction and the conclusion.
• Fit-for-purpose paragraph means that ideas are presented in a clear academic way. For
  example, one idea per paragraph.

Criterion E
• One example of an “individual” could be an individual consumer or an individual manager.
   However, this cannot be considered with a “group” of consumers or a management team.
• For [4], a balanced response: look at the perspectives of both individual and group(s).
• The chosen individual, group needs to be applicable and relevant to the question with
   specific explanation.
• Candidates need to go beyond stating the stakeholder.
• Please do not use the adjective ‘inappropriate’ in the descriptor for 2 marks. If
   inappropriate award 1 mark
• Candidates need not explicitly say “stakeholder”.

In section C, the question rubric explicitly states that “organizations featured in sections A and
B and in the paper 1 case study may not be used as a basis” to candidate’s answers to
questions 6, 7 and 8. When this happens please award marks as follows:

Criterion A: award a maximum of [1]. The business management content cannot be relevant
if the organization is fictitious.
Criterion B: 0 marks – there is no connection to a “real-world organization”
Criterion C: award a maximum of [1]. The arguments cannot be relevant if the organization is
fictitious.
Criterion D: mark as normal.
Criterion E: award up to a maximum of [1]. The individual and/or group perspective(s) cannot
be relevant if the organization is fictitious.

Additional guidance for questions 6,7 and 8

Q6

Accept examples of CSR /environmental issues as being ethical. The question expects
application of one concept on another. Candidates are expected to discuss ethics and its
impact on innovation and not to discuss these two concepts separately. In other words, each
example of ethical behaviour should be applied to a real innovation the company created
/adopted and thereafter the impact on various stakeholders. (the impact is really of innovation)

Q7

Accept organizational culture or national culture.

Accept any relevant organizational strategy.

Q8

Please note that the question is about organizational change / some major strategic change
rather than a change in product/product adaptation strategy in marketing for example,
McDonalds in India. To achieve the highest marks for Criterion E and Criterion B candidates
are expected to examine the impact of organisational change due to globalisation on different
stakeholders. Candidates may explain how globalization impacted on a particular individual
(CEO) or a group in a position to create/initiate an organisational change. The question is not
about the impact of globalisation directly on stakeholders.
