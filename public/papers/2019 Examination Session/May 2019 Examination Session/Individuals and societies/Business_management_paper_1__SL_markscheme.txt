                                              Section A
1.   (a)   With reference to RDM, describe how changes in operations management altered
           its relationship with two other business functions.                                      [4]

           The shift in operations management from a traditional industrial manufacturing
           process to an automated process altered its relationship with the following business
           functions:
           • Human resources: RDM changed its recruitment from semi-skilled young people
              who had just completed their education at a local technical secondary school to
              university graduates with degrees in engineering or computer science. This shift
              almost certainly necessitated a shift in approaches to leadership and motivation.
           • Marketing: In the process of becoming an automated manufacturing process,
              RDM fundamentally changed its marketing mix. Though the decision to shift from
              kerosene stoves was market driven (declining demand), the automated process
              allows RDM to customize products and make, as in the case of the aluminum
              water bottles, wholly new products.
           • Accounting and Finance: Prior to automation, RDM made uniform products on a
              large scale. Pricing decisions would have been relatively rare – setting a fixed
              price for a product. Now that the business is making customized products, pricing
              decisions have to be made with virtually every order, which involves people from
              the accounting department. Whereas RDM had capital expenditures prior to full
              automation, it also had substantial revenue expenditures in the form of payroll.
              With automation, the mix of capital versus revenue expenditures shifted in the
              direction of more capital expenditures. This shift requires significantly different
              approaches to finance.

           Candidates should name the functions, but they can be implicit.

           N.B. R&D is not a business function.

           Accept any other relevant changes.

           Mark as a 2 + 2.

           Award [1] for an appropriate business function identified and an additional [1] for
           some description of changes in context. Award a maximum of [2] for each function
           described.

     (b)   Explain how RDM’s transformation of its manufacturing process from traditional
           mass production to highly automated production affected the interests of internal
           stakeholders.                                                                            [6]

           • Employees – jobs will change, different skills, highly trained engineers and
             computer scientists.
           • Managers – tasks will change, management role different.
           • Shareholders – may have sacrificed dividends for investments but reaped
             benefits later.

           Accept any other relevant internal stakeholders.

           Marks should be allocated according to the markbands on page 5.

           Award a maximum of [3] for a theoretical answer, or for only considering one
           internal stakeholder.

Award a maximum of [5] if the answer is mainly descriptive but in context.

Award a maximum of [6].

2.   (a)   With reference to RDM, outline one advantage and one disadvantage of Jan’s
           leadership style (lines 88–89).                                                          [4]
           Jan’s leadership style is democratic with hints of laissez faire. A simple assertion
           that it is democratic or is laissez faire is insufficient for context.
           Advantages:
           • Employees feel that they have more freedom and more say in the operation of
             the business.
           • Greater sense of autonomy and purpose, which fosters creativity, innovation and
             teamwork.
           • It extends responsibility for decision making to a broader group, increasing the
             likelihood of employees exercising authority more responsibly. When engineers
             contact customers to help them with their design, for example, they know that
             they are representing the business to the outside world and must bear that
             responsibility.
           • Most employees like this leadership style.
           Disadvantages:
           • It is less orderly than the style of Jan’s father. According to the case, despite an
              atmosphere of “teamwork, diversity, humour and fun,” sometimes RDM now
              seems a bit chaotic.
           • Decision making can take longer. When Kristián ran the business, he made all
              the decisions, and he could make them as quickly (or take as long) as he wished.
           • Some employees want the type of clearer guidance often found in autocratic
              management.

           Accept any other relevant advantage or disadvantage.
           Mark as a 2 + 2.
           Award [1] for an appropriate advantage and [1] for a disadvantage identified and an
           additional [1] for application to the points identified. Maximum award: [4].

           N.B. The case study states the leadership style is democratic, but there are hints of
           laissez faire. Mention of either “democratic” or “laissez faire” on their own is not
           enough for an application mark, there needs to be use of the actual context to gain
           application marks.

(b)   Explain how innovation at RDM may have influenced their marketing practices.                 [6]
      Innovation: introduce something or some process that is new.
      Prior to changing to healthcare products, RDM’s marketing practices would have been
      based on:

      For SL and HL:
      • Product: a consumer-durable product, a product at the end of its life cycle, a standardized
        product
      • Place: presumably distributed/sold through retailers? A country/market emerging from
        communist rule
      • Promotion: little evidence of a formal marketing mix
      • Price: fierce competition, low prices.

      Additional for HL:
      • Process: unclear
      • Physical evidence: relevant?
      • People: a “conservative” family business

      There was little evidence of a marketing strategy so these items are not coordinated.
      Post innovation marketing practices based on:

      For SL and HL:
      • Place: completely different market – the healthcare sector, likely to be sold directly, not
        through retail
      • Product: range of products, customized products, different production processes
      • Promotion: now CSR business, implications for marketing. Possibility of marketing using
        IT
      • Price: lower costs, lower prices. Now likely to be individually negotiated. Needs prices for
        a wider range

      Additional for HL:
      • People: personal contact with customer
      • Process: different way of meeting customer needs, direct contact with customers
      • Physical evidence: relevant?

      Other issues include change in target market, change in nature of market (growing), creating
      USP. After innovation, these practices will need to be included in a coordinated marketing mix.
      Accept any other relevant explanation.

      Marks should be allocated according to the markbands on page 5.
      Award a maximum of [3] for a theoretical answer or for limiting answer to only considering
      one market practice.
      Award a maximum of [5] if the answer is mainly descriptive but in context.
      Award a maximum of [6].

3.   (a)   Describe two changes in the external environment that have affected RDM.                    [4]

           A number of changes in the external environment are referred to in the stimulus.

           Social:
           • Changes in how people heat their homes (declining use of kerosene stoves).
           • The aging population of Europe increasing demand for medical care.

           Technological:
           • The Czech Republic’s improvement in the country’s IT infrastructure
           • Changing use of technology by customers eg smartphones (could also be
             classed as a social factor).

           Economic:
           • The change in economic system from communist/command to market.
           • The integration of the Czech Republic into the broader economy of central and
             Western Europe.

           Ecological:
           • Increased use of renewable sources of energy.

           Political:
           • The change in Czechoslovakia from communist to democratic.

           Legal:
           • Compliance with EU regulations.

           Ethical:
           • Growth in CSR since the 1980s.

           N.B. No need for candidates to actually mention STEEPLE features by name.
           There may be some other external factors that are relevant eg competition, changes
           in demand which can also be included.

           Mark as 2 + 2.

           Accept any other relevant change in the external environment.

           Award [1] for each change in external environment identified, up to [2], and award
           [1] additional per external factor identified for appropriate description and application
           to the stimulus.

           Maximum award: [4].

(b)   Explain how the methods used to motivate employees could have changed when RDM
      transformed from traditional mass production to highly automated production.           [6]

      Historically:
      • RDM was a traditional manufacturing firm.
      • It was hierarchical, its leadership was autocratic.
      • The business had many workers, who were expected to perform relatively simple
         functions repeatedly.
      • In such an environment, motivation typically relies upon paying workers more for
         high productivity. Workers can in turn accelerate their work if they want to earn
         more.
      • Its motivational approach was, in all likelihood, Taylorist.

      After change (to highly automated):
      • RDM had to hire different types of “workers”: highly trained engineers and
         computer scientists.
      • Employees of this type are typically less motivated by money and more by what
         Daniel Pink refers to as autonomy, mastery and purpose.
      • Employees want the freedom to do jobs without being micro-managed; they want
         to develop themselves professionally so that they become experts in their field,
         and they want to know that they are doing more than just making money, that
         they are connected to some larger purpose.

      In the case of RDM:
      • The changes in leadership style have given employees more autonomy to work
          with customers to help them.
      • The core competency of RDM is cutting edge automation and innovation
          suggests that the engineers and computer scientists themselves must be masters
          in their area of expertise to stay on the leading edge.
      • Candidates are not bound to mentioning either Taylor, Pink or other theorists.
          They may refer to other appropriate theorists. In their selection, however, they
          must convey some understanding that most employees now will not be satisfied
          with traditional money-based incentives alone.

      Accept any other relevant explanation.

      Marks should be allocated according to the markbands on page 5.

      Award a maximum of [3] for a theoretical answer or for limiting answer to only the
      traditional situation or to only the highly automated situation.

      Award a maximum of [5] if the answer is mainly descriptive but in context.

      Award a maximum of [6].

4.   (a)   State two reasons for selecting a specific location for production.                          [2]

           Reasons for selecting a specific location of production include:
           • Access to resources or raw materials.
           • Access to appropriate technologies, including infrastructure.
           • Proximity to markets.
           • Proximity to suppliers, including suppliers of financial services.
           • Proximity to other firms in the industry or related (clustering)
           • Access to available appropriate workforce.
           • Access to transportation systems.
           • Cost of land.


           Accept any other valid reason.

                 Answer: exactly 4 years

                 Award [1] for the correct workings and [1] for the correct answer with the unit “years”:

      (ii)   the average rate of return (show all your working).                                 [2]



             ARR = [(80 000 000 – 64 000 000) ÷ 5 ÷ 64 000 000] x 100 = 5%



             Award [2] for correct answer with working and with the percentage sign.

             Award [1] if the percentage sign is missing,

             Do not credit the formula alone.




(c)   Explain two types of financial rewards, other than salary, that RDM might offer its engineers
      and computer scientists.                                                                   [4]

      Types of financial reward other than salary that RDM might offer its engineers and
      computer scientists include:
      • commission – but difficult for these types of employees
      • profit-related pay – could be suitable
      • performance-related pay (PRP) – but may be difficult to measure performance for
        individual employees
      • employee share ownership scheme – could be suitable
      • fringe payments (perks) – such as company car, health care, etc.

      Accept any other relevant financial reward.

      Mark as a 2 + 2.

      Award [1] for an appropriate financial reward identified and an additional [1] for
      explanation and application. Award a maximum of [2] for each financial reward
      identified, explained, and applied to the stimulus. Maximum award overall: [4].

(d)   Recommend whether RDM should choose Option 1 or Option 2.                                [10]

      With Option 1, advantages for RDM include:
      • Retention of “proprietary” hold on its knowledge of automation and robotics.
      • Continuation of operating in a market (medical devices) that is growing and
        where RDM is known and has a solid performance.
      • Remaining free from relationships with other companies, which can cause
        conflicts. Conflicts could emerge with ZI operational details. They could also
        emerge because of conflicts of culture in the two organizations. Jan has worked
        for years to create a democratic, innovative culture at RDM, which could conflict
        with the more traditional industrial culture at ZI.

      Disadvantages of Option 1 include:
      • Need of capital, which will have to be raised either through issuance of shares or
         debt.

• If long-term finance comes from share capital, dilution of the ownership of the
  Radeki de Dovnic family will occur.
• Loss of opportunity to work closely with another company, from which other
  opportunities may emerge.

Accept any other relevant advantage or disadvantage of Option 1.

With Option 2, advantages for RDM include:
• Substantially lower capital outlay ($6.0M versus $50.0M or $24.0M).
• On balance, a good location near highly profitable markets.
• Potential opportunities that could occur by forming an alliance with ZI. In light of
  RDM’s flexibility in manufacturing, it could easily fill some types of orders for ZI or
  even become one of its suppliers.
• The infusion of innovative ideas from the expansion of RDM’s labour force of
  engineers and computer scientists.



Disadvantages of Option 2 include:
• Loss of proprietary knowledge of automation and robotics, which would be
   passed on to another company that, after the period of the strategic alliance,
   could potentially become a competitor.
• The need to expand significantly the recruiting and training function to find twenty
   more computer scientists and engineers.
• ZI will not want new hires from RDM overseeing the reconfiguration of its
   processes, which will require RDM to transfer many of its experienced people to
   the new location. They may not want to do that (affecting motivation) or may
   refuse to do it (thus leaving RDM and taking their expertise elsewhere).
• Potential problems that come from relationships with other companies: conflicts
   over operation operational details, culture conflict, etc.

Accept any other relevant evaluation.
