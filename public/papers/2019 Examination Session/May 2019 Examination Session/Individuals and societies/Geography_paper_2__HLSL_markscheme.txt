                                              Section A
1.   Changing population

     (a)   State the median age for Country B in the year 2000.                                  [1]

           29 (years). Accept 28–29.

     (b)   State which country has the greatest projected increase in median age between
           2010 and 2040.                                                                        [1]

           Country B

     (c)   Explain one reason why the median age of a population could decrease.                 [2]

           Award [1] for a valid reason for the decrease in median age and [1] for
           explanation of how it affects the median age.

           Valid reasons (dependent on current median age) include:
           • In-migration of youthful people/out-migration of elderly people.
           • High birth rate/rise in birth rate/fertility rate will increase the proportion of
             younger population.
           • Increased mortality among elderly population/decrease in life expectancy.
           • Increase in death rate due to conflict decreases the proportion of independent
             population.

           For example: The arrival of youthful economic migrants [1] means proportionately
           more younger people, reducing the median age [1].
                                            –6–                M19/3/GEOGR/BP2/ENG/TZ0/XX/M


(d)   Explain one environmental consequence of one named forced migration.                 [3]

      The example could be internal displacement or refugees. Accept a broad
      interpretation of “environmental”, to include the built environment and landscape.

      Identified and located example of a forced migration [1]. Identified environmental
      consequence [1]. Further developed explanation [1].

      Environmental consequence of migration may include:
      • Deforestation
      • Soil erosion
      • Contamination of water supplies – rivers/groundwater
      • Depletion of water resources
      • Waste disposal
      • Aesthetic damage
      • Production of environments that breed disease
      • Loss of biodiversity
      • Air pollution
      • Land degradation.

      For example: Northern Cameroon hosts Nigerian refugees who have escaped
      violence [1] this has caused rapid deforestation [1] as refugees need firewood for
      cooking [1].

      For example: Lebanon has many Syrian refugees escaping war [1] the waste
      from informal settlements is often dumped in an uncontrolled manner [1] this
      leads to soil and water pollution [1].
                                                –7–                 M19/3/GEOGR/BP2/ENG/TZ0/XX/M


(e)    Explain one policy designed to prevent human trafficking.                                  [3]

       Identification of a valid policy at societal, NGO, national or international level [1];
       development with details on how it operated/operates [1] further development
       which may include why it was introduced or magnitude of the problem [1].

       Policies may include:
      • Accreditation schemes such as Fair Trade, Global Organic Textile Standard,
        Ethical Trading initiative decrease demand for cheap clothes that cause
        trafficking of labour in LICs
      • Education of individuals to decrease demand for services provided by trafficked
        populations – “John Schools” in USA that are aimed at changing attitudes of
        sex buyers
      • National Agency against Trafficking in Persons in Romania educates target
        groups to increase their awareness
      • Travel restrictions – children not travel without parents’/parent’s signature eg
        Brazil
      • Community activities such as vigilance groups in India that detect trafficked
        population in villages
      • Prosecution of individuals/firms that use trafficked labour or groups that
        organize the trafficking of people by the National Crime Agency in UK
      • Government legislation intended to curb trafficking eg Danish Criminal Code,
        Modern Slavery Act in UK
      • Border controls such as border patrols by South African National Defence Force
        on SA’s northern borders
      • International co-operation – UN Protocol against trafficking
      • Improve the lives of vulnerable groups of people in LICs eg National Referral Mechanism
        (UK agency) improving women’s accessibility to work in Albania.

       For example:
       • Cambodia passed legislation in 2008 [1] that criminalizes all forms of
         trafficking for men, women and children [1]. Fines and prison sentences are
         applied to those convicted [1].

2.   Global climate – vulnerability and resilience

     (a)   Describe the regional distribution of high total greenhouse gas emissions from
           agriculture.                                                                                [2]

           Award [1] for each valid statement, up to a maximum of [2].

           Possibilities include:
           • concentration in East Asia/South East Asia/South Asia
           • Western Europe/Northern Europe
           • Central/Eastern USA
           • almost entirely northern hemisphere.

     (b)   Explain two reasons why increased trade by emerging economies has led to
           increased greenhouse gas emissions.                                                       [2+2]

           Identification of a valid reason [1] and [1] for further development/exemplification of
           how it has led to an increase in GHG emissions.

           Possibilities must be linked to increased trade and could include:
           • Increased export of manufactured goods – increased greenhouse gas
             emissions from factories/industry producing these.
           • TNCs locating manufacturing plants in emerging economies – local
             regulations may be more lax in terms of emissions.
           • Increased trade results in increased greenhouse gas emissions from container
             shipping/aircraft/road transport of goods.
           • Trade in emerging economies may be instrumental in improving standard of
             living – per capita greenhouse gas emissions increase due to increased
             consumption (meat, fossil fuels)
           • Reliance of emerging economies on fossil fuels.

     (c)   Explain how carbon offset schemes and carbon trading might lead to a global
           reduction in greenhouse gas emissions.                                                    [2+2]

           Award [1] for explaining carbon offsetting and [1] for how it could reduce global emissions.

           AND

           Award [1] for explaining carbon trading and [1] for how it could reduce global
           emissions.

           Example: Carbon offset schemes are designed to reduce or offset carbon
           emissions by funding activities and projects [1] such as tree planting or solar
           power which reduce emissions elsewhere [1].

           Example: Carbon trading attempts to create a market in which emission permits
           issues by governments can be traded [1]. Companies that exceed their targets
           have to buy from those that do not – this market system attempts to limit
           emissions [1].

           Award a maximum of [2] for a description of carbon emissions offsetting and
           carbon trading that does not explain how global greenhouse gas emissions can
           be reduced over time by this approach.

3.   Global resource consumption and security

     (a)   Describe what is meant by “embedded water”.                                                 [2]

           Water resources that are used in the production of food and manufactured goods
           in one country/place [1] that are transferred to other, often water scarce,
           countries or regions via trading [1].

     (b)   Explain two reasons why diets are changing in middle-income countries.                  [2 + 2]

           Award [1] for identifying and describing a valid reason, with [1] for explanatory
           development.

           For example: Rising incomes in middle-income countries have given more people sufficient
           disposable income [1] to incorporate more meat into their diets at the expense of
           vegetables and grains [1].

           Other possible reasons include:
           • Health awareness
           • Advertising, especially by multinational food firms
           • Environmental awareness
           • Transition to global food systems
           • Rapid urbanization and shift to energy-dense diets
           • Real term fall in the cost of large number of foodstuffs
           • Globalization/Westernization/Cultural homogenization/Role of TNCs


     (c)   Suggest two ways in which declining water availability might threaten a country’s
           energy security.                                                                        [2 + 2]

           Award [1] identifying and describing a valid way, with [1] for explanatory
           development.

           Possible ways include:
           • less water for HEP production
           • need to safeguard supplies of safe water might lead to fracking being banned
           • falling availability of potable water may lead to increased need for desalinization
              plants (with their heavy energy usage)
           • lack of water needed for steam generation or cooling in thermal/nuclear power
              plants.
           • lack of water for geothermal energy production – water used in drilling/water
              used in cooling/water required in enhanced geothermal systems that rely on
              artificially created reservoirs in rock formations that do not have enough natural
              fluid
           • lack of water may lead to a decline in the production of Biofuels.

           For example: Declining water availability might reduce the input of water into
           reservoirs in hydro-electric power generation schemes [1], so a country that is
           heavily dependent on hydro-power may be unable to generate as much electricity
           as previously and may be unable to meet demand [1].

                                              Section B
4.   (a)   (i)    Estimate the number of Syrian refugees that have settled in Pennsylvania
                  (labelled X).                                                                   [1]

                  102 (allow 101–103)

           (ii)   Determine the increase in the number of Syrian refugees admitted to the US
                  between 2013 and 2014.                                                          [1]

                  204 (Accept this answer only)

     (b)   Using evidence from the population pyramid only, explain one possible challenge
           faced by the US government in resettling Syrian refugees.                              [2]

           Identification of a valid challenge shown in the pyramid [1] quantification evidence
           from the population pyramid [1].

           For example: There are challenges for education/schooling [1] as over 50% [51.1%]
           of the refugees are below 17 years of age [1] / 33.8% between 5 and 17 [1]
           Other possibilities include:
           • Challenges in creating employment opportunities [1] as 46% of working age [1].
           • Challenge of high dependency ratio [1] – approximately 50% [54%] [1]

(c)   To what extent does the infographic offer a flawed representation of the scale of Syrian
           resettlement in the US?                                                                [6]

           The question is asking candidates to examine how well the infographic represents
           the scale of Syrian resettlement. Answers should focus on an appraisal of the flaws
           and strengths of the infographic in showing scale of resettlement and not a critique
           of style.

           Award [1] for each flaw or strength and further [2] max for each supported
           development/explanation up to a maximum of [5].
           Award the final [1] for a supported overall appraisal which weighs up the
           infographic as a whole.
           Award maximum of [4] if only one perspective (flaw or strength) is given.

           For example:

           Flaws:
           • The choropleth map does not give a true representation [1] as it does not give
              absolute numbers [1].
           • It uses emotive language in the key, such as “high” [1], when the actual
              number of refugees arriving in each state is actually very small/insignificant
              [1].
           • Only shows official figures [1] – others may have entered illegally [1].
           • Bar chart does not give a true representation of the changes in the numbers
              admitted [1] as it does not show 2016 data [1] this indicates there was an
              actual decrease rather than constant increase shown in the graph [1].
           • The choropleth map only gives a general picture of distribution in the USA [1]
              and does not show the distribution within the states [1].
           • Age groups on pyramid not even [1] and do not give precise information about
              the demographic structure of refugees [1].

           Strengths:
           • It shows the actual numbers going to the US [1], which can be compared with
              the global number of Syrians displaced [1] which demonstrates that refugee
              numbers are quite small [1].
           • The bar graph shows the temporal change in the numbers being resettled in
              the US [1]; can see how scale of resettlement is not really changing
              significantly [1].
           • The map gives an accurate display of where the refugees have settled [1] and
              shows that large areas of the USA have low numbers or no refugees [1].
           • The infographic shows accurate information [1] as the sources are reputable
              internet sites [1].

           Overall appraisal can be found at the beginning or end of the answer and may be
           a comment such as: The infographic has some strengths but mainly demonstrates flaws.

5.   “Of all the demographic challenges nations face, ageing is the most serious.” To what
     extent do you agree with this statement?                                                  [10]

     Marks should be allocated according to the markbands on pages 3 to 4.

     Perspectives on what constitutes a demographic challenge will vary as they are likely
     to be place- and time-specific. Responses may tackle the question on a regional or
     global scale and a clear understanding of the terms “ageing population” (an increase in
     the percentage of the population over 65) and “demographic challenge” should be
     evident, although not explicitly outlined.

     Possible applied themes (AO2) demonstrating knowledge and understanding (AO1):

        •   Ageing may produce demographic challenges that can be seen as negative
            such as socio-economic impacts, including dependency, grey economy,
            pensions, tax rates, health care etc [Unit 1:3]
        •   Ageing may produce positive socio-economic impacts such as employment
            opportunities, the grey economy, reduced crime rates etc [Unit 1:3]
        •   Other aspects of population structure may cause demographic challenges such
            as youthful populations, gender imbalances, needs of special groups (disability
            and HIV) [Unit 1:3]
        •   Population movements may produce demographic challenges – forced and
            voluntary migrations, rapid/large scale population growth in urban areas [Unit
            1:2]
        •   Population change and resource consumption and neo-Malthusian ideas of
            over-population [Unit 3:3]

     Good answers may be well structured (AO4) and may additionally offer a critical
     evaluation (AO3) which assesses the relative seriousness of the consequences of a
     population ageing in different places and the possibilities of managing ageing
     populations. Another approach might be to focus on other demographic challenges
     identified above and an explanation as to why these are very serious and ageing is less
     so.

     For 5–6 marks
     Expect some outlining of the consequences of an ageing population and/or an alternate
     demographic challenge. The response is partial, narrow or lacks supporting evidence.

     For 7–8 marks
     Expect a well-structured account which includes:
     • either a well-evidenced synthesis which links together several well evidenced
        ageing and demographic themes from the Guide
     • or a critical conclusion (or ongoing evaluation) informed by geographical concepts
        and/or perspectives.

     For 9–10 marks
     Expect both traits.

6.   “Responding to climate change is more important than working towards the UN
     Sustainable Development Goals.” To what extent do you agree with this statement?              [10]

     Marks should be allocated according to the markbands on pages 3 to 4.

     Reponses may tackle the question on a national, regional or global scale and may also consider
     the time frame needed to achieve change. An understanding of climate change and the UN SDGs
     should be evident in the response. Responses may have valid different perspectives on what
     constitutes “important”.

     Possible applied themes (AO2) demonstrating knowledge and understanding (AO1):

        •   The potential consequences of climate change such as sea level change, extreme weather,
            changes to agriculture, spatial changes in biomes, changing hydrology’s [Unit 2:2]
        •   The impacts of climate change on people and places such as health hazards and migration
            [Unit 2:2]
        •   The possibilities to response to climate change
        •   Explanation of the purpose of the SDGs with a focus on some of the 17 goals such as
            gender equity, reducing hunger, and poverty. This may include an outline of how the SDGs
            operate to address issues of resource management [Unit 3:3]
        •   Explanation of the interaction between SDGs and climate change.

     Responses may link the impacts of climate change on the potential outcome of some of the 17 goals.
     Alternatively, a response could see both as interlinked and show how both complement one another.

     Good answers may be well structured (AO4) and may additionally offer a critical evaluation
     (AO3) which examines the statement in a way that shows understanding of the relative importance
     of climate change and SDGs. Another approach may comment on how the relative importance
     may vary between places. Some answers may examine the respective processes and possibilities
     of managing climate change and SDGs at different spatial and temporal scales.
