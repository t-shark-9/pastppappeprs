Answer one question from this section.

1.   Las Migas

     Carolina plans to set up a bakery, Las Migas, in a small town. Competition from established
     bakeries is strong. Carolina has asked for a bank loan because her personal savings are
     insufficient. The bank manager requested the following information:
     yy a business plan
     yy a cash flow forecast for the first four months of operations.

     Carolina has no experience with financial forecasts but she estimated the figures for Las Migas for
     the first four months of operations. These figures are shown in Table 1.

            Table 1: Estimated figures for Las Migas for the first four months of operations

                                                For the first two months of operations: $1500

                                                $45 to be paid every two months starting the first

2.   DuffJD

     DuffJD provides a laundry service for towels and sheets to three hotel chains in a major city,
     Hoyluk. It provides each hotel chain with trade credit.

     Competition in this market is increasing, as two rivals are planning to offer laundry services to hotel
     chains in Hoyluk.

                            Table 1: Selected financial data for DuffJD for 2018

                              Annual fixed costs                             $75 000

Answer one question from this section.

3.   Ace Industries (AI)
     Ace Industries (AI) manufactures plastic containers, mostly for the soft and fruit juice industries.
     The operations management department uses flow production for its standard-sized products and
     batch production for its customized products.
     AI’s sales are growing rapidly. It currently has a 6 % share of the plastic container market. However,
     it has recently struggled to meet customized orders on time. Some customers have complained
     about product quality. Currently, AI is organized by region, which allows the company to have
     strong relationships with customers, who feel that AI knows them and cares about their interests.
     The human resource department is proposing restructuring the organization by function. Not
     everyone at AI agrees with this change. Many think that the problems of late delivery and poor
     quality could be solved through greater delegation.
     Lloyd Rinnegrat, Chief Financial Officer, has suggested that AI’s management think more deeply
     about their rapid growth. Except Lloyd, most people at AI believe that rapidly growing sales
     are good – that by increasing its market share AI will, in the long run, benefit by being a large
     organization. However, Lloyd argues that being a small organization has many merits, as shown by
     the changes in AI’s recent gross profit margins and net profit margins.

                                    Table 1: Selected financial data for AI

                                                  2017                 2018                 2019

                  Sales growth                     14 %                15 %                 12 %

                  Sales                       $327 000 000        $376 000 000         $421 000 000

                  Gross profit margin              57 %               55.3 %                53.2 %

                  Net profit margin                9%                   8%                   7%

     The marketing department has predicted that the soft and fruit juice industries are moving away
     from major mass-produced drinks and toward niche products, such as exotic fruit drinks and
     speciality beverages for very particular markets.

           function.                                                                                     [2]

4.   Willow Enterprises (WE)

     Willow Enterprises (WE) was founded in 1989 originally as a small manufacturer of carpeting
     for high-end commercial and institutional office space. In 1997 the management made several
     strategic decisions:
     yy change from the use of cheap man-made materials to more expensive natural fibres in its
        carpets
     yy change legal status from a private to a public limited company
     yy use profits to increase production capacity and expand the sales force
     yy diversify by taking over other regional businesses, including a retail chain, and transform them
        into environmentally friendly businesses.

     Because of its appeal to environmentally conscious customers, WE became the regional market
     leader and, by 2008, was an important carpet manufacturer at a national level.

     At this time, Chief Executive Officer Simon Dee decided that WE would adopt a far-reaching
     programme of corporate social responsibility (CSR). Every year, WE committed more resources
     to various forms of corporate social responsibility (CSR), such as charitable contributions and fair
     payments to employees and suppliers. By 2018, WE had diverse revenue streams and a brand
     identity strongly associated with corporate social responsibility (CSR).

     For the last few years, WE’s gross and net profit margins have been falling slightly but steadily.
     Simon has attributed the declining profitability to diseconomies of scale and one-off (one-time)
     expenses associated with each takeover. The Chief Financial Officer, Ruth Croft, disagreed.
     She gave Simon a copy of a 1970 article by the economist Milton Friedman entitled “The Social
     Responsibility of Business is to increase its Profits”.

     (a)   Define the term revenue streams.                                                               [2]

     (b)   Explain one advantage and one disadvantage of WE changing its legal status to a
           public limited company.                                                                        [4]

     (c)   With reference to WE, distinguish between internal and external growth.                        [4]

     (d)   Discuss whether WE should retain its programme of corporate social responsibility
           (CSR).                                                                                        [10]

5.   Copper Health (CH)

     Copper Health (CH) was the market leader in the production of anti-venom* vaccines to treat
     poisonous snake bites. CH’s mission – influenced heavily by corporate social responsibility (CSR)
     – is to put customers first and profits second in the treatment of snake bites.

     Despite 100 000 deaths worldwide each year from snake bites and 400 000 serious injuries, CH
     recently announced that it will no longer produce anti-venom vaccines. Several large Mexican,
     Brazilian and Indian pharmaceutical companies have entered the market selling anti-venom
     vaccines at a much lower price than CH.

     A spokesperson for CH said: “We will remain a private limited company where corporate social
     responsibility (CSR) remains an important driving force for our mission. Our medical research is
     only financed from retained profit. When the lower-priced competition arrived, our sales and profits
     of anti-venom vaccines decreased significantly. Treating snakebites no longer makes financial
     sense. Instead, the technology used to produce anti-venom vaccines will be used to research and
     develop (R&D) other life-saving vaccines”.

     A non-governmental organization (NGO) has demanded action. “CH is the largest manufacturer
     of anti-venom vaccines in the world. Although CH’s competitors are increasing their production of
     anti-venom vaccines they will not be able to produce enough to satisfy demand for the next two
     years. There will be a major shortage. This will result in many life-threatening injuries and deaths.”

     The non-governmental organization (NGO) has urged CH to seek new sources of finance to
     continue the production of the anti-venom vaccine.
