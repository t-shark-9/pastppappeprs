Apply the markbands that provide the “best fit” to the responses given and award credit wherever it is
possible to do so. If an answer indicates that the demands of the question are understood and
addressed but that not all implications are considered (for example, compare or contrast; reasons
or significance; methods or success), then examiners should not be afraid of using the full range of
marks allowed for by the markscheme. Responses that offer good coverage of some of the criteria
should be rewarded accordingly. If you are uncertain about the content/accuracy of a candidate’s
work please contact your team leader.

Section 1: The ‘Abbasid dynasty (750–1258)

1.   To what extent did military power play a role in the ‘Abbasid rise to power?

     Candidates are required to consider the role of military power in the rise of the ‘Abbasids.
     Candidates may refer to the rebellion started in 747, led by Ibrahim the Iman and supported by the
     people of Khorasan, the battles in Nishapur, Gorgan, Nahavand and Karbala, and the ultimate
     revolution commanded by Abu al-Abbas as-Saffah in 750–751. Candidates may also suggest that
     the ‘Abbasids relied heavily on Persian military strength from the Khorasan, where there was both
     Arab and non-Arab opposition to the Umayyads. Candidates may suggest that the ‘Abbasid rise to
     power was fuelled by increasing criticism of the Umayyads, who were accused of turning the
     Caliphate into a dynastic institution, which was dependant on bureaucracy. Candidates may refer to
     the role of religious opposition to the Umayyads and the ‘Abbasid ability to attract religious leaders
     to their cause.


2.   “The Sassanian heritage had a significant cultural and political impact on the ‘Abbasid dynasty.”
     Discuss.

     Candidates are required to offer a considered and balanced review of the opinion that the
     Sassanian heritage had a significant cultural and political impact on the ‘Abbasid dynasty.
     Candidates may refer to the number of experienced Iranians in high positions in the ‘Abbasid civil
     administration who took some of their practices to the new caliphate. They can also consider the
     Sassanian influence in the revival of the institution of the vizier, and in the formation of a new Irano–
     Islamic class of secretaries. Candidates may also consider the Sassanian heritage especially
     noticeable in the perpetuation of arts and crafts such as silk, plate, and stucco, as well as in the
     architecture and decoration of palaces. Sciences, especially mathematical methods, were also
     influenced by Sassanian heritage.
                                                    –6–                  M19/3/HISTX/HP3/ENG/TZ0/AF/M


Section 2: The Fatimids (909–1171)

3.   Evaluate the impact of Fatimid ideology on religious relations with Muslims, Coptic Christians and
     Jews.

     Candidates are required to make an appraisal of Fatimid ideology on religious relations with
     Muslims, Coptic Christians and Jews. Candidates may refer to the Ismaili branch of the Shi'a
     followed by the Fatimids who, being a minority amongst Muslims, applied a tolerant policy. The
     caliphs' interest in winning new Muslims through religious persuasion instead of forcing conversion
     also demonstrated their tolerant attitude. Candidates may focus their response on discussions of
     religious relations or they may combine that discussion with examples of the wider impact of
     Fatimid ideology on society as detailed in the markscheme. This had an impact especially
     noticeable in the economy where Muslims, Coptic Christians and Jews shared many activities.
     Since an important part of the revenue for the Fatimids was derived from customs dues, trade and
     taxes, they neither created monopolies nor harassed small merchants and artisans, and allowed for
     close contacts among religious communities. While other relevant factors may be referred to, the
     bulk of the response will remain on the issue raised in the question.


4.   Evaluate the effectiveness of the military reforms of two of the following: al-Mu'izz (953–975); al-
     Hakim (996–1021); al-Mustansir (1036–1094).

     Candidates are required to make an appraisal of the effectiveness of the military reforms of two
     Fatimid caliphs. In the case of al-Mu'izz candidates may refer to the reforms carried out to
     reorganize the army with a standing force and a militia, and the formation of a naval fleet trained to
     protect coastal trade from pirates. These changes proved to be effective against both
     the Berbers of Morocco and the Umayyads of Spain, and facilitated a series of raids on Italy.
     Regarding al-Hakim, candidates may consider the introduction of slave troops on a large scale, a
     useful policy to extend Fatimid power, especially in Syria. Nevertheless, they had a destabilizing
     effect on the relations with the civilian population and did not solve the rivalry among factions in the
     army. In the case of al-Mustansir, candidates may highlight the increment in the number of Turks.
     The payments they received ended up draining the dynasty’s treasure and allowed the Turks to
     take control over important cities.
                                                      –7–                  M19/3/HISTX/HP3/ENG/TZ0/AF/M


Section 3: The Crusades (1095–1291)

5.      Evaluate the importance of the theory and practice of jihad during the Crusades.

         Candidates are required to make an appraisal of the theory and practice of jihad during the
         Crusades. Candidates may refer to the theory of jihad as outlined in the Qur’an however they must
         focus on the practice of jihad during the Crusades. Jihad was not practiced in the early crusading
         period as the divisions in the Muslim world precluded any concept of a united holy war. Jihad
         developed at the beginning of the 12th century as a call to devout Muslims to resist the invaders,
         who were now seen as a permanent threat. Nur-al-Din and Saladin expanded it to unite the Muslim
         forces against the crusaders. The success of Nur-al-Din and Saladin strengthened the appeal of
         jihad and increased their armies. Jihad was also used to eliminate opponents of Sunni Islam, such
         as the Fatimids, this further strengthened Islamic power. Candidates may also refer to the
         influence of the Christian concept of Holy War, as an incentive for the revival of jihad in the Muslim
         world.


     6. Evaluate the consequences of the Fourth Crusade (1202–1204).

        The question requires that candidates make an appraisal of the of the consequences of the Fourth
        Crusade (1202–1204). The Fourth Crusade attacked and captured the Byzantine capital of
        Constantinople. Candidates may refer to the extensive death and destruction caused by the attack
        and the looting of the city. The Byzantine Emperor was replaced by a Western leader and the
        Eastern Church was placed under Roman Catholic leadership. This diversion of the Crusade
        resulted in an advantage to Muslims in the Middle East as they were not attacked, and the
        destruction of the Byzantine Empire weakened their major opponent. The Fourth Crusade greatly
        damaged the prestige of the Crusading movement and reduced support for further expeditions
        which led to further weakness in the Christian kingdoms of the Middle East. The divide between the
        Byzantium and Western Europe was deepened for centuries, which further enabled the expansion
        of Islam. Candidates may also refer to the increased commercial influence of Venice and expanded
        Latin influence in Greece and the eastern Mediterranean.
                                                 –8–                  M19/3/HISTX/HP3/ENG/TZ0/AF/M


Section 4: The Ottomans (1281–1566)

7.   Evaluate the causes and consequences of Safavid contest [competition] with the Ottomans.

     Candidates are required to make an appraisal of the causes and consequences of the Safavid
     contest with the Ottomans. As causes, candidates may refer to territorial disputes, the Habsburg-
     Persian Alliance that menaced the Ottomans, and the pact between the Ottomans and Francis I of
     France. Other causes may include the assassination of an Ottoman governor, and the defection of
     the governor of Bitlis to the Safavids. For consequences, candidates may consider that the
     Ottomans recovered lands in Anatolia, lower Mesopotamia, western Armenia, western Georgia, the
     mouths of the Euphrates and Tigris, and part of the Persian Gulf coast; while Safavids retained
     their north-western territories in the Caucasus. Candidates may also refer to the scorched earth
     policy applied during the war that damaged many territories, and the impact of the war on the
     Franco–Ottoman alliance since the Ottomans could help with only limited naval support during the
     Franco–Ottoman invasion of Corsica (1553). Both causes and consequences must be clearly
     indicated but there does not need to be equal focus on each.


8.   Evaluate the importance to the evolution of Ottoman administration of two of the following: Mehmet
     II (1451–1481); Selim I (1512–1520); Suleiman the Magnificent (1520–1566).

     Candidates are required to make an appraisal of two rulers, weighing up their importance or
     otherwise to the evolution of Ottoman administration. Candidates may consider the establishment
     of the diwan under Mehmet II, and the codification of the law carried out by him, and later by
     Suleiman, addressing issues such as taxation, profits of trade and import–export duties.
     Candidates may also evaluate the policies adopted to gain loyal officers as in the case of Mehmet
     II, whose diwan was formed by officials and religious scholars solely loyal to him and regulated by
     the kanunname, a list of the chief officials, their responsibilities, salaries, and punishments.
     Regarding Selim I, candidates may consider the execution of opposition leaders and members of
     the royal family who were replaced with reliable supporters, the support of the Janissaries, and the
     persecution of heretics to consolidate the Ottoman power. Candidates may also reflect on the
     treatment of minorities as part of the administration as in the case of Suleiman, who gave particular
     attention to Jews and Christian minorities raising their status above serfdom.
                                                  –9–                     M19/3/HISTX/HP3/ENG/TZ0/AF/M


Section 5: Trade and the rise and decline of African states and empires (800–1600)

9.    Evaluate the impact of trans-Saharan trade on the decline of African empires.

      The question requires candidates to make an appraisal of the impact of trans-Saharan trade on the
      decline of African empires. Candidates are required to consider trans- Saharan trade in their
      responses. While considering the role of the trade, candidates may examine how trade contributed
      to tension and rivalry between communities and how this eventually led to the weakening and
      eventual decline of some of the African states. It is important for candidates to give examples of
      states they are referring to in their response. With the decline of trade, some of the states that had
      relied on trade for their wealth and existence also declined. Candidates may also consider the
      rivalry that developed, which aimed to control trade and how this led to the emergence of new
      states and subsequently the collapse of some of the old states.


10.   “Islam was a key factor in the rise of the Mali Empire.” Discuss.

      The question requires candidates to offer a balanced review that includes a range of factors
      demonstrating how far Islam was the key factor in the rise of the Mali Empire. Candidates may
      agree, disagree or partially agree with the hypothesis. Candidates may discuss how the role of
      Islam contributed to the rise of the Mali Empire by considering the role played by two Malian
      Islamic leaders, Sundiata and Mansa Musa. They may consider how Mansa Musa who was a
      devout Muslim was able to use Islam to unify the people and thus set up the Mali Empire. They
      may also discuss the role played by his pilgrimage and how Islam enabled him to acquire
      administrative skills, which contributed to the rise of his empire. Other factors to be considered may
      include, the importance of the role of trade, agriculture and the defeat of Sumanguru by Sundiata.
                                                   – 10 –               M19/3/HISTX/HP3/ENG/TZ0/AF/M


Section 6: Pre-colonial African states (1800–1900)

11.   “Social factors were the most significant cause of the rise of the Zulu kingdom.” Discuss.

      The question requires candidates to offer a balanced review of the statement. Candidates will
      consider a range of factors, with an emphasis on the significance of social factors. Candidates may
      agree, disagree or partially agree with the hypothesis. Candidates may discuss social factors such
      as the amabutho, the role of the clan system, intermarriages and the rapid increase in population.
      Additionally, candidates may consider other factors such as the climate in the Drakensburg area
      which made agriculture possible, Shaka and the Mfecane, the rise of leaders such as Dingiswayo,
      Zwide and the military strength of the Zulu. Candidates may also discuss the role played by the
      centralized system of leadership in the rise of the Zulu Kingdom.


12.   Examine the role of Nana and Jaja in the rise of the Niger Delta trading states.

      This question requires candidates to consider an argument in a way that uncovers the role played
      by Nana and Jaja in the rise of the Niger Delta trading states. Candidates may consider why Jaja
      was seen as the founder of the Opobo state and how Nana contributed to the rise of the Itsekiri
      state. They may examine how Jaja moved from being a slave to the head of the Anna Pepple
      House. Candidates may consider how both leaders were able to influence and absorb
      neighbouring houses and how this contributed to the rise of their states. Jaja formed the Opobo
      city-state as a result of a conflict with the Manilla Pepple house in 1869. Candidates may consider
      the role played by their control of the lucrative palm oil trade in their state development and/or how
      both Nana and Jaja were able to block the British from controlling trade in the area.
                                                  – 11 –                M19/3/HISTX/HP3/ENG/TZ0/AF/M


Section 7: The slave trade in Africa and the Middle East (1500–1900)

13.   Evaluate the importance of planation agriculture to the expansion of the Atlantic slave trade.

      The question requires candidates to make an appraisal of the role played by plantation agriculture
      in the expansion of the Atlantic slave trade. Candidates may consider how plantations were set up
      in the Americas and how these were labour intensive. This led to the search for labour from Africa,
      especially the west African coast. This led to what was known as the triangular trade with the
      transportation of slaves forming a major part of the trade. As the plantation economy in tobacco
      and sugar grew, so did trans-Atlantic trade. Raw materials were exported to industrial countries
      who in turn transported industrial products. Candidates may therefore consider how plantation
      agriculture was important for the expansion of the trade, but may consider other factors that played
      a role, for example the availability of slaves and the growth in industrial development.


14.   To what extent did missionary activities contribute to the decline of the East African slave trade?

      The question requires candidates to consider the merits or otherwise of the argument that
      missionary activities were significant to the decline of the East African slave trade. On the role of
      Christian missionaries, candidates may consider how their introduction of legitimate trade as an
      alternative to the slave trade contributed to the decline of the East African slave trade. They may
      also consider how the introduction of Christianity, which was against slavery, had an impact on the
      trade. Other factors candidates may consider include, the closing of slave markets or the role
      played by the general decline in demand for slaves. Candidates may consider other factors for the
      decline of the East African slave trade, but the focus should remain on the role of the missionaries.

    Section 8: European imperialism and the partition of Africa (1850–1900)

    15.   “The response of other European powers to British actions in Egypt and South Africa was the main
          cause of partition.” Discuss.

          The question requires candidates to offer a considered and balanced review of the statement, with
          which they may agree, disagree or partially agree. Candidates may discuss how British interest in
          the two named areas intensified because of the opening of the Suez Canal and the desire to
          increase mineral wealth respectively. Strategic decisions by Britain in South Africa were crucial.
          The annexation of the Transvaal and the desire to control all of South Africa, to exclude other
          powers was very influential. This stimulated French and German desire for colonial acquisition and
          subsequently led to the partition of Africa. Candidates may argue that the need for raw materials
          due to industrial development in Europe and the role of chartered companies among other factors,
          also played a part in the partition of Africa.


    16.   Evaluate the importance of African military, technological and administrative weaknesses to the
          partition of Africa.

          The question requires candidates to make an appraisal of the importance of African military,
          technological and administrative weaknesses to the partition of Africa. Candidates may discuss the
          role played by the limited military strength of the African forces compared to that of the colonial
          powers, which often led to their defeat. They may also address the limited technological
          advancement and how that contributed to partition. The administrative weakness of the African
          communities may also be considered. Candidates may consider political disunity within African
          communities, which made it easy for colonial powers to conquer them.

Section 9: Response to European imperialism (1870-1920)

17.   With reference to the Asante wars (1873, 1896, 1900), evaluate the reasons for Asante resistance
      and British intervention.

      The question requires candidates to make an appraisal of the reasons for Asante resistance to
      British intervention. The relationship between the Asante and the Fante may be considered.
      Candidates may also consider the British taking over Fante, which was a vassal state of the
      Asante Confederation, thus infringing on Asante sovereignty. Candidates may address the Asante
      desire to control the Gold Coast, which also conflicted with the British desire to control the region
      for economic, political and strategic reasons. Both the British and the Asante were interested in
      controlling trade in the region.


18.   “African leaders collaborated with the colonial powers because they had no alternative.” Discuss.

      The question requires candidates to offer a considered and balanced review of the statement, with
      which they may agree, disagree or partially agree. Candidates must give examples of leaders who
      collaborated in their responses. They may argue that those who collaborated did so because they
      did not have weapons to match those of the colonialists. Some collaborated because they were not
      assured of support by their neighbours and therefore resistance was not a choice. Alternatively,
      they may argue that collaborators had a choice, but collaborated for self-serving reasons, including
      gaining weapons, which they used to attack their neighbours, or, due to the developmental
      opportunities they hoped to gain from the colonial power.

Section 10: Africa under colonialism (1890–1980)

19.   Compare and contrast the nature of colonial rule in one British colony and one Portuguese colony.

      The question requires that candidates give an account of the similarities and differences between
      British rule in any of their colonies, which may include, Nyasaland, Northern and Southern
      Rhodesia and Portuguese rule in their colonies, which may include Mozambique and Angola.
      Candidates must refer to the two systems of rule in their answers. Candidates may compare the
      indirect rule by the British in Nyasaland, Northern and Southern Rhodesia, with the Portuguese
      policy of assimilation in either Angola or Mozambique. Candidates may address how the two
      colonial powers settled on their different policies.


20.   Discuss the social and political developments that took place in the Gold Coast to 1957.

      The question requires that candidates offer a considered and balanced review of the social and
      political developments in the Gold Coast up to 1957. Candidates may discuss how, by 1948,
      resistance to colonial rule had begun. The foundation of the UGCC and the CPP, the Accra riots
      and the emergence of Kwame Nkrumah were important political developments leading to
      independence. Discussion can also be made of the developments in the education system that led
      to the establishment of institutions such as Achimota College in 1927. Further developments in
      education led to the emergence of an African professional class of doctors, lawyers and civil
      servants as well as a successful commercial class. These individuals became the basis for the
      movement to independence. Candidates should limit their discussion to the period up to 1957.

Section 11: 20th-century nationalist and independence movements in Africa

21.   “Trade unions played a significant role in the achievement of independence in Kenya.” To what
      extent do you agree with this statement?

      The question requires that candidates consider the merits or otherwise of the statement.
      Candidates must refer to the situation before independence, noting, for example, the oppressive
      labour policies and industrial relations based on master and servant laws. They may also consider
      the connection between colonial rule and the fight for workers’ rights. Candidates may consider the
      impact of the strikes in the early 1920s, the first registration of trade unions in 1934, and their
      subsequent evolution between 1943 and 1945, as well as the influence of international trade
      unionism. Furthermore, they may address the detention of political leaders in 1952 that pushed
      trade unions to demand independence. Candidates may agree, partly agree or disagree with the
      statement.


22.   Compare and contrast the contribution of nationalist movements to the achievement of
      independence in Senegal and Tanganyika.

      The question requires that candidates give an account of the similarities and differences
      concerning the contribution of nationalist movements to the achievement of independence in the
      named countries. The Tanganyika African National Union (TANU), launched in 1954 by Nyerere,
      supported the union among Africans and rejected any tendency or tradition that could divide them.
      Candidates may refer to the fact that during the negotiations with the British government, TANU
      asked for an elective system, demanded that most political offices were reserved for Africans, and
      supported the claims of African peasants. In the case of Senegal, candidates may consider the
      existence of more than one nationalist movement, the most important of these being the
      Senegalese Democratic Bloc, which was founded by Leopold Sedar Senghor in 1948. In 1958, it
      merged with another political party to become the Senegalese Progressive Union. Candidates may
      reflect on its socialist roots and the adoption of Marxism–Leninism as its ideological basis, and on
      Senghor’s ideas to unite African movements that led to the formation of the Mali Federation, which
      was a short-lived coalition, before its separation and the subsequent achievement of Senegalese
      independence.

Section 12: The Ottoman Empire (c1800–1923)

23.   “The Tanzimat reforms did not modernize the Ottoman Empire.” Discuss.

      The question requires that candidates offer a considered and balanced review of the statement.
      Results of the reforms may extend beyond the timeframe but they must be clearly linked to the
      issue raised in the question. Candidates may discuss the aims of the reforms to establish whether
      they were met. Candidates may refer to difficulties in modernization resulting from the size and
      complexity of the Empire, the attitude of religious leaders to change as well as resentment of
      foreign influence. The financial and governmental structure of the Empire may be considered as
      barriers to modernization. Candidates may consider evidence of successful modernization in the
      areas of education, business and commercial development and improved infrastructure.
      Candidates may agree, partly agree or disagree with the statement.


24.   Discuss the impact of the Balkan Wars (1912 and 1913) on the Ottoman Empire.

      The question requires that candidates offer a considered and balanced review of the impact
      (effects) of the Balkan Wars on the Ottoman Empire. Candidates may offer equal coverage of the
      wars or they may prioritize their discussion of one over the other. However, both wars will be a
      feature of the response. Candidates may refer to territorial losses incurred by the Ottoman Empire,
      and the changes to Ottoman international and military status. The huge number of casualties and
      the apparent weakness of the Ottoman Empire may also be discussed. Candidates may consider
      the internal impact of each of the wars, such as increased opposition to the government, internal
      dissension and conflict and weakened financial power. Candidates may consider the impact of the
      wars on Ottoman diplomacy, particularly its relations with the Balkan states as well as major
      powers such as Germany and Russia.

Section 13: War and change in the Middle East and North Africa 1914–1945

25.   Discuss the effects of Allied diplomacy and the Paris peace treaties on the Middle East to 1923.

      The question requires that candidates offer a considered and balanced review of the effects of both
      Allied diplomacy and the Paris peace treaties on the Middle East to 1923. Candidates may offer
      equal coverage of Allied diplomacy and the peace treaties or they may prioritize the discussion of
      one over the other. However, both must be a feature of the response. Candidates may refer to the
      effects of wartime Allied diplomacy such as the Sykes–Picot Agreement (the focus of which was
      the partitioning of the Ottoman Empire), the Balfour Declaration (which supported the
      establishment of a Jewish homeland in the Middle East), and the Hussein–McMahon
      correspondence. The Paris peace treaties may include, the Treaty of Sèvres (superseded by the
      Treaty of Lausanne). Their impact on several areas in the Middle East should be considered,
      including Turkey, Syria and Lebanon.


26.   To what extent did economic developments in Palestine contribute to Arab–Jewish tensions?

      The question requires that candidates consider the merits or otherwise of the suggestion that
      economic developments were responsible for Arab–Jewish tensions. The causes of the tensions
      may predate the timeframe but must be clearly linked to the issue raised in the question. Although
      the focus of the question is on economic developments, social and political developments may also
      be considered for context. Candidates may refer to tensions caused by Jewish land purchases in
      Palestine, which dispossessed Arabs and raised fears of Jewish majority control. Jewish
      immigration led to expanded Jewish interests in business, unions and agriculture. Other factors
      may include conflict over the political control of Palestine, religious disputes with respect to
      Jerusalem and the Jewish creation of their own armed force, which increased fear among Arabs.

Section 14: Africa, international organizations and the international community (20th century)

27.   Examine the reasons for the failure of the League of Nations to deal with Italian aggression in
      Abyssinia.

      The question requires that candidates consider the interrelationship between the actions of the
      League of Nations and Italian aggression in Abyssinia. Reasons for the League’s failure may
      predate the timeframe but must be clearly linked to the issue raised in the question. Candidates
      may refer to the weakness of the League, withdrawal of major powers, reluctance of Britain and
      France to undermine the Stresa Front, and the lack of enthusiasm for military action in Britain and
      France. Abyssinia as an African country was not a vital interest to other countries as shown by the
      proposed Hoare–Laval pact and the limited resistance by the Abyssinians, which made
      intervention less likely. While other relevant interrelationships, for example, the rise of Germany
      and the Manchurian Crisis, may be considered, the bulk of the response will remain on the issue
      raised in the question.


28.   Evaluate the success of the Southern African Development Coordination Conference (SADCC)
      and the Southern African Development Community (SADC).

      The question requires that candidates make an appraisal of the SADCC and the SADC.
      Candidates may offer equal coverage of the SADCC and the SADC or they may prioritize their
      evaluation of one organization. However, both organizations will be a feature of the response.
      Candidates may refer to the goals of the organizations, the policies and methods used to achieve
      these goals, evidence of and reasons for success or failure in attaining these goals. Areas of
      success considered may include trade, transport, tourism, energy, disaster management, the
      eradication of poverty, and peacekeeping. Both strengths and limitations must be clearly indicated
      but there does not need to be an equal focus on each. While other relevant factors, for example,
      changing political structures and their impact on the success of the organizations may be referred
      to, the bulk of the response will be focused on the issue raised in the question.

Section 15: Developments in South Africa 1880–1994

29.    “The Boers’ attainment of political power was the main consequence of the South African War
      (1880–1902).” Discuss.

      The question requires that candidates offer a balanced and considered review of the statement.
      Although the focus of the question is on the Boers gaining political power, other consequences of
      the war will also be considered. Candidates may address how the war had an impact on British
      policy. Candidates may refer to the Treaty of Vereeniging, which promised eventual self-
      government to the Boers. The Boers were the largest group with voting rights and Britain
      supported them and provided them with financial resources. British disenfranchisement of the
      black South African population strengthened the Boers politically. Apart from the war contributing
      to the change in British attitude, candidates may discuss other consequences of the war including
      the death and destruction that took place during the war. Candidates may consider short- and long-
      term consequences, and/or social and political consequences.


30.   “Mandela played the most significant role in South Africa’s transition to democracy.” Discuss.

      The question requires that candidates offer a considered and balanced review of the statement,
      with which they may agree, partly agree or disagree. The reasons offered may predate the
      timeframe but they must be clearly linked to the issue raised in the question. Although the focus of
      the question is on the role of Mandela, candidates must also consider other factors. Candidates
      may refer to Mandela’s role as the respected leader of black South Africans in the negotiations for
      democracy. His philosophy of peaceful reconciliation and not retribution encouraged co-operation
      with the white government in democracy negotiations. The decision by De Klerk to release
      Mandela and work towards democracy, as well as the role of foreign powers which put economic
      pressure on South Africa, may be considered. Candidates may also discuss the role played by
      other political figures and political parties in South Africa, as well as the changing attitudes of white
      South Africans.
                                                  – 20 –               M19/3/HISTX/HP3/ENG/TZ0/AF/M


Section 16: Social and cultural developments in Africa in the 19th and 20th centuries

31.   Discuss the changing role of women in two African countries.

      The question requires that candidates offer a considered and balanced review of the changes in
      the role of women in two African countries. Candidates may offer equal coverage of the two
      countries, or they may emphasize the discussion of one country. However, discussion of both
      countries will be a feature of the response. Candidates may refer to social, economic and political
      changes in the role of women in the chosen countries. Economic roles may encompass property
      ownership, inheritance and eligibility for employment. Social rights in areas such as marriage,
      divorce, and recognition as legal individuals and education may also be considered.


32.   Examine the impact of colonialism on education in two African countries.

      The question requires that candidates consider the interrelationship between colonialism and its
      impact on the development of education in two African countries. The impact of colonialism may
      extend beyond the timeframe but it must be clearly linked to the issue raised in the question.
      Candidates may offer equal coverage of the two countries, or they may emphasize their
      examination of one country. However, both countries must feature in the response. A comparative
      approach may or may not be used. Candidates may refer to the extent to which an education
      system was developed in the country, number of schools, literacy rates, opportunities for higher
      education. The geographical extent of the education system and its impact on society and culture
      may also be considered. Roles played by highly educated Africans in the development of the
      country and how education contributed to this development may be considered.

Section 17: Post-war developments in the Middle East (1945–2000)

33.   Discuss the successes and failures of the Camp David Accords.

      Candidates are required to offer a considered and balanced review of the successes and failures
      of the Camp David Accords. Among the successes of the Accords, candidates may refer to the
      normalization of relations between Egypt and Israel, the exchange of ambassadors, the launch of
      regular airline flights, the revocation of the Egyptian boycott to trade, and the Egyptian provision of
      oil to Israel. For Israel, the most evident benefit was a peaceful border, and the decrease in its
      levels of alert. Regarding the failures, candidates may refer to the controversy over settlements in
      frontier lands, and the failure of the autonomy talks. The Israeli settler movement was opposed to
      the accords and the Palestinian problem became an inconclusive matter. Besides, the accords did
      not prevent the rising of Islamic extremist groups in Egypt dissatisfied with the decision to make
      peace with Israel, and isolated Egypt from the rest of Arab states.


34.   Evaluate the effects of the 1979 Revolution in Iran.

      Candidates are required to make an appraisal of the effects of the 1979 Revolution in Iran.
      Candidates may consider short and long-term effects in different fields. For political effects,
      candidates may consider the introduction of an Islamic republic, the suppression of secularism and
      the creation of new bodies of government. Candidates may also refer to the strict censorship
      applied to purge opponents from political parties, universities, services, and media. In the
      economic and social fields, Iran has had some success in broadening education and healthcare,
      and diversifying its economy, but was also denounced for corruption and economic inequality.
      Candidates may reflect on the status of women, who were excluded from the workforce and higher
      education. For foreign affairs, Iran experienced difficult relations with Western countries and some
      of its neighbours, especially Iraq. While other relevant factors may be referred to, the bulk of the
      response will remain focused on the issue raised in the question.

Section 18: Post-independence politics in Africa to 2005

35.   Evaluate the importance of personal ambition in the establishment of two single-party states in
      Africa.

      The question requires that candidates make an appraisal of the importance of personal ambition in
      the establishment of single-party states weighing up its importance or otherwise in two African
      countries. Candidates may offer equal coverage of the two countries or they may prioritize their
      evaluation of one. However, both countries must be featured in the response. A comparative
      approach may or may not be used. Candidates may refer to the character, qualifications and
      personal qualities of the individual seeking power as well as their policies, programmes or ideals.
      While other relevant factors, for example, internal problems or conflicts, state of the existing
      government, external pressures, the introduction of new ideologies and examples provided by
      other states may be referred to, the bulk of the response will remain on the issue raised in the
      question.


36.   Evaluate two African states’ return to multi-party democracy in the 1980s and 1990s.

      The question requires that candidates make an appraisal of the experience of two African states’
      return to multi-party democracy in the 1980’s and 1990’s. Candidates may offer equal coverage of
      both countries or they may emphasize the experience in one country, but both countries must be
      dealt with in the response. A comparative approach may or may not be used. Candidates may
      make reference to reasons for the return to multi-party democracy which may include internal
      dissent, economics or external influences. However, they may choose to focus solely on the
      experience of the two countries in returning to multi-party democracy or they may combine reasons
      for the return to democracy with the experience of the return. Experience of the return to
      democracy may include references to success and failure in a number of areas such as social and
      economic policies, political developments and the emergence of new leaders and parties.
