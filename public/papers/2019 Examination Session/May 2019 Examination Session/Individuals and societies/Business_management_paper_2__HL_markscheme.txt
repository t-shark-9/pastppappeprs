                                                  Section A
1.   (a)   State two elements, other than a cash flow forecast, of a business plan.                    [2]

           • An executive summary
           • A business description: accept mission and vision statements as “one” element for [1]
           • A market analysis
           • Other financial forecasts: award [1] for any type of forecasted financial account such as
             break-even forecast / profit loss / balance sheet if the candidate shows understanding that
             the financial information is forecasted / expected for the future, otherwise it is not a plan
           • Marketing strategies
           • Organization strategies

           Award [1] for stating an appropriate example/element of a business plan (application
           not required), up to a maximum of [2]. The two examples/elements need not be
           articulated well.

     (b)   Prepare a cash flow forecast for Las Migas for the first four months of operations.         [6]

           Accept slightly different headings / format such as opening balance at the top or at
           the bottom.
           Do not penalize if there is no overall title as it is not specified in the subject guide,
           unlike the profit and loss account / balance sheet where a title is expected.
           N.B. Allow candidate own figure rule (OFR): if a candidate makes an error in one
           row and carries it through the remainder of the forecast it is only one error. This
           provision includes both mathematical errors and conceptual errors (for example, if a
                                             –7–                 M19/3/BUSMT/HP2/ENG/TZ0/XX/M


      candidate has the interest in the incorrect month then they should only lose [1] for
      that error).

      Allow candidate OFR if they use salary as an inflow deduct [1] for that error, do not
      double penalize as missing from outflow.

      Award [1] if there is some understanding of what a cash flow forecast is, but the
      forecast is otherwise largely inaccurate, incomplete, or illegible.

      Award [2] if the cash flow forecast is in a generally accepted format, or is untidy and/or
      contains more than four errors.

      Award [3] if the cash flow forecast contains three errors.
      Errors could include in addition to number placement problems and mathematical errors,
      conceptual errors (using the word “profit” rather than “net cash flow”) or omissions, such as
      not having a line like “closing balance” or totals.

      Award [4–5] if the cash flow forecast is drawn essentially correctly and neatly in a
      generally accepted format, but there is one error for [5] or two errors for [4].

      Award [6] if the cash flow forecast is drawn accurately and neatly in a generally
      accepted format, and is error free. If the candidate provides a heading of total
      inflow/outflow without using another heading above of inflow or outflow – do not
      penalise as an omission.

      If the candidate omits both headings of outflow / inflow  one error substituting the
      term “net profit in the cash flow forecast for “net cash flow” is inaccurate and [1]
      should be deducted. If there is only one row for all cash outflows, deduct [1] from
      the total mark awarded.

      Full working is not expected.

(c)   Explain one problem that Las Migas may experience as a new business.                         [2]

      • Banks and suppliers are sometimes reluctant to give credit to new businesses
        with no trading records. The local bank may not lend Carolina the money she
        needs to set up the bakery, especially as the market is already very competitive.
        Her personal savings, as for many start-up owners, are insufficient.
      • Many start-up owners may lack financial / managerial skills, Carolina has no
        experience with financial records, account and estimates, her estimated forecast
        might be inaccurate and despite positive closing balances from month 3, Las
        Migas might still experience cash flow problems. Accurate financial planning and
        documents are vital for business survival. Carolina’s lack of managerial skills can
        be risky and jeopardize Las Migas’ survival.
      • Las Migas will have to face competition from established bakeries. In a small
        town, will demand be enough for another bakery? As a start-up, Las Migas will
        have to find a USP to survive and build its own customer base. (More money will
        have to be spent to establish a USP.)
      • Carolina’s monthly salary is expected to be low relative to her rent as she tries to
        establish her business. She might have a personal cash flow issue which may
        distract her from managing her business.

         N.B. Accept cash flow problems/a need for finance, referring to the cash flow
         forecast constructed.
                                      –8–                 M19/3/BUSMT/HP2/ENG/TZ0/XX/M


Award [1] for a relevant generic problem identified or described and [1] for any
additional explanation in context.

[2] cannot be awarded for the problem if the response lacks either explanation
and / or application to Las Migas as a new business.

For example: for identification or a description of the problem with or without
application [1].

For explanation of the problem with no application [1].

For explanation of the problem and application [2]. Such as an explanation of the
impact of competition, creation of brand loyalty / USP etc.

2.   (a)   State two methods of primary market research.                                                 [2]

           •     Surveys
           •     Interviews
           •     Focus groups
           •     Observations

           N.B. No application required. Do not credit examples. Sampling is not a method.

           Award [1] for each relevant method of primary market research identified. Award a
           maximum of [2].

       For example, if one irrelevant figure that belongs to the profit and loss account is
       added, the rest will not match.

       Award [5] if the profit and loss account is accurately constructed in the expected IBO
       format. All the relevant headings of each component/parts are used and correctly
       classified. All relevant figures are presented. No extra irrelevant figures are included.
       The calculations under each part/component are correct and well-presented.

       Deduct [1] for one omission including the overall heading/title. Accept a partial title.

       N.B. If the candidate did not follow the IBO format award up to [2].

       Accept 15.2 % or 15.3%.
       Award [1] for the correct answer (working not required). Candidates must
       show a percentage sign.
       Do not accept 15%, or the formulae.
       Allow candidate OFR.

(c)   Explain one strategy that Enjuice could use to increase its gross profit margin.          [2]

      • Enjuice could increase its gross profit margin by reducing direct costs/cost of
        goods sold. It could use cheaper raw materials or instead, find cheaper materials
        for producing the cans or find cheaper suppliers of cans.
      • Enjuice can reduce labour costs by reducing the wages / salaries of its labour on
        the production line, or by increasing automation in the canning process.
      • Enjuice could decrease the price of its juices. Sales revenue might increase as
        the market for juices is very competitive and customers are likely to be very
        responsive / very price elastic.
      • JIT – perhaps Enjuice can use JIT stock management for aluminum / fruit, or any other
        metals for the canning process to cut cost of holding stock.
      • Technically, if the suggestion of the marketing manager is followed, increasing
        advertising will reduce net profit before interest and tax, but can increase total
        revenue with positive impact on gross profit.

      N.B. Do not accept increase in price given the information in the stimulus.
      Do not credit any suggestion to reduce expenses.

                                                Section B
3.   (a)   Define the term cooperative.                                                                    [2]


           A cooperative is a type of ‘for profit social organization’ that is established owned
           and managed collectively by members, each of whom has a financial interest in the
           business and a say in how the business is run.
           A cooperative operated by its members for their mutual benefit and can be
           organized by producers, consumers or employees

           Award [1] for a partial answer showing some partial knowledge of cooperatives such
           as that it is an organization which is owned and run by all its members.

           Award [2] if there is a further understanding that cooperatives exist for profit but with
           some social objectives that benefit its members.
           Candidates do not have to identify the different types for full marks

           Award [1] for a basic definition that conveys partial knowledge and understanding.
           Award [2] for a full definition that conveys knowledge and understanding similar to
           the answer above.

     (b)   Explain one positive and one negative impact of social media marketing on JP’s
           promotional strategy.                                                                           [4]

           One positive impact of social media (Facebook, Instagram) marketing on JP’s
           promotional strategy is cost effectiveness, the use of various types of social media is
           cheap and often free. This can positively impact on JP’s finance given the financial
           difficulties outlined in the stimulus.

           A second impact could be to strengthen the brand loyalty of the business, given that
           social media marketing is being used by famous musicians with a lot of followers
           which would be important given that JP’s guitars are more expensive than those of
           the competition.

           One negative impact is that celebrities endorsing JP’s guitars can be unpredictable
           and beyond JP’s control. Any poor behaviour or negative publicity can damage JP’s
           branding in the eyes of potential customers. Increased competition has meant that
           JP will need to ensure that its social media marketing presents the right image for
           the business. A negative impact on branding can lead to a fall in demand and further
           financial difficulties.

           Although cost effective, the use of social media marketing may make it difficult for
           JP to accurately measure the impact of its promotional strategy. Given that JP only
           uses social media it is very important for management to assess its effectiveness.
           Also, if social media marketing is not carried out professionally, it could contribute to
           a negative image such as a lack of response to customer complaints being viewed
           publicly.

           Accept any other relevant positive impact / negative impact.
           The impact has to be applicable to social media marketing not any type of
           promotion.

           Mark as 2 + 2.

           For an identification or a description of one benefit / cost with or without application [1]:

      • For explanation of one benefit / cost and application [2].

      Application must refer to the impact of social media marketing on JP’s promotional
      strategy.


(c)   Explain two benefits to JP of using quality circles.                                       [4]
      Candidates can refer to marketing, operation or Human Resource Management
      issues.
      It is expected that the candidates demonstrate explicit understanding of the term/ practice of
      using quality circles.

      The benefits to JP of using quality circles revolve around the
      motivational/productivity/teamwork/cooperation/possible empowerment benefits
      gained from participation. The fact that JP is a cooperative also implies that quality
      circles will align with the culture of the organization (supportive, common goals).
      Meeting together to find better methods of production/ practices creates high quality
      products/ guitars. JP established a Unique Selling Point based on quality which
      creates brand loyalty.
      Empowered staff are more motivated and therefore staff turnover is also very low
      which reduces recruitment costs and training as well as increased efficiency when
      the higher levels of needs/ the motivators of employees are met. There is evidence
      in the case study that JP workers are productive and take pride in their work.


      Accept any other relevant benefit.

      Mark as 2 + 2.

      • For an identification or a description of one benefit with or without application [1].
      • For explanation of one benefit with no application [1].
      • For explanation of one benefit and application [2].

      Application must refer to the benefits to JP of using quality circles.

(d)   Discuss whether JP should accept XYZ’s takeover bid.                                       [10]

      There are a number of compelling reasons as to why JP should accept the takeover
      bid.
      Financially, one may argue that JP needs the financial strengths of XYZ.JP’s
      financial future will be guaranteed. Price competition is eroding sales, indicating that
      financial sustainability is in doubt.

      The number of redundancies will probably be reduced and jobs will be saved. The
      cooperative may be kept intact. However, if the takeover does go ahead then a
      number of roles may be lost due to duplication.

      The stimulus indicates that XYZ has a strong balance sheet, large cash reserves
      and are also experts at marketing. JP is likely to benefit from XYZ’s expertise in the
      latter area given that its brand loyalty and awareness are dependent on social media
      marketing, which can be difficult to control and measure, as the stimulus indicates.
      This marketing expertise and finance will allow JP to promote its products through
      more traditional methods by enhancing/growing brand awareness and loyalty
      further. One may judge this argument as a significant one given the current
      problems that JP is facing
                                        – 14 –              M19/3/BUSMT/HP2/ENG/TZ0/XX/M




However, the motives for the takeover are narrow. They seem to be driven by
financial considerations only. The takeover could change the culture at JP and the
cooperative has already refused to consider the bid. Staff turnover is very low and
the fear is that the takeover may force some staff to consider their position at JP.
Staff turnover may rise, increasing recruitment and training costs, as it is assumed
that quality circles would be kept. Expertise could be lost.


As a large company, the combination of XYZ’s financial power and JP’s
determination to remain as they are will cause conflict. XYZ is likely to be a profit
maximizing organization with few social objectives. JP’s culture will have to change.
JP will not remain as a for profit social enterprise.
XYZ has experience in kitchen appliances rather than producing musical
instruments. Given the competition, XYZ might not be successful unless it finds
ways of reducing costs as marketing might not be effective. Still, one may argue
that marketing and financial expertise are transferable.
XYZ’s management tendency for strict control is highly likely to result in abandoning
the practice of quality circles that requires empowerment and trust. The interest and
motivation of JP’s employees is likely to be diminished considerably with further
implications for quality and branding.
Perhaps JP should reject the offer and find some sources of finance to take the
cooperative through this difficult time as it is likely that remaining as a cooperative is
very important for the members while XYZ has just financial objectives. –as stated in
the stimulus.
The members of the cooperative will have to prioritize their objectives- being a social
enterprise with some mutual benefits of changing into a for profit corporation.

Ultimately, JP may have to revisit its financial forecasts and as a cooperative may
have to take a more pragmatic view. If the warnings of additional jobs being lost
come to fruition, the cooperative will have to accept the offer. The opportunities for
growth in their market are considerable and may allow the business to regain market
share. As the cooperative enjoys the successes of the business, the decision to
accept the bid is warranted, although some concerns over culture loss and
empowerment of the workforce must be taken into account if the transition is to be a
smooth one.

A conclusion with judgment is expected.
Accept any substantiated judgment.



A balanced response is one that covers at least two arguments for and at least two
arguments against.
It is expected that a substantiated judgment is provided

Candidates cannot reach the top two mark bands if the issue of being a cooperative-
for profit social enterprise is not covered.

4.   (a)   Outline two features of autocratic leadership.                                                  [2]

           •   Decision making is carried out by an individual or select few individuals.
           •   Communication tends to be one way only- top down.
           •   Organization is characterized by a role culture.
           •   Any other suitable feature outlined

           Award [1] for each feature identified.


     (b)   Explain one cost and one benefit of a high labour turnover of managers for
           The Warriors.                                                                                   [4]

           Costs of a high turnover of managers include increased recruitment costs and a
           management system that may be confusing for the subordinates to follow if
           managers keep changing. This may have further motivational issues, as the work
           force may be unsettled and impact on the players’ performance.
           From the stimulus, there is evidence that The Warriors recruitment costs are higher
           than desirable given the time spent looking for new managers. More costs will result
           in less funds being available to support The Warriors corporate social responsibility
           practices and risk Dave’s achievement- see bullet points in stimulus.

           Player turnover has also been high, which may impact on teamwork on and off the
           pitch and reduces The Warriors chances for commercial success. There is also
           evidence in the stimulus that two new players who presumably have not gelled yet
           with the team, or The Warriors culture, are unhappy and complained on social
           media. This is bad publicity for The Warriors.

           The benefits are that poorly performing managers are not allowed to make things
           worse for the club. Underperforming managers can be moved on and fresh thinking
           and ideas can be introduced. Dave who is actually very popular with the fans, will
           probably enjoy even further support from the fans if he removes underperforming
           managers or players quickly. The Warriors have not yet won a trophy and the
           appointment of a dynamic new manager has put them on the verge of winning a
           final for the first time.

           Accept any other relevant benefit/cost.
           While managers are technically employees, It is expected that the candidates apply
           the advantages/ disadvantages to the roles/ behaviour of the managers and/or
           possible impact on the players due to the changes in management.

           Mark as 2 + 2.

           • For explanation of one benefit/cost with no application [1].
           • For explanation of one benefit/cost and application [2].

           Application must refer to the high turnover of managers for The Warriors.


     (c)   Explain one cost and one benefit to The Warriors of committing to corporate social
           responsibility (CSR).                                                                           [4]

           The costs to The Warriors of committing to CSR involve the opportunity costs.
           Reduced ticket prices and healthy snacks, etc, divert funds when the funds could be
           used to purchase improved players, hire more experienced managers or improve
                                             – 17 –               M19/3/BUSMT/HP2/ENG/TZ0/XX/M


      spectator facilities. CSR improves the image of the team off the pitch in the eyes of
      the stakeholders, but perhaps greater consideration should be given to what is
      happening on it.

      The benefits of the commitment to CSR include brand development and loyalty
      through the eyes of its junior supporter group – an important group of longer-term
      stakeholders – that are willing to come and watch the games despite lack of success
      which ensures some financial sustainability of the club at a time when they are still
      waiting to win their first trophy.

      The benefits/costs should refer/ apply to The Warriors and not to different
      stakeholders.
      The impact on different stakeholders may be used as long as the final costs/
      benefits refer to The Warriors.

      Accept any other relevant cost and benefit.

      Mark as 2 + 2.

      • For an identification or a description of one benefit/cost with or without application [1].
      • For explanation of one benefit/cost with no application [1].
      • For explanation of one benefit/cost and application [2].

      Application must refer to The Warriors committing to CSR.

(d)   Discuss two methods to resolve conflict for The Warriors other than a lock-out.                 [10]

      The question asks candidates to examine the stimulus and make reasoned
      judgements to suggest appropriate methods to resolve the conflict for The Warriors
      Candidates are expected to be familiar with:
          • Conciliation and Arbitration
          • Employee participation in industrial democracy
          • No strike agreements
          • Single union agreement


      Given the stimulus, it could be argued that with an important final coming up and
      The Warriors being on the verge of winning their first trophy and given the lock-out,
      Dave is highly likely to push for non- strike agreement as any action such as strike
      action is likely to result in an irreversible negative impact and can easily be used by
      the players to send a message to Dave : they are serious about Dave’s actions but
      do not wish to jeopardize being in the final. The players have clearly had enough of
      Dave’s autocratic style and wish to see a change.
      Dave and the fans are likely to be very worried as short term strike action is
      possible and could send a very serious message to stakeholders that the players’
      dissatisfaction is real.

      However, the players are unlikely to agree without some form of compromise from
      Dave and the realization that a strike or not regularly training can reduce the chance
      of success. Also, loss of earnings, fear of management response etc might
      facilitiate some conflict resolution.

      Other methods could include conciliation and arbitration, where Dave will ask for
      an independent adjudicator to rule on the lock-out and other issues and bring both
      sides together. This, however, will take time and is a medium term solution and the
      final is approaching. Costs of organizing this could impact on The Warriors’ CSR.
                                        – 18 –              M19/3/BUSMT/HP2/ENG/TZ0/XX/M


Dave’s habit of impulsive behaviour towards his managers and staff indicate that he
would not be able to see the value in this solution. Given the stimulus, this may be
difficult, especially if the arbitrator rules against Dave’s decision and the decision is
binding. The players might support this method but need to ensure that they are
able to represent their case or have a representative.

Candidates can use conciliation and arbitration as two different methods provided
that there is a clear explanation of the differences.

Industrial democracy
Dave could seek to modify his management style and allow greater employee
participation and publicly promise not to be so harsh on players. There is evidence
that he is willing to consult with a former player to sort out the lock-out. But we must
ask the question of, given Dave’s autocratic style, how likely this modification would
be given Dave’s track record. Dave’s management style has to change to be more
democratic which might be challenging for him but acceptable for the players.

Dave is clearly a leader with a vision to do the right thing by his community. The
conflict is affecting him, as he has admitted in private. He risks undoing some of the
CSR that has put him in a favourable position with the supporters and in the
absence of any trophy wins, he cannot afford to do this. It would seem that it would
be in the best interests of the club and the fans to solve this conflict quickly. Dave
will have to change his leadership style and allow greater employee participation.
However, this could all change if The Warriors win this for the first time.

Students may also evaluate the single union agreement

A conclusion with judgment is expected.
The candidates should refer to methods of conflict resolution not actions/industrial
relation that can be taken.
Please note that in the question, an example of industrial relation was given- a lock
out hence some candidates may follow with other examples.
Candidates that refer only to industrial employee relations and not to methods of
conflict resolution can- not reach the top mark bands- see below.

A balanced response is one that covers at least one argument for and at least one
argument against each option.

Marks should be allocated according to the mark bands on page 5 with further

relevant issue that is one-sided, award up to a maximum of [4].
For one relevant issue/ method that is balanced with sufficient depth award up to [5]
Accept methods/suggestions that are related to industrial democracy without naming
the methods like- change leadership style, consultation/ discussion.

If the candidates provided just examples of industrial relations and not conflict
resolution, but the methods are well covered/ evaluated award up to [6]

5.   (a)   Define the term retained profit.                                                             [2]

           Retained profit is the profit remaining after all expenses, taxes and dividends are paid
           and that is not distributed to shareholders. It is kept as part of shareholder equity
           which appears on the balance sheet to provide a source of funds for possible future
           activities.

           Accept any other relevant definition.

           N.B. no application required. Do not credit examples.

           Award [1] for a basic definition that conveys partial knowledge and understanding.

           Award [2] for a full definition that conveys knowledge and understanding similar to
           the answer above. A candidate must demonstrate an understanding that retained
           profit is part of shareholder equity/ or belongs to shareholders and/or that it can be
           used as a source of funds/ reinvestment for possible future business activities.

     (b)   Explain one advantage and one disadvantage for CH of having a mission statement.             [4]

           Advantages for CH of having a mission statement include:
           • Informs the stakeholders of the common purpose of CH‘s existence, and its core
             values. CH produces vital anti-venom vaccines, but its mission statement
             demands that CH carry out its operations in a socially responsible manner.
             Mission statements can have an influential role in setting organizational
             objectives as well as getting support/ acceptance from various stakeholders like
             customers whom CH endeavors to put before profit could have contributed to CH
             being a market leader.
           • CH’s mission statement may act as a motivating force for employees and
             managers and could lead to low staff turnover and/or benefits for the recruitment
             of new highly qualified employees especially if CH starts to develop new life-
             saving vaccines.

           Disadvantages include:
           • Some mission statements may be written as vague statements of intent. It can be
              difficult to ascertain exactly what the business stands for in terms of setting
              sustainable business objectives. This may discourage some investors. CH is
              stating that profitability is secondary after CSR. Yet this profitability is being used
              to finance future growth and research. Investors may not commit funds given this
              mission statement.

(c)   Explain two possible external sources of finance CH could use to continue production
      of anti-venom vaccines.                                                                     [4]

      The question is sufficiently broad to allow candidates to explain a range of possible
      sources of finance, but any candidate who looks at internal organic sources, such as
      increasing sales/profits, must be not given credit.

      Possible external sources include:
      • As CH is a private limited company, the decision could be taken to raise funds
        through an initial public offering. CH could be “floated or listed” on the appropriate
        local share market to raise funds targeting ethical investors.
      • Angel investors who have strong ethical/CSR intent could provide funds.
      • The NGO has demanded action. Given the number of deaths and injuries from
        snakebites, the NGO could be approached to provide new finance or
        governments in those countries predominantly affected. There could be the
        possibility of a private public partnership.
      • Bank loan. If candidates uses this source of finance, it is expected that the
        candidate either comments on the fact that is likely to come from banks with
        ethical objectives or from banks which accept the risk associated with CH’s
        mission statement or that the bank is likely to give a loan for a cause such as
        saving lives.

      It is expected that the candidates incorporate the ethical investors/ ethical support
      issues given the current mission statement of ‘people before profit ‘as application.

      Candidates do not have to use the exact words as above but to show understanding
      that whoever provides the finance should believe in/ support CH’s mission/able to
      justify given the finance that might be risky due to CH’s mission and the possible
      impact on the population.

      Accept any other relevant possible source. (grant, subsidies)
      Donation is not really an applicable source of finance for what has to be done. CH is
      not a charity
      Mark as 2 + 2.

      • For an identification or a description of one possible source of external finance
        with or without application [1].
      • For explanation of one source with no application [1].
      • For explanation of one source and application [2].

      Application must refer to the possible sources of finance for production of anti-
      venom vaccines.

(d)   Discuss CH’s decision to stop producing anti-venom vaccines.                               [10]

      Answers at the top level will look at the ethical arguments of retaining the production
      of anti-venom vaccines versus the financial implications for doing so.

      CH’s mission statement alludes to “putting customers first and profits second”. The
      decision to stop producing the anti-venom vaccines will be viewed as hypocritical by
      stakeholders and will lead to a loss of its market leader status. There could be a
      consumer backlash/boycott, and this will hamper marketing attempts for any new
      life-saving vaccines. The drop in revenue could be considerable and as a result
      there may be no profits to finance research and development. The comments from
      the NGO are unhelpful and will bring increased scrutiny and further unwelcome

publicity. Stopping production may damage the economic sustainability of CH to the
point where they may cease to exist.

However, the increased competition and wave of price reductions cannot be
ignored. We must assume that this new competition has a product that competes
with CH on price because, as the market leader, we would assume CH has a certain
degree of brand loyalty. Clearly, consumers see the competition from Brazil, Mexico
and India as a substitute, and unit sales of CH’s vaccine have fallen significantly.
Perhaps customers are not as ethical as CH ‘s management assume and are not
very supportive of CH’s CSR If CH does not stop production and cut its losses now,
it may not have time or finance to develop new life-saving vaccines, through which it
may be able to recreate its market leader status.


The profit motive is the reward for entrepreneurial initiative and risk. CH is quite
within its rights to stop production of a loss-making vaccine and switch to a market
that may be underdeveloped and gain the first mover advantage, albeit one with
considerably more risk. Ironically, if the decision to stop production is made quickly,
CH may be the beneficiary of some panic buying, boosting short-term revenues
before the anti-venom vaccine is withdrawn from the shelves.
Also, other segments of people can be helped by CH if people are put before profit.

Given the ethical and moral issues in this case, CH may be wise to wait and see
customers’ reaction to new competitors, carry out further market research on the
competition and customers attitudes towards CSR. It is indicated that for two years,
the new competition will be unable to fill the gap left by CH if it decides to leave this
market. CH is still the market leader. Possibly CH could emphasize its product
quality and its ethical mission over the competition and see if this acts as a spur.

Accept any other relevant argument.

A conclusion with judgment is expected.

A balanced response is one that covers at least two arguments for and at least two
arguments against.

Marks should be allocated according to the mark bands on page 5 with further
guidance below.

For one relevant issue that is one-sided, award up to [3]. For more than one
relevant issue that is one-sided, award up to a maximum of [4].

Award a maximum of [6] if the answer is of a standard that shows balanced analysis
and understanding throughout the response with reference to the stimulus material
but there is no judgment/conclusion.

Candidates cannot reach the [7–8] markband if they give judgment/conclusions that
are not based on analysis/explanation already given in their answer.

Candidates cannot reach the top marks if there is no relevant reference/ application
to the stimulus.

                                           Section C
Questions 6–8. Please mark the candidate response using the assessment criteria on
pages 6–7.

6.    With reference to an organization of your choice, discuss the ways in which ethics can
      influence innovation in an organization.                                                 [20]

7.    With reference to an organization of your choice, examine the impact of culture on
      organizational strategy.                                                                 [20]

8.    With reference to an organization of your choice, discuss the ways in which
      globalization can influence organizational change.                                       [20]

N.B. Although the question asks for the application of one concept on another, it is still
expected that Business Management content will be aligned with the concepts especially the
second concept (the one being acted on).

Please note that candidates can conclude that there was a minimal impact, however it has to
be based on balanced arguments and evaluation.

Additional guidance in relation to the assessment criteria
For each criterion, the aim is to find the descriptor that conveys most accurately the level
attained by the candidate, using the best-fit model. It is not necessary for every single
aspect of a level descriptor to be met for that mark to be awarded.

• The highest level descriptors do not imply faultless performance and should be achievable
  by a candidate.
• A candidate who attains a high level of achievement for one criterion will not necessarily
  reach high levels of achievement for the other criteria and vice versa.

If only one concept is addressed:
• Criteria A, B, C and E: award up to a maximum [3].
• Criterion D: full marks can be awarded.

Where the question asks for impacts of two concepts on content, examiners must allow for
unbalanced treatment of the two concepts throughout a candidate’s response. One concept
may be more significant than the other.

Criterion B
For [2]: “…connection is not developed” should be treated the same as superficial.


Criterion C
1  1 arguments are expected per concepts.
• Questions 6 to 8 require consideration of the impact of one concept on a second concept
   – therefore accept 2  2 arguments for a balanced response.
• Justification is through logic or data.
• For [2] there is no balance as there are no counter arguments at all, or the arguments are
   all one-sided then this would be unjustified.
• For [3] there are some balanced arguments – some of which are justified.


Criterion D
• Introductions need to be concise and related to the question.
                                                     – 24 –             M19/3/BUSMT/HP2/ENG/TZ0/XX/M


• The candidate’s response does not to have explicit headings for each structural element.
• A body is the area in which the substance of arguments occurs. It is usually located
  between the introduction and the conclusion.
• Fit-for-purpose paragraph means that ideas are presented in a clear academic way. For
  example, one idea per paragraph.

Criterion E
• One example of an “individual” could be an individual consumer or an individual manager.
   However, this cannot be considered with a “group” of consumers or a management team.
• For [4], a balanced response: look at the perspectives of both individual and group(s).
• The chosen individual, group needs to be applicable and relevant to the question with
   specific explanation.
• Candidates need to go beyond stating the stakeholder.
• Please do not use the adjective ‘inappropriate’ in the descriptor for 2 marks. If
   inappropriate award 1 mark

Candidates need not explicitly say “stakeholder”.

In section C, the question rubric explicitly states that “organizations featured in sections A and
B and in the paper 1 case study may not be used as a basis” to candidate’s answers to
questions 6, 7 and 8. When this happens please award marks as follows:

Criterion A: award a maximum of [1]. The business management content cannot be relevant
if the organization is fictitious.
Criterion B: 0 marks – there is no connection to a “real-world organization”
Criterion C: award a maximum of [1]. The arguments cannot be relevant if the organization is
fictitious.
Criterion D: mark as normal.
Criterion E: award up to a maximum of [1]. The individual and/or group perspective(s) cannot
be relevant if the organization is fictitious.

Additional guidance for questions 6,7 and 8

Q6

Accept examples of CSR /environmental issues as being ethical. The question expects
application of one concept on another. Candidates are expected to discuss ethics and its
impact on innovation and not to discuss these two concepts separately. In other words, each
example of ethical behaviour should be applied to a real innovation the company created
/adopted and thereafter the impact on various stakeholders. (the impact is really of innovation)

Q7

Accept organizational culture or national culture.

Accept any relevant organizational strategy.

Q8

Please note that the question is about organizational change / some major strategic change
rather than a change in product/product adaptation strategy in marketing for example,
McDonalds in India. To achieve the highest marks for Criterion E and Criterion B candidates
are expected to examine the impact of organisational change due to globalisation on different
stakeholders. Candidates may explain how globalisation impacted on a particular individual
                                                  – 25 –              M19/3/BUSMT/HP2/ENG/TZ0/XX/M


(CEO) or a group in a position to create/initiate an organisational change. The question is not
about the impact of globalisation directly on stakeholders.
