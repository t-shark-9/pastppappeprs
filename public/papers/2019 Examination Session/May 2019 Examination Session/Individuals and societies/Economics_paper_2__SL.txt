1.       Study the following extract and answer the questions that follow.


                United States (US) tin can manufacturers seek tariff exemption on tinplate steel

          The Can Manufacturers Institute (CMI) has asked the US Department of Commerce to
           take away tariffs and other trade protection measures that are currently applied to imports
           of tinplate steel. Tinplate steel is used to make tin cans as packaging for food. The CMI
           represents the tin can manufacturing industry and its suppliers in the US.

          The tin can manufacturing industry accounts for the annual domestic production of
           approximately 124 billion tin cans. The industry employs more than 28 000 people, with
           factories in 33 US states, Puerto Rico and American Samoa. It generates revenue of around
           US$17.8 billion. The CMI claims that the tariff on imports of tinplate steel has a severe
           economic impact on the tin can manufacturing industry.

          Approximately 2 % of all US steel is tinplate. Currently, there is excess demand that is
           causing a disequilibrium in the domestic US tinplate steel market. In 2016, US demand for
           tinplate steel was 2.1 million tons, while domestic supply was 1.2 million tons, meaning that
           only 57 % of domestic demand was met by US tinplate steel producers. Not only is there a
           domestic shortage of tinplate steel, but also the CMI claims that there has been a noticeable
           decline in the quality of domestically-produced tinplate steel.

          The CMI claims that even a small increase in the price of raw materials could create a
           competitive disadvantage, forcing some tin can manufacturing plants to shut down. This
           would create structural unemployment for 10 000 workers in regionally-based factories.
           The CMI also claims that the tariff puts food can producers at a competitive disadvantage
           with other food packaging substitutes, such as plastic and glass. These substitutes are not
           subject to tariffs.

          According to the CMI, canned fruits and vegetables cost 20 % less than fresh food. Because
           of this, people on low incomes consume canned foods at a higher rate than the average
           American. Canned food offers a low-cost solution to feeding the nation; especially the 42
           million Americans who live in low-income households. The figure includes 13 million children.
           The CMI further claims that tariffs, or any trade barriers, have harsh consequences for those
           living in relative poverty.

                             Bhutan’s growth soars amid hydropower building boom

           Bhutan is a developing Asian country, bordered by India and China. The government
            of Bhutan is mostly interventionist in its approach to economic growth and economic
            development. Situated in the Himalayan mountains, Bhutan has significant water resources
            that may be employed to generate hydropower.

          The most significant intervention by the government is investment in the generation of
           hydropower. However, funding is not possible domestically. The hydropower projects are
           mostly financed by concessional long-term loans from India. Government borrowing to
           finance hydropower construction has made Bhutan the second-most indebted nation in
           Asia. Bhutan now has a high level of government debt, equal to 118 % of annual real gross
           domestic product (GDP).

          The funding of Bhutan’s interventionist policies has created significant dependence on Indian
           tied aid. A condition of the aid is that Indian companies lead the infrastructure projects. The
           large amount of foreign aid has made achieving self-reliance difficult. At present, India
           finances nearly one-quarter of the Bhutan government’s budget expenditures.

          When the projects are completed they will more than double Bhutan’s hydropower generation
           capacity and over 80 % of the power generated will be exported to India. Hydropower to
           India is Bhutan’s largest export, and the increased exports will lead to greater government
           revenue. Real GDP growth is expected to reach 11.7 % by 2019.

          Another significant intervention by the government is the promotion of university education for
           as many young people as possible, coupled with the creation of government jobs to employ
           them. The present level of exporting hydropower to India has provided some government
           revenue to pay for government jobs. However, while the number of university graduates is
           growing each year, the number of government jobs has not been growing at the same rate.

          In response to the current inability to provide enough jobs, the government is also
           implementing other programmes. Firstly, they are encouraging graduates to pursue
           employment in Bhutan’s small private sector, which is struggling to make a meaningful
           contribution to economic growth. Secondly, the government is promoting tourism, making it
           one of the most popular alternatives to government employment. Thirdly, the government is
           attempting to reduce red tape (excessive regulations) in areas such as industrial licensing,
           trade, labour markets and finance. This red tape is a barrier to foreign direct investment.
           Finally, the government is trying to make employment in agriculture more appealing. Bhutan’s
           climate means that it could be well-positioned to produce and export a variety of fruits.

                                     Chinese investment helps Peru to develop

          Over the past decade, Peru has been one of South America’s fastest-growing economies,
           with an average economic growth rate of 5.9 % and low average annual inflation of 2.9 %.
           This has been mostly due to a favourable external environment, sensible macroeconomic
           policies and reforms of environmental regulations designed to increase investment in Peru’s
           profitable mining sector. However, the deregulation in the mining sector has been opposed
           by environmental groups and trade unions, fearing increased pollution and poorer working
           conditions.

          Strong growth in employment and income has dramatically reduced poverty rates.
           Absolute poverty fell from 27.6 % in 2005 to 9 % in 2015.

          Gross domestic product (GDP) growth continued to accelerate in 2016, very much helped
           by higher mining export output as several new large mining projects entered into production
           and reached full capacity. Peru mines and exports many commodities, including copper, gold,
           lead, zinc, tin, iron ore, silver, and oil and petroleum products.

          China is Peru’s main trading partner, taking 22.1 % of Peru’s exports and supplying 22.7 %
           of their imports in 2016. Chinese companies are also significant suppliers of foreign direct
           investment (FDI) to Peru, recently investing over US$2 billion to purchase a hydroelectric
           power plant. The second main trading partner is the United States (US), taking 15.2 % of
           Peru’s exports and supplying 20.7 % of their imports in 2016.

          Peru’s current account deficit declined significantly from 4.9 % to 2.8 % of GDP in 2016,
           owing to increasing export growth and lower imports. Peru’s government continues to
           support a free trade policy; since 2006, Peru has signed trade deals with 17 different
           countries including the US, Canada, China and Japan. In addition, a trade deal has also
           been signed with the European Union.

          Real GDP growth is expected to slow slightly in 2017 due to an anticipated lower growth
           rate in the mining sector and weak private investment. To support the economy as mining
           production slows, the government is expected to increase public investment in 2017.

          Growth projections may not be achieved if any, or a combination, of the following occur:
           external shocks in commodities prices, a further deceleration of China’s economic growth,
           unpredictability in world capital markets and the threat of tight monetary policy in the US.
           Raising economic growth requires structural and fiscal reforms to improve productivity,
           reduce the size of the informal sector and improve the efficiency of public services.
