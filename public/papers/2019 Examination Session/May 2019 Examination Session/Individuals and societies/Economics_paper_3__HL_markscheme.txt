Notes for examiners:

1. Whenever relevant, carry over marks must be awarded. If a candidate makes an error in
   calculation, but then uses the incorrect figure appropriately and accurately in later question
   parts, then the candidate may be fully rewarded. This is the “own-figure rule” and you should
   put OFR on the script where you are rewarding this.

2. Alternative approaches may be taken in responses to the [4] questions that use A02
   command terms. If this is the case and the alternative approaches are valid, then full
   credit should be given.

1.   (a)   Identify the slope of the supply curve.                                                  [1]

           An answer of 4.5 or  4.5 (or 1/4.5 or 2/9) without any working is sufficient for [1].

     (b)   Outline the reason why the quantity supplied increases as the price rises.               [2]

                       including one of the following:
                        At a higher price, the profit margin is greater, so there
                           is an incentive to produce and offer more units.
                           OR
                        As price increases, profit will be maximized at a higher
                           level of output given an upward-sloping MC curve.
                           OR
                        Since marginal costs rise, a firm will be willing to offer
                           more units per period only at a higher price.

           NB Responses which outline only that producers are “more able to afford” to produce more
           should not be rewarded.

                   an increase in costs of production will reduce
                     profitability, causing producers to be less willing to
                     supply.

      NB Responses which make reference to producers being “less able to afford” resources
      should not be rewarded.

      Reference to the need to cut costs may be rewarded at level 1, but if the candidate refers to
      producers being unable to afford to supply, this should not be rewarded.

                 An explanation that price elasticity of supply is the
                 responsiveness of supply (or, of quantity supplied) to a
                 change in price.

      The time taken to produce goods is an important determinant of the price elasticity
      of supply.

(g)   Apart from time, explain two factors which influence the price elasticity of supply.        [4]

           1     The written response is limited.                                 1-2
                 Any one factor expressed in a vague manner [1].

                 in a vague manner [3].
                 Any two factors explained clearly [4].

      Factors may include:
       whether the firm has excess (or unused, or spare) capacity available: if it does, then
        increasing output will be easier so supply will be more price elastic
       possibility of storage: the greater the ability to store stocks, the more price elastic
        supply will be as firms can draw from stocks to increase the quantity supplied
       mobility of factors of production: the easier it is for a producer to switch resources
        from one use to another, the easier it will be to increase the quantity supplied in
        response to an increase in the price of the product, so supply will be more elastic
        (the ease with which technology can be implemented/applied could be an example
        of this)
       the rate at which costs rise as output increases – the faster/higher the rate, the
        lower the PES (NB “costs of production” should not be rewarded)
       the nature of the product eg for agricultural products, the time lag between planting
        and harvest is relatively long, so supply would be relatively price inelastic in the
        short term.

      Any other reasonable response should be rewarded.

(h)   With reference to Figure 2, explain how the incidence of taxation on consumers and/or

        comparative advantage
       over-specialization resulting in vulnerability to changes in market conditions or as a
        barrier to economic development
       risk will be reduced by the avoidance of over-reliance on trading partners for
        essential products or resources which might compromise national security or
        diminish negotiating power
       specialization may make it difficult for the economy to diversify, thus maintaining
        the risk of vulnerability to market conditions
       safety and environmental standards may be compromised by low-quality imports
       specialization may not result in beneficial trade if export markets are protected by
        barriers to trade
       if demand conditions for the export good suffer a long-term decrease then the
        resulting deterioration of the country's terms of trade may harm the economy
       over-specialization may result in an economy continuing to produce a good with
        low income elasticity of demand, causing economic growth to be slow relative to
        other economies.

      Consequences may include:
       a stronger currency may reduce the export competitiveness of the eurozone, thus
        worsening the current account balance/increasing imports and reducing exports
       a currency appreciation will reduce the domestic price of imports so cost of living will
        decrease and cost of imported raw materials will decrease, lowering production
        costs of domestic firms and reducing inflationary pressure
       a stronger currency may reduce export competitiveness, causing aggregate demand
        to decrease, thus reducing inflationary pressure
       a stronger currency may reduce the export competitiveness of the eurozone,
        causing aggregate demand to decrease, thus causing slower growth/higher
        unemployment
       the value of any foreign debt may be reduced as a smaller amount of euros will be
        needed to repay/service the debt (if denominated in foreign currency)

       the economy can use exchange rate policy to affect macroeconomic variables, such
        as the growth rate; inflation)
       if an economy has a current account deficit/surplus, the exchange rate will act as a
        self-regulating mechanism to restore the balance

                 An AD/AS diagram showing a shift of the AD curve to the
                 right AND an explanation that lower interest rates will lead
                 to increased investment and/or consumer spending and/or
                 lower saving, causing AD to shift to the right therefore
                 causing an increase in output and a reduction in
                 unemployment.

      Any form of aggregate supply curve (SRAS, LRAS or Keynesian AS) is acceptable.

      Candidates who incorrectly label diagrams can receive a maximum of [3].

      For AD/AS, the vertical axis may be price level or average price level. The horizontal
      axis may be output, real output, national output, real national output, national income,
      or GDP. A title is not necessary.

      Any other reasonable response should be rewarded. For example, a diagram showing
      the labour market, with axes labelled “wage rate” and “employment” or “quantity of
      labour”, with accurate explanation may be fully rewarded.

(g)   State two interventionist supply-side policies that are likely to increase the demand
      for low-wage labour in Fairland.                                                           [2]

      Award [1] for each appropriate policy stated.

      Policies may include:
       investment in infrastructure
       tax cuts or tax allowances in industries that hire low-wage labour
       subsidies for firms that hire low-wage labour
       Investment in education and training/human capital
       Investment in health.

      Examiners should be aware that some candidates may take alternative approaches,
      which, if appropriate, should be fully rewarded.

(h)   State two market-based supply-side policies that are likely to increase the supply
      of labour in Fairland.                                                                     [2]

      Examiners should be aware that some candidates may take alternative approaches,
      which, if appropriate, should be fully rewarded eg cuts in employee social security
      contributions.
