1.   (a)   Analyse the ways in which cultural traits are spread from place to place.               [12]

           Marks should be allocated according to the markbands on pages 3 to 4.

           Cultural traits are the varied facets of a culture, including language, religion,
           cuisine, music, dress, etc. The most likely focus is national–cultural identity but
           ethnicity, religion and local cultures are creditable also.

           The spread of cultural traits involves both the diffusion and subsequent
           adoption/use of new ideas, attitudes, tastes and behaviours. Culture spreads in
           numerous ways, including:
           • diffusion of cultural traits carried by migrants and diaspora groups
           • ideas spread by social networks, data flows and “shrinking world” processes
           • TNC consumption networks and the cultural changes they bring
           • the past cultural imperialism of colonizing states, which led to the widespread
             diffusion and adoption of Western culture(s)
           • the sometimes complex ways in which cultural ideas spread from place to place
             on account of glocalization/hybridization processes (without which the adoption
             of new tastes/ideas/fashions/languages might not happen).

           Do not credit material which dwells on resistance to, or consequences of, cultural
           change. This is irrelevant to the clearly-directed question which has been asked.

           Good answers may apply (AO2) a wider range of knowledge and understanding
           (AO1) in a well-structured way (AO4). One approach might be to provide a
           conceptually-informed analysis of how cultural spread (both diffusion and adoption)
           happens (utilizing concepts such as cultural imperialism, hybridization, etc).
           Another approach might be to analyse in turn colonial/imperialistic/“hard power”
           mechanisms and neo-colonial/“soft power” strategies.

           For 4–6 marks, expect some outlining of ways in which different aspects of culture
           have spread/travelled spatially/globally. Response is either partial, narrow or lacks
           supporting evidence.

           For 7–9 marks, expect a structured, evidenced analysis of:
           • either how a range of cultural traits have spread/diffused to specific places by
             various means (involving technology, migration, trade etc)
           • or specific concepts/processes/mechanisms which further our understanding of
             how and why culture/cultural traits are spread spatially.

           For 10–12 marks, expect both of these traits.

(b)   Discuss the relationships between globalization and human development.                [16]

      Credit all content in line with the markbands. Marks should be allocated
      according to the markbands on pages 5 to 6. Credit unexpected approaches
      wherever relevant.

      Human development, like the MDGs/SDGs, includes economic, social/cultural
      and political elements. Globalization is similarly a multidimensional concept. Many
      links and connections can therefore be established between the two concepts and
      their associated processes. The relationships are often viewed as positive but
      can in fact be complex; some highly developed societies may reject globalization.
      Globalization has not always had beneficial developmental impacts for all
      individuals and societies.

      Possible applied themes (AO2) include knowledge and understanding (AO1) of:
      • globalization indices and their component parts (4.1)
      • global trade and economic networking of places (4.2)
      • developmental implications of data flows and trends (4.3)
      • multidimensional human development (5.1)
      • TNC responsibility frameworks (5.1)
      • developmental implications of cultural change (5.2)
      • rejection of globalization by civil society (5.3)
      • societal and economic risks stemming from global interactions (6.1).

      Good answers may synthesize (AO3a) three or more of these themes in a well-
      structured (AO4) way.

      Good answers may additionally offer a critical evaluation (AO3b) of the statement
      which discusses the relative importance of different globalizing processes for
      human development. Another approach might be to critically discuss how human
      development in different places may have been affected in positive or negative
      ways. Another approach might be to discuss interactions between different
      globalizing and developmental processes, or the global power relationships that
      can help/hinder global development.

      For 5–8 marks, expect some outlining of two relevant themes. Response is either
      partial, narrow or lacks supporting evidence.

      For 9–12 marks, expect:
      • either a structured synthesis which links together several well-evidenced
        themes from the Guide
      • or a critical conclusion (or ongoing evaluation) informed by geographical
        concepts and/or perspectives.

      For 13–16 marks, expect both of these traits.

2.   (a)   Analyse the validity and reliability of two indicators of human development.                [12]

           Marks should be allocated according to the markbands on pages 3 to 4.

           Possibilities for analysis include the human development index (HDI), the gender
           equality index and GDP per capita or infant mortality. One approach might be to
           analyse two components of the HDI (eg life expectancy and literacy). Another
           approach might be to analyse the HDI in its entirety along with a second indicator,
           such as GDP per capita. Either approach is acceptable.

           For full marks to be awarded, all of the points raised need not be explicitly
           categorized as either validity or reliability issues. It is sufficient to provide a wide-
           ranging critique which infers concern with both reliability and validity.

           If more than two indicators are analysed, credit the two which are dealt with best.

           Possible issues associated with their use include:
           • the accuracy of the data (a reliability issue) and whether they are verifiable
           • the comparability of data between countries (a reliability issue), methodological
             issues (criticisms of GDP or HDI formulae) (a reliability issue)
           • the extent to which they genuinely show variations in development, for example
             HDI is widely viewed as a good measure because it takes into account three
             different variables (a validity issue)
           • varying perspectives on the genuine importance (validity) of what is being
             measured (eg, money, happiness, gender equality)
           • the importance (validity) of a particular measure (eg literacy) because of how it
             impacts on other aspects of development such as income/happiness.

           Good answers may apply (AO2) a wider range of knowledge and understanding
           (AO1) in a well-structured way (AO4). One approach might be to provide a
           structured systematic analysis which clearly separates validity and reliability
           issues. Another approach might be to analyse the two chosen indicators using a
           wider range of critical points with strong supporting evidence and data.

           For 4–6 marks, expect some outlining of one or two indicators/measures.
           Response is either partial, narrow or lacks supporting evidence.

           For 7–9 marks, expect a structured, evidenced analysis of:
           • either two indicators of human development (dealt with in a balanced way)
           • or the issues of validity and reliability (these may be implied rather than
             explicit; do not expect balance)

           For 10–12 marks, expect both of these traits.

(b)   “Physical geography is the main reason why some places are less connected than others.”
      Discuss this statement.                                                              [16]

      Credit all content in line with the markbands. Marks should be allocated
      according to the markbands on pages 5 to 6. Credit unexpected approaches
      wherever relevant.

      Physical geography may include consideration of: whether different places are
      relatively isolated; maritime and continental places; natural resource endowment;
      various site and climatic factors. Connectivity has multiple dimensions (for
      example, inclusion in transport networks or internet connectivity). Places can be
      identified as local areas or states, or at other scales.

      Answers which largely ignore/sideline the role of physical geography and instead
      discuss the role of non-physical factors may still reach Level 9-12 if they meet
      other mark band criteria well. However, they are unlikely to reach Level 13-16.

      Possible applied themes (AO2) include knowledge and understanding (AO1) of:
      • importance of oil resources for connected OPEC states (4.1)
      • connected global superpowers and reasons for this (4.1)
      • economic migration rules and connectivity of destination states (4.2)
      • global data flow patterns (4.3)
      • natural resource availability (4.3)
      • geographic isolation at varying scales (4.3)
      • networking via microfinance (5.1)
      • cultural diffusion between places (5.2)
      • global diaspora (5.2)
      • protectionism and trade restrictions (5.3)
      • implications of global shift or reshoring for connectivity (6.2-6.3).

      Good answers may synthesize (AO3a) three or more of these themes in a well-
      structured (AO4) way.

      Good answers may additionally offer a critical evaluation (AO3b) of the statement
      which discusses the extent to which physical factors are most important in different
      places and contexts. Another approach might be to critically discuss the relative
      importance of physical and human influences on connectivity at the national or
      more local scale (eg, isolated rural areas within well-connected states). Another
      approach might be to examine changes in relative importance over time and the
      possibility that physical barriers might be overcome.

      For 5–8 marks, expect some outlining of two relevant themes. Response is either
      partial, narrow or lacks supporting evidence.

      For 9–12 marks, expect:
      • either a structured synthesis which links together several well-evidenced
        themes from the Guide
      • or a critical conclusion (or on-going evaluation) informed by geographical
        concepts and/or perspectives.

      For 13–16 marks, expect both of these traits.

3.   (a)   Using examples, analyse the links between globalization and the rise of nationalism in some
           countries.                                                                               [12]

           Marks should be allocated according to the markbands on pages 3 to 4.

           Nationalism can assume different forms, eg, protectionism, anti-immigration
           policies and demonstrations, military action, etc. In the past nationalism was
           associated with expansion and empire building; today it may be linked with a retreat
           from globalization (and associated sovereignty issues).

           Some credit must be given for material which analyses the rise of anti-
           globalization/isolationist movements at more localized scales, such as Occupy,
           local food sourcing movements, long-established Amish communities, etc.
           Case studies such as these may include relevant explanations of why globalization
           has prompted the rise of reactive movements within some countries. However,
           valid instances of nationalism must also be included for Bands 7-9 and 10-12.

           Possible reasons and examples include:
           • concerns that globalization has not led to “a good deal” for native citizens (USA
             since 2016)
           • “resource nationalism” and the expatriation of profits by TNCs (Bolivia)
           • concerns with migration and cultural change (UK/Brexit)
           • the impact of global information flows on national language and culture (France)
           • the “dilution” of sovereignty on account of MGO membership (EU populist
             movements)
           • large-scale anti-Western political movements in particular nations eg Boko
             Haram in northeast Nigeria (though not always strictly “nationalist”, credit should
             be given for material linking globalization with so-called “tribalization” politics).

           Good answers may apply (AO2) a wider range of knowledge and understanding
           (AO1) in a well-structured way (AO4). One approach might be to provide a
           structured systematic analysis of opposition different facets of globalization (trade,
           migration, media, etc). Another approach might be to analyse different
           manifestations of nationalism (civil society action as opposed to government
           policies).

           For 4–6 marks, expect some outlining of one or two instances of contemporary
           nationalism. Response is either partial, narrow or lacks supporting evidence.

           For 7–9 marks, expect a structured, evidenced analysis of:
           • either why nationalism is linked with globalization in two countries
           • or different forms/aspects/types of nationalism.

           For 10–12 marks, expect both of these traits.

(b)   Examine the spatial pattern of environmental impacts associated with different global
      flows.                                                                                      [16]

      Credit all content in line with the markbands. Marks should be allocated according to
      the markbands on pages 5 to 6. Credit unexpected approaches wherever relevant.

      Global flows include movements of goods, people, data and capital (and
      investment). Environmental impacts – at local, regional or global scales – can be
      wide ranging, encompassing: pollution of water, air and land; biodiversity issues
      and agribusiness impacts; climate change projections. Consideration of impact
      patterns may include uneven regional impacts (eg, for waste exporters/importers
      in the global core/periphery), spatial diffusion patterns for transboundary pollution,
      localized/linear pollution along shipping lanes, etc.

      Responses which describe detailed environmental problems caused by global
      flows/growth/development, yet fail to address any pattern of these impacts (other than
      asserting that ‘everywhere’ or 'more places' are being affected) are unlikely to progress
      far into Level 9-12 and should not be awarded a Level 13-16 mark.

      Possible applied themes (AO2) include knowledge and understanding (AO1) of:
      • global core and periphery patterns (1.1)
      • major global networks and flows (4.2)
      • illegal waste movements (4.2)
      • growth of TNC supply chain networks (4.2)
      • natural resource patterns and interactions (4.2.1)
      • cultural landscape and built environment changes (5.2)
      • transboundary pollution patterns (6.2)
      • shipping lane pollution (6.2)
      • global shift of polluting industries (6.3)
      • global agribusiness systems (6.3).

      Good answers may synthesize (AO3a) three or more of these themes in a well-
      structured (AO4) way.

      Good answers may additionally offer a critical evaluation (AO3b) of the statement
      which examines patterns at varying scales (global, regional or more local patterns).
      Another approach might be to critically examine how the different global processes
      give rise to more evident impact patterns than others.

      For 5–8 marks, expect some outlining of two relevant themes. Response is either
      partial, narrow or lacks supporting evidence (or neglects ‘pattern’ entirely).

      For 9–12 marks, expect:
      • either a structured synthesis which links together several well-evidenced
        themes from the Guide
      • or a critical conclusion (or on-going evaluation) informed by geographical
        concepts and/or perspectives.

      For 13–16 marks, expect both of these traits.
