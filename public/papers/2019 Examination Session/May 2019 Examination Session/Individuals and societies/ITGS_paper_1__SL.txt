Answer two questions. Each question is worth [20 marks].

1.   Parents “cyber-spying” on their children

     The New York Times reports that an increasing number of parents use technology to protect their
     children and keep track of their online activities.

     Many companies are developing cell/mobile phone apps* to sell to parents who want to keep
     an eye on their child’s online activities. Some apps operate as a simple global positioning
     system (GPS) tracking device, but others are much more advanced. For example:
     • Qustodio restricts internet browsing and monitors for signs of cyber-bullying by detecting
        keywords in social media.
     • TeenSafe lets parents see all the texts, web history and apps on the child’s phone, tablet or
        computer. With one of its options, the parents can receive copies of all the messages that the
        child sends and receives. Parents can also receive weekly activity reports, similar to the one
        in Figure 1.

(Question 1 continued)

     Some of the apps are invisible to the children, so they do not always know they are being
     monitored by their parents. Some child psychologists believe that this approach to parenting is
     wrong. They argue that parents should develop trust with their children, rather than using spyware
     and engaging in online surveillance.



* apps: an app (application software) is typically a small, specialized program
  downloaded onto mobile devices; apps can also run on the internet, on a
  computer, or on a cell/mobile phone or other electronic device


     (a)   (i)    Identify two features of spyware.                                                 [2]

           (ii)   Identify the steps taken by a GPS device to determine its location.               [4]

     (b)   The developers of Qustodio decided to use automated keyword detection to monitor for
           signs of cyber-bullying.

           Analyse this decision.                                                                   [6]

     (c)   To what extent is it acceptable for parents to use apps such as Qustodio and TeenSafe
           to monitor their child’s online activities?                                              [8]

2.     Braille keyboards

       According to the World Health Organization, over 250 million people worldwide are blind or visually
       impaired. Many of them use a tactile writing system called Braille, which they read with their hands
       by touching patterns of raised dots with their fingertips.

       Several companies have recently developed Braille keyboards, such as the one shown in
       Figure 2. Braille keyboards use different combinations of the nine main keys to form characters.

                                       Figure 2: A Braille keyboard




                                   [Source: with the permission of HumanWare]


       Braille keyboards are usually very expensive. They can cost twenty or thirty times more than
       standard keyboards. They are always protected by patents and cannot be cheaply reproduced.

       Umair Osman, a young teacher in Pakistan, has invented a system that uses a flexible plastic
       overlay1 to imitate the layout of a Braille keyboard.

       Umair has also developed software that converts the combinations of keys pressed on the overlay
       to the corresponding ASCII2 character. The overlay, together with the software, enables visually
       impaired students to convert a standard keyboard into a Braille keyboard.

       Umair has decided to release his software as open source software and is considering using
       crowdfunding3 for future projects.

(Question 2 continued)

     (a)   (i)	Identify two features of American Standard Code for Information
                Interchange (ASCII).                                                                  [2]

           (ii)   Describe two methods that Umair could have used to gather information from
                  visually impaired people during the development of his system.                      [4]

     (b)   Umair has decided to release his Braille software as open source software, rather
           than proprietary software.

           Explain why Umair took this decision.                                                      [6]

     (c)   Umair has two options:
           • Option 1: he could continue to develop his software and Braille keyboard by using
             crowdfunding.
           • Option 2: he could sell the intellectual property rights to AssistivIT, a large company
             that develops software.

           Evaluate these two options.                                                                [8]

                                                 –6–                   M19/3/ITGSX/SP1/ENG/TZ0/XX

3.   Hurricane warning systems

     In 2017, Hurricane Irma was a catastrophic disaster. Unfortunately the computer models did not
     accurately predict its track (course) in time to warn residents in the areas affected. Accurately
     predicting the track of a hurricane is critical for protecting life and property.

     The potential tracks that Hurricane Irma could have taken are shown in Figure 3.

                            Figure 3: Potential tracks of Hurricane Irma




     The European computer model, run by the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather
     Forecasts, performed far better than the American model, known as the Global Forecast System.
     However a new model created by the electronics company Panasonic, called PWS, performed
     best.

     The American and European models depend on data gathered from weather balloons. Panasonic,
     on the other hand, creates systems that collect real-time weather data from over 3500 aircraft
     every day.

     The PWS model resulted in accurate simulations of the track of the hurricane four to seven days
     in advance.

(Question 3 continued)

     (a)   (i)	Identify two file types that could be used for the image in Figure 3, which shows
                the potential tracks of Hurricane Irma.                                                [2]

           (ii)    Outline the difference between data and information.                                [2]

           (iii)   Outline why visualization is used to present data.                                  [2]

     (b)   (i)	Distinguish between a model and a simulation.                                          [2]

           (ii)    Different weather variables, such as wind speed and temperature, need to be
                   collected in order to predict the track of a hurricane. Wind speed data is sampled
                   more frequently than temperature data in a hurricane.

                   Explain one reason why wind speed data would be sampled more frequently than
                   temperature data in a hurricane.                                                    [2]

           (iii)   Explain why the data collected about Hurricane Irma was not encrypted prior to
                   being transmitted.                                                                  [2]

     (c)   Panasonic does not make its PWS model available to governments, as the company
           says that doing so would compromise its commercial interests.

           Discuss whether governments should be able to make private companies such as
           Panasonic share their data.                                                                 [8]




                                                                                                 Turn over
                                                     –8–                 M19/3/ITGSX/SP1/ENG/TZ0/XX

4.   Electronic voting (e-voting)

     E-voting is a form of voting that uses a computer instead of a printed ballot paper. Voters go to
     a polling station and cast their vote using an electronic voting machine (EVM), such as the one
     shown in Figure 4.

     Voters must be authenticated by the system before casting their vote. The votes are then stored in
     an encrypted form in a relational database.

     The graphical user interface (GUI) of the EVM can be adjusted for different voters. For example,
     the font size can be increased for voters who have limited vision.

                       Figure 4: Example of an electronic voting machine (EVM)




                                           [Source: cmannphoto/istock]


     E-voting is already used for local elections in the towns and cities of several countries, such as
     Belgium, Canada and Estonia. Countries such as Finland are now considering whether to use
     e-voting for the whole population in their national elections.


     (a)   (i)	Other than font size, identify two features of the GUI that could be customized
                so that it is accessible for all voters, including people with physical, sensory and
                other challenges.                                                                        [2]

           (ii)    Identify two features of authentication.                                              [2]

           (iii)   Identify two features of encryption.                                                  [2]

     (b)   Elections using e-voting in countries such as Finland will create significant amounts
           of personal data. The government of Finland will have to ensure it has appropriate
           policies for the collection, storage and sharing of the data.

           Explain why it is important to have an appropriate policy for the collection, storage
           and sharing of the data from elections that use e-voting.                                     [6]

     (c)   Evaluate the advantages and disadvantages of e-voting.                                        [8]
