Extended response questions - quality of construction

        Extended response questions for SLP2 carry a mark total of [16]. Of these marks, [15] are awarded for content and [1] for the quality of
         the answer.

        [1] for quality is awarded when:
             the candidate’s answers are clear enough to be understood without re-reading.
             the candidate has answered the question succinctly with little or no repetition or irrelevant material.

                                                                                                            consequences are given.
                 a. homeostasis is the maintenance of a constant internal environment ✔
                 b. the pancreas produces hormones that control the levels of glucose ✔
                 c. if glucose levels in blood are high, beta-cells «of the pancreas» produce insulin ✔


                 d. «insulin» causes the cells to take up /absorb glucose ✔
                 e. liver stores excess glucose as glycogen ✔
                 f. if glucose levels in blood are low, alpha-cells «of the pancreas» produce glucagon ✔
                 g. «glucagon» causes the liver to break down glycogen into glucose ✔                       OWTTE
                                                                                                                                          8 max
                 h. «glucagon» increase levels of glucose in the blood ✔
                 i. negative feedback controls the glucose levels ✔

                 consequences:
                 j. if the pancreas produces little/no insulin a person can develop type I diabetes ✔
                 k. a person with type I diabetes «usually» needs/is dependent on injections of insulin ✔
                 l. type II diabetes occurs when the body becomes resistant to insulin/cells do not
                    respond to insulin ✔
                 m. type II diabetes can «sometimes» be controlled by diet and exercise ✔
                 n. named consequence of having diabetes «eg: eye damage» ✔
