Subject details:              Computer science HL paper 3 markscheme

Mark allocation

Candidates are required to answer all questions. Total 30 marks.


General

A markscheme often has more specific points worthy of a mark than the total allows. This is intentional.
Do not award more than the maximum marks allowed for that part of a question.

When deciding upon alternative answers by candidates to those given in the markscheme, consider the
following points:

• Each statement worth one point has a separate line and the end is signified by means of
  a semi-colon (;).

• An alternative answer or wording is indicated in the markscheme by a “/”; either wording can be
  accepted.

• Words in ( … ) in the markscheme are not necessary to gain the mark.

• If the candidate’s answer has the same meaning or can be clearly interpreted as being the same as
  that in the markscheme then award the mark.

• Mark positively. Give candidates credit for what they have achieved and for what they have got
  correct, rather than penalizing them for what they have not achieved or what they have
  got wrong.

• Remember that many candidates are writing in a second language; be forgiving of minor linguistic
  slips. In this subject effective communication is more important than grammatical accuracy.

• Occasionally, a part of a question may require a calculation whose answer is required for subsequent
  parts. If an error is made in the first part then it should be penalized. However, if the incorrect answer
  is used correctly in subsequent parts then follow through marks should be awarded. Indicate this
  with “FT”.

• Question 4 is marked against markbands. The markbands represent a single holistic criterion applied
  to the piece of work. Each markband level descriptor corresponds to a number of marks. When
  assessing with markbands, a “best fit” approach is used, with markers making a judgment about
  which particular mark to award from the possible range for each level descriptor, according to how
  well the candidate’s work fits that descriptor.

General guidance

 Issue             Guidance
 Answering         • In the case of an “identify” question read all answers and mark positively up to the
 more than           maximum marks. Disregard incorrect answers.
 the quantity      • In the case of a “describe” question, which asks for a certain number of facts
 of responses        eg “describe two kinds”, mark the first two correct answers. This could include two
 prescribed in       descriptions, one description and one identification, or two identifications.
 the questions     • In the case of an “explain” question, which asks for a specified number of
                     explanations eg “explain two reasons …”, mark the first two correct answers.
                     This could include two full explanations, one explanation, one partial explanation
                     etc.

(b)   Award [4 max].
      Award [1] for explaining what URL-rewriting is in the context of stateful
      connection and allow [1] for an example or a comparison with session cookies

      URL Rewriting changes the URL to include parameters
      e.g. www.bangbai.com?userId=Asdf34e3

      Mark as [2] and [2].

      Works without cookies/cookies disabled/as an alternative to cookies;
      URL re-writing will still work as it embeds the session ID inside the request;

      URL Rewriting does not result in anything being saved (e.g. cookies) on the client
      side;
      Therefore, the privacy of the client cannot be compromised (e.g. By searching
      contents of the cookie folder later);

      May work with legacy devices/devices without access to cookies;
      That are not able to use cookies/do not have access to an alternative to URL re-
      writing;

      Makes the links more descriptive/readable;
      Which will help the developer resolve issues (accept example, such as server
      identified in URL);
      (Note to examiners: descriptive cannot be awarded a second mark if not related
      to the scenario e.g. search engines is not correct)

      Allows the details of the identification of the user to be recorded in log files;
      Which will help for future analysis/reviews/data mining;                              [4]

3.   Award [6 max].
     Award [1] for each point that explains why the use of VPN reduces the effectiveness of
     the app up to [6 max].

     A VPN hides the true IP address;
     Instead, it provides the IP address of the VPN’s server;
     A VPN adds an additional layer of complexity has been added;
     Which may increase the likelihood of the connection dropping;
     A VPN encrypts/tunnels the data which is transmitted;
     Which has a potential overhead (more computational power/increases the size of data
     packets) and this may reduce emergency responses times;
     A VPNs may log traffic that passes through;
     This may present a potential security concern if sensitive information is reported;
     A VPN may employ a filtering policy/blocks ports;
     So certain parts of the app may not work (e.g. VOIP protocols may not work);
     If GPS/location service is deactivated, then the system is reliant upon IP Address;
     Location information can be obtained from the GPS/GPS is sent in data packets;
     However, it may not be as easily verifiable by comparing with a known IP location;
     Not having the true IP address would mean that the EMIS server would not have any
     indication of the location of the source of the report;
     VPN usage may give users a feeling of anonymity which may encourage misuse;
     Which may divert resources to the hoaxes instead of authentic reports;                   [6]

4.   The answer could include the following:

     Definitions:
     The source IP hash combines the source and destination IP address to generate a
     hash key, which is then assigned to a specific server. The benefit of this approach is
     that a client who experiences a dropped connection can be returned to their session
     with the same server.
     The client-side random load balancing algorithm delivers a list of server IPs to the
     client, which then selects a server IP at random.

     Security
     As Client Side Random allows control of the choice of server to be made by the client it
     would leave the system much more vulnerable to DOS/DDOS attacks.

     Persistence
     If disconnected, Client Side Random may allocate a new server to the client as it will
     choose randomly from the list. However, if the IP is the same, then Client-side Hash will
     pair the client with the previous server. This may mean that the work being done before
     is not lost (e.g. Client continues from where she left of seamlessly).

     Distinguishing between users
     Client-Side Hash is affected when a single IP address is used by many users (e.g.
     proxy servers sharing a connection, VPNs etc). A single user might also disconnect
     and re-connect with a different IP address due to DHCP so would be seen as a
     “different” person.

     Cost
     Client Side Random is a cheaper solution as it doesn’t require any expensive hardware on
     the server side (i.e. the hardware load balancers etc).

     Single Point of Failure (SPOF)
     Client Side Random eliminates the SPOF as all requests do not depend on one device (i.e.
     the hardware load balancer provided by the system). Similarly, it avoids bottlenecks if the
     load balancer is overloaded.

     Control
     When using client side random, Bangbai Government is essentially losing control over the
     load balancing process. If for some reason they suddenly want to re-direct all queries away
     from certain servers (e.g. It’s been compromised, or the data centre has a fire etc) they
     can’t, as they cannot easily/quickly change the algorithm on each of the client devices.

     Intelligence/Adaptiveness/Flexibility
     Client Side Random may not take into consideration privileged information about the
     servers, which it does not have access to. Therefore, it cannot decide which of the servers
     is *currently* best suited to handle a specific type Such information may include:
        • Server Resources are different (Primary Memory, Secondary Memory,
            Processor)
        • Deployment of the services to different servers (Server A and B deal with video
            reports, Server C with simple text/photo reports etc).
        • Current load of each server (Server B has more connections than server A)
        • Current Health of each server (Server C just died)

Additional Research
Caching can affect a lot of load balancing algorithms as they use DNS to allocate the next
server. This can skew the allocation of servers, but because Client-side Random uses a
randomly generated server from a simple list, it avoids this problem.
The HTTP/2 specification, which is now supported by every major browser, has built in
support for Client-Side Load Balancing. The citizen reporting app can benefit from this as it
uses HTTP for the REST API.

Overall comparison/evaluation
The main issue with the source IP hash load balancing algorithm is that each change
can redirect EVERYBODY to a different server, which again lags the time of response
for a citizen call in Bangbai.
That is why some good load-balancers have implemented a consistent hashing method
to ensure that if a server fails, for example, only the client connected to this server are
redirected and not all.
The counterpart of consistent hashing is that it doesn’t provide a perfect hash, and so,
in a farm of 3 servers, some may receive more clients than others and this can take a
toll on the time of response to citizen calls.
When a failed server comes back, its users (determined by the hashing done on the
Source IP) will be redirected to it again.
There is no overhead in terms of CPU or memory when using such an algorithm.

Conclusion
A final measured conclusion that links together the various points and recommends
one or both of the algorithms as appropriate for the needs of Bangbai.                        [12]
