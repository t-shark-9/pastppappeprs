Option A — Databases

1.   Marble Reading Book Stores (MRBS) is a chain of bookstores based in London. The
     stores want to keep information about the books they sell, the authors of the books and the
     publishers they work with. The assumptions made when the database was created were:
     • a publisher can publish books from one or more authors
     • an author can write one or more books.

     (a)   Construct the entity-relationship diagram (ERD) for this scenario.                                 [2]

     Three of the tables in the MRBS database are shown below:

Option B — Modelling and simulation

5.   The rise in global temperatures has led to the melting of the sea ice in polar regions.
     Scientists have developed a number of computer models that can be used to make
     predictions about the rate of sea ice melting in these polar regions and its effect on coastal
     areas globally. In order to create a computer model a number of variables are identified.

     A computer model of the effects of the melting of the sea ice in the Arctic Ocean may include
     the following variables:
     • average ocean surface temperature (C)
     • albedo of the ocean (the proportion of light reflected from the ocean surface)
     • precipitation (mm)
     • salinity of the ocean (grammes of salt in one kilogramme of water)
     • area of sea ice (km2).
     (a)   Copy and complete the following table showing each variable’s data type and a suitable
           range of values that would represent the information shown above.                          [3]

                  Variable                        Data type           Range of values

                  Ocean surface temperature

                  Albedo

                  Area of sea ice

     In this model the following rules have been determined:
     • for every 0.01 C increase in ocean surface temperature, the area of sea ice decreases by 1 %
     • for every 1 % decrease in the area of the sea ice, the sea level rises by 20 mm.
     The initial values are:
     • area of sea ice = 1 000 000 km2
     • average surface temperature of the ocean is 0.00 C.
     (b)   Using the rules and initial values above, construct the pseudocode that would enable
           the area of the sea ice and the sea level rise to be calculated if there was an increase
           of 0.04 C in the ocean surface temperature.                                               [4]

     (c)   Using the information above state:

           (i)     the area of the sea ice.                                                           [1]

           (ii)    the change in sea level.                                                           [1]

(Option B, question 5 continued)

     The scientists observed when running the model numerous times using historical data there
     were significant differences between observed and expected results.

     A second model was developed that included new variables and rules.

     The surface of the ocean reflects the heat from the sun. The ratio between the area covered
     by the sea ice and the area where there is no sea ice (open ocean) affects the value of the
     average albedo. The lower the albedo, the quicker the sea ice will melt.

     The average albedo is calculated using this formula:

     Average albedo =
     (area of sea ice  albedo of sea ice)  (area of open ocean  albedo of open ocean)
                            (area of sea ice  area of open ocean)

     Note:
     • area of sea ice = 1 000 000 km2
     • area of open ocean = 1 000 000 km2
     • albedo of sea ice = 0.6
     • albedo of open ocean = 0.1.
     The average albedo will change with every iteration of the model. Each iteration is 2 years
     after the previous.

      (a)     The same method identifier addSwimmers is used in both classes Race and Event.

              Explain why this does not cause a conflict.                                         [3]

      The Event class above assumes that the event has more than 8 swimmers and requires
      qualifying heats. However, an event with less than 9 swimmers has no qualifying heats, so
      the original Event class was inherited by a new class FinalsOnlyEvent.

      (b)     Outline two advantages of the OOP feature “inheritance”.                            [4]

      (c)     Outline how method overriding can help to create the new class FinalsOnlyEvent.     [2]

16.   An Event has been instantiated with 2 qualifying heats for a total of 11 swimmers.

      Event free100 = new Event("100 m free style",2);

      The swimmers were added to the two Race arrays and after the races, their times were
      recorded as shown in the table.

      The method fillFinals() will select the 8 fastest swimmers, in ascending order of time,
      from both swimmer arrays and copy them to the swimmer array in the finals race.

      (a)   Sketch the resulting swimmer array in finals.                                          [3]

      To help with this selection, all entries from races[0] and races[1] will be copied into two
      new parallel arrays of size 16, one array for swimmers and one array for their times.

      (b)   Construct the code fragment for the given situation that will copy swimmers and times
            into two parallel arrays named tempSwimmer and tempTime.[6]

17.   The organizing school arranges for visiting students to stay with a host family. The
      information about each of the visiting students is stored in a file. The student records are
      sorted by name. Some of the other variables included are school, gender, age and host
      family name, as shown in the UML diagram below.

       Visitor

       - String name
       - String school
       - char gender
       - int age
       - String hostFamily
       			 … more variables
       + constructors
       + accessor and mutator methods

      A program needs to be written to match visiting students with host families. The matching
      process requires data to be manipulated extensively (adding, editing, deleting). The file will
      be read into RAM.

      This program will be used for different events with different numbers of visitors. Therefore, it
      will be implemented using a dynamic data structure.

      (a)   Define the term object reference.                                                           [1]

      It has been decided to use a single linked list named guests to store and manipulate the
      Visitor objects.

      (c)   (i)	Construct the code needed to instantiate an object guests of the
                 LinkedList class.                                                                      [1]

            (ii)   Construct the code for the method penultimate() that returns the second to
                   last element in the linked list guests. You may assume that guests is locally
                   accessible.[4]

     Consider the following diagram which represents the list guests.

     The following recursive method has been written to act on the list guests.

     public void recursive(int k, char a)
     {
       if (k == guests.size())
       {
     		output ("no such record");
       }
       else
       {
     		 Visitor current = guests.get(k);
     		if ((current.getGender() == a) && (current.getAge() > 15))
     		{
     			output current.getName();
     		}
     		else
     		{
     			 recursive(k + 1,a);
     		}
       }
     }

     (d)   Using the data provided in the diagram, trace the call recursive(0,'F'), clearly
           showing the levels of recursion.                                                        [4]

     (e)   Outline one reason why the use of a recursive method may be inappropriate for
           linked lists. [2]

     Due to unforeseen circumstances, schools may cancel their participation in an event at the
     last minute. Therefore, a method is needed to remove all the visiting students of one school
     from the linked list guests.

     (f)   Construct the method removeSchool that takes the name of a school as parameter
           and removes all students of that school from the list guests.                           [6]
