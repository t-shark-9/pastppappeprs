Subject details:         Computer science HL paper 2 markscheme

Mark allocation

Candidates are required to answer all questions in one Option. Total 65 marks.

General

A markscheme often has more specific points worthy of a mark than the total allows. This is intentional.
Do not award more than the maximum marks allowed for that part of a question.

When deciding upon alternative answers by candidates to those given in the markscheme, consider the
following points:

• Each statement worth one point has a separate line and the end is signified by means of
  a semi-colon (;).

• An alternative answer or wording is indicated in the markscheme by a “/”; either wording can be
  accepted.

• Words in ( … ) in the markscheme are not necessary to gain the mark.

• If the candidate’s answer has the same meaning or can be clearly interpreted as being the same as
  that in the markscheme then award the mark.

• Mark positively. Give candidates credit for what they have achieved and for what they have got
  correct, rather than penalizing them for what they have not achieved or what they have got wrong.

• Remember that many candidates are writing in a second language; be forgiving of minor linguistic
  slips. In this subject effective communication is more important than grammatical accuracy.

• Occasionally, a part of a question may require a calculation whose answer is required for subsequent
  parts. If an error is made in the first part then it should be penalized. However, if the incorrect answer
  is used correctly in subsequent parts then follow through marks should be awarded. Indicate this
  with “FT”.


General guidance

  Issue            Guidance
  Answering        • In the case of an “identify” question, read all answers and mark positively up to the
  more than          maximum marks. Disregard incorrect answers.
  the quantity     • In the case of a “describe” question, which asks for a certain number of facts
  of                 eg “describe two kinds”, mark the first two correct answers. This could include two
  responses          descriptions, one description and one identification, or two identifications.
  prescribed       • In the case of an “explain” question, which asks for a specified number of
  in the             explanations eg “explain two reasons …”, mark the first two correct answers.
  questions          This could include two full explanations, one explanation, one partial explanation etc.

     (b)   Award [2 max].
           As Book_Title attribute is String/Varchar;
           It does not allow many validation checks (like range check etc);                     [2]

     (c)   Award [1 max].
           Seeking the truth;                                                                   [1]

     (d)   Award [4 max].
           Award [1] for selection of Book_Title from Book
           Award [1] for INNER JOIN Book ON PUBLISHER
           Award [1] for JOIN Author.Author_Num = Book.Author_NUM
           Award [1] for the correct test of equity of Publisher_Name.

           SELECT Book_Title FROM Book
           INNER JOIN Book ON PUBLISHER
           Author.Author_Num = Book.Author_Num
           WHERE Publisher_Name = “Orlando Crux”                                                [4]

     (e)   Award [2 max].
           Transaction must be completed in full;
           Otherwise a rollback will occur;                                                     [2]

     (f)   Award [2 max].

           Each user sees a fixed view of the data;
           This may include visible changes made by the user / the user's own transactions
           and transactions of other users

           Changes made are not permanent and can be reversed using rollback;
           This will return the database to its previous state (maintaining consistency);       [2]

     (g)   Award [2 max].
           When a field value changes multiple occurrences must be updated;
           For example, if a publisher moves, we’ll need to change the values for City and
           Country in multiple records;
           Problem occurs if we forget to change the values in any of the records;
           The database would then have data inconsistency;                                     [2]

           Do not accept answer relating to storage requirements – it is not an issue in this
           database

2.   (a)   Award [3 max].
           Row Locking;
           Allows concurrent processing while ensuring transaction isolation;
           Thus, ensuring the update of one teacher does not affect the update of another
           teacher;
           While one transaction (by a teacher) is accessing a resource from a shared
           folder, it places a lock, an access restriction, on the resource, controlling the level
           of access allowed by another transaction by another teacher;                              [3]

     (b)   Award [4 max].
           Award [1] for identifying a way of maintaining data security and [1] for a
           development up to [2 max]
           Mark as [2] and [2]

           Minimizing permissions/creating Access Rights;
           Restrict users to have permission only to the means to do their job. Some can
           view, modify and insert some only view etc;

           Auditing changes;
           Log changes made to teachers and permissions through auditing. This gives a
           trail to follow should you have problems. Without authorization no one gets grant
           of permissions;

           Minimizing table access;
           Isolate the teachers from the data tables they do not need / Create views and
           user defined functions to support user access requirements and not give access
           to the tables;                                                                            [4]

     (c)   (i)   Award [2 max].
                 Award [1] for identifying a way of maintaining data security and [1] for a
                 development up to [2 max].

                 Deferred update;
                 does not physically update the database on disk until a transaction has
                 reached its commit point/if a transaction fails before reaching its commit
                 point, it will not have changed the database in any way so UNDO is not
                 required;

                 Shadow paging;
                 When a page is to be modified, a shadow page is allocated in which
                 changes are made;
                 When it is ready to become durable, all pages that refer to original are
                 updated to refer new replacement page;

                 Back-up / Mirror Copy;
                 Back-up/Mirror copies of the entire database are made to ensure the
                 database is at the most updated version of the original;                            [2]

       example up to [3 max].

       Data masking or data obfuscation;
       is the process of hiding original data with random characters;
       eg: suppressing certain characters in the student address, student id etc;

       Data encryption;
       Conversion of data into non-readable gibberish creates highly secure
       results such as scrambling the student_ID;
       The only way to gain access to the data is to unlock it with a key or
       password which only those authorized can access;                             [3]

3.   (a)   Award [4 max].
           Applications interacting with the database are minimally affected;
           When a fully normalized database structure is extended, to accommodate new
           types of data, database structure can remain largely or entirely unchanged;
           So, the applications interacting with the database are minimally affected;

           Key dependent;
           Every non-key column in every table is directly dependent on the key, the whole
           key and nothing but the key;
           Remove redundant data;

      You can enter foreign keys that do not match the corresponding primary key in
      the related table;
      This could cause a lot of problems such as mismatched customer data and
      mismatched transaction records;

      Cascading update;
      If the primary key for a record in the Managers table changes, all corresponding
      records in the Employees table are modified;

      Cascading delete;
      If a record in the Managers table is deleted, all corresponding records in the
      Employees table are deleted;                                                         [2]

      And that there is no single attribute that is able to uniquely identify a record;
      In a manner that will not lead to potential duplication of records;
      It identifies exactly one record of the table, then that record shows the single
      value of each of the non-key attributes;

                    Data warehouses contain both historical and current data;
                    Timestamps are required to compare data from different times;                     [2]

           (ii)     Award [2 max].
                    Increased Query and System Performance;
                    data warehouse is built for analysis and retrieval of data rather than
                    efficient upkeep of individual records (ie transactions);

                    Timely Access to Data;
                    ETL, are used within a data warehouse environment. These routines
                    consolidate data from multiple source systems and transform the data into
                    a useful format that enable quick querying;

                    Enhanced Data Quality and Consistency;
                    Data from the various business units and departments is standardized and
                    the inconsistent nature of data from the different sources is removed;
                    Individual business units will start to utilize the same data repository as the
                    source system for their individual queries and reports;

                    Historical Intelligence;
                    Data warehouse stores large amounts of historical data and time-period
                    analysis, trend analysis, and trend prediction thus allowing for advanced
                    reporting and analysis of multiple time-periods;                                  [2]

           When the data is collected from different sources each source will have their own
           standards if we have two different data sources A and B;
           Selection of the data that is going to be useful in analysis – the different offices
           will have data relevant only to them, such as staff names, etc;
           Standardization of the data – the company may have imposed a standard on all
           its offices, but this is not always the case, and the data will certainly have to be
           Checked, eg date formats are different in different countries;
           Other transformation techniques that students may give as examples are more
           like:

           •      Cleaning (eg “Male” to “M” and “Female” to “F” etc)
           •      Filtering (eg selecting only certain columns to load)
           •      Enriching (eg Full name to First Name , Middle Name , Last Name)
           •      Splitting a column into multiple columns and vice versa.                            [2]

      Award [1] for a description of link analysis being used to find patterns
      Award up to [2] for comparison between the two techniques

      Cluster Analysis
      Cluster analysis groups customers by age / according to different factors, such as
      region/location;
      Therefore, it enables comparison between groups;

      Classification
      A classifier or model is developed using training sets of data;
      New data is then added to the model and compared against the predicted
      outcomes / new classifiers may be developed;

      Discussion
      Classification requires prior knowledge of the customer base, cluster analysis
      does not;
      Data can be classed in new samples using classification whereas for cluster
      analysis one only suggests groups based upon patterns in data;
      Labelled samples from a set of classes is required for classification whereas for
      cluster analysis unlabelled samples will do;                                         [6]

(d)   Award [3 max].
      Access the customer payment details for purchases of fairly large orders from the

      customers;
      Identify the outliers/customers who have defaulted more than a fixed number of
      times in payment after running the deviation detection (multiple if-then-else

      Award [1] for an outline of customer segmentation
      Award [1] for an outline of link analysis
      Award up to [3 max] for use by ZCC to improve marketing strategies

      Customer segmentation
      Divides a customer base into groups of individuals that are similar in specific
      ways relevant to marketing, such as age, gender, order of the type of paper,
      frequency of orders placed and the size of the orders normally placed;
      assign each customer to one of the segments;
      A typical segmentation makes each segment distinct from other segments
      (different segments have different needs), it is homogeneous within the segment
      (exhibits common needs);
      segmenting is using borders to form groups;
      Segmentation groups objects into similar groups;
      The resulting groups contain members that are more similar to each other than
      they are to other groups;

      Link Analysis
      Load a claim and runs a query back to the database to find all other claims
      sharing any similar attributes;
      show matches on the address of a claimant in the original case being
      investigated;
      Now combine matches-merge identical nodes. So, we can more easily see
      unusual connections;
      Once seen a suspicious link, accept or escalate;

           Award [1] for identification of implication and up to [3 max] for the development of
           the implication identified.

           Rendering for non-interactive media such as animations is a much slower
           process than for interactive media/games;
           Rendering times for individual frames may vary from a few seconds to days
           depending on the complexity of the scene;
           Rendered frames are stored to a hard disk and then transferred to other media
           for playback;

           3D rendering is computationally resource hungry;
           Computer processing power has increased rapidly and greatly over the years;
           Allowing a much higher degree of photorealism / realistic rendering;
           However, the enough computational power still can’t cope up with growing
           demand of realistic 3D animation.                                                      [6]

           Supervised learning is when the outcome related to a given input is already

           Whereas unsupervised learning is when no examples of outcome are given to
           help with the learning;
           And so, the “learner” must deduce its own solutions eg classifying similar objects
           by colour or shape;                                                                   [4]

      Lossy compression
      Reduces the file-size by removing some of the data in the file;
      Once removed, the data cannot be recovered;
      This generally results in a loss of quality (e.g. picture resolution, audio frequency
      range);
      Files compressed using lossy compression are used in their compressed form
      (e.g. images, video, audio);

      Lossless compression
      Reduces file size by looking for repeated patterns of data / redundant data and
      replacing those with a single shorter "token"; //do not penalize the candidate for
      not using the word “token”
      Files must be decompressed before they can be used/ to recover the data;

      Lossless compression reduces file size while preserving all the data;
      Once decompressed, the pdf document will contain all the data in its original

      It would be hard for a lossy compression algorithm to distinguish between data
      that can be removed (e.g. reducing the resolution of the images) and data that is
      necessary for the pdf documents to make sense (e.g. parts of the text);
      Using lossy compression may result in an unusable/unreadable document;

            Reasons why power laws may be appropriate
            The number of users shown for each site appears to follow the general pattern of
            a power law distribution / is consistent with the general principles of power laws
            (the “rich get richer”);
            It's likely/reasonable to assume that sites with large numbers of users will tend to
            attract more new users than sites with fewer users;
            This may be particularly true of social media sites where a high number of
            existing users may equate to a more diverse/engaging/attractive experience for
            new users;

            Reasons why power laws may not be appropriate
            However, correlation does not equal causation. / Just because the sites appear to
            exhibit a power law distribution, it doesn't mean that their growth is governed by a
            power law;
            Other factors may be more significant (e.g. the demographic / region a social
            media site attracts, changing fashion, the policies of the sites themselves);
            Sites that were very popular in the past but diminished/died-out may suggest that
            power laws are not the only / main factor influencing future development (e.g.
            MySpace);

            Enables Narayan City to gather data from many more sources than would be
            possible through the use of traditional data-gathering methods;
            This will enable far more information to be gathered far more quickly than using
            traditional methods;

            Data is generated proactively by citizens' actions;
            Therefore, data more likely to reflect what citizens actually do rather than what
            they might claim they do;
            Improves the accuracy of the data;

            Existing strategies used by citizens can be incorporated into future planning;
            for example, using side-roads to optimize journey times/timing of journeys to
            avoid major congestion;
            Thus, helping to ensure that future plans are optimized / tailored to citizens’
            needs;

            Data gathering and analysis can be automated;
            Therefore, it is very cost effective;
            Thus, it is able to be scaled / increased without major impacts on budget;

            Data monitoring and collection is real-time;
            Therefore, the effect of implementing plans will be reflected by visible changes in
            use patterns / journey times / routes taken;
            Thus, the city council can get reliable feedback/evaluation of how effective their
            plans are;

      • Folksonomies / hashtags / social media / web 2.0 has given all users
        opportunity to create instead of simply seeking information;
      • trending hashtags may make users with opposing points of view less willing to
        expose their dissent / more likely that users just follow the trend;
      • Social media allows people to be anonymous and hence more likely to
        attack/hurt others
      • users including certain hashtags may find themselves open to attack/abuse
        from other human users / automated bot accounts (e.g. “trolling”);
      • hashtags are open to misuse and manipulation (e.g. "bot" accounts flooding
        social media with tagged posts / users stuffing posts with multiple lines of the
        same hashtag to create a false "trend");
      • users who follow/search on popular hashtags may find themselves "bubbled" –
        i.e. they are only ever exposed to viewpoints that reflect their own existing
        perspectives;
      • Content people share is moving towards viral / inappropriate content to attract
        attention
      • Followers of popular accounts / hashtags tend to be influenced by the views /

            Descriptions
            A class is the blueprint/template/abstraction for an entity/object;
            An instantiation is the process of creating an object / is an actual object (that
            contains data);

            Example involving actual data that links the 2 concepts
            The class Race stores up to 8 different instantiated objects of the Swimmer class
            and their times;
            Swimmer is the generic class for a swimmer in the event. An instantiation of this
            class would be a specific swimmer with name, school etc.;                              [3]

                   Aggregation allows code reuse / reduces amount of coding;
                   As the code for the Swimmer object already exists;

                   Aggregation allows for the better organization of objects;
                   As the variables/methods of the aggregated data will be kept in the class in
                   which it belongs;
                                                                                                   [2]

                   Aggregation increases dependencies;
                   A change in the Swimmer class could have an unexpected consequence for
                   the Race class;

                   Using aggregation can lead to more complex code;

            Each method is defined within its own class.

            It promotes code reuse / reduces redundancy;

            development time;

            It reduces maintenance overhead;
            Because you only have to update the parent;

            Can speed up development time;
            As parent code will (probably) already have been tested;

            The extensibility feature of inheritance;
            Is a measure of the ability to extend the class without having to create completely
            new classes;                                                                          [4]

Example answer 3:

Swimmer[] tempSwim = new Swimmer[16];
double[] tempTime = new double[16];
for(int j = 0; j < 8; j++)
{
    tempSwim[j] = races[0].getSwimmer(j);
    tempTime[j] = races[0].getTime(j);
    tempSwim[j+8] = races[1].getSwimmer(j);
    tempTime[j+8] = races[1].getTime(j);
}

Example answer 4:

Swimmer[] tempSwim = new Swimmer[16];
double[] tempTime = new double[16];
for(int j = 0; j < 16; j++)
{
     if (j < 8)
     {
          tempSwim[j] = races[0].getSwimmer(j);
          tempTime[j] = races[0].getTime(j);
     }
     else
     {
          tempSwim[j] = races[1].getSwimmer(j-8);
          tempTime[j] = races[1].getTime(j-8);

Note to examiners: that the question asks for all entries to be copied. However,
do not penalize "efficient" solutions that avoid copying the null and 0 entries.

Example answer 3 using the undefined addSwimmers() method in the Race
class:

int k = 0;
int count = 0;
while ((count < 8) && (k < 16)) // allow even if (k<16) is missing
{
  if (tempTime[k] != 0)        // tempSwimmer[k].getName() != null
                                        // allow tempSwimmer[k] != null
    {
            finals.addSwimmers(tempSwimmer[k],count);
            count++;
    }
    k++;
}

Example 4 using a single for loop

Note that all 3 above versions can be written with a for loop as shown below (the
same mark scheme can be used):

int count = 0;
for (int k = 0; k < 16; k++)
{
     if (tempTime[k] != 0)              // tempSwimmer[k].getName() != null
                                        // allow tempSwimmer[k] != null
        {
               finals.setSwimmer(tempSwimmer[k],count);
               count ++;
               if (count == 8)
                  break;
        }
}

      For a large linked list, this would require a large number of recursive calls /

      Which may cause stack overflow;

      A linked list only allows for sequential access;
      Therefore, using recursion would not lead to any gains in efficiency;             [2 marks]
