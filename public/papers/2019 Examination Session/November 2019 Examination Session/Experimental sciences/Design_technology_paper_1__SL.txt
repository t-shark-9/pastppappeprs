Questions 27 – 30 relate to the following case study. Please read the case study carefully and answer
the questions.

Puma’s new shoe packaging changes the idea of the shoebox by wrapping footwear in a simple
cardboard structure held in place by a reusable bag.

Puma’s new design of shoe box is known as “Clever Little Bag” and was designed by a company led by
designer Yves Béhar, see Figure 7.

                          Figure 7: An example of the Puma Clever Little Bag




                           [Source: images and details with kind permission from fuseproject]


Clever Little Bag contains 65 % less cardboard, by using a bag made of recycled plastic as the outer
layer that holds the inner cardboard structure and has no top/lid.

The bag’s handles slip through a hole at one end of the inner box, securing the bag to the cardboard and
providing a plastic bag-free way to carry the shoes.

Due to using 8500 fewer tons of paper, and the new packaging’s lighter weight, Puma expects to cut
carbon dioxide emissions by 10 000 tons per year and water, energy and diesel use by 60 %. That works
out to 1 million litres of water, 20 million megajoules of electricity, 1 million litres of fuel oil and 500 000
litres of diesel, see Figure 8.
