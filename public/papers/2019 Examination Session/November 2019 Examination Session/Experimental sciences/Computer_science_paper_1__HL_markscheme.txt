Subject details:         Computer science HL paper 1 markscheme

Mark allocation

Section A: Candidates are required to answer all questions. Total 25 marks.
Section B: Candidates are required to answer all questions. Total 75 marks.
           Maximum total = 100 marks.

General

• A markscheme often has more specific points worthy of a mark than the total allows. This is
  intentional. Do not award more than the maximum marks allowed for that part of a question.

• When deciding upon alternative answers by candidates to those given in the markscheme, consider
  the following points:

• Each statement worth one point has a separate line and the end is signified by means of a
  semi-colon (;).

• An alternative answer or wording is indicated in the markscheme by a “/”; either wording can be
  accepted.

• Words in ( … ) in the markscheme are not necessary to gain the mark.

• If the candidate’s answer has the same meaning or can be clearly interpreted as being the same as
  that in the markscheme then award the mark.

• Mark positively. Give candidates credit for what they have achieved and for what they have got
  correct, rather than penalizing them for what they have not achieved or what they have got wrong.

• Remember that many candidates are writing in a second language; be forgiving of minor linguistic
  slips. In this subject effective communication is more important than grammatical accuracy.

• Occasionally, a part of a question may require a calculation whose answer is required for subsequent
  parts. If an error is made in the first part then it should be penalized. However, if the incorrect answer
  is used correctly in subsequent parts then follow through marks should be awarded. Indicate this
  with “FT”.


General guidance

  Issue            Guidance
  Answering        • In the case of an “identify” question, read all answers and mark positively up to the
  more than          maximum marks. Disregard incorrect answers.
  the quantity     • In the case of a “describe” question, which asks for a certain number of facts
  of                 eg “describe two kinds”, mark the first two correct answers. This could include two
  responses          descriptions, one description and one identification, or two identifications.
  prescribed       • In the case of an “explain” question, which asks for a specified number of
  in the             explanations eg “explain two reasons …”, mark the first two correct answers.
  questions          This could include two full explanations, one explanation, one partial
                     explanation etc.

     to a remote server that could be accessed/controlled over the internet;

     copies of all important data files (backup) could be placed on two separate hardware
     devices;
     which are placed in two different physical locations;

     a remote file server could be set up;

     Cache memory is a memory that a computer microprocessor can access more quickly
     than it can access regular RAM;
     It is integrated directly with the CPU chip or placed on a separate chip which has a
     separate bus interconnect with the CPU;
     and stores frequently used data only until a computer is powered up;
     Thus, when a processor requests data that already has an instance in the cache
     memory; it does not need to go to the main memory or the hard disk to fetch the data;

     Cache memory is a small-sized type of volatile computer memory;
     that provides high-speed data access to a processor;
     and stores frequently used computer programs, applications and data;
     Cache memory can be primary or secondary cache memory, where primary cache
     memory is directly integrated to the processor;
     And secondary cache memory is a reserved portion on a disk stores and provide
     access to frequently accessed data/applications from the disk.                          [3 max]

6.   Award [3 max]
     Abstraction allows us to create a general idea of what the problem is and how to solve
     it;
     Abstraction removes all specific detail, and any patterns that will not help in solving a
     problem. This helps in forming a “model” (If designers don’t abstract they may end up
     with the wrong solution to the problem they are trying to solve);
     Abstraction is widely used because there exist a number of “patterns” in programming
     that keeps repeating in every application/program;
     The pattern corresponding to an issue can be found, then the abstract solution to it can
     be found and implemented, and the problem is solved;
     Most programming languages provide some built-in abstract patterns, which are easy
     to use (some API provides more advanced patterns);

     Abstraction is the process of taking away or removing characteristics from something in
     order to reduce it to a set of essential characteristics;
     In object-oriented programming, abstraction is one of three central principles (along
     with encapsulation and inheritance);
     Through the process of abstraction, a programmer hides all but the relevant data about
     an object in order to reduce complexity and increase efficiency;
     The resulting object itself can be referred to as an abstraction, meaning a named entity
     made up of selected attributes and behavior specific to a particular usage of the
     originating entity. Abstraction is related to both encapsulation and data hiding;           [3 max]

     Virtual memory is a memory management capability of an OS;
     that (uses hardware and software to) allow a computer to compensate for physical
     memory shortages by temporarily transferring data from random access memory

           Direct changeover:
           is the cheapest and quickest/the old system is completely switched for the new

           this is straight forward but also the most risky / nothing to fall back on;
           no need to keep data duplicates;
           it allows the organization to change the system when most convenient;
           the employees have very little time in order get use to the new system as the
           change is instantaneous;
           there is a period of time when neither systems are operational;

           Phased conversion:
           method where the old system is still in use but parts of the new system or
           modules are introduced, involves bringing in the new system one step at a time;
           less risky than direct changeover; less risky that the whole system will go wrong/if
           something happens, it will only affect the specific part;

            files can be shared directly using a network/all computers in the network can
            share resources such as printers, scanners;

            Communication;
            students/teachers can communicate with people around the world via the

            Interactive teamwork;
            software (like Microsoft Office) enables many users to contribute to a document
            concurrently;

            Flexible access;
            network allows students to access files from different computers (throughout the
            network) (one can begin work on a project on one computer and finish up on
            another);

            Software cost;
            software products are available for networks at a substantial savings in
            comparison to buying individually licensed software;

            Software management;
            load software on the server saves time compared to installing and tracking files
            on independent computers/upgrades are also easier because changes only have
            to be done once on the file server instead of on individual computers;

            Improved network security;
            if the school has its own network, it can monitor network traffic / can create a

             A network router is a hardware device that is connected to multiple
             channels for different networks;
             through an interface that is situated on each network;

             Router acts as a processing unit for information packets;
             it duplicates information packets for use during transmission from one
             network to another;

             The router uses a protocol or set of rules;
             to determine which information packets are to be routed to certain interfaces
             within the network;                                                             [2 max]

             Network interface cards are used to connect each computer to the network;
             so they can communicate with the network router to receive information
             packets;

             Interface cards determine the infrastructure of a local area network (LAN);
             and allow all of the computers to connect to the network;                       [2 max]

(c)   Award [2 max].
      Protocols define the rules that govern network communication (for example,
      packet format, type and size, what happens when an error occurs, and which part
      of the network is supposed to handle the error and how);

      Computer networks consists of various types of equipment (such as routers,
      switches, hubs and network interface cards) and the equipment comes from
      different vendors, but they must all work together or the network does not operate
      correctly;

      Protocols work in layers (the highest being what the user sees, and the lowest

      Each (wireless network) adapter has a unique label called a MAC address;

      Routers uses these addresses to identify/authenticate computers (routers include
      an option to whitelist or blacklist certain devices based on MAC addresses, so
      access could be restricted to any device which is not in the whitelist);

      One disadvantage is that the whitelist should be amended any time a new device
      is purchased / when access to guests should be granted;

      Also this method is useless against hackers who use programs which intercept
      data passing through network and report the MAC address of any device
      communicating on the network;                                                      [4 max]

                   Screen resolution is the number of pixels a screen can display (horizontally
                   and vertically). (For example, the screen can show 1024 pixels horizontally
                   and 768 vertically);                                                                [1]

            (ii)   Award [4 max].
                   Screens that are different sizes (for example, 3–6 diagonal inches for a
                   phone, and 9–12 diagonal inches for a tablet, size of 13–17 inches for a
                   notebook screen, and a desktop screen size of 20–30 inches);
                   can still have the same screen resolution (for example, a laptop could have
                   a 13-inch screen with a resolution of 1280 x 800 and a desktop computer
                   could have a 17 inch monitor with the same 1280 x 800 resolution);
                   but physically smaller screen will not show less of the website;
                   the screen with the higher resolution will be able to show you more of the
                   website because that screen has more pixels and the image will be
                   sharper;
                   but elements on the screen (icons and text) will look smaller;

                   Most mobile displays currently have screens with fewer pixels than desktop
                   displays and are physically smaller;
                   typing on small on-screen keyboards is difficult;
                   less precision (clicking a 12-pixel-high text link with a mouse is no problem
                   but tapping the same link with fingers could be difficult);
                   there is no mouse pointer so there is no concept of "hovering" over a page
                   element/ remaining in an uncertain state;
                   most modern touch screens allow zooming;
                   allow the user to perform gestures using one or more fingers, such as
                   swiping/pinching;

            OS controls all the activities of computer system and acts as an interface
            between user and hardware;

            Thus the role of OS is
            to keep track of who is using which resource;
            to grant resource requests;

      Award [2 max] for evidence that:
      Sensors (input devices) detect/measure the water level;
      sensors detect/measure the temperature (of the water);
      sensors detect/measure the dampness/moisture level of the clothes;
      sensors also detect movement of the machine's drum and other associated
      actions;

      Sensors continuously take readings/measurements (in the context of above) and
      send these readings to the processor;

      Award [2 max] for evidence that:
      processor controls sensors, valves and actuators responsible for controlling the
      parts that clean clothes;
      processor determines what actions the machine should take next;
      the washing machine has been programmed/ it goes through a process of
      running its internal programs;

      processor compares readings with pre-set values (in the context of the various
      sensors);
      if the readings fall outside of the specified range, the processor sends a message
      to the output transducer to switch on/off ... (in the context of part of the washing
      machine);

      Award [2 max] for evidence that:
      output transducers are used for turning on and off devices that control the rest of
      the machine;
      such as the motors that spin the tub;
      or the water pump;

      Example:
      once the start button is pushed the washing machine begins to dump water into
      the drum, a sensor will detect that the water level has been reached;
      based on the setting, the processor will allow the water to flow only to a
      predetermined level;
      it will send the signal to output transducers to shut off the water;
      and begin the agitation process;
      once the timer tells that it is time, processor sends signal to output transducer to
      stop agitating;
      it then begins the spin process/ removing the dirty water from the machine
      at the end of the spin cycle, the washing machine's processor sends signal
      to turn on the water pump and sucking it out of the machine;                           [6 max]

            keep track of the top of the stack since not all of the array holds stack elements
            (in an integer variable, for example, named TOP);

            the main property of a stack is that stack values/objects go on and come off of
