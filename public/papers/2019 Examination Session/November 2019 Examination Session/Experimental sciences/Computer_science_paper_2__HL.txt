Option A — Databases

1.   One-to-7 is an international organization that works with teachers and other educators. One
     department within this organization provides an online forum for teachers to discuss ideas for
     lessons and to share resources.

     In order to access this forum teachers are required to submit the following information, which
     will be stored in a table in the database.

                  Figure 1: Online form to register personal details to the One-to-7 forum

                                                          Personal Details Fields marked with an * are required

     (a)     Identify one reason why the teacher’s name has been split into two fields.                          [1]

     (b)     Outline one reason why there may be concerns about the amount of personal
             information that is requested.                                                                      [2]

     Once the submit button on the online form has been selected, the personal data is input into
     the database.

     (c)     Outline why the transaction needs to be atomic in the context of this scenario.                     [2]

     Once the teacher is registered they can post comments on the forum.

     (d)     Explain how transactions are managed to ensure isolation when registered teachers
             add comments to a discussion thread on the forum.                                                   [3]

     The One-to-7 database in managed by the database administrator (DBA).

     (e)     Identify two tasks that are carried out by the database administrator (DBA).                        [2]

     The DBA is considering using the email address as the primary key, but is concerned that
     many of the 250 000 educators who are registering for this online forum may have more than
     one email address. Users may create duplicate accounts, deliberately or accidently, by using
     different email addresses as usernames.

     (f)     Explain the factors that would need to be considered in using a composite primary key
             instead of only using the email address.                                                            [4]

(Option A continued)

2.   Taxonomy is the part of science that focuses on naming and classifying or grouping organisms.
     Swedish naturalist, Carl Linnaeus, developed the current hierarchical classification system of
     taxonomic classification in the 1700s. This classification is hierarchical so one class has many
     orders, and one order has many families.

     Birds can be classified under the Linnaean hierarchical taxonomy as “Aves”. In one system
     of classification, Aves has 23 orders, one of which is the order Ciconiiformes, which holds six
     families within it.

     (a)   Construct an entity-relationship-diagram that shows the relationships between the
           class, order and family.                                                                    [2]

     Spoonbills constitute one of the families within the order Ciconiiformes. Data can be collected
     about spoonbills, such as length of the bill or beak, and is included in the database.

     (b)   (i)	Outline, using an example, how data validation can ensure that data is entered
                into the birds database correctly.                                                     [2]

           (ii)   Outline, using an example, how data verification can ensure that data is entered
                  into the birds database correctly.                                                   [2]

     (c)   Distinguish between data and information when entering the length of a spoonbill’s
           beak in the database.                                                                       [2]

     (d)   Identify two characteristics of a conceptual schema.                                        [2]

     (e)   Explain why the use of data modelling is critical to the success of a database, such as
           the one used in this scenario.                                                              [3]

     (f)   Explain, using the example described in the scenario, why referential integrity is
           important in databases.                                                                     [3]


3.   Trucking On, a logistics and haulage company based in Marseille, France, keeps track of its
     lorries and operations in a database.

     Lorries are made up of the truck and a trailer. Trucks are usually coupled with the same
     trailer but sometimes trailers are moved to a different truck for part of the year.

     Each driver only uses one truck.

     (a)   Identify two characteristics that make a database unnormalized.                             [2]



(Option A continues on the following page)




                                                                                                Turn over

     Trailer space is measured in cubic metres.

     The table can also be represented as:

     LORRY (TruckID, Truckmake, Energysource, Driver, Tel, TrailerID,
     Trailerspace, Coupled_from, Coupled_to)

     (b)   Outline why data redundancy may be a problem in the LORRY table.                              [2]

     The table has been split into two tables following the rules of normalization. The resulting two
     tables are shown with the primary key underlined:

     LORRY (TruckID, Truckmake, Energysource, Driver, Tel)

     TRAILER (TrailerID, Trailerspace, Coupled_from, Coupled_to, TruckID)

     (c)   Identify the steps to create a query to find the names and telephone numbers of the
           drivers who drive lorries that have more than 60 cubic metres of trailer space.               [4]

     (d)   Normalize the database to 3NF. Use the same format as shown, ensuring that primary
           keys are clearly indicated by underlining them.                                               [7]

(Option A continued)

4.   The collection, storage and sharing of data is becoming increasingly important for
     organizations who have a choice about which type of database to use to store their data. Two
     examples of database types are relational and object-oriented.

     (a)   Explain two advantages of using a relational database rather than an object-oriented
           database.                                                                               [4]

     The 2016 US presidential election was seen to be a victory for data analytics. Companies
     that specialize in analytics use data warehouses.

     (b)   State two characteristics of a data warehouse.                                          [2]

     (c)   Outline why data needs to be transformed before it can be loaded into the data
           warehouse.                                                                              [2]

     (d)   Outline why opinion poll data and other election data are timestamped when added to
           the data warehouse.                                                                     [2]

     (e)   Outline why analytics companies use link analysis.                                      [2]

     (f)   Outline why analytics companies use deviation detection.                                [2]

     Once data has been loaded into a data warehouse it can be mined. The use of data analytics
     is believed to have been important to the outcome of the US election campaign.

     (g)   Discuss whether the advantages of data mining techniques in this scenario outweigh
           the disadvantages.                                                                      [6]




                                      End of Option A




                                                                                             Turn over
                                                   –6–                  N19/4/COMSC/HP2/ENG/TZ0/XX

Option B — Modelling and simulation

5.   Investment planning is something that many people need to be aware of. Planning for your
     future requires research because bad choices can be very costly.

     Interest paid on money invested is usually in the form of compound interest. The formula to
     calculate compound interest is:

     T = P * (1 + r)n

     T is the total value of the investment,
     P is the principal sum invested,
     r is the interest rate per time period converted to a decimal (for example, 5 % is 0.05),
     n is the number of time periods.

     (a)   Calculate the total value of the investment after two years if the principal sum of $ 30 000
           is invested. The yearly interest rate is 10 % and this rate is compounded at the end of
           each year.                                                                                    [2]

     An additional $ 1000 is added to a principal amount of $ 30 000 at the end of each month.
     The monthly interest rate is 0.5 % and this rate is compounded at the end of each month.

     (b)   Outline, using a diagram or otherwise, a method of calculating the total value of the
           investment after 12 months.                                                                   [5]

     Each month, tax is calculated on the monthly profit at a rate of 25 % when the investment
     total (T) is $ 40 000, or below. However, when the investment total (T) is above $ 40 000, the
     tax rate is 40 %.

     The tax is calculated at the end of each month after interest has been added. A running total
     of the tax is kept and only deducted from the investment total (T) at the end of the year.

     (c)   Construct an algorithm to calculate the fund value at the end of each month. This
           algorithm should also calculate the total value of the investment after the tax has been
           deducted after 12 months.                                                                     [6]

     Many investment companies offer alternative investment schemes and use modelling to set
     the rates of interest.

     (d)   Explain why the investment company would use modelling when setting the rates
           of interest.                                                                                  [4]

6.   A supermarket chain has identified four potential locations to build a distribution centre.
     The distribution centre will store goods and distribute them to a large number of
     supermarkets in the region.

     A computer simulation will be run to determine the best location to build the distribution centre.

     (a)   Outline two reasons for using a computer simulation in this scenario.                         [4]

     (b)   (i)	Identify two data inputs for this computer simulation model.                             [2]

           (ii)    Identify two criteria that may be used to determine the best location to build the

7.   The QT Railway and QT Highway have recently been built to connect Qinghai with Tibet.
     This has made the mountainous region of Tibet accessible to the rest of China.

     The endangered Tibetan antelope migrates over 300 km each year to give birth to a single calf.
     The QT Railway and QT Highway cross this migration route, see Figure 2.

     The building of the QT Railway and QT Highway presents potential dangers to both the
     antelopes and the public travelling through this nature reserve.

     To understand more about the antelopes’ migration patterns, some antelopes have tracking
     devices attached. Using the information from these tracking devices, a 2D visualization
     model can be developed and updated in real time.

     (a)    Identify four items of data that would be included to create the 2D visualization model.                  [4]

     (b)    Explain why a 2D visualization model would be used rather than a 3D visualization
            model in this scenario.                                                                                   [4]

8.   Optical character recognition (OCR) is a method where printed text or handwritten text is
     converted to machine-encoded text.

     (a)      Outline one problem that may lead to printed text characters not being detected correctly. [2]

     Recognizing handwritten characters presents more of a problem because people have
     different handwriting styles.

     For example, the digitized handwritten letter X in Figure 3 does not exactly match the
     digitized letter X in Figure 4.

           Figure 3: Digitized handwritten letter X              Figure 4: Digitized letter X

                -1 -1 -1 -1 -1 -1 -1 -1 -1                      -1 -1 -1 -1 -1 -1 -1 -1 -1
                -1 -1 -1 -1 -1 -1 -1 -1 -1                      -1 -1 -1 -1 -1 -1 -1 -1 -1

                -1 -1 -1 -1 -1 -1 -1 -1 -1                      -1 -1 -1 -1 -1 -1 -1 -1 -1
                -1 -1 -1 -1 -1 -1 -1 -1 -1                      -1 -1 -1 -1 -1 -1 -1 -1 -1
                -1 -1 -1 -1 -1 -1 -1 -1 -1                      -1 -1 -1 -1 -1 -1 -1 -1 -1
                -1 -1 -1 -1 -1 -1 -1 -1 -1                      -1 -1 -1 -1 -1 -1 -1 -1 -1

     Artificial neural networks (ANNs) can be used to assist with recognizing handwritten
     characters that do not exactly match the expected pattern.

     (b)      Outline why an ANN can be used to overcome the challenges outlined in this scenario.       [2]

     (c)      Explain how ANN pattern recognition techniques are applied to ensure that the
              handwritten letter X in Figure 3 is recognized as a letter X.                              [4]

     Predictive text, where the computer predicts the next word in the sentence, can be
     programmed to utilize a neural network.

     (d)      Identify two features that would be required by the ANN to predict the next word in the
              sentence.                                                                                  [2]

     The sentence “The child is feeling” is entered into an application that uses predictive text and
     three options are suggested: better, like, a. Upon entering the two characters “hu” the word
     hungry is suggested.

     (e)      Explain how the application uses a neural network to suggest suitable words.               [6]

     (f)      Outline two potential problems with training the ANN to suggest appropriate words.         [4]

Option D — Object-oriented programming

To improve customer satisfaction, a supermarket chain wants to create an object-oriented program
(OOP) to simulate the lines of customers at the check-outs in their point of sale (POS) system.

This point of sale (POS) system consists of several check-out counters. After filling their shopping carts
with items, customers line up at one of the check-out counters. In most cases, they wait in line until it is
their turn to pay.

Three real-world objects are implemented using the following classes:

      Cart            represents a customer together with the items they intend to purchase
      POSline         represents an individual check-out counter and the line of customers with carts
                      waiting at that checkout
      POSsystem       the overall check-out system

The UML diagram for the class POSline is provided below.

      POSline

      - String id

      - boolean active

      - Cart[] line

      + constructor

            returning the indicated Cart object. You may assume that a cart exists at position n.     [4]


The supermarket chain wants to use this OOP simulation to experiment with different ways of
organizing their check-out system. For example, it is possible to have different check-out
counters such as cash-only or card only, or to have check-out counters for ten items or fewer.

15.   (a)	Define the term inheritance.	                                                              [2]

      (b)   Explain one advantage of the OOP feature “inheritance” with reference to this scenario.   [3]

      (c)   Describe two advantages of using libraries of classes.                                    [4]

      It is also possible to have one line that serves a number of check-out counters.

      (d)   Outline one change needed to the original model to allow this possibility to be
            implemented.                                                                              [2]

      (e)   Outline two reasons why the use of multiple programming teams in different locations
            may be problematic when developing an integrated software solution.	                      [4]

16.   When the number of customers in the supermarket is low, some check-out counters will
      close. When there are many customers waiting, a new check-out counter will open.

      (a)   Outline why the variable active in the UML of the class POSline was defined as a
            boolean data type.                                                                         [2]

      When a new check-out counter opens, some customers from the nearest line will choose to
      move their carts to this check-out counter.

      For this simulation, the assumption is made that every second cart in the old line will move to
      the new line and the other carts will remain in the original line.

      (b)   Construct the code for a method split (part of the class POSsystem), that takes an
            existing, non-empty POSline as a parameter. It should copy every second cart from
            the original line into a new line. Afterwards it should delete every second cart from the
            original line.

            An example call in POSsystem would be: POSline number2 = split(number1),
            where number1 is an existing POSline.

            You may use any method declared or developed. 	                                            [8]

      As a result of the simulation, the company has decided to create a new POS system for their
      supermarkets.

      There have been discussions about adapting existing open source code when developing
      modules of the new POS system.

      (c)   Describe two ethical issues that may arise if modules of the new POS system are
            developed from open source code.                                                           [4]

17.   The array line in POSline is now replaced by a singly linked list list of CartNode objects.
      The class CartNode has been defined as follows.

      public class CartNode
      {
         private Cart myCart;
         private CartNode next;

            public CartNode(Cart aCart)
            {
               this.myCart = aCart;
               this.next = null;
            }
            public Cart getCart(){ return this.myCart; }
            public CartNode getNext(){ return this.next; }

               this.next = nextNode;
            }

      The class POSlist has been implemented with the standard list methods addLast and
      removeFirst that act on list.

      (b)    Using object references, construct the method public Cart removeFirst() that
             removes the first CartNode object from list. The method must return the Cart object
             in that node or null if list is empty.	                                                     [4]

      (c)    Sketch the linked list list after running the following code fragment where
             cart1, cart2, cart3, cart4 and cart5 have been instantiated as objects
             of the class Cart.

             POSlist queueList = new POSlist()
             queueList.addLast(cart2);
             queueList.addLast(cart1);

     A method leaveList(int n) is required in the class POSlist, similar to the method
     leaveLine(int n) that was added to the class POSline.

     (e)   Using object references, construct the method public Cart leaveList(int n) that
           removes the nth CartNode object from list. The method must return the Cart object
           in that node.

           You may assume that the nth CartNode object exists in the list.
