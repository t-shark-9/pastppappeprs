Criterion A: Language

• How effectively and accurately does the student use language?

  Marks    Level descriptor
    0      The work does not reach a standard described by the descriptors below.
           Command of the language is limited and generally ineffective.
   1–2     A limited range of vocabulary is used, with many basic errors.
           Simple sentence structures are sometimes clear.
           Command of the language is generally adequate, despite many inaccuracies.
   3–4     A fairly limited range of vocabulary is used, with many errors.
           Simple sentence structures are usually clear.
           Command of the language is effective, despite some inaccuracies.
   5–6     A range of vocabulary is used accurately, with some errors.
           Simple sentence structures are clear.
           Command of the language is good and effective.
   7–8     A wide range of vocabulary is used accurately, with few significant errors.
           Some complex sentence structures are clear and effective.
           Command of the language is very effective.

           Complex sentence structures are clear and effective.


Clarification

Word count
At HL, students are required to write a minimum of 250 words in section A and 150 words in
section B. Failure to write the minimum number of words will result in a [1 mark] penalty under
criterion A. There is no penalty for exceeding 400 words in section A or 250 words in section B: the
whole text should be taken into consideration in the award of marks.

Language
Not all errors have the same importance, and examiners should bear this in mind. Some errors
affect the communication of meaning significantly, and others do not. Also, some errors indicate a
fundamental lack of command of the language, while others may simply indicate a moment of
forgetfulness.

SLIPS – mistakes at all levels of difficulty, but erratic and occasional – eg the candidate normally
forms past tenses well, but occasionally forgets “-ed”.

FLAWS – errors occur more regularly, particularly in certain structures – eg past tenses are formed
correctly quite often, but are not really reliable, and there may be basic confusions (eg past simple
versus present perfect).

GAPS – some structures are rarely correct, or simply don’t appear – eg the past tenses are
needed, but do not appear.

A good answer will have very few language gaps, if any, and slips or flaws very rarely affect
meaning.

Criterion C: Format

• How correctly does the student produce the required text type?
• To what extent are the conventions of text types appropriate?

  Marks     Level descriptor
    0       The work does not reach a standard described by the descriptors below.
            The text type is not recognizable.
     1
            Conventions appropriate to the text type are not used.
            The text type is hardly recognizable or is not appropriate.
     2
            Conventions appropriate to the text type are very limited.
            The text type is sometimes recognizable and appropriate.
     3
            Conventions appropriate to the text type are limited.
            The text type is generally recognizable and appropriate.
     4
            Conventions appropriate to the text type are evident.
            The text type is clearly recognizable and appropriate.
     5
            Conventions appropriate to the text type are effective and evident.

To gain maximum marks [5], all of the bulleted conventions must be applied.
To gain [3], more than half of the conventions must be applied.

Note: Examiners are reminded that Criterion C bullet points are marking notes, not mark schemes.
Therefore, where one or more bullet points are only partially fulfilled (eg appropriate register
generally used but not consistently, there is an opening salutation but no closing salutation etc),
some credit/recognition may still be given. In such cases, examiners should consider the work
holistically and use their professional judgements, with reference to the criteria, to arrive at the
final marks.

Expected conventions of the text type are as follows:

Question 1: Leaflet
• will adopt a semi-formal to informal register
• will have an engaging title
• will have a short introduction and a conclusion
• will identify ideas with format features, eg sub-headings, bullet points, numbering etc
• will include practical aspects of the text type, eg “contact us”, or a phone number and/or an
  email address.


Question 2: Interview
• will adopt a semi-formal to formal register
• will have a relevant headline/title
• will have an introduction and a conclusion
• will use a style aimed at involving and interesting the reader
• will refer to the interview, including direct quotations and/or reported speech; it will not be a
  verbatim transcript.

• will have an introduction and conclusion
• will have a clearly structured layout, eg sub-headings, short brief paragraphs/sections, etc.


Question 5: Blog entry
• will adopt a semi-formal to informal register
• will have an engaging title for the entry itself – ie not just a general name for the blog overall
• will include first person statement and/or narration
• will show awareness of the reader, eg through direct address, a lively and interesting style etc
• will have a closing statement, eg invitation to comment, a conclusion drawn etc.
