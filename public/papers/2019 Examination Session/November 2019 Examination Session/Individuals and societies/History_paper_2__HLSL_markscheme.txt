Markbands for paper 2

 Marks     Level descriptor
           Responses are clearly focused, showing a high degree of awareness of the demands and implications of the
           question. Answers are well structured and effectively organized.
           Knowledge of the world history topic is accurate and relevant. Events are placed in their historical context, and
           there is a clear understanding of historical concepts.
           The examples that the candidate chooses to discuss are appropriate and relevant, and are used effectively to
  13–15
           support the analysis/evaluation. The response makes effective links and/or comparisons (as appropriate to the
           question).
           The response contains clear and coherent critical analysis. There is evaluation of different perspectives, and this
           evaluation is integrated effectively into the answer. All, or nearly all, of the main points are substantiated, and the
           response argues to a consistent conclusion.
           The demands of the question are understood and addressed. Answers are generally well structured and
           organized, although there is some repetition or lack of clarity in places.
           Knowledge of the world history topic is mostly accurate and relevant. Events are placed in their historical context,
           and there is some understanding of historical concepts.
  10–12    The examples that the candidate chooses to discuss are appropriate and relevant, and are used to support the
           analysis/evaluation. The response makes effective links and/or comparisons (as appropriate to the question).
           The response contains critical analysis, which is mainly clear and coherent. There is some awareness and
           evaluation of different perspectives. Most of the main points are substantiated and the response argues to a
           consistent conclusion.
           The response indicates an understanding of the demands of the question, but these demands are only partially
           addressed. There is an attempt to follow a structured approach.
           Knowledge of the world history topic is mostly accurate and relevant. Events are generally placed in their historical
   7–9     context.
           The examples that the candidate chooses to discuss are appropriate and relevant. The response makes links
           and/or comparisons (as appropriate to the question).
           The response moves beyond description to include some analysis or critical commentary, but this is not sustained.
           The response indicates some understanding of the demands of the question. While there may be an attempt to
           follow a structured approach, the response lacks clarity and coherence.
           Knowledge of the world history topic is demonstrated, but lacks accuracy and relevance. There is a superficial
   4–6     understanding of historical context.
           The candidate identifies specific examples to discuss, but these examples are vague or lack relevance.
           There is some limited analysis, but the response is primarily narrative/descriptive in nature rather than analytical.
           There is little understanding of the demands of the question. The answer is poorly structured or, where there is a
           recognizable essay structure, there is minimal focus on the task.
           Little knowledge of the world history topic is present.
   1–3
           The candidate identifies examples to discuss, but these examples are factually incorrect, irrelevant or vague.
           The response contains little or no critical analysis. The response may consist mostly of generalizations and poorly
           substantiated assertions.
    0      Answers do not reach a standard described by the descriptors below.



Examiners are reminded of the need to apply the markbands that provide the “best fit” to the responses
given by candidates and to award credit wherever it is possible to do so. If an answer indicates that
the demands of the question are understood and addressed but that not all implications are
considered (for example, compare or contrast; reasons or significance; methods or success),
then examiners should not be afraid of using the full range of marks allowed for by the markscheme:
as such, responses that offer good coverage of some of the criteria should be rewarded accordingly.

For the attention of all examiners: if you are uncertain about the content/accuracy of a
candidate’s work please contact your team leader.

Topic 1: Society and economy (750–1400)

1.   Evaluate the impact of changes in travel and transportation on the economies of two societies,
     each from a different region.

     Candidates will make an appraisal of the impact of changes in travel and transportation on the
     economies of two societies, weighing up the importance or otherwise of these changes. The two
     societies must be from different regions, but they may or may not have been contemporaneous
     with each other. The impacts may extend beyond the timeframe, but they must be clearly linked to
     the issue raised in the question. Candidates may offer equal coverage of changes in travel and
     transportation, or they may prioritize their evaluation of one of these two factors. However, both
     aspects will be a feature of the response. A comparative approach may or may not be used.
     Candidates may refer to changes in technological developments and cartography, the
     development of road networks, changes to major trade and travel routes and/or developments in
     horse transport. Both positive and negative impacts may be evaluated.


2.   Discuss the effectiveness of methods used to spread religion in two societies, each from a
     different region.

     The question requires that candidates offer a considered and balanced review of the methods used
     to spread religion in two societies. The two societies must be from different regions, but they may
     or may not have been contemporaneous with each other. A comparative approach may or may not
     be used. Candidates may refer to the spread of religion due to trade, military conquest, migration
     and emigration, the role of missionaries and religious campaigns. Candidates will consider how
     effective these methods were and are likely to consider both their success and failure in order to
     respond fully to the question.
                                                 –5–                  N19/3/HISTX/BP2/ENG/TZ0/XX/M


Topic 2: Causes and effects of medieval wars (750–1500)

3.   “Dynastic disputes were the main cause of medieval wars.” Discuss with reference to two wars,
     each from a different region.

     The question requires that candidates offer a considered and balanced review of the view that
     dynastic disputes were the main cause of medieval wars. The two wars must be from different
     regions, but they may or may not have been contemporaneous with each other. Causes may
     predate the timeframe of the topic, but they must be clearly linked to the issue raised in the
     question. Candidates may offer equal coverage of the causes of each war or they may prioritize
     their discussion of one over the other. A comparative approach may or may not be used.
     Candidates may refer to causes other than dynastic disputes, for example territorial disputes, the
     expansion or containment of religion, competition over economic resources, but the bulk of the
     response will remain on the issue raised in the question.


4.   Evaluate the role of leaders in determining the outcome of two wars.

     The question requires that candidates make an appraisal of the outcome of two wars, weighing up
     the strengths/importance and limitations or otherwise of the role of leaders. The two wars may or
     may not be from the same region and they may or may not have been contemporaneous with each
     other. Candidates may offer equal coverage of the two wars, or they may prioritize one over the
     other. A comparative approach may or may not be used. Both the strengths and limitations of
     leadership must be clearly indicated but there does not need to be an equal number of each. While
     other relevant factors, for example, the use of technology, human and economic resources, military
     skill, may be referred to, the bulk of the response will remain on the issue raised in the question.
                                                    –6–                   N19/3/HISTX/BP2/ENG/TZ0/XX/M


Topic 3: Dynasties and rulers (750–1500)

5.   Compare and contrast the administration of law in two dynastic states.

     The question requires that candidates give an account of the similarities and differences between
     the administration of law in two dynastic states, referring to both throughout. The two states may or
     may not be from the same region and they may or may not have been contemporaneous with each
     other. Candidates may refer to the methods by which laws were enforced, reviewed and reformed;
     the structure, organization and functionality of law courts; tensions between civil and common law;
     the role of religious authorities in legal administration; the centralization or decentralization of legal
     systems; the role of trial by combat or battle. Both similarities and differences must be clearly
     indicated but there does not need to be an equal number of each.


6.   Evaluate the success with which two rulers, each from a different region, overcame challenges to
     their power.

     The question requires that candidates make an appraisal of the success of two rulers in
     overcoming challenges to their power, weighing up the strengths and limitations of the rulers’
     responses to these challenges. The two rulers must be from different regions, but they may or may
     not have been contemporaries. A comparative approach may or may not be used. Candidates may
     refer to rulers’ responses to military challenges, challenges to political supremacy (including
     conflict with religious authorities), challenges posed by individual rivals for power, challenges
     relating to marriage, death and succession, challenges to the territorial integrity of the rulers’ land,
     or economic challenges. Both strengths and limitations must be clearly indicated, but there does
     not need to be an equal focus on each.
                                                 –7–                 N19/3/HISTX/BP2/ENG/TZ0/XX/M


Topic 4: Societies in transition (1400–1700)

7.   Evaluate the impact of social and economic change on the role of women in one country or state.

     The question requires that candidates make an appraisal of the impact of social and economic
     change on the role of women in one country or state. The social and economic changes may
     predate the timeframe, but they must be clearly linked to the issue raised in the question.
     Candidates may refer to the strengths and/or the weaknesses of both social and economic change
     in relation to the role of women. Both strengths/importance and limitations must be clearly
     indicated but there does not need to be an equal number of or focus on each. While other relevant
     factors, for example, the impact of religion on gender roles, legal restrictions on the rights of
     women, the absence of men in time of war, may be referred to, the bulk of the response will remain
     on the factors raised in the question.


8.   Compare and contrast the discrimination and persecution of religious groups in two states.

     The question requires that candidates give an account of the similarities and differences between
     the discrimination and persecution of religious groups in two states, referring to both throughout.
     The two religious groups may or may not be from the same region and they may or may not have
     been contemporaneous with each other. The practices discussed may predate or extend beyond
     the timeframe, but they must be clearly linked to the issue raised in the question. Candidates may
     compare and contrast issues such as the imprisonment or execution of apostates; the execution of
     heretics or members of banned sects; the banishment of groups belonging to minority religions; the
     application of additional taxation; employment restrictions or the imposition of a defined living
     space upon different religions groups. Both similarities and differences in the discrimination and
     persecution of religious groups must be clearly indicated but there does not need to be an equal
     number of each.
                                                  –8–                   N19/3/HISTX/BP2/ENG/TZ0/XX/M


Topic 5: Early Modern states (1450–1789)

9.    Discuss the nature of rule in one state in ascendancy and one state in decline.

      The question requires that candidates offer a considered and balanced review of the nature of rule
      in one state in ascendancy and one state in decline. The two states may or may not be from the
      same region and they may or may not have been contemporaneous with each other. A
      comparative approach may or may not be used. Candidates may refer to the administration and
      interpretation of laws; the methods of governance including how political, social and economic
      policies were determined; the nature and effectiveness of leadership and whether the state was an
      oligarchy, theocracy or monarchy. Factors such as the role of the military, both army and navy, and
      the expansion or contraction of imperial possessions may also be of relevance.


10.   Evaluate the effectiveness of methods used to deal with opposition in two states, each from a
      different region.

      Candidates will appraise the effectiveness of the treatment of opposition in two states. The two
      states must be from different regions, but they may or may not have been contemporaneous with
      each other. A comparative approach may or may not be used. Candidates may refer to the
      treatment of different opposition groups, for example political versus religious opposition, to
      evaluate the effectiveness of methods used to deal with opposition. These methods may include
      legal restrictions; the use of force and/or physical punishments; incarceration; expulsion from the
      state; economic restrictions. Candidates may also refer to conciliatory methods such as the
      granting of territorial claims; concessions for increased political influence; the recognition of
      different religions within a state; economic concessions. Candidates will consider how effective
      these methods were and are likely to consider both their success and failure in order to respond
      fully to the question.
                                                   –9–                   N19/3/HISTX/BP2/ENG/TZ0/XX/M


Topic 6: Causes and effects of Early Modern wars (1500–1750)

11.   Evaluate the significance of technological developments to the outcome of two Early Modern wars.

      The question requires that candidates make an appraisal of the significance of technological
      developments to the outcome of two Early Modern wars. The two wars may or may not be from the
      same region and they may or may not have been contemporaneous with each other. The
      developments discussed may predate or extend beyond the timeframe, but they must be clearly
      linked to the issue raised in the question. Candidates may offer equal coverage of the outcome of
      both wars, or they may prioritize their evaluation of one. A comparative approach may or may not
      be used. Both strengths/importance and limitations must be clearly indicated but there does not
      need to be an equal number of each. While other relevant factors such as leadership, terrain or
      economic factors, may be referred to, the bulk of the response will remain on the issue raised in
      the question.


12.   Evaluate the political and economic effects of one Early Modern war.

      The question requires that candidates make an appraisal of one Early Modern war, weighing up
      the strengths and limitations of its political and economic effects. The effects may extend beyond
      the timeframe, but they must be clearly linked to the issues raised in the question. Candidates may
      offer equal coverage of political and economic effects, or they may prioritize their evaluation of one
      over the other. However, both political and economic effects will be a feature of the response.
      While other relevant factors, for example, social, religious, demographic or territorial effects may be
      referred to, the bulk of the response will remain on the factors raised in the question. Examples of
      political effects may include the overthrow of a ruling dynasty and its replacement with another; the
      adoption of a new religion; the introduction of a new legal system. Economic effects may include
      indebtedness because of the cost of the war; food shortages; disruption of trade as well as access
      to new territory and resources for the victors.

Topic 7: Origins, development and impact of industrialization (1750–2005)

13.   “The most significant development of industrialization was improved communications.” Discuss
      with reference to two countries.

      The question requires that candidates offer a considered and balanced review of the statement
      that the most significant development of industrialization was improved communications. The two
      countries may or may not be from the same region and they may or may not have been
      contemporaneous with each other. Consequences of the improvements in communications may
      extend beyond the timeframe, but they must be clearly linked to the issue raised in the question. A
      comparative approach may or may not be used. Candidates may refer to specific technological
      improvements; developments in print or digital media; changes in transportation that facilitated
      increased communication, for example the role of railways. While other significant developments of
      industrialization such as energy, power, infrastructure and mass production, may be referred to,
      the bulk of the response will remain on the issue raised in the question.


14.   Discuss the impact of industrialization on the standards of living in two countries.

      The question requires that candidates offer a considered and balanced review of the impact of
      industrialization on the standards of living in two countries. The two countries may or may not be
      from the same region and they may or may not have been contemporaneous with each other. The
      impacts discussed may extend beyond the timeframe, but they must be clearly linked to the issue
      raised in the question. A comparative approach may or may not be used. Candidates may refer to
      availability and quality of housing; population density leading to overcrowding; greater income
      equality or disparity; increased access to consumer goods; the quality of food available; impact
      upon health. Access to medical care; education and schooling may also be of relevance.
                                                  – 11 –               N19/3/HISTX/BP2/ENG/TZ0/XX/M


Topic 8: Independence movements (1800–2000)

15.   Examine the importance of nationalism in the rise of two independence movements, each from a
      different region.

      The question requires that candidates consider the interrelationship between the importance of
      nationalism and independence movements. The two movements must be from different regions,
      but they may or may not have been contemporaneous with each other. The emergence of the
      movements may predate or extend beyond the timeframe, but they must be clearly linked to the
      issue raised in the question. Candidates may offer equal coverage of each independence
      movement, or they may prioritize their examination of one over the other. A comparative approach
      may or may not be used. While other relevant interrelationships, for example the importance of
      leadership, the experience of war or the nature of colonial rule, may be considered, the bulk of the
      response will remain on the issue raised in the question.


16.   Discuss the importance of leadership in the success of two independence movements, each from
      a different region.

      The question requires that candidates offer a considered and balanced review of the reasons why
      the role of leadership was important for the success of two independence movements. The two
      movements must be from different regions, but they may or may not have been contemporaneous
      with each other. The role of the leaders may predate or extend beyond the timeframe, but they
      must be clearly linked to the issue raised in the question. Candidates may offer equal coverage of
      both movements, or they may prioritize their discussion of one over the other. A comparative
      approach may or may not be used. While other relevant factors, for example the withdrawal of
      colonial rule; changes in public perception of imperialism; economic factors; the impact of war, may
      be referred to, the bulk of the response will remain on the issue raised in the question.

Topic 9: Evolution and development of democratic states (1848–2000)

17.   Evaluate the importance of social and economic factors in the emergence of one democratic state.

      The question requires that candidates make an appraisal of the social and economic factors in the
      emergence of one democratic state, weighing up the importance or otherwise of these two factors.
      The influence of the two factors may predate the timeframe, but they must be clearly linked to the
      issue raised in the question. Candidates may offer equal coverage of social and economic factors,
      or they may prioritize their evaluation of one of the two. However, both aspects will be a feature of
      the response. A comparative approach may or may not be used. Candidates may refer to social
      factors such as population growth, influence of religious institutions, the role of education.
      Candidates may refer to economic factors such as the influence of industrialization, improvements
      in transportation and communication, economic growth or crises. Both importance and limitations
      must be clearly indicated but there does not need to be an equal focus on each.


18.   Evaluate the effectiveness of the responses to domestic crises in two democratic states.

      The question requires that candidates make an appraisal of the responses of two democratic
      states to domestic crises, be that one or more per state, weighing up the strengths and limitations
      of those responses. The two states may or may not be from the same region and they may or may
      not have been contemporaneous with each other. The states’ responses may extend beyond the
      timeframe, but they must be clearly linked to the issue raised in the question. Candidates do not
      have to offer equal coverage of the two states, but they must address both in their evaluation. A
      comparative approach may or may not be used. Candidates may refer to political, social or
      economic crises. Examples of these may include an attempted takeover of the state, the outbreak
      of contagious disease, severe weather conditions such as widespread drought, famine,
      hyperinflation, unexpectedly large movements of population into or out of the state. Both strengths
      and limitations of the states’ responses must be clearly indicated but there does not need to be an
      equal number of each.

Topic 10: Authoritarian states (20th century)

19.   Compare and contrast the importance of the use of force on the emergence of two authoritarian
      states, each from a different region.

      Candidates will give an account of the similarities and differences between the use of force on the
      emergence of two authoritarian states referring to both throughout. The two states must be from
      different regions, but they may or may not have been contemporaneous with each other. Examples
      of the use of force may predate the timeframe, but they must be clearly linked to the issue raised in
      the question. Candidates may refer to force used against opposing parties or rivals for power; the
      use of force against citizens to ensure compliance; the forced removal of dissidents. While other
      relevant factors, such as the promise of political reform, solutions to economic problems, improved
      economic conditions, appeals to nationalism, may be referred to, the bulk of the response will
      remain on the issue raised in the question.


20.   Evaluate the impact of domestic economic policies on the maintenance of power in two
      authoritarian states, each from a different region.

      The question requires that candidates make an appraisal of the impact of domestic economic
      policies on the maintenance of power in two authoritarian states, weighing up the strengths and
      limitations of the policies. The two states must be from different regions, but they may or may not
      have been contemporaneous with each other. The impact of domestic economic policies may
      extend beyond the timeframe, but they must be clearly linked to the issue raised in the question. A
      comparative approach may or may not be used. Candidates may discuss specific domestic
      economic policies such as industrialization, preparation for war, employment policies, agricultural
      developments, economic policies linked to ideology. Both strengths and limitations must be clearly
      indicated but there does not need to be an equal number of each.

Topic 11: Causes and effects of 20th century wars

21.   Discuss the impact of guerrilla warfare on the outcome of two 20th century wars.

      The question requires that candidates offer a considered and balanced review of the impact of
      guerrilla warfare on the outcome of two 20th century wars. The two wars may or may not be from
      the same region and they may or may not have been contemporaneous with each other. The use
      of guerrilla warfare may predate the time frame, but it must be clearly linked to the issue raised in
      the question. Candidates may offer equal coverage of guerrilla warfare in both wars, or they may
      prioritize their discussion of one war over the other. A comparative approach may or may not be
      used. While other relevant factors, for example, technology, the application of human or economic
      resources, external involvement, may be referred to, the bulk of the response will remain on the
      issue raised in the question.


22.   “Territorial changes were the most significant challenge to successful peacemaking.” Discuss with
      reference to the effects of two 20th century wars.

      The question requires that candidates offer a considered and balanced review of the statement
      that territorial changes were the most significant challenge to peacemaking. The two wars may or
      may not be from the same region and they may or may not have been contemporaneous with each
      other. The effects of the wars may extend beyond the timeframe, but they must be clearly linked to
      the issue raised in the question. Candidates may offer equal coverage of both wars, or they may
      prioritize their discussion of one over the other. A comparative approach may or may not be used.
      While other relevant factors, for example, political change, economic factors, population
      displacement may be referred to, the bulk of the response will remain on the issue raised in the
      question.

Topic 12: The Cold War: Superpower tensions and rivalries (20th century)

23.   Evaluate the impact of detente upon US–USSR relations up to the end of 1979.

      The question requires that candidates make an appraisal of the impact of detente upon US–USSR
      relations up to the end of 1979. The events discussed may predate or extend beyond the
      timeframe stated, but they must be clearly linked to the issue raised in the question. A comparative
      approach that would focus upon areas where the impact was of a greater or lesser extent, may or
      may not be used. Candidates may refer to events such as the arms race, rivalry over influence in
      newly independent countries, agreements over trade and over security. Both strengths and
      limitations must be clearly indicated but there does not need to be an equal number of each.


24.   “Ideology was the most important cause of Cold War crises.” Discuss with reference to two Cold
      War crises, each from a different region.

      The question requires that candidates offer a considered and balanced review of the statement
      that ideology was the most important cause of Cold War crises. The two crises must be from
      different regions, but they may or may not have been contemporaneous with each other. Causes
      may predate the timeframe, but they must be clearly linked to the issue raised in the question.
      Candidates may offer equal coverage of both crises, or they may prioritize their discussion of one
      over the other. A comparative approach may or may not be used. While other relevant factors, for
      example economic rivalry, the arms race, fears of expansionism, the actions of client states, may
      be referred to, the bulk of the response will remain on the issue raised in the question.
