Apply the markbands that provide the “best fit” to the responses given and award credit wherever it is
possible to do so. If an answer indicates that the demands of the question are understood and
addressed but that not all implications are considered (for example, compare or contrast; reasons
or significance; methods or success), then examiners should not be afraid of using the full range of
marks allowed for by the markscheme. Responses that offer good coverage of some of the criteria
should be rewarded accordingly. If you are uncertain about the content/accuracy of a candidate’s
work please contact your team leader.

Section 1: Monarchies in England and France (1066–1223)

1.   “Henry I restored peace and stability to England.” To what extent do you agree with this statement?

     The question requires that candidates make an appraisal of methods used by Henry I to establish
     and maintain peace, by weighing up their contribution or otherwise to stable government. Both
     strengths and limitations may be mentioned but there does not have to be an equal focus on each.
     In his dealings with the Barons candidates may mention his Coronation Charter that guaranteed
     property rights, however there was resentment of his “new men” in government; of his centralizing
     tendencies and refusal to make the position of sheriff hereditary. He had the support of Anselm
     and the Church. He gained the loyalty of Stephen of Blois but failed to clarify the succession after
     the White Ship. Royal power was strengthened by extending the use of justiciars; royal finances
     were stabilized with the appointment of able administrators such as Roger of Salisbury. Henry
     gaining control of Normandy by 1106 should be made relevant to conditions in England. Some may
     argue that there was peace and stability but that there remained underlying problems such as
     baronial discontent and unclear succession.


2.   “Louis VI increased the authority of the monarchy in France.” Discuss.

     The question requires that candidates offer a considered and balanced review of the statement
     that Louis VI increased monarchical authority in France. Candidates may identify the challenges to
     royal authority, such as “robber barons”; the power of the feudal principalities; the power and
     independence of the Anglo-Normans. Louis used his military skills to control robber barons
     (William of Auvergne and Hugh de Puiset). This led to popular support and respect from powerful
     vassals. The Dauphin’s marriage to Eleanor of Aquitaine obtained one of the largest principalities
     for the French crown, thereby strengthening his authority. He also had the support of the Church
     (he stated he was a vassal of St Denis). He was able to ensure that the heir of Henry I paid
     homage for Normandy, giving him more control over the Anglo-Normans. Some may argue that he
     extended royal authority, but that it was the start of a process that was completed by Philip
     Augustus when he brought the powerful principalities such as Anjou and Normandy under control.

Section 2: Muslims and Jews in medieval Europe (1095–1492)

3.   “The loss of economic activity was the most significant result of the conflict between the Christian-
     ruled and Muslim-ruled states in Spain.” Discuss.

     The question requires that candidates offer a considered and balanced review of the statement
     that the loss of economic activity was the most significant result of the conflict between the
     Christian-ruled and Muslim-ruled states in Spain. Candidates may refer to the disruption of
     important channels of trade in agriculture, traditional crafts and commerce. Candidates may
     discuss how the economic impact of the conflict might have varied in cities, ports or different
     states. Candidates may refer to the importance and impact of the conflict on maritime commerce
     for the Muslim states. Candidates may refer to the commercial realignment that occurred in the
     thirteenth century with the opening of the Straits of Gibraltar to Christian trade. While other relevant
     factors, for example the impact of the Crusades, the territorial expansion of the Christian states
     and loss of lands by the Muslims states, may be referred to, the bulk of the response will remain on
     the issue raised in the question.


4.   Discuss the contribution of Jews to trade, royal bureaucracy and scholarship in medieval Europe.

     The question requires that candidates offer a considered and balanced review of the contributions
     of Jews to trade, royal bureaucracy and scholarship in medieval Europe. Candidates may offer
     equal coverage of trade, royal bureaucracy and scholarship, or they may prioritize two of the
     contributions in their discussion. Candidates may refer to the activities of Jews in money lending
     and as important traders. Their role in establishing trade networks linking European, Islamic and
     Byzantine civilizations was significant. Candidates may refer to the activities of Jews in terms of
     documentation, royal records, and collections of calendar volumes in the 13th century serving both
     bureaucracy and scholarship. Candidates may discuss the contribution of Jews to scholarly issues
     of the day in their capacity as physicians and astronomers in royal courts. While other relevant
     factors, for example the social and legal discrimination Jews faced, may be referred to, the bulk of
     the response will remain on the issue raised in the question.
                                                 –6–                 N19/3/HISTX/HP3/ENG/TZ0/EU/M


Section 3: Late medieval political crises (1300–1487)

5.   Evaluate the impact on England and France of the Hundred Years War 1415–1453.

     The question requires that candidates consider the interrelationship between the series of conflicts
     and conditions/politics in both England and France. There may be consideration of impact on the
     population; the economy; national identity; changes in military tactics, where relevant. In France
     one major impact was population decline because of famine, epidemics and the actions of
     mercenaries during the conflicts. In England the cost of the war contributed to discontent with the
     monarchy (the Peasants’ Revolt and the overthrow of Richard II). Toward the end of the war, the
     loss of French territory was blamed on the “weak rule” of Henry VI and was arguably a cause of the
     Wars of the Roses. In both countries, the conflicts led to a stronger sense of national identity
     because of military success (Agincourt) or the need to drive out foreigners (Joan of Arc). The end
     of English presence gave France a much stronger sense of unity. A comparative approach may or
     may not be used, some may argue that France suffered much greater damage than England.


6.   “The Wars of the Roses were caused by a crisis of royal authority.” Discuss.

     The question requires that candidates offer a considered and balanced review of the causes of the
     Wars of the Roses. Discussion should focus on the issue of a “crisis”. Candidates may discuss the
     “weak rule” of Henry VI, his military failure, his counsellors and discontent with ineffective
     government (Cade’s Rebellion) suggesting a “crisis”. Popular discontent was less of an issue for
     Edward IV but there was some (Robin of Redesdale). The succession of Edward V as a minor
     could be seen as a crisis allowing Gloucester to take the throne. The disappearance of the Princes
     was a crisis for Richard III and his dubious claim provided an opportunity for Henry Tudor to
     invade. Others may argue that the factions in politics caused problems and conflict for both Henry
     VI and Edward IV, with Margaret of Anjou trying to save the Lancastrian dynasty and Edward
     dealing with problems caused by powerful nobles (Warwick). Factional rivalry was also an issue
     between 1483 and 1485. Candidates may agree, partly agree or disagree with the statement.
                                                  –7–                  N19/3/HISTX/HP3/ENG/TZ0/EU/M


Section 4: The Renaissance (c1400–1600)

7.   Discuss the origins of developments in art and literature during the Renaissance.

     The question requires that candidates offer a considered and balanced review of the origins of
     major developments in art and literature during the Renaissance. Origins could be considered to
     mean key influences in both areas. Developments in art, arguably, originated from trade with the
     east giving access to new pigments (lapis lazuli and vermilion). A more vibrant realistic painting
     style developed. The wealth of Italian city states supported the continuation of these
     developments. The Papacy was also a significant patron of the visual arts. In literature, the
     developments originated in the wider study of the Classics, again a consequence of trade. This led
     to the emergence of Humanist ideas that emphasized the importance of the cultivated individual.
     Literature became more secular as the influence of the Church declined and consideration was
     given to the role of the individual within the political sphere. Candidates may offer equal coverage
     of art and literature, or they may prioritize their discussion of art. However, both aspects will be a
     feature of the response.


8.   With reference to Burgundy and Germany, discuss the reasons for the emergence of the Northern
     Renaissance.

     The question requires that candidates offer a considered and balanced review of the reasons for
     the emergence of the Northern Renaissance. Reasons could include that the ideas of the Italian
     Renaissance spread north because of trade with key cities such as Bruges and Antwerp; although
     some may argue that the Northern Renaissance had its own distinct characteristics particularly in
     areas such as architecture which remained Gothic in style. A key reason was the weakening of the
     Catholic Church and the influence of Erasmus and Humanism, encouraging the development of
     secular art and literature. Both the German states and Burgundy were very prosperous and
     wealthy patrons could finance developments in art and architecture that contributed to the Northern
     Renaissance. The development of the printing press made it possible to disseminate widely the
     ideas that led to the emergence of the Northern Renaissance.
                                                   –8–                   N19/3/HISTX/HP3/ENG/TZ0/EU/M


Section 5: The Age of Exploration and its impact (1400–1550)

9.    Discuss the significance for Portugal of its exploration of the west coast of Africa.

      The question requires that candidates offer a considered and balanced review of the significance
      for Portugal of its exploration of the west coast of Africa. The significance may extend beyond the
      timeframe. Candidates may refer to the fact that the exploration provided the Portuguese with a
      great economic advantage and trade networks were established. Candidates may also refer to the
      fact that domestically it had very little popular support and caused tensions as the enterprise and
      benefits of exploration were only enjoyed by the nobility. Candidates may discuss the fact that the
      slave trade impacted Portugal domestically with slaves becoming significant minorities in various
      cities. While other relevant factors, for example, how it transformed West African states or its
      relation to the larger Asian spice route, may be referred to, the bulk of the response will remain on
      the issue raised in the question.


10.   Evaluate the consequences of the exploration of the New World for Europe.

      The question requires that candidates make an appraisal of the consequences of the exploration of
      the New World for Europe. Consequences may extend beyond the timeframe but they must be
      clearly linked to the issue raised in the question. Candidates may refer to the transformation of
      economic relationships of medieval Europe through the introduction of gold and silver. Candidates
      may discuss the impact on social and class structures where the merchants and manufacturers
      slowly replaced, in many cases, the land-owning nobility. Candidates may refer to the rethinking of
      political and commercial enterprises consolidating relations between entrepreneurs and
      governments. There may be reference to the introduction of new plants and foods to the European
      market and its impact. Candidates may refer to a New World view of the globe and Europe’s place
      in it establishing a Eurocentric perspective.
                                                  –9–                  N19/3/HISTX/HP3/ENG/TZ0/EU/M


Section 6: The Reformation (1517–1572)

11.   Discuss the reasons for the successful spread of Lutheran ideas in Germany.

      The question requires that candidates offer a considered and balanced review of the reasons for
      the successful spread of Lutheran ideas in Germany. Reasons may predate the timeframe but they
      must be clearly linked to the issue raised in the question. Candidates may discuss the nature of
      critiques and the strong following and support offered by the German princes. Candidates may
      refer to the printing press as central to the scale and scope of the spreading of Luther’s religious
      ideas. The number of pamphlets, their use of the vernacular and the excoriating woodcuts that
      often accompanied them contributed to the appeal of Luther’s message. Further frustrations were
      felt among several sections of society and these frustrations—whether they were political or
      economic—found in Lutheranism a vehicle for discontent to be expressed. Political factors that
      may be addressed include antagonism toward Church authority in Germany and the power of the
      Holy Roman Empire. Economic grievances may include discontent with the papacy using Germany
      as a source of heavy taxation.


12.   To what extent can the Council of Trent (1545–1563) be considered a success for the Catholic
      Reformation?

      The question requires that candidates consider the merits or otherwise of the suggestion that the
      Council of Trent (1545–1563) be considered a success for the Catholic Reformation. The analysis
      of success may extend beyond the timeframe but must be clearly linked to the question.
      Candidates may refer to its impact being rather narrow and driving a more fanatical or hard-line
      position, isolating reformist views. Candidates may refer to a reinforcing of Church doctrine and the
      role of the Church as sole interpreter of the word of God. Candidates may refer to its function as a
      counter to Protestant positions and arguably, it initially achieved its objectives. Candidates may
      refer to its effect on the papacy and papal authority leading to mixed views. Candidates may refer
      to its long-term impact on the emergence of new orders (Jesuits, Capuchins) that attempted reform
      by implementing changes. Candidates may agree, partly agree or disagree with the suggestion.
                                                   – 10 –                N19/3/HISTX/HP3/ENG/TZ0/EU/M


Section 7: Absolutism and Enlightenment (1650–1800)

13.   Compare and contrast the foreign policies of two absolutist monarchs.

      The question requires that candidates give an account of the similarities and differences of the
      foreign policies of two absolutist monarchs. Foreign policy could include the formation of alliances
      possibly via dynastic marriages as well as aggressive actions such as waging war and the
      expansion of territory either in Europe or in pursuit of overseas colonies. The exemplars chosen do
      not have to be from different states, nor do they have to be contemporaneous if chosen from
      different states. It would be legitimate to consider the foreign policies of Louis XIV, Louis XV or
      Louis XVI. The reasons for certain policies will vary according to the chosen exemplars, for
      example the wars of Louis XIV were arguably aggressive as he sought to expand French power.
      Other reasons could include the fear of attack by a powerful neighbour, or the desire to protect or
      develop trade to enhance the power of the state and the monarch. Both similarities and differences
      must be clearly indicated but there does not have to be an equal number of each.


14.   “The policies of enlightened despots had little impact on their subjects.” Discuss with reference to
      two enlightened despots.

      The question requires that candidates offer a considered and balanced review of the statement.
      Candidates could choose to agree, disagree or partially agree depending on their chosen
      exemplars. The two chosen despots may or may not have been contemporaneous with one
      another. Candidates may choose to approach the question by identifying some key enlightenment
      ideas and establish how far they were adopted. When discussing “impact”, areas to consider could
      be social structure, civil rights, wealth distribution and developments in areas such as science.
      Some may argue that the policies of “enlightened despots” were driven by the desire to maintain
      their own power and the security of the nation. It may also be argued that their policies had very
      little impact on most of the population with “impact” being limited to a relatively small proportion of
      the population. Impact of policies may extend beyond the timeframe but it must be clearly linked to
      the policies of the chosen exemplars.

Section 8: The French Revolution and Napoleon I (1774–1815)

15.   “Economic rather than political challenges caused a crisis in the Ancien Régime by 1789.” Discuss.

      The question requires that candidates offer a considered and balanced review of the statement
      that economic difficulties were more significant than political challenges in causing a crisis in
      France by 1789. Economic challenges could include the recession of the 1780s and huge debts
      from earlier wars (Seven Years War and the American War of Independence). The regime was
      unable to deal effectively with this debt because of weak financial structures (ineffective tax
      collection, no national bank or stock exchange). Political challenges were closely linked to
      economic ones. The nobility resisted Calonne’s tax reforms as they were seen as a threat to their
      status and demanded the recall of the parlements and later the Estates General. This provided the
      bourgeoisie the opportunity to demand greater participation in politics. Some may argue that the
      Ancien Régime was in crisis by 1789 because it had no basis of support due to economic
      weakness. While other relevant factors such as Enlightenment ideas may be referred to the bulk of
      the response will remain on the issues in the question.


16.   “Napoleon’s military reputation was the most important factor in his rise to political power.” Discuss.

      The question requires that candidates offer a considered and balanced review of the contribution
      made by Napoleon’s military reputation to his rise to political power. The weakness of the Directory
      including: financial instability, political instability and threats, such as Vendémiaire and Prairial; was
      underlined by its increasing reliance on the military. Sieyès and others began to look for a “strong
      man” to head a coup and Napoleon was identified as a candidate because of his military reputation
      (he was one of three potential candidates.) After Brumaire, Napoleon was made Consul and then
      used this as a base to extend his political power as First Consul and later Emperor. Some may
      argue that it was his military reputation that made him a potential candidate, others may argue that
      it was his skill as a propagandist that contributed to his rise to power. Candidates may argue that
      there would have been no opportunity for a military coup without the inherent weakness of the
      Directory. Candidates may choose to agree, partly agree or disagree with the statement.

Section 9: France (1815–1914)

17.   “The Congress of Vienna had a limited impact on France.” To what extent do you agree with this
      statement?

      The question requires that the candidates offer a considered and balanced response to the
      statement. The Congress of Vienna reached various decisions regarding France. There should be
      discussion of both internal and international impact. It could be argued France lost standing
      internationally, she was confined to her 1790 borders and lost territory (Nice and Savoy). In
      support of the statement France remained a major power. Talleyrand had negotiated at Vienna on
      equal terms and by 1818, France became a full member of the Congress System at Aix-la-
      Chappelle. Internal impact is more complex, the first Bourbon Restoration had been the work of
      Talleyrand and was not universally popular (as evidenced by the Hundred Days), the Second
      Restoration was the result of allied victory at Waterloo and was confirmed by the Congress. There
      was an army of occupation until 1818 and a war indemnity levied. Therefore, it could be argued
      that the main impact was the determination of the Congress of Vienna to stop France reverting to a
      republic.


18.   “The Dreyfus Affair destabilized the Third French Republic.” Discuss.

      The question requires that candidates offer a considered and balanced review of the impact of the
      Dreyfus Affair on the Third Republic. Anti-Dreyfusards believed the strength of the state, including
      the reputation of the army was more important than the rights of the individual (the Dreyfusard/pro-
      Republican stance). Despite the public furore (families were divided, Zola’s J’Accuse…! article) it
      could be argued that there was little real threat to the Republic and that the instability was more
      apparent than real. Déroulède’s attempted coup in 1899 had little or no support even from the army
      and offered no alternative to the Republic. Whereas support for Dreyfus led to the various
      moderate and left pro-republican parties uniting and the election of 1902 returned a majority pro-
      republican chamber with Waldeck-Rousseau as PM indicating popular support for the Republic.
      Subsequently the governments of Combes and Rouvier reformed the army and separated church
      and state, with the Republic remaining stable. Candidates may agree, partly agree or disagree with
      the statement.

Section 10: Society, politics and economy in Britain and Ireland (1815–1914)

19.   Examine the factors that led to poor living and working conditions for the urban working class.

      The question requires that candidates consider the interrelationship between a number of factors
      and poor living and working conditions. Factors to be considered could include political attitudes,
      overpopulation, industrialization and the poor infrastructure of towns and cities. Laissez-faire
      beliefs argued against government intervention in the economy or on social conditions. There were
      limited ineffective attempts to reform working conditions, and a reluctance to increase taxation to
      pay for social reform left this to local authorities and charity. Overpopulation was a major factor.
      The population doubled in the first half of the 19th century and continued to grow. Urban areas had
      poor infrastructure (little clean water or effective sewerage systems). There was very little change
      to the 1850s, some may argue that the widening of the electorate led to governments being more
      willing to enact reforms to gain working class support but that this process was gradual. It was not
      until the first decade of the twentieth century that governments began to attempt to establish a
      more equitable society (pre-war Liberal reforms).


20.   “Disraeli’s domestic policies reflected his commitment to social reform.” To what extent do you
      agree with this statement?

      The question requires that candidates offer a considered and balanced review of the domestic
      policies of Disraeli and the motivation behind them. Reference could be made to key legislation
      such as the Artisans’ and Labourers’ Dwellings Improvement Act 1875, the Public Health Act 1875,
      the Conspiracy and Protection of Property Act 1875 and the Employers and Workmen Act 1875.
      Some may argue that Disraeli’s novels indicated a commitment to social reform and this translated
      into the concept of Tory Democracy. Some may argue that Disraeli wanted to use the power of
      traditional institutions for the good of the whole community. To argue against the statement, some
      may point out that after the 1867 Reform Act increased the size and base of the electorate, many
      of Disraeli’s domestic policies were shaped by electoral considerations. He wanted an alliance
      between the working class and the aristocracy. Reference to legislation supporting trade unions
      could be cited in support of this view. There may be some discussion of the limits of Disraeli’s
      policies, but the bulk of the response will remain on the issue in the question.

Section 11: Italy (1815–1871) and Germany (1815–1890)

21.   Evaluate Metternich’s role in the growth of nationalism and liberalism in Italy between 1815 and
      1848.

      The question requires that candidates make an appraisal of Metternich’s role in the growth of
      nationalism and liberalism in Italy between 1815 and 1848. Candidates may offer equal coverage
      of nationalism and liberalism, or they may prioritize their evaluation of one. Some may argue that
      both liberalism and nationalism began to develop because of French rule. Candidates may refer to
      Metternich having an important role in repressing various uprisings in 1820, 1830 and 1848 in the
      Italian states therefore influencing the growth of nationalism and liberalism. Candidates may refer
      to both being context specific and Metternich’s impact on these forces was stronger in the north.
      Candidates may argue that the uprisings in the Two Sicilies had very little to do with nationalism
      but sought liberal reform and the 1820 uprising there was suppressed with the aid of Austrian
      troops. While other relevant factors, for example the role Mazzini (Young Italy), Garibaldi and the
      various secret societies (Adelfia and Carbonari) played may be referred to, the bulk of the
      response will remain on the issue raised in the question.


22.   Discuss the successes and failures of Bismarck’s domestic policies.

      The question requires that candidates offer a considered and balanced review of Bismarck’s
      domestic policies. When discussing successes and failures candidates may identify Bismarck’s
      aims both in relation to specific policies and the nation as a whole. His overarching aim was to
      maintain the authority of the monarchy and the dominance of Prussia within the empire. Key
      domestic policies include the Kulturkampf, anti-socialist legislation, State Socialism, economic
      policies and policies relating to national minorities. Both the Kulturkampf and anti-socialist
      legislation could be considered failures as the Catholic Centre Party gained support and anti-
      Catholic laws were repealed or lapsed. The Social Democrats continued to grow and by 1891 were
      a significant group in the Reichstag. State Socialism was to some extent successful as the German
      working class remained relatively loyal to the empire. There may be some discussion of policies
      toward national minorities and the attempts at Germanization, which was successful to some
      extent, but Polish nationalism remained strong in the eastern part of the empire.

Section 12: Imperial Russia, revolution and the establishment of the Soviet Union (1855–1924)

23.   Discuss the reasons for the final crisis of autocracy in February/March 1917.

      The question requires that candidates offer a considered and balanced review of the reasons why
      the Russian monarchy was in crisis by early 1917. Some may argue the autocracy had been in
      crisis for many years and had only survived to 1914 through a combination of limited reform
      (National Duma, Land Reform and some economic growth) and repression (limited power of the
      Duma, Stolypin’s Necktie and the Lena Massacre 1912). Others could argue that the reforms from
      1905 were the beginning of a process that would strengthen the monarchy (Stolypin’s “gamble on
      the strong”) leading to gradual political change and stability. This process was disrupted by the
      outbreak of war in 1914 and the impact of the war (defeats, casualties, economic crisis) eroded
      support for Tsar Nicholas II. It may be argued that there were long term factors undermining
      autocracy but in the short term it was the failure to deal effectively with the war that led to a crisis,
      with even the army and moderate politicians turning against the autocracy.


24.   Compare and contrast the roles of Lenin and Trotsky in Russia between 1917 and 1924.

      The question requires that candidates give an account of the similarities and differences in the
      roles of Lenin and Trotsky in Russia referring to both throughout. Similarities could include that
      both were active in generating support for the Bolsheviks in 1917. Both convinced others to
      attempt revolution even though Russia did not fit the Marxist model. Both were willing to use force
      to ensure the survival of the Bolshevik state. Lenin accepted the need for the Red Terror and the
      one-party state. Trotsky enforced strict discipline in the Red Army and ruthlessly suppressed the
      Kronstadt Mutiny. Both were significant in shaping policy in Russia. Differences could include that
      Lenin focused on policy, persuading the Central Committee to back revolution. He implemented
      War Communism to supply the Red Army and adopted the NEP in 1921. Trotsky was more
      practical, organizing the Red Guard’s seizure of power in October 1917 and as Commissar for War
      during the Civil War, he ensured victory for the Bolsheviks. Both similarities and differences should
      be clear but there does not have to be an equal number of each.

Section 13: Europe and the First World War (1871–1918)

25.   Evaluate the impact of the Congress of Berlin on the European Alliance system.

      The question requires that candidates make an appraisal of the impact of the Congress of Berlin
      on the European Alliance system. Candidates may refer to the increasing tensions between
      Austria-Hungary and Russia and the fracturing of the Dreikaiserbund. Consequently, Bismarck
      signed the Dual Alliance with Austria in 1879 and temporarily revived the Dreikaiserbund in 1881.
      Candidates may discuss Russia being thwarted with regard to its Pan-Slavism in the Balkans,
      damaging its relations with Austria and Germany, and limiting the importance of the
      Dreikaiserbund. Some may argue that the impact was long term and contributed to the Franco-
      Russian Alliance 1894. The main impact of the Congress was the establishment of the long lasting
      Dual Alliance. Candidates may refer to Britain and Austria finding ways of expanding their spheres
      of influence. While other relevant factors, for example the role of the Ottoman empire, may be
      referred to, the bulk of the response will remain on the issue raised in the question.


26.   Compare and contrast the impact of the First World War on the civilian populations in two
      countries up to 1918.

      The question requires that candidates give an account of the similarities and differences of the
      impact of the First World War on the civilian populations in two countries up to 1918, referring to
      both throughout. Candidates may refer to similar experiences of citizens in terms of their rights and
      freedoms being curbed due to government policies. Candidates may refer to citizens being
      exposed to intense nationalist feeling and euphoria early on. Candidates may refer to different
      levels of intensity and disruption of daily life across social, economic or political factors. Candidates
      may refer to the impact varying for urban and rural populations. Candidates may refer to similarities
      or differences in terms of economic mobilization and impact. Both similarities and differences must
      be clearly indicated but there does not need to be an equal focus on each.

Section 14: European states in the inter-war years (1918–1939)

27.   Evaluate domestic resistance to the Nazis.

      The question requires that candidates make an appraisal of the domestic resistance to the Nazis,
      weighing up its strengths and limitations. Candidates may refer to early resistance from the
      traditional right and strong conservatives in the military including the Reichswehr’s reluctance to
      merge with the SA and Beck’s 1938 conspiracy. Candidates may refer to political resistance that
      came in various forms early on from Communists, Social Democrats, workers and youth
      movements. Candidates may refer to Jewish groups that formed in opposition to the discriminatory
      policies. There may be discussion of the actions of both Catholic and Lutheran churches in
      resisting certain key policies, but the extent of resistance needs evaluation. There may be some
      discussion as to how the coercive nature of the Nazi state hindered effective resistance but also
      the fact that there was popular support for the regime. Both strengths and limitations must be
      clearly indicated but there does not need to be an equal focus on each.


28.   Discuss the impact of political polarization during the Second Spanish Republic.

      The question requires that candidates offer a considered and balanced review of the impact of
      political polarization during the Second Spanish Republic. Candidates may refer to the fact that the
      Republic experienced a period of reform between 1931–1933, and the repealing of reforms
      between 1933–1936 fuelled political polarization. Candidates may refer to the lack of democratic
      culture and experience in party politics that made certain political groups more reactionary (CEDA,
      Falange), making them less capable of compromise or negotiation. Candidates may refer to lack of
      authority and political violence that emerged, further weakening the Republic and stimulating
      political radicalization. Candidates may refer to the manifestations of political violence contributing
      to polarization, for example, the crushing of the Asturias rising. By 1936 compromise between the
      Republicans and Nationalists was unlikely, ultimately leading to the military coup of July 1936 and
      the subsequent Civil War.

Section 15: Versailles to Berlin: Diplomacy in Europe (1919–1945)

29.   To what extent was German foreign policy successful between 1919 and 1933?

      The question requires that candidates consider the merits or otherwise of the suggestion that
      German foreign policy was successful between 1919 and 1933. Candidates may consider success
      to mean Germany regaining her position as a major European power. In the years from 1919 to
      1924, German foreign policy was largely unsuccessful. Evidence could include the acceptance of
      the terms of the Treaty of Versailles and Germany’s isolation leading to the Treaty of Rapallo with
      the Soviet Union. Candidates may discuss the policies of Stresemann, negotiating the Dawes Plan
      1924 and the Locarno Agreements 1925. Germany joined the League of Nations and was no
      longer isolated and able to negotiate the Young Plan in 1928 which reduced the overall reparations
      total and finalized the removal of all occupation troops from the Rhineland. Thus, it could be
      argued that from 1924 onwards German foreign policy was largely successful.


30.   Evaluate the importance of the wartime alliance (1941–1945) to the defeat of the Axis powers in
      Europe.

      The question requires that candidates make an appraisal of the importance of the wartime alliance
      (1941–1945) to the defeat of the Axis powers in Europe. Candidates may refer to the wartime
      alliance as providing essential resources and supply chains that increased the Allies’ capacity to
      continue fighting (American supplies to both Great Britain and the Soviet Union). Candidates may
      refer to the industrial power and production capacity of the wartime allies as having significant
      importance. Factories in the US and the Soviet Union were safe from German air attacks. There
      may also be discussion of huge resources in terms of manpower available to the Allies. Candidates
      may refer to the coordination of campaigns of the wartime alliance on the Axis powers, particularly
      on Germany. Candidates may refer to adaptations that the wartime alliance made in terms of air
      and naval tactics. While other relevant factors, for example the strategic errors made by the Axis
      powers, may be referred to, the bulk of the response will remain on the issue raised in the
      question.

Section 16: The Soviet Union and post-Soviet Russia (1924–2000)

31.   Evaluate the impact of Stalin’s economic and political policies in the Soviet Union between 1945
      and 1953.

      The question requires candidates to make an appraisal of both economic and political policies in
      the Soviet Union between 1945 and 1953. When considering impacts, candidates may discuss the
      aims of the policies. Economically the main aim was to recover from wartime destruction of
      infrastructure. Industrial and agricultural production levels were below those of the 1930s. The 4th
      and 5th Five Year plans were implemented, focusing on key industries (oil and steel) production,
      and both rose significantly by 1950. Agriculture was less successful not reaching pre-war levels by
      1950, despite being re-collectivized. It was damaged by policies such as Lysenkoism. Politically,
      Stalin’s aim was to maintain power and strengthen the state. The party was purged (100 000 a
      year), wartime heroes such as Zhukov were sidelined. The “discovery” of plots such as the
      Doctors’ Plot and the Leningrad affair maintained an atmosphere of fear and potential rivals such
      as Malenkov and Khrushchev were unable to threaten Stalin. There was limited political impact but
      economic policies were to some extent successful in aiding recovery.

32.   “Brezhnev’s foreign policy was successful in reducing Cold War tensions in Europe.” To what
      extent do you agree with this statement?

      The question requires that candidates consider the merits or otherwise of the statement that
      Brezhnev reduced Cold War tensions in Europe. Some may argue that the Brezhnev Doctrine
      1968 increased tensions in Europe. As a consequence of détente and better relations with the US,
      Brezhnev was also willing to make concessions in Europe in the 1970s (detail on détente, such as
      SALT 1, should be made relevant to Europe). Brezhnev signed the Treaty of Moscow 1970 and the
      Helsinki Accords 1975, both significantly reduced Cold War tensions in Europe. Others may argue
      that Brezhnev did not initiate policies that reduced tensions but accepted overtures from others that
      led to a reduction in tensions. There may be reference here to Brandt’s Ostpolitik. Others may
      argue that tensions remained, with continued criticism of the Soviet Union’s record on human rights
      and the issue of deploying new nuclear weapons (SS-20s) in Europe. Candidates may agree,
      partly agree or disagree with the statement.

Section 17: Post-war western and northern Europe (1945–2000)

33.   Evaluate how the West German state responded to the challenge of the Baader Meinhof
      Group/Red Army Faction.

      The question requires that candidates make an appraisal of the methods used by the West
      German state against the Baader Meinhof Group/Red Army Faction. Candidates may refer to
      extensive powers that the police and intelligence forces were given at the time due to the groups’
      activities. Candidates may refer to and evaluate the extent to which civil liberties may have been
      eroded. The Lander lost some of their police powers to federal organisations in order to combat
      terrorism. Candidates may refer to the formation of a paramilitary anti-terrorist squad that was
      created called the GSG-9 that used numerous methods. Candidates may refer to the technological
      innovation of advanced computerization and tracking techniques. Candidates may refer to the
      impartiality of trials, badgering of defence lawyers and harsh treatment of prisoners. It could be
      argued that the methods were to some extent successful as the West German state remained
      stable despite the levels of violence at times.


34.   Evaluate the political changes in one western or one northern European country (other than
      France, the Federal Republic of Germany and Spain).

      The question requires that candidates make an appraisal of the political changes in one western or
      one northern European country (other than France, the Federal Republic of Germany and Spain),
      weighing up the strengths and limitations of those political changes. Candidates may refer to new
      political systems that emerged such as shifts from authoritarian to democratic forms of
      government. Candidates may refer to possible territorial changes such as a loss of colonies or
      overseas territories and their impact on politics. Candidates may refer to the emergence of inter-
      governmental organizations such as the UN or EEC (today’s EU) which impacted and transformed
      European countries into new political arrangements. Candidates may refer to ideological political
      polarization in various contexts. Candidates opinions and conclusions should be clearly stated and
      supported by appropriate evidence.

Section 18: Post-war central and eastern Europe (1945–2000)

35.   Discuss the reasons for the emergence of conflict in the Balkans in the 1990s.

      The question requires that candidates offer a considered and balanced review of the reasons for
      the emergence of conflict in the Balkans in the 1990s. Candidates may refer to the political
      fragmentations that occurred in the breakdown of Yugoslavia with certain regions desiring more
      political autonomy. Candidates may refer to the identity politics that emerged and contributed to
      extreme nationalism. Also, religion was arguably a significant factor particularly in the Bosnian and
      Kosovo Wars. Candidates may discuss the short-term issues such as the declaration of
      independence by Croatia and Slovenia that sparked a reaction by Serbia which initiated the Ten-
      Day War in 1991. Candidates may refer to the refusal of the Central Serbian authorities led by
      Milosevic to grant autonomy. Candidates may refer to long standing economic decline as a reason
      for the emergence of the conflict. While other relevant factors, may be referred to, the bulk of the
      response will remain on the issue raised in the question.


36.   Discuss the economic challenges of the post-communist era in one central or eastern European
      country (1989–2000).

      The question requires that candidates offer a considered and balanced review of the economic
      challenges of the post-communist era in one central or eastern European country (1989–2000).
      Challenges may extend beyond the timeframe but they must be clearly linked to the issue raised in
      the question. Candidates may refer to economic issues such as government debt that the country
      might have been facing at the time. Candidates may refer to inflation and unstable food prices that
      posed significant economic challenges. Candidates may refer to difficulty in reforming a centrally-
      planned economy to enable the transition into a free market economy. Candidates may refer to
      internal dissatisfaction and bottom up pressures from civilians demanding opportunities and basic
      services. While other relevant factors, for example the transformation of state institutions and
      political factors, may be referred to, the bulk of the response will remain on the issue raised in the
      question.
