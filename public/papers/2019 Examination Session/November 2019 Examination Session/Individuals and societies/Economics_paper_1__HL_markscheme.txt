Microeconomics

1.   (a)    Explain two reasons why the demand for primary commodities might be
            price inelastic.                                                                       [10]

            Answers may include:
            • definitions of price inelastic demand, primary commodity, demand
            • diagram to show price inelastic demand
            • explanation of why the demand for primary commodities might be price inelastic that
              refers to two reasons for low price elasticity of demand, such as the lack of close
              substitutes, high degree of necessity and low proportion of income spent on the primary
              commodity
            • examples of primary commodities with price inelastic demand.

            Award a maximum of level 2 marks if a candidate has only explained one reason why the
            demand for primary commodities might be price inelastic.

(b)   Discuss the significance of price elasticity of demand (PED) for a government imposing an
      indirect tax on a good.                                                                 [15]

      Answers may include:
      • definitions of indirect tax, price elasticity of demand (PED)
      • diagram(s) to show the effect of taxation on the market for a good and how the price
        elasticity of demand (PED) will impact the outcome
      • explanation that the government uses indirect taxes to raise revenue as well as to limit the
        production/consumption of demerit goods
      • examples of specific products upon which a government has imposed indirect taxes in
        practice
      • synthesis or evaluation (discuss).

      Discussion may include: consideration of the extent to which government revenue and the
      production/consumption of the product will be impacted by the PED, consideration of the
      effect of PED on how the tax burden will be divided between consumers and producers,
      consideration of the effect of PED on workers (employment), consideration of the difficulties
      in measuring PED and in determining the socially optimal level of production/consumption
      (when taxes are imposed to limit the production/consumption of demerit goods).

      Examiners should be aware that candidates may take a different approach which, if
      appropriate, should be rewarded.

      NB: It should be noted that definitions, theory, and examples that have already been given in
      part (a), and then referred to in part (b) should be rewarded.

            Answers may include:
            • definitions of economies of scale, long-run average costs
            • diagram to show movement along the downward-sloping portion of the long-run average
              cost curve
            • explanation of how economies of scale lead to lower average costs as a firm increases
              scale of production in the long run that refers to two clearly different types of economies
              of scale, such as specialization, efficiency, marketing and indivisibilities

(b)   Discuss the view that barriers to entry in a monopoly will always lead to abnormal
      profits in the long run.                                                                 [15]

      Answers may include:
      • definitions of barriers to entry, monopoly, abnormal (economic) profit, long run
      • diagram to show a monopoly realizing abnormal profit
      • explanation that monopoly firms can maintain monopoly profits in the long run because of
        barriers to entry such as economies of scale, branding and legal barriers
      • examples of specific barriers to entry that enable monopoly firms to make abnormal profits
        in the long run in practice
      • synthesis or evaluation (discuss).

      Discussion may include: monopoly firms do not always earn abnormal profits even with
      barriers to entry due to insufficient demand for their products (resulting from changing
      consumer tastes, technological obsolescence, etc); governments often regulate or
      nationalize monopolies, resulting in lower prices and profits; monopolies may have goals
      different from profit maximization (such as revenue maximization, technology development,
      etc); consideration of the word “always”.

      Examiners should be aware that candidates may take a different approach which, if
      appropriate, should be rewarded.

      NB It should be noted that definitions, theory, and examples that have already been given in

3.   (a)    Explain the impact that a cut in taxation and an increase in government spending
            might have on the circular flow of income.                                                 [10]

            Answers may include:
            • definitions of the circular flow of income (model), (indirect/direct) taxation, government
              spending
            • diagram of the circular flow of income showing injections and leakages
            • explanation of the impact a cut in taxation and an increase in government spending will
              have on the circular flow of income, with leakages being reduced and injections being
              increased, resulting in an increased (flow of) income, ceteris paribus
            • example(s) of expansionary fiscal policy in practice.

            Award a maximum of level 2 marks if a candidate only refers to either a cut in taxation or an
            increase in government spending (but not both).

(b)   Discuss whether the real gross national income (GNI) per capita of a country is a good
      indicator of its standard of living.                                                        [15]

      Answers may include:
      • definition of real GNI(GNP) per capita
      • a diagram is not required for full marks, but candidates may use diagram(s) to show
        inequality in the distribution of income, negative externalities in production/consumption,
        economic growth
      • explanation why the real GNI per capita might be regarded as a good indicator of the
        standard of living, such as higher average income leading to higher consumption, greater
        tax revenue for public services, less poverty
      • examples of countries with different GNI per capita resulting in different standards of living
        and/or countries where there is discrepancy between the standard of living and the level
        of real GNI per capita
      • synthesis or evaluation (discuss).

      Discussion may include: consideration of the limitations of using real GNI per capita to
      measure the standard of living such as the lack of information about the distribution of
      income and the composition of output, measurement problems and non-income factors
      (leisure time, quality of environment) affecting the well-being of the population; consideration
      of alternative measures such as HDI and “green GDP” per capita; consideration of the
      meaning of “standard of living”.

      Examiners should be aware that candidates may take a different approach which, if
      appropriate, should be rewarded.

4.   (a)    Explain the effect an increase in investment might have on real gross domestic
            product (GDP) using the Keynesian multiplier.                                              [10]

            Answers may include:
            • definitions of real GDP, investment, Keynesian multiplier
            • Keynesian AD/AS diagram to show the multiplier effect (successive increases in AD and
              real GDP)
            • explanation of how an initial increase in investment, a component of AD, leads to multiple
              successive increases in AD and real GDP
            • hypothetical numerical example(s) to support the explanation or a historical example of
              specific situations where an increase in investment has possibly led to a multiplier effect.

            Award a maximum of level 2 marks if a candidate does not use the concept of the Keynesian
            multiplier.

      • diagram to show an increase in both AD and LRAS (resulting in increasing real GDP) or a
        production possibilities frontier diagram
      • explanation that interventionist supply-side policies, such as investment in human capital,
        investment in new technology, investment in infrastructure or industrial policies, are
        conducted by the government and aim to improve the economy’s capacity to produce (the
        quality and/or the quantity of the economy’s factors of production)
      • examples of specific interventionist supply-side polices in practice and/or countries where
        interventionist supply-side policies might have led to economic growth
      • synthesis or evaluation (discuss).

      Discussion may include: consideration of alternative policies (market-based supply-side
      policies, expansionary monetary policies, expansionary fiscal policies) with regard to factors
      such as time lags, the ability to create employment, the impact on the government budget,
      the short-run effect on the AD, the administrative requirements and the political support
      required for their implementation, social effects and effects on the environment.
