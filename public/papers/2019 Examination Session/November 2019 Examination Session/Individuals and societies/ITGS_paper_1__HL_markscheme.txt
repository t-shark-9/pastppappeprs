Critical Thinking – explanation, analysis and evaluation


These trigger words often signal critical thinking. The bold words are the key terms in the various
criteria.
Explanation – Because, as a result of, due to, therefore, consequently, for example
Analysis – Furthermore, additionally, however, but, conversely, likewise, in addition, on the other hand,
whereas
Evaluation ‫ –ؘ‬My opinion, overall, although, despite, on balance, weighing up

Examiners should be aware that in some cases, candidates may take a different approach, which if
appropriate should be rewarded. If in doubt, check with your team leader.

In the case of an “identify” question read all answers and mark positively up to the maximum marks.
Disregard incorrect answers. In all other cases where a question asks for a certain number of facts
eg “describe two kinds”, mark the first two correct answers. This could include two descriptions,
one description and one identification, or two identifications.

It should be recognized that, given time constraints, answers for part (c) questions are likely to include a
much narrower range of issues and concepts than identified in the markband. There is no “correct”
answer. Examiners must be prepared to award full marks to answers which synthesize and evaluate
even if they do not examine all the stimulus material.

1.   Biometric authorization

     Note to examiners:
     • All part (a) questions are marked using ticks and annotations where appropriate.
     • Part (b) and part (c) are marked using markbands. Use annotations and text comments to
       provide a rationale behind the marks you awarded. Do not use ticks.

     (a)   (i)     Identify two fields that could be in the Employee table of the database.          [2]

                   Answers may include:
                   • First name
                   • Surname
                   • ID number
                   • Gender / sex
                   • Phone number
                   • Date of birth

                   • Department e-mail.

                   Award [1] for identifying each appropriate field up to maximum of [2].

           (ii)    Identify two characteristics of a relational database.                            [2]

                   Answers may include:
                   • more than one linked table/entity
                   • primary key fields linked to foreign key fields
                   • each record is unique
                   • eliminates data redundancy
                   • is a smaller file than a flatfile database.

                   Award [1] for identifying each characteristic of a relational database up to
                   maximum of [2].

           (iii)   Identify two methods that could be used to ensure that the data input to the
                   database is accurate.                                                             [2]

                                             –5–                  N19/3/ITGSX/HP1/ENG/TZ0/XX/M


(b)   As part of the implementation of the biometric authorization system,
      Bright Creativa has written a privacy policy.

      Explain three features that Bright Creativa would need to include in a privacy
      policy linked to the company’s biometric authorization system.                          [6]

      Answers may include:
      • The privacy policy will need to be easily understood/transparent.
      • So employees are able to understand how their data will be collected, stored
         or who it may be shared with.

      •   The privacy policy must explain what data is being collected about them.
      •   And this data is intended to be used by the company.

      •   The privacy policy will need to explain that data will only be stored for as long
          as necessary / for the length of time the employee is with the company.
      •   And that appropriate measures have been taken to safeguard it from
          unauthorized access.

      •   If a data breach occurs, i.e. the data is compromised or stolen.
      •   The company must inform the users immediately.


Award [1] for identifying a feature that Bright Creativa would need to include in a privacy
policy and [1] for explaining why that feature should be included up to a maximum of [2].

Mark as [2] + [2] + [2].

(c)   To what extent is the employees’ improved access to company resources
      outweighed by their concerns about the level of surveillance by the company?      [8]

      Answers may include:
      Advantages to the employee
      • convenience, such as there is no need to carry ID cards to unlock doors
      • there is no need to remember passwords to logon to the network, or to
         continuously change the password
      • is likely to be more secure than relying on authentication techniques such as
         a username and password as it is harder to forge a fingerprint than
         remember a password
      • may provide quicker access to resources
      • they don’t need to carry cash to buy items from the café.

      Concerns of the employee may
      • their performance could be monitored and performance ratings based on
         potentially information provided by the system
      • monitoring may become covert surveillance which may be unethical,
         especially if the employees are not aware of the ways in which the
         information is used
      • purchases are tracked and judgements might be made about them, for
         example, what foods they purchase
      • the fingerprints may not always be reliable, for example if the employee cuts
         the finger that is used for biometric authentication, which means that a
         resource may not be accessible
      • logging on to each resource using biometric identification may be time
         consuming and lead to inefficient working practices.

       provide a rationale behind the marks you awarded. Do not use ticks.

     (a)   (i)     Identify two stages of the product development life cycle (PDLC).                [2]

                   Answers may include:
                   • investigation of existing system
                   • feasibility study
                   • requirement Specification

                   • client and end-user evaluation
                   • testing and debugging.

                   Award [1] for identifying each stage of the product development life cycle
                   (PDLC) up to maximum of [2].

           (ii)    Identify two methods that could be used to train the staff to use the new
                   modelling system.                                                                [2]

                   Answers may include:
                   • video tutorials
                   • “how to” guides
                   • face-to-face training
                   • online training courses.

                   Award [1] for identifying each method that could be used to train the staff to
                   use the new modelling system up to maximum of [2].

           (iii)   Identify two measurements that could be taken by the weather sensors in
                   the Kinakora National Park.                                                      [2]

                   Answers may include:
                   • air temperature
                   • wind speed
                   • wind direction
                   • humidity
                   • the amount of precipitation
                   • ground temperature.

                   Award [1] for identifying each measurement that could be taken by the
                   weather sensors in the Kinakora National Park up to maximum of [2].
                                             –8–                   N19/3/ITGSX/HP1/ENG/TZ0/XX/M


(b)   Two methods for informing tourists about wildfires in Kinakora National Park are:
      • Short Message Service (SMS) texting/text messaging
      • Posting information on the Kinakora National Park website.

      Analyse these two methods.                                                            [6]

      Answers may include:
      Advantages of using SMS texting
      • easy to use
      • information is pushed out to the tourists
      • not dependent on internet access
      • cheap
      • low tech / can be done from very old hardware
      • faster than posting information in a website / synchronous.

      Disadvantages of using SMS texting
      • tourists need phone reception to get the message
      • the national park needs all tourists’ phone numbers to ensure all tourists can
         access this information
      • data needs to be stored (phone numbers) so an appropriate privacy policy
         needs to be in place
      • there is no guarantee the message has got through
      • some tourist might not have their phone
      • batteries can run out.

      Advantages of using the Kinakora National Park website
      • the information can use graphics/maps
      • it is not necessary to collect/store tourists’ phone numbers.

      Disadvantages of using the Kinakora National Park website
      • tourists need to visit the website to get information
      • tourist may not have web access
      • visually impaired visitors might not get the information.

      Note: Many of the advantages of SMS text are automatically disadvantages of
      the Kinakora National Park website or vice versa.

(c)   Evaluate Kinakora National Park’s decision to use computer modelling to develop
      strategies for dealing with wildfires.                                                [8]

      Answers may include:
      Advantages of using computer models to develop strategies to deal with
      wildfires
      • many different scenarios can be tried out before a final strategy is
          determined
      • dangerous situations can be tried without the risk to human life
      • possible fires can be predicted, and strategies can be defined to deal with
          them
      • the development of the model may lead to a greater understanding of the
          factors that influence the start and spread of forest fires; for example, fires
          starting in similar circumstances may not always follow same pattern
      • models may be revised as the nature of forest fires evolves, for example, as
          a result of drier conditions, hotter summer temperatures
      • models can be used for training.

      Disadvantages of using computer models to develop strategies to deal with
      wildfires
      • the data that is being input / data must be reliable / GIGO
      • the model is a simplification of a real situation and there may be factors that
          it is not possible to consider
      • expensive to develop a model/ requires large amount of processing power
          and this may not be an effective use of resources
      • the conditions in the national park may evolve more quickly than the model is
          able to which may lead to predictions not being as accurate as expected.

3.   Online learning

     Note to examiners:
     • All part (a) questions are marked using ticks and annotations where appropriate.
     • Part (b) and part (c) are marked using markbands. Use annotations and text comments to
       provide a rationale behind the marks you awarded. Do not use ticks.

     (a)   (i)     Identify two ways that the TailorEd system could provide feedback to the
                   students.                                                                        [2]

                   Answers may include:
                   • graphics/text on the screen
                   • sent by email to the student
                   • haptic feedback on correct answers in a mobile version
                   • notifications in a mobile app
                   • by awarding badges
                   • chat/chatbot.

                   Award [1] for identifying each way the TailorEd system could provide
                   feedback to the students up to maximum of [2].

           (ii)    Identify two ways that the data collected about students’ academic
                   progress could be used by TailorEd.                                              [2]

                   Answers may include:
                   • to send students advertisements of relevant educational material
                   • to ascertain the effectiveness of the lessons
                   • to adapt the tasks to the students’ abilities
                   • to offer tutoring if students fail a particular unit
                   • to share with universities and aid candidate selection
                   • to give opportunities to high scoring students
                   • to keep parents informed.

                   Award [1] for identifying each way the data collected about students’
                   academic progress could be used by TailorEd up to maximum of [2].

           (iii)   Outline how a firewall functions.                                                [2]

                   Answers may include:
                   • monitors incoming and outgoing traffic
                   • acts like a filter between the computer and the Internet
                   • blocks specific ports / IP addresses / protocols / words or phrases
                   • either allows traffic to pass through the firewall or not based on a set of
                     predetermined rules.

                   Award [1] for identifying the basic function of a firewall and [1] for a
                   development of the initial idea up to maximum of [2].

(b)   There are two possible methods for ensuring students use the TailorEd online
      learning system responsibly. They are:
      • Restrict access to sites that may be considered inappropriate.
      • Educate the students about acceptable use.

      Analyse these two options.                                                              [6]

      Answers may include:
      Reasons for restricting access to sites that may be considered
      inappropriate
       • to stop students going to websites they shouldn’t
       • to ensure the schools bandwidth is used for education rather than for other
          purposes
       • to protect students from dangers on the web / some inappropriate sites
          appear without warning and they are hard to avoid
       • parents may be happier knowing the filtering technology is in place as it will
          restrict access for younger students who cannot filter for themselves.

      Reasons for educating students about acceptable use
      • the students learn to take responsibility for their actions as this will be a skill
         they will need outside of school
      • students will always find ways to circumvent the filters applied by the school
      • who decides what will be blocked? Learning may be constricted by the use of
         a white list.

(c)   To what extent do the benefits of collecting students’ progress data outweigh the
      concerns of the students, teachers and parents?                                     [8]

      Answers may include:
      Benefits of collecting students’ progress data
      • the data collected can be tailored to provide more individualized learning for
         the student
      • the student’s progress can be reported back to the teacher/parent on a more
         regular basis and in a more standardized format
      • the school is able to use the data to identify trends and patterns that may not
         be immediately obvious and use this data driven approach to improve the
         performance of its teachers and students
      • this information can be used by students when applying for jobs or even for
         further education.

      Concerns of the students, teachers and parents
      • they may not know what data is being collected, stored and/or disseminated
      • they may not know the degree to which the identity of the student is
         anonymized
      • there may be a purely data driven approach to the use of the student data
         which may lead to a narrowing of the teaching to ensure short term targets
         are met at the expense of the whole learning experience
      • large amounts of teachers’ time may be taken up with the collection and
         entering of this data into the TailorEd database
      • the cost of purchasing the TailorEd system may not be cost-effective as it
         may involve staff training costs or the employment of staff to enter the data.

(b)   Explain why an agile project management methodology would be used in the
      development of the new AI surveillance camera system.                                 [6]

      Answers may include:
      Reasons for using an agile project management methodology include
      • regular testing of the development of the AI system will be able to pinpoint
         potential issues when they arise rather than waiting for a particular milestone
         to be reached
      • the developments in AI may lead to revisions being necessary to the scope
         and nature of the project throughout its course
      • changes in legislation linked to data collection may require the nature of the
         project to change during its course
      • the client is involved throughout the development of the project, who help
         with customer satisfaction
      • there would be less risk as this methodology would eliminate project failure
      • use of prototypes would help make revisions easier
      • agile supports teamwork and collaborate
      • agile prioritizes workflow, creating a more efficient process
      • lots of opportunity for feedback enabling the system to be revised during
         development.

(c)   To what extent should pattern recognition in AI systems be trusted to make
      decisions about sending real-time alerts to the police?                             [8]

      Answers may include:
      Reasons why pattern recognition in AI systems should be trusted to make
      decisions about sending real-time alerts to police
      • it can analyse large amounts of data so police decisions will be based on
          greater information
      • can provide more information to police to assist them in carrying out their job
      • standard response to dangers can eliminate human error, such as panic
          responses or ill-judged responses
      • there is less chance of not noticing a dangerous situation, whereas humans
          can get distracted
      • the AI system can react faster than a human to suspicious circumstances.

      Reasons why pattern recognition in AI systems should not be trusted to
      make decisions about sending real-time alerts to police
      • unlike humans, the AI system cannot make decisions based on ethical
         criteria
      • creating rules that take into account all of the possible ethical dilemmas may
         not be possible and cannot always determine right from wrong
      • if an unsupervised learning is used, the AI may self-learn and arrive at
         decisions that may not be appropriate
      • the AI could become unreliable due to a glitch in the system
      • there might be a new situation never anticipated by the AI system
      • there is the problem of accountability. At what point can the AI system, or the
         programmers etc be held accountable for an error.

     (a)   (i)     Identify two features of a legacy system.                                       [2]

                   Answers may include:
                   • based on “old” technology such as desktop computers
                   • uses previous versions of software that may not be compatible with
                     currently used version / are not backwardly compatible
                   • may include hardware that is no longer supported by manufacturers or
                     suppliers
                   • may include hardware that is expensive to maintain due to availability of
                     parts/expertise.

                   Award [1] for identifying each characteristic of a legacy system up to
                   maximum of [2].

           (ii)    Identify two reasons why a feasibility study is used during project
                   development.                                                                    [2]

                   Answers may include:
                   • look at requirements specification to see if it is achievable
                   • look at costs to see if it is affordable
                   • see if benefits outweigh the costs
                   • decide how soon it is needed
                   • decide if the users need training
                   • to take into account the total amount of time it will take to implement and
                     design the new system
                   • examine whether it is technically feasible
                   • look at drawbacks
                   • look at alternative solutions.

                   Award [1] for identifying each reason why a feasibility study is used up to
                   maximum of [2].

           (iii)   Identify two stakeholders that the information systems manager should
                   consult in the initial investigation.                                           [2]

(b)   Two changeover methods that could be used for the introduction of the new AI
      system are:
      • Direct changeover
      • Phased changeover.

      Analyse these two changeover methods.                                                  [6]

      Answers may include:

      Direct changeover
      • there is a faster changeover, so new system is up and running immediately
      • may be less confusing for staff as they have only one system to understand
      • will remove the issues of compatibility between the two systems that may
          occur with a phased changeover
      • training would be needed before the implementation a new AI system
      • there is a high risk of data loss if something goes wrong, and reverting back
          to the old system is impossible.

      Phased changeover
      • may provide time for staff to learn the new system (training) while the original
         system is used in parallel
      • may give time to appraise the new system as it is implemented which is not
         possible with direct changeover as implementation is done in smaller
         “chunks”
      • may be possible to revert back to old system as changes may be less
      • allows closer monitoring of new system as each phase of the implementation
         can be thoroughly evaluated before the next stage.
      • lower risk of data loss when introducing a new AI system
      • it would take longer to implement using a phased changeover method.

(c)   Joelstraat Hospital currently bases the diagnoses of patients’ illnesses on:
      • Information provided by the expert system
      • Discussions between the doctors and the patients.

      The new AI system will be a significant improvement over the current expert
      system.

      To what extent should the diagnosis of patients’ illnesses be based on the
      information provided by the AI system?                                                [8]

      Answers may include:
      Reasons for basing the diagnosis of the patients on the recommendations
      of the AI system
      • may be used to improve the throughflow of patients as the diagnoses could
           be linked to non-serious cases only
      • may provide a second opinion that a medical professional can use as the
           basis for making a decision
      • may act as a method of allocating less urgent patients to nurses and leaving
           the more serious conditions to doctors.

      Reasons for not basing the diagnosis of the patients on the
      recommendations of the AI system
       • the accuracy of the diagnosis will depend on the quality/volume/range of data
          available in the AI system
       • the AI system may contain bugs
       • the AI system does not take into account the medical history of the patient
       • cannot make decisions based on ethical criteria
       • might be a new situation never anticipated, therefore difficult for AI system to
          properly analyze
       • raises issues linked to accountability if there are problems that emerge as a
          result of an incorrect diagnosis.

                  • sound emitted from the FluffyMopa
                  • sound hits object and is reflected back to the sensor on the FluffyMopa
                  • the FluffyMopa calculates the time taken to receive the sound
                  • the FluffyMopa calculates the distance from the object
                  • if the distance is less than (or equal to) the value permitted the
                    FluffyMopa stops

             Answers may include:
             Reasons why Alpha testing is necessary
             • can debug programming at initial phase, before the new FM2 is released
             • the FM2 mop would go through step-by-step process to ensure that it
               works completely
             • it would identify possible issues with the FM2 mop before releasing the
               full-working model.

(c)   During the development of the FM2, an app was created that could enable an
      owner of a FM2 to carry out the following tasks remotely:
      • Check the quality of the cleaning using video footage from the FM2.
      • Check the amount of charge remaining in the battery.
      • Use natural language processing so that the owner can give instructions such
         as “OK Fluffy, clean the kitchen floor now”, or “Fluffy, return to the docking
         station to recharge”.

      Discuss whether the FM2 should be developed to include these additional
      features.                                                                           [8]

      Advantages of developing the FM2 with the additional features
      • would allow the FM2 to clean rooms more efficiently as it would not redo
         previously cleaned areas or may not clean areas that do not need to be
         cleaned / may allow the cleaning to be fine-tuned by determining high traffic
         areas
      • will enable the owners to send the FM2 to a specific area/room in the house
      • natural language will assist the elderly and the handicapped video footage
         would provide customers with information about cleaning performance.

      Disadvantages of developing the FM2 with the additional features
      • natural language processing may not be reliable enough to enable the FM2
          to carry out these tasks
      • potential misuse of information collected, who is authorized to access
          information / database can be hacked, leads to possible loss of personal
          data about home/floorplans
      • the company would need to invest in IT resources to create, maintain and
          share this information
      • if data is shared with 3rd parties, customers could receive unwanted ads or
          solicitations based on the data
      • records customers lifestyle and daily patterns, can be used to predict habits
      • information could be accessible to police, insurance companies
      • the development of these additional functions may not be cost effective.
