                                               Section A
1.   (a)   Outline two advantages for Accord of using job/customized production.                [4]

           Advantages could include:
          Product: adjusting recipes to meet customer needs
          Packaging: producing individually designed packaging for each customer
          Marketing: could reinforce USP, which is not strong as Aran does not have it
           right.
          Flexibility
          Differentiation

           Some candidates may mention ‘low stocks’. However stocks are likely to be low
           for any production system as this is a perishable product with perishable
           ingredients so at best a generic point.

           Accept any other reasonable description.

           Award [1] for each advantage up to a total of [2].

           Award [1] for putting the advantage into context up to a total of [2].

     (b)   Explain how Accord can differentiate Enrich from the products of its competitors.    [6]

           Key aspects:
      •    The product is aimed at the specialist “gym” market rather than the mass market
      •    Greater emphasis on natural, healthy ingredients
      •    More intimate relationship with customers as it is small
      •    Positive features of small versus multinational.
           Explanation/analysis should come from discussing these in relation to the
           situation that Accord is in. Context from some comparison with competitors

           Marks should be awarded according to the mark bands on page 3.

           Award maximum [3] for a theoretical answer or for only analysing one feature.

           Award maximum [5] if the analysis of two features or more is mainly descriptive
           but in context.
                                                     –8–               N19/3/BUSMT/HP1/ENG/TZ0/XX/M


2.   (a)   Describe two reasons why secondary market research may not be useful to
           Accord.                                                                                [4]

          Secondary market research – exploring data that has been already collected for a
           different purpose.
          Data may not be quite what is required – most likely for the mass market rather
           than niche market
          Data likely to be dominated by large businesses rather than by small businesses
          Data may be out of date.
          These are new products so maybe no existing data.

           Accept any other reasonable reason.

           Award [1] for each reason up to a total of [2].

           Award [1] for putting the reason into context up to a total of [2].
     (b)   Explain possible economies of scale that may apply to ABC Ltd. but not to
           Accord.
                                                                                                  [6]
           Economies of scale: Reduction in the average costs of a business as the scale
           of production increases. In this context, “scale” means productive capacity (ie,
           the physical size of the business) rather than the actual level of production.

           ABC is a large multinational so it can:
      •    afford the best and most efficient equipment, whereas Accord will be very basic
      •    direct effective marketing based on a whole range of products, whereas Accord
           only has a limited portfolio and little budget
      •    employ a range of professionals and managers, whereas Accord only has the two
           owners so its skills and time are limited
      •    access to a wide range of sources of finance, hence cheaper finance than
           Accord, which, as a partnership is limited.

           Accept any other reasonable explanation/application of EOS.

           Marks should be awarded according to the mark bands on page 3.

           Award a maximum of [4] if the discussion of economies of scale is only about
           ABC or Accord but not both.

           Award maximum [3] for a theoretical answer.

           Award maximum [5] if the analysis is mainly descriptive but in context.

           N.B. Some candidates may refer to average costs going down when production
           goes up (because of fixed costs being spread out more). Technically this is
           incorrect, as this is about production efficiency rather than scale so should not be
           allowed. However, candidates may still be able to explain types of EOS in context.
                                                   –9–                  N19/3/BUSMT/HP1/ENG/TZ0/XX/M


3.   (a)   With reference to Accord, outline two possible steps for Aran and Kayla in
           starting the business.                                                                 [4]

           Steps could be:
          finding finance – needed for premise, equipment
          identifying/researching the market – it seems Aran has already done some of this
           but flawed
          building a customer base – gyms, etc
          creating a business plan
          setting up a partnership agreement

           Context likely to come from Accord being a small business, partnership, what has
           already been done

           Accept any other reasonable step.

           Award [1] for each step up to a total of [2].

           Award [1] for putting the step into context up to a total of [2].

     (b)   Other than a business angel (line 108), explain methods of external finance that
           Accord could use to increase production capacity (line 108).                           [6]

      •    New partner. Realistic? Anyone suitable? May upset existing partnership.
      •    Bank loan. Difficult for small businesses, does not have much of a track record.
           Assets for security?
      •    Working capital sources (debt factors, reducing stocks, creditors/debtors) likely to
           be insufficient for the expansion because the business only deals in goods with a
           short shelf life.
      •    Grants/subsidies. Unlikely to be available.
      •    Lease rather than buy: often used for premises, so promising.
      •    Do not accept share capital – it is a partnership.
           Candidates may mention converting to a limited company which provides
           possible extra finance. This can be rewarded and could be contextualized.
           Candidates may also mention conversion to a public limited company. This is
           unrealistic for Accord so can only be a non-contextual answer.
           Explanation should come from how relevant the sources are.

           Marks should be awarded according to the mark bands on page 3.

           Award a maximum of [2] if the source chosen is internal.

           Award maximum [3] for a theoretical answer.

           Award a maximum [4] for only one method

           Award maximum [5] if the answer is mainly descriptive but in context

           To achieve [6] the candidate must consider at least two methods.

                                                Section B
4.   (a)   Define the term labour turnover.                                                    [2]

           Measure the rate at which employees are leaving a business, calculated as:

             Employees leaving in a fixed period
                                                   100
           Average number employed in that period

           No need for formula if put into suitable words such as ideas of proportions, time
           periods, employees leaving, employee numbers.

           Award [2] for a complete definition.

           Award [1] for some understanding of labour turnover, eg it mentions “leaving” but
           not “employees” or time periods.

     (b)   For Kayla’s proposal calculate:

           (i)   the payback period;                                                           [2]

                 Payback measures the time taken to pay back the original investment.

                 Original investment = $100k.

                 Paid back at a net $80k per year.

                 After 1 year paid back $80k so $20k more needed.

                              1

(c)   With reference to Accord, explain one advantage and one disadvantage of using
      total quality management (TQM).                                                         [4]

      Advantages:
       There are quality issues that could be addressed – batches are being rejected.
       There are supply chain issues as confirmed by Elsie that could be reduced
        with TQM.
       It could increase efficiency and therefore profits, which are essential to a small
        business.
       Could influence Aran’s impatience with supply chain.

      Disadvantages:
       Accord is a small business and may not have resources.
       It employs part-time staff who may not take on TQM ideas.
       TQM is designed for larger, more complex operations.

      Beware of answers that are only about general quality issues which should not be
      rewarded unless linked to TQM.

      Accept any other relevant advantage/disadvantage.

      Context comes from issues identified in the case and the nature of the business.

      Award [1] for each advantage/disadvantage of TQM up to a total of [2].

      Award [1] for putting each advantage/disadvantage into context up to a total
      of [2].

(d)   Discuss whether Aran and Kayla should change the organizational culture of
      Accord to overcome the problems with Enrich drinks.                                    [10]

      Problems with Enrich related to culture:
       Sales not strong
       Aran getting frustrated
       Workforce do not share vision
       Mainly part-time interests outside of work
       Aran’s autocratic style has increased labour turnover
       Quality problems (may overlap with (c))
       Problems with suppliers (may overlap with (c))
       Some disagreement as to who is to be blamed.

      Potential culture issues:
       Autocratic leadership
       Lack of sharing of vision
       Signs of disagreements and different styles.
                                       – 13 –              N19/3/BUSMT/HP1/ENG/TZ0/XX/M


However, some problems seem down to Aran’s personality (person culture?):
impatient, driven, wants to succeed, task-oriented. Is this culture, can it be
changed?

Other problems are due to marketing issues, which may not be due to culture.

Can culture be changed?
 TQM can change culture. Is it really suitable? It would certainly examine all the
  processes and business relationships.
 Clearer vision and training staff may help.
 Maybe task culture is not helping. Could this become more one of roles or
  some other culture?
 Is Aran’s style part of the culture? Maybe a different leadership style.
 Might it be better to employ full-time workers? Is this realistic?

Culture seems to be power based, could change to role based or task based.

If there are clear benefits from changing then it should be done, however, difficult
to make a case?

Accept reasonable alternative answers.

Marks should be allocated according to the mark bands on page 4.

Award a maximum of [4] for a purely theoretical answer or with no effective use
of case (eg, only repeating case material without development).

Award a maximum of [6] if culture change is considered but there is limited use of
data, or if there is good analysis of data with limited consideration of culture
change. (eg if main focus is on leadership with little link to culture).

Award a maximum of [8] if culture changes are considered and there is good use
of data but there are no significant judgements.

                                              Section C
5.   Using the case study and the additional information on pages 3 and 4, recommend
     whether Accord should start making and selling snack bars or whether Kayla and Aran
     should sell Accord to SF. A force field analysis of the options could help you in your
     answer.                                                                                    [20]

     Making and selling snack bars:
     Forces for the change to snack bars:
      Kayla is certain there is a market
      Fits in with existing product portfolio
      Payback and ARR are OK
      Business is in a good position to grow
      The Mintel report is very positive
      Snack bars are better than drinks because of competition.

     Forces restraining the change:
      Aran thinks it better to target the mass drinks market
      There are still quality issues to overcome first
      Detox does not fit in with his ideas for the product/market.

     Selling Accord to SF:
     Forces for the selling SF:
      Offer is for 5 years’ worth of earnings
      Detox remains
      Aran is frustrated with the current business and would accept the offer
      There are threats to Accord’s survival
      Certainty
      Kayla would buy Detox, which she likes.

     Forces restraining the change:
      It would end the partnership
      Would Aran later regret it?

     Do not penalize candidates who do not consider the “do nothing” option.

Criterion A: Is about the choice of theories/tools made by the candidate to try and
solve the problem. Possible theories, planning tools and techniques include: FFA,
Investment appraisal, SWOT, Risk (candidates need not refer to Ansoff but it might be
useful), takeovers, product portfolios, market data, ownership and control issues, eg
partnership, market research the importance of assumptions.

In this instance, as compared with previous sessions, the emphasis is likely to be on
choosing relevant theories and ideas and not so much on business tools.

No understanding of FFA max [3]. FFA could be presents as a table or a discussion of
driving/restraining forces

For [4]: FFA plus at least one other tool, technique or theory understood and developed well
with some relevance to the additional stimulus material.

For [2]: some understanding of at least two tools, techniques or theories, but not developed.

Criterion B: Is about the use of the stimulus, tools, techniques, theories in solving the
problem. Application will be judged by the use of the stimulus material, in particular the extra
material, especially Table 1, Appendix 1.

For [4]: relevant tools, techniques and theories are applied well to the case study (including
OFR) context and additional stimulus material, the application is convincing and relevant.

If only one option considered max [3].

Limited use of Table 1 or Appendix 1 max [3].

For [2]: some limited context/application but not developed. Use of tools limits candidate’s
ability to make reasoned arguments.

Criterion C: Is about the process of making a decision and the strength of the
recommendation. Options discussed in balanced way, conclusions drawn as to whether
they work. Remember, “do nothing” can be a recommendation.

It is always worth reflecting on the piece of work as a whole (the entirety of the answer) when
deciding on the mark for this criterion.

There can be some flexibility about the chose option: Option A, Option B, both options,
neither option

For [4]: There needs to be a comparison between the two options using Section C and other
material and a recommendation (Option 1, option 2 or do nothing) made and supported.

For [2]: Only one option considered or some limited arguments but not justified. No
comparison, limited analysis, but candidate arrives/draws a reasoned conclusion.

Criterion D: Structure. This criterion assesses the extent to which the student organizes his
or her ideas with clarity, and presents a structured piece of writing comprised of:
 an introductory paragraph
 logical structure
 a concluding paragraph
 fit-for-purpose paragraphs. This means: not too long, focused on distinct issues,
   sequenced well, guides the reader.
Beware of under-rewarding weak scripts that, nonetheless, have some or all of the elements.
The candidate will lose marks in the other criteria so they should not be doubly penalized.

For [4]: all four elements present, clearly organized and there is clarity in the student’s
answer.

For [2]: No logical structure, but other elements present or logical structure with other
elements missing.

Criterion E: Is about the extent to which stakeholders (both groups and individuals)
are considered.
 Individuals: Aran and Kayla (these hold different views so can be considered as different
   individuals).
 Groups: Managers, employees, customers, communities, governments, stakeholders at
   SF.

For [4]: two or more individuals and groups are considered in a balanced way.

For [2]: one group or individual considered appropriately, or several individuals or groups
considered superficially.

[1] could be awarded if there is mention of stakeholders but with little development.

[3] could be awarded if there is a range of stakeholders but little balance.
