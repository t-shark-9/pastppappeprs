Notes for examiners:

1. Whenever relevant, carry over marks must be awarded. If a candidate makes an error in
   calculation, but then uses the incorrect figure appropriately and accurately in later question
   parts, then the candidate may be fully rewarded. This is the “own-figure rule” and you should
   put OFR on the script where you are rewarding this.

2. Alternative approaches may be taken in responses to the [4] questions that use A02
   command terms. If this is the case and the alternative approaches are valid, then full
   credit should be given.

1.   (a)   State two characteristics of a perfectly competitive market.                           [2]

           Award [1] for each valid characteristic.

           Characteristics may include:
           • many small firms
           • homogeneous product
           • no barriers to entry (and exit)
           • perfect information
           • perfect factor mobility
           • firms are price takers.

     (b)   Using a fully labelled diagram, outline the relationship between marginal
           product (MP) and average product (AP) of labour.                                       [4]

              For a fully labelled diagram showing an MP curve that peaks earlier and
              higher and that intersects AP at its maximum.
              OR
              For outlining that MP will fall (due to diminishing returns) [1] and will
              intersect AP at its maximum, because if MP>AP, AP will rise, and if
              MP<AP, AP will fall [1].
      2       The written response is accurate.                                           3–4
              For a fully labelled diagram showing an MP curve that peaks earlier and
              higher and which intersects AP at its maximum.
              AND
              For outlining that MP will fall (due to diminishing returns) [1] and will
              intersect AP at its maximum, because if MP>AP, AP will rise, and if
              MP<AP, AP will fall [1].

      The vertical axis may be labelled Marginal/Average Product, Product, Output, (or abbreviations of
      these). The horizontal axis may be labelled (Quantity of) labour, workers, variable factor, input.

(c)   (i)    Determine the slope of the market supply function for the corn farmers in Nissos.         [1]

             (+) 1 is sufficient for [1].

      (ii)   Calculate the monthly equilibrium quantity of corn in Nissos.                             [2]

             10 − 0.5P = P − 2
             12 = 1.5P
             P=8
             Q=–2+8=6

             Any valid working is sufficient for [1].

             Q = 6 million kg

             An answer of 6 million kg or 6 million or 6 without working is sufficient for [1].

             For full marks to be awarded the response must provide some valid working and
             include correct units.

          Advantages may include:
          • supporting farmers’ incomes/increasing producer surplus
          • decreasing income inequality
          • reducing rural-urban migration
          • decreasing price instability in agricultural markets.

          Disadvantages may include:
          • higher prices for consumers
          • overproduction of farm products (surplus) / misallocation of resources / allocative
             inefficiency
          • increased government expenditure
          • opportunity cost of financing the scheme

          Any other valid response.
2         The written response is accurate.                                                       3–4
          Accurate explanations of advantages may include:
          • supporting farmers’ incomes, because farmers may have low and/or unstable
             incomes
          • decreasing income inequality, because rural areas have lower incomes than
             urban areas
          • reducing rural-urban migration, because urban areas have high unemployment
             and lower living standards due to population density
          • decreasing price instability in agricultural markets, which may occur because of
             weather and other random factors.

          Accurate explanations of disadvantages may include:
          • consumers will pay higher prices for food, which is a necessity
          • overproduction of farm products / misallocation of resources, because too much
             land is used for agriculture
          • increased government expenditure, which requires higher taxes or (increased)
             government borrowing
          • opportunity cost of financing the scheme, because spending on other needs will
             have to be foregone.

          Any other valid and explained response.

(ii)   Draw and label on Figure 1 a curve that illustrates the price floor in Nissos
       that leads to a monthly surplus of 3 million kg of corn.                        [2]




       Award [1] for a horizontal line above the equilibrium price.

       Award [1] for the line being drawn at $10.

       If the line is not labelled a maximum of [1] may be awarded.

       OFR applies.

(f)   (i)     State one measure that the government of Nissos might take to deal with this
              corn surplus, following the imposition of the price floor.                         [1]

              Award [1] for one accurate possible measure.

              Measures may include:
              • destroying the surplus
              • storing for future use (possible future drought)
              • exporting abroad at a lower price
              • overseas food aid
              • purchasing the surplus
              • providing foodbanks or low-income families with (rationed) surplus
              • any other valid measure.

      (ii)    Outline why purchasing this surplus implies an opportunity cost for the
              government of Nissos.                                                              [2]

                         For outlining that the funds used on purchasing
                         the surplus could have been used to finance
                         education, health services etc, or that taxes
                         would have to be higher or (the increased)
                         borrowing penalizes (or burdens) future
                         generations.

      (iii)   Using Figure 1, determine the size of the decrease in monthly corn consumption
              following the imposition of the price floor.                                       [1]

              1 million kg is sufficient for [1].

              No workings are required.

              OFR applies.

      (iv)    Using Figure 1, calculate the change in consumer expenditure on corn in Nissos.    [2]

              8  6 = $48 million
              10  5 = $50 million

              Any valid working is sufficient for [1].

              Change = $2 million OR an increase of $2 million.

              An answer of 2 or 2 million or $2 million without working is sufficient for [1].

              OFR applies.

              For full marks to be awarded the response must provide valid working and include

        Reasons may include:
        • higher level of investment spending is encouraged
        • export competitiveness is maintained

          suffer a decrease in their purchasing power
        • efficiency of price mechanism is maintained
        • income is not redistributed from lenders to borrowers
        • income is not redistributed from consumers to other groups
        • to avoid currency depreciation.

         Reasons why deflation is also undesirable are also valid, such as:
         • deflationary spiral
         • avoidance of a deflationary gap.

  2      The written response is accurate.                                        3–4
         Accurate explanations may include:
         • higher level of investment spending is encouraged as companies
           can predict future revenues and costs with less uncertainty/more
           confidence
         • export competitiveness is maintained so trade deficits do not widen
           creating BOP problems / so export-driven growth is maintained
         • money wage earners and recipients of transfer payments do not
           suffer a decrease in their purchasing power as they usually cannot
           negotiate higher wages/payments (or, so income inequality does not
           widen)
         • efficiency of price mechanism is maintained permitting efficient
           allocation of resources
         • income is not redistributed from lenders to borrowers, so that lenders
           (banks) do not charge unnecessarily high interest rates / so that
           borrowing is not excessively encouraged
         • income is not redistributed from consumers to other groups such as
           shareholders/producers, who would have benefited from higher
           profits (or, so income inequality does not widen)
         • to avoid currency depreciation, which would lead to higher import
           prices and production costs.

             keep falling
           • if prices are not maintained, a deflationary gap may occur with a
             decrease in economic activity and/or higher unemployment and/or
             bankruptcies.

      increasing aggregate demand if an economy is in a deep recession.                        [1]

      Answers may include:
      • Interest rates are already close to zero.
      • Spending depends on confidence/indebtedness as well as interest rates.
      • Money demand may be highly sensitive (elastic/flat) with respect to interest rates.

          Reasons may include:
          • An increase in Government spending is direct or can target specific
            sectors.
          • Spending by the government will often increase confidence levels.

          Accurate explanations may include:
          • An increase in Government spending (G) is direct since G is a
             component of aggregate demand or since infrastructure or subsidies
             can be targeted towards key areas.
          • Spending by the government will often directly increase employment
             (or decrease unemployment) and thus confidence levels.
          • There may be a multiplier effect as a rise in income leads to a rise in
             consumption.
          • Lowering income taxes increases disposable incomes and thus may
             positively affect spending as well as confidence levels.

            new exchange rate.                                                                       [1]

                   1
            US$       = US$ 0.29 or 0.29 or 29 cents
                  3.5

            Either of the above equivalent answers is sufficient for [1].

            OFR applies.

            For OFR divide 1 by the equilibrium value that appears on the plot or whatever is
            indicated on the vertical axis that is given by the intersection of demand and supply.

      (ii)   State two reasons that could have caused an increase in the supply of US$.         [2]

             Reasons may include:
             • US increasing its imports OR Gardia increasing its exports of goods and services to
               the US
             • Gardia’s interest rates rising OR US rates falling
             • Gardia’s inflation rate falling OR the inflation rate in the US rising
             • US incomes rising at a faster rate than incomes in Gardia
             • more investment (financial and/or direct) flowing from the US to Gardia
             • US government/central bank using dollars to buy gamma/foreign currencies
             • speculative selling of dollars (because of expectation of depreciation)
             • any other valid reason.

             NB Acceptable answers do not require an explicit reference to Gardia.

             Award [1] for each valid reason.

(g)   Calculate the maximum possible increase in real gross domestic product (GDP) in
      Gardia that could result from the changes in investment and government spending.          [2]

          1
                (11 − 8) = 4  3
      1 − 0.75

      Any valid working (eg the multiplier being calculated correctly) is sufficient for [1].

      = 12 million gamma

      An answer of 12 million gamma or 12 without workings is sufficient for [1].

      If investment is ignored and so the answer provided is 11  4 = 44 then [1] may be awarded.

      For full marks to be awarded the response must provide valid working and include
      correct units.

(h)     Using a fully labelled monetarist / new classical diagram, explain why, while there
        may be short-term fluctuations in output, the economy will always return to the full
        employment level of output in the long run.                                            [4]

1          The written response is limited.                                            1–2
           For a fully labelled diagram showing AD shifting right and SRAS shifting
           left, with a new LR equilibrium at the intersection of LRAS and the new AD.
           OR
           For explaining that a higher price level (and lower unemployment) will
           lead to higher wages/input prices, so SRAS/production falls (to the left).
           The new long-run equilibrium is where the new AD intersects LRAS at a
           higher price level with no impact on real GDP (the full-employment level
           of output).
2          The written response is accurate.                                           3–4
           For a fully labelled diagram showing AD shifting right and SRAS shifting
           left, with a new LR equilibrium at the intersection of LRAS and the new AD.
           AND
           For explaining that a higher price level (and lower unemployment) will
           lead to higher wages/input prices, so SRAS/production falls (to the left).
           The new long-run equilibrium is where the new AD intersects LRAS at a
           higher price level with no impact on real GDP (the full-employment level
           of output).

        NB An alternative response which illustrates and explains how the economy would adjust to
        a decrease in aggregate demand should also be fully rewarded.
