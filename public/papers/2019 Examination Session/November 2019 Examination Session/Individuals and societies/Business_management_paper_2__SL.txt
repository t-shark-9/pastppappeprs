Answer one question from this section.

1.   Small-Scale Hobbies (SSH)

     Scale Airplane Modeller is a magazine produced by Small-Scale Hobbies (SSH).
     The company sells the magazine through independent retail outlets in the US.

     The finance director produced a summary of 2018’s financial information. Last year’s
     break‑even chart showed that SSH had a margin of safety of 20 000 units.

                            Table 1: Selected financial data for SSH for 2018:

                      Annual fixed costs                                 $100 000

                      Variable costs per magazine produced                      $2

                      Magazine price                                            $4.50

     This year, to reduce costs and to increase sales, the company will introduce new production
     methods, which will reduce:
     yy unit variable costs by 10 %
     yy fixed costs by $5000 per year.


     (a)   Define the term margin of safety.                                                            [2]

     (b)   Using the financial data in Table 1, calculate:

           (i)     the break-even level of output (show all your working);                              [2]

           (ii)    the percentage of total costs that were fixed costs for last year (show all your
                   working);                                                                            [2]

           (iii)   the level of profit for SSH at 2018’s level of production (show all your working).   [2]

     (c)   Explain how the introduction of new production methods will affect the total cost line in
           SSH’s break-even chart.                                                                      [2]

2.   Daytona Go-Carts

     In 2020, Ron James aims to open Daytona Go-Carts,
     a race track where individuals as young as twelve can
     rent go-carts and participate in races. Through primary
     market research, Ron has discovered that many
     teenagers would enjoy participating in go-cart races.

     Ron has two options for locations for the go-cart
     race track:
     yy Option 1: The cost of the site would be $1.2 million
     yy Option 2: The cost of the site would be $1.8 million.             [Source: https://www.pexels.com]

     Forecasted profits for Option 1 are:

            Year 1          Year 2          Year 3          Year 4         Year 5
           $200 000        $300 000        $300 000       $300 000        $300 000

     Forecasted profits for Option 2 are $300 000 in the first year, with profits growing by 20 % per
     year for the next four years.


     (a)     State two methods of primary market research.                                                  [2]

     (b)     Calculate, for Option 1:

             (i)     the average rate of return (ARR) (show all your working);                              [2]

             (ii)    the payback period (show all your working).                                            [2]

     (c)     Calculate, for Option 2, the average rate of return (ARR) (show all your working).             [2]

     (d)     Explain one reason why Option 1 may be a less risky investment than Option 2.                  [2]




                                                                                                      Turn over

                                             Section B

Answer one question from this section.

3.   Top Star (TS)

     Top Star (TS) manufactures sports footwear. Its products are sold through retail outlets and
     online. Sales of TS’ footwear in retail outlets are falling. However, because e-commerce
     is growing rapidly, online sales are increasing. In 2018, TS’ total domestic sales were
     $5 000 000 and total domestic market sales for the same time period were $50 000 000.

     TS must consider several challenges:
     yy Some businesses in the sports footwear industry are finding that selling online leads to
        many problems and higher costs
     yy TS’ website is not user friendly. Customer complaints about the website and ordering
        problems are increasing
     yy TS’ presence in international markets is weak and its product range is limited. The
        directors of TS want to develop a new line of running shoes but the company has
        insufficient finance for research, development and creating brand awareness.

     The directors think that TS should follow an external growth strategy. Two options are being
     considered:
     yy Option 1: Some directors propose a merger with a footwear manufacturer, the
        multinational company All Champion, which would allow TS to be more competitive
     yy Option 2: Other directors propose a merger with a footwear retailer that has a strong
        presence in domestic and international markets.

     The finance manager believes that merging with All Champion could hurt TS’ reputation.
     TS’ factories may have to close, which the local population may resent.


     (a)   Describe one feature of a multinational company (MNC).                                   [2]

     (b)   Calculate TS’ market share in 2018 (show all your working).                              [2]

     (c)   Explain two disadvantages and one advantage to TS of selling its products online.        [6]

     (d)   With reference to TS, evaluate the two merger options.                                  [10]

4.   Imperial Falls (IF)

     Imperial Falls (IF) is a luxury hotel in a city centre. The hotel is an old palace, elegantly
     furnished and overlooking the harbour. Of the highest quality, for decades IF has been the
     preferred hotel for business travellers to the city. Relying on reputation and word of mouth,
     IF does little promotion. Its facilities include a swimming pool and a high-quality restaurant.
     Table 1 shows information about the principal hotels located in this city centre in 2018.

                             C. Welcome Rest                 $215       4 stars

                             D. Excalibur                    $155       3 stars

     In 2019, bookings at IF have begun to decline because of a new hotel, Guest Rooms (GR),
     which is part of a global chain. Many businesses have employees who travel to major
     cities, where most business meetings occur. Hotels in city centres are usually luxurious and
     expensive. GR is different. It offers clean, small rooms with Wi-Fi, a small desk and a double
     bed. Room prices at GR are significantly lower than most city-centre hotels. The new GR is
     located near the airport, 6 kilometres (3.72 miles) from the city centre.

     GR uses a fee-based membership model and member companies require employees to stay
     at a GR hotel when on business. Employees may also stay there when on personal travel.
     Guests use self-service check-in machines (similar to those used at airport check-ins), which
     issue electronic keys. GR electronically bills the company directly. Service is minimal. GR
     relies heavily on social media marketing. It also uses above-the-line promotion.


     (a)     State two types of above-the-line promotion.                                              [2]

     (b)     Using Table 1, construct a product position map/perception map for all four hotels prior
             to the opening of GR.                                                                     [4]

     (c)     Explain two ways in which GR is able to offer rooms at a lower price than IF.             [4]

     (d)     Discuss possible changes to IF’s marketing mix to reduce the loss of customers to GR. [10]

5.   FrioAire Appliances (FA)

     FrioAire Appliances (FA) manufactures medium-priced and medium-quality refrigerators. It is
     a multinational public limited company. Its factory is located in a less economically developed
     country that has high unemployment, a tradition of autocratic leadership and labour costs
     lower than FA’s home country. The factory is profitable, and FA pays consistently good
     dividends. Market growth for medium-priced and medium-quality refrigerators is limited.

     As part of a strategic objective to increase productivity and to enter a fast-growing market
     for high-priced and high-quality refrigerators, FA is considering building a new factory in
     and relocating production to Germany. This would require closing the factory in the less
     economically developed country. The new factory will:
     yy use innovative technologies, including advanced robotics and 3D processes
     yy require fewer employees, but those it does require will need to have better skills and
        qualifications.

     Germany has a highly skilled, qualified and productive workforce. The new factory would
     allow FA to reposition its products. However, FA would need to raise significant finance to
     build and equip the new factory.

     FA’s leadership style at the factory in the less economically developed country is autocratic.
     Members of FA’s board wonder whether this style would be suitable for the new factory in
     Germany, where workers have more bargaining power because of their high skill level and
     the labour-friendly cultural traditions. In Germany, FA would have to follow more regulations
     regarding the environment, health and safety, and employee rights.

     FA workers in the less economically developed country are very loyal to FA, which has
     continued operation through a civil war at significant cost to itself (for security). If FA were to
     close in the less economically developed country, the workers would not find such good jobs.


     (a)   Describe one disadvantage of operating as a public limited company.                             [2]

     (b)   Explain one benefit and one cost to FA of using an autocratic leadership style.                 [4]

     (c)   Explain one positive and one negative impact of FA on the developing country.                   [4]

     (d)   Evaluate the option of building a factory in, and relocating, to Germany.                      [10]
