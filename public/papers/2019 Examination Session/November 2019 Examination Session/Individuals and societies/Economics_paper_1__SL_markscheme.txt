                                              Section A

Microeconomics

1.   (a)    Explain two reasons why the demand for manufactured goods might be
            price elastic.                                                                        [10]

            Answers may include:
            • definitions of PED, price elastic, demand
            • diagram to show a relatively elastic demand curve, elastic section on a demand curve
            • explanation of two determinants of the elastic demand of manufactured goods, including:
              the number and closeness of substitutes, the degree of luxury/necessity, time and the
              proportion of income spent on the good
            • examples of manufactured goods with a relatively price elastic demand.

            NB Candidates who only explain one reason should not be awarded marks beyond level 2.

     (b)    Evaluate the importance of cross price elasticity of demand for a business selling a good if
            the price of a related good increases.                                                    [15]

            Answers may include:
            • definition of cross price elasticity of demand (XED)
            • diagram to show the significance of XED on the shift in demand that results from any
              change in price
            • explanation of the impact of XED on businesses if the price of complements and
              substitutes for a good they produce changes in terms of price, quantity, revenue and profit
            • examples of products that have substitutes and complements
            • synthesis or evaluation.

            Evaluation may include: the relative size of XED and the extent to which the revenue and
            profit will rise or fall; the assumption that other factors affecting demand remain constant and
            that XED is difficult to predict and measure.

     (b)    Evaluate the view that expansionary monetary policy is the most effective way to achieve
            economic growth.                                                                         [15]

            Answers may include:
            • definitions of monetary policy, economic growth
            • diagram to show the effect of expansionary monetary policy on economic growth
            • explanation of expansionary monetary policy by reducing interest rates will increase
              consumption and investment, leading to a rise in aggregate demand and therefore
              economic growth
            • examples of the impact of expansionary monetary policy on economic growth
            • synthesis and evaluation.

            Evaluation may include: consideration of the problems of expansionary monetary policy,
            such as inflation, that consumption and investment may not increase if business and
            consumer confidence are low, and the time lags associated with interest rate changes.
            Responses could also cover alternative policies to achieve economic growth, such as fiscal
            policy or supply-side policy.

     (b)    Discuss the view that economic growth always leads to a rise in living standards.       [15]

            Answers may include:
            • definitions of economic growth, living standards
            • PPC diagram or AD/AS diagram to depict economic growth
            • explanation of why economic growth leads to a rise in living standards because, for

            • synthesis or evaluation (discuss).

            Discussion may include: consideration that economic growth may not always lead to a rise in
            living standards because of factors such as environmental costs, the distribution of income,
            inflation and how the increased use of capital intensive technology may lead to
            unemployment.
