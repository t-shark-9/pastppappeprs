Please start each question on a new page. Full marks are not necessarily awarded for a correct answer
with no working. Answers must be supported by working and/or explanations. In particular, solutions
found from a graphic display calculator should be supported by suitable working. For example, if
graphs are used to find a solution, you should sketch these as part of your answer. Where an answer
is incorrect, some marks may be given for a correct method, provided this is shown by written working.
You are therefore advised to show all working.

     Engine oil is sold in cans of two capacities, large and small. The amount, in millilitres,
     in each can, is normally distributed according to Large ∼ N (5000 , 40) and
     Small ∼ N (1000 , 25) .

     (a)   A large can is selected at random. Find the probability that the can contains at least
           4995 millilitres of oil.                                                                               [2]

     (b)   A large can and a small can are selected at random. Find the probability that the large
           can contains at least 30 millilitres more than five times the amount contained in the
           small can.                                                                                             [6]

     (c)   A large can and five small cans are selected at random. Find the probability that the
           large can contains at least 30 millilitres less than the total amount contained in the
           small cans.                                                                                            [5]

     Eleven students who had under-performed in a philosophy practice examination were given
     extra tuition before their final examination. The differences between their final examination
     marks and their practice examination marks were

                                      10 , −1 , 6 , 7 , −5 , −5 , 2 , −3 , 8 , 9 , −2 .

     Assume that these differences form a random sample from a normal distribution with mean µ
     and variance σ 2 .

     (a)   Determine unbiased estimates of µ and σ 2 .                                                            [4]

     (b)   (i)     State suitable hypotheses to test the claim that extra tuition improves examination
                   marks.

		         (ii)    Calculate the p-value of the sample.

		         (iii)   Determine whether or not the above claim is supported at the 5 % significance
                   level.                                                                                         [8]

     A manufacturer of stopwatches employs a large number of people to time the winner of
     a 100 metre sprint. It is believed that if the true time of the winner is µ seconds,
     the times recorded are normally distributed with mean µ seconds and standard deviation
     0.03 seconds.

     The times, in seconds, recorded by six randomly chosen people are

                                 9.765 , 9.811 , 9.783 , 9.797 , 9.804 , 9.798 .

     (a)   Calculate a 99 % confidence interval for µ . Give your answer correct to three decimal
           places.                                                                                         [4]

     (b)   Interpret the result found in (a).                                                              [2]

     (c)   Find the confidence level of the interval that corresponds to halving the width of the
           99 % confidence interval. Give your answer as a percentage to the nearest whole
           number.                                                                                         [3]
