Instructions to Examiners

Abbreviations

M      Marks awarded for attempting to use a valid Method; working must be seen.

(M)    Marks awarded for Method; may be implied by correct subsequent working.

A      Marks awarded for an Answer or for Accuracy; often dependent on preceding M marks.

(A)   Marks awarded for an Answer or for Accuracy; may be implied by correct subsequent working.

R      Marks awarded for clear Reasoning.

N      Marks awarded for correct answers if no working shown.

AG     Answer given in the question and so no marks are awarded.


Using the markscheme

1      General

      Mark according to RM™ Assessor instructions and the document “Mathematics HL: Guidance
      for e-marking May 2015”. It is essential that you read this document before you start marking. In
      particular, please note the following:

       Marks must be recorded using the annotation stamps. Please check that you are entering marks
          for the right question.
       If a part is completely correct, (and gains all the “must be seen” marks), use the ticks with
          numbers to stamp full marks.
       If a part is completely wrong, stamp A0 by the final answer.
       If a part gains anything else, it must be recorded using all the annotations.
       All the marks will be added and recorded by RM™ Assessor.

2      Method and Answer/Accuracy marks

       Do not automatically award full marks for a correct answer; all working must be checked, and
         marks awarded according to the markscheme.
                 It is not possible to award M0 followed by A1, as A mark(s) depend on the preceding
         M mark(s), if any.
                 Where M and A marks are noted on the same line, eg M1A1, this usually means M1
         for an attempt to use an appropriate method (eg substitution into a formula) and A1 for using
         the correct values.
                  Where the markscheme specifies (M2), N3, etc., do not split the marks.
                  Once a correct answer to a question or part-question is seen, ignore further working.
                 However, if further working indicates a lack of mathematical understanding do not
                 award the final A1. An exception to this may be in numerical answers, where a
                 correct exact value is followed by an incorrect decimal. However, if the incorrect
                 decimal is carried through to a subsequent part, and correct FT working shown,
                 award FT marks as appropriate but do not award the final A1 in that part.
                                                     –4–             M15/5/FURMA/HP1/ENG/TZ0/XX/M

     3.      log a  log b             log (a  b)                    Do not award the final A1


3    N marks

     Award N marks for correct answers where there is no working.

     Do not award a mixture of N and other marks.
                 There may be fewer N marks available than the total of M, A and R marks; this is
       deliberate as it penalizes candidates for not following the instruction to show their working.

4    Implied marks

    Implied marks appear in brackets eg (M1), and can only be awarded if correct work is seen or if
    implied in subsequent working.

     Normally the correct work is seen or implied in the next line.
     Marks without brackets can only be awarded for work that is seen.

5    Follow through marks

    Follow through (FT) marks are awarded where an incorrect answer from one part of a question is
    used correctly in subsequent part(s). To award FT marks, there must be working present and
    not just a final answer based on an incorrect answer to a previous part.

     If the question becomes much simpler because of an error then use discretion to award fewer FT
        marks.
     If the error leads to an inappropriate value (eg sin  1.5 ), do not award the mark(s) for the final
        answer(s).
     Within a question part, once an error is made, no further dependent A marks can be awarded,
        but M marks may be awarded if appropriate.
     Exceptions to this rule will be explicitly noted on the markscheme.

6    Mis-read

    If a candidate incorrectly copies information from the question, this is a mis-read (MR).
    A candidate should be penalized only once for a particular mis-read. Use the MR stamp to indicate
    that this has been a misread. Then deduct the first of the marks to be awarded, even if this is an M
    mark, but award all others so that the candidate only loses one mark.

     If the question becomes much simpler because of the MR, then use discretion to award fewer
        marks.
     If the MR leads to an inappropriate value (eg sin  1.5 ), do not award the mark(s) for the final
        answer(s).

7     Discretionary marks (d)

     An examiner uses discretion to award a mark on the rare occasions when the markscheme does
     not cover the work seen. In such cases the annotation DM should be used and a brief note written
     next to the mark explaining this decision.

8     Alternative methods

     Candidates will sometimes use methods other than those in the markscheme. Unless the question
     specifies a method, other correct methods should be marked in line with the markscheme. If in
     doubt, contact your team leader for advice.

      Alternative methods for complete questions are indicated by METHOD 1, METHOD 2, etc.
      Alternative solutions for part-questions are indicated by EITHER . . . OR.
      Where possible, alignment will also be used to assist examiners in identifying where these
        alternatives start and finish.

9     Alternative forms

      Unless the question specifies otherwise, accept equivalent forms.

      As this is an international examination, accept all alternative forms of notation.
                 In the markscheme, equivalent numerical and algebraic forms will generally be written
        in brackets immediately following the answer.
                 In the markscheme, simplified answers, (which candidates often do not write in
        examinations), will generally appear in brackets. Marks should be awarded for either the form
        preceding the bracket or the form in brackets (if it is seen).

        Example: for differentiating f ( x)  2sin (5x  3) , the markscheme gives:

            f  ( x)   2cos(5x  3)  5     10cos(5x  3)                                A1

        Award A1 for  2cos (5 x  3)  5 , even if 10cos(5x  3) is not seen.

10    Accuracy of Answers

      Candidates should NO LONGER be penalized for an accuracy error (AP).

     If the level of accuracy is specified in the question, a mark will be allocated for giving the answer to
     the required accuracy. When this is not specified in the question, all numerical answers should be
     given exactly or correct to three significant figures. Please check work carefully for FT.

11    Crossed out work

     If a candidate has drawn a line through work on their examination script, or in some other way
     crossed out their work, do not award any marks for that work.

12    Calculators

     A GDC is required for paper 3, but calculators with symbolic manipulation features (for example,
     TI-89) are not allowed.

     Calculator notation
     The Mathematics HL guide says:
                 Students must always use correct mathematical notation, not calculator notation.
     Do not accept final answers written using calculator notation. However, do not penalize the use of
     calculator notation in the working.

13    More than one solution

     Where a candidate offers two or more different answers to the same question, an examiner should
     only mark the first response unless the candidate indicates otherwise.

            since Y lies inside the circle, Y divides the chord CK internally

           Since the triangles ACY and DBY are still similar ACY=DBY                       A1

           ACDB is therefore a cyclic quadrilateral so the points A, B, C, D lie on
           a circle.                                                                       R1

           again consider the circle passing through ABC and again let it cut the line
           CD at K.                                                                        M1
           in this case Y lies outside the circle ABC and therefore Y divides the chord
           CK externally.                                                                 M1

                       2
      since x 2 and y have the same coefficients and there is no xy term,
      this is a circle                                                                   R1
      we know the pair of points fit the equation.                                       R1
      hence this is the required equation.

      METHOD 2
      Let the general equation be
      x2  y 2  ax  by  q  0                                                         M1
      The intersection with the given circle satisfies
      (a  d ) x  (b  e) y  (q  c)  0                                            M1A1
      This must be the same line as lx + my + n = 0                                     R1
      Therefore
                   a  d  l giving a  d  l
                   b  e  m giving b  e  m                                          A1
                   q  c  n giving q  c  n
      leading to the required general equation
