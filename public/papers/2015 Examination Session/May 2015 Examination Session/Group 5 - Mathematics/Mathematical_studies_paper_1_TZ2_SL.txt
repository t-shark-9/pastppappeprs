Maximum marks will be given for correct answers. Where an answer is incorrect, some marks may be
given for a correct method, provided this is shown by written working. Write your answers in the
answer boxes provided. Solutions found from a graphic display calculator should be supported by
suitable working, for example, if graphs are used to find a solution, you should sketch these as part of
your answer.

1.   The distance d from a point P (x , y) to the point A (1 , −2) is given by
      d = ( x − 1) 2 + ( y + 2) 2 .

     (a)    Find the distance from P (100 , 200) to A. Give your answer correct to two decimal
             places.                                                                                                           [3]

     (b)     Write down your answer to part (a) correct to three significant figures.                                          [1]


     (c)     Write down your answer to part (b) in the form a × 10k , where 1 ≤ a < 10 and k ∈  .                             [2]

2.   Fabián stands on top of a building, T, which is on a horizontal street.
     He observes a car, C, on the street, at an angle of depression of 30 . The base of the
     building is at B. The height of the building is 80 metres.

     The following diagram indicates the positions of T, B and C.



                            T                                                           diagram not to scale

           (i)    the height of the building;

           (ii)   the angle of depression.                                                                                      [2]

7.   The producer of a TV dancing show asked a group of 150 viewers their age and the type of
     Latin dance they preferred. The types of Latin dances in the show were Argentine tango,
     Samba, Rumba and Cha-cha-cha. The data obtained were organized in the following table.


                                                                      Dance

     A χ2 test was carried out, at the 5 % significance level.

     (a)   Write down the null hypothesis for this test.                                              [1]

     (b)   Write down the observed number of viewers who preferred Rumba and were older than
           20 years old.                                                                              [1]

     (c)   Use your graphic display calculator to find the p-value for this test.                     [2]

     The producer claims that the type of Latin dance a viewer preferred is independent of
     their age.

     (d)   Decide whether this claim is justified. Give a reason for your decision.                   [2]

13.   A factory makes metal bars. Their lengths are assumed to be normally distributed with a
      mean of 180 cm and a standard deviation of 5 cm.

      (a)   On the following diagram, shade the region representing the probability that a
            metal bar, chosen at random, will have a length less than 175 cm.                                                     [2]




                                             Length of metal bar

      A metal bar is chosen at random.

      (b)   (i)    The probability that the length of the metal bar is less than 175 cm is equal to the
                   probability that the length is greater than h cm. Write down the value of h .

            (ii)   Find the probability that the length of the metal bar is greater than one standard
                   deviation above the mean.                                                                                      [4]

14.   The number of fish, N , in a pond is decreasing according to the model

                                          N (t) = ab−t + 40 , t ≥ 0

      where a and b are positive constants, and t is the time in months since the number of fish in
      the pond was first counted.

      At the beginning 840 fish were counted.

      (a)   Find the value of a .                                                                                                [2]

      After 4 months 90 fish were counted.

      (b)   Find the value of b .                                                                                                [3]

      The number of fish in the pond will not decrease below p .

      (c)   Write down the value of p .                                                                                          [1]

15.   A building company has many rectangular construction sites, of varying widths, along a road.
      The area, A , of each site is given by the function

                                          A (x) = x (200 − x)

      where x is the width of the site in metres and 20 ≤ x ≤ 180 .

      (a)   Site S has a width of 20 m. Write down the area of S.                                                                    [1]

      (b)   Site T has the same area as site S, but a different width. Find the width of T.                                          [2]

      When the width of the construction site is b metres, the site has a maximum area.

      (c)   (i)    Write down the value of b .

            (ii)   Write down the maximum area.                                                                                      [2]

      The range of A (x) is m ≤ A (x) ≤ n .

      (d)   Hence write down the value of m and of n .                                                                               [1]
