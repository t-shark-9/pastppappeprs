Answer all questions in the answer booklet provided. Please start each question on a new page.
You are advised to show all working, where possible. Where an answer is incorrect, some marks may
be given for a correct method, provided this is shown by written working. Solutions found from a graphic
display calculator should be supported by suitable working, for example, if graphs are used to find a
solution, you should sketch these as part of your answer.

     A group of 100 customers in a restaurant are asked which fruits they like from a choice of
     mangoes, bananas and kiwi fruits. The results are as follows.

                                   15 like all three fruits
                                   22 like mangoes and bananas
                                   33 like mangoes and kiwi fruits
                                   27 like bananas and kiwi fruits
                                    8 like none of these three fruits
                                    x like only mangoes

     (a)   Copy the following Venn diagram and correctly insert all values from the
           above information.                                                                          [3]

     The number of customers that like only mangoes is equal to the number of customers that
     like only kiwi fruits. This number is half of the number of customers that like only bananas.

           of x .                                                                                      [2]

     The radius of both the cylinder and the base of the cone is 3 cm.
     The height of the cylinder is 4.5 cm.
     The slant height of the cone is 4 cm.

     (a)   (i)    Show that the vertical height of the cone is 2.65 cm correct to three
                  significant figures.

     The bottle contains 125 cm3 of perfume. The bottle is not full and all of the perfume is in the
     cylinder part.

     (b)   Find the height of the perfume in the bottle.                                               [2]

     Temi covers the perfume bottles with a paint that costs 3 South African rand (ZAR)
     per millilitre. One millilitre of this paint covers an area of 7 cm2.

     (d)   Calculate the cost, in ZAR, of painting the perfume bottle. Give your answer correct
           to two decimal places.                                                                  [3]

     Temi sells her perfume bottles in a craft fair for 325 ZAR each. Dominique from France buys
     one and wants to know how much she has spent, in euros (EUR). The exchange rate is
     1 EUR = 13.03 ZAR.

     Daniel grows apples and chooses at random a sample of 100 apples from his harvest.
     He measures the diameters of the apples to the nearest cm. The following table shows the
     distribution of the diameters.

                     Diameter

     (a)   Using your graphic display calculator, write down the value of

           (i)    the mean of the diameters in this sample;

           (ii)   the standard deviation of the diameters in this sample.                           [3]

     Daniel assumes that the diameters of all of the apples from his harvest are normally
     distributed with a mean of 7 cm and a standard deviation of 1.2 cm. He classifies the apples
     according to their diameters as shown in the following table.


                                   Classification         Diameter (cm)

                              		      Small            Diameter < 6.5

                                      Medium           6.5 ≤ Diameter < a

     (b)   Calculate the percentage of small apples in Daniel’s harvest.                            [3]

     Of the apples harvested, 5 % are large apples.

     (c)   Find the value of a .                                                                    [2]

     This year, Daniel estimates that he will grow 100 000 apples.

     (e)   Estimate the number of large apples that Daniel will grow this year.                     [2]
