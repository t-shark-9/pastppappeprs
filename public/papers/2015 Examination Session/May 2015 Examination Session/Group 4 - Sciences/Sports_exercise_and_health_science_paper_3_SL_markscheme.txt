General marking instructions

1.    Follow the markscheme provided, award only whole marks and mark only in RED.

2.    Make sure that the question you are about to mark is highlighted in the mark panel on the right-hand side of the screen.

3.    Where a mark is awarded, a tick/check () must be placed in the text at the precise point where it becomes clear that the candidate deserves the
      mark. One tick to be shown for each mark awarded.

4.    Sometimes, careful consideration is required to decide whether or not to award a mark. In these cases use RM™ Assessor annotations to support
      your decision. You are encouraged to write comments where it helps clarity, especially for re-marking purposes. Use a text box for these additional
      comments. It should be remembered that the script may be returned to the candidate.

5.    Personal codes/notations are unacceptable.

6.    Where an answer to a part question is worth no marks but the candidate has attempted the part question, use the “zero” annotation to award zero
      marks. Where a candidate has not attempted the part question, use the “SEEN” annotation to show you have looked at the question. RM™ Assessor
      will apply NR once you click complete.

7.    If a candidate has attempted more than the required number of questions within a paper or section of a paper, mark all the answers. RM™ Assessor
      will only award the highest mark or marks in line with the rubric.

8.    Ensure that you have viewed every page including any additional sheets. Please ensure that you stamp “SEEN” on any additional pages that are
      blank or where the candidate has crossed out his/her work.

9.    There is no need to stamp an annotation when a candidate has not chosen an optional question in Section B. RM™ Assessor will apply NR once you
      click complete.

10.   Mark positively. Give candidates credit for what they have achieved and for what they have got correct, rather than penalizing them for what they
      have got wrong. However, a mark should not be awarded where there is contradiction within an answer. Make a comment to this effect using a text
      box or the “CON” stamp.

Mark Allocation

Candidates are required to answer questions from TWO of the Options [2×20 marks]. Maximum total = [40 marks].

Markscheme format example:

                  a condition in which blood supply to some part of the brain is impaired ‹due
                  to a blocked/burst artery›

1.   Each row in the ‘Question’ column relates to the smallest subpart of the question.

2.   The maximum mark for each question subpart is indicated in the ‘Total’ column.

3.   Each marking point in the ‘Answers’ column is shown by means of a tick () at the end of the marking point.

4.   A question subpart may have more marking points than the total allows. This will be indicated by ‘max’ written after the mark in the ‘Total’ column.
     The related rubric, if necessary, will be outlined in the ‘Notes’ column.

5.   An alternative wording is indicated in the ‘Answers’ column by a slash (/). Either wording can be accepted.

6.   An alternative answer is indicated in the ‘Answers’ column by ‘OR’ on the line between the alternatives. Either answer can be accepted.

7.   Words in angled brackets ‹ › in the ‘Answers’ column are not necessary to gain the mark.

8.   Words that are underlined are essential for the mark.

9.   The order of marking points does not have to be as in the ‘Answers’ column, unless stated otherwise in the ‘Notes’ column.



                                                                                                                                                continued…

10.   If the candidate’s answer has the same “meaning” or can be clearly interpreted as being of equivalent significance, detail and validity as that in the
      ‘Answers’ column then award the mark. Where this point is considered to be particularly relevant in a question it is emphasized by OWTTE (or words
      to that effect).

11.   Remember that many candidates are writing in a second language. Effective communication is more important than grammatical accuracy.

12.   Occasionally, a part of a question may require an answer that is required for subsequent marking points. If an error is made in the first marking point
      then it should be penalized. However, if the incorrect answer is used correctly in subsequent marking points then follow through marks should be
      awarded. When marking, indicate this by adding ECF (error carried forward) on the script. ‘ECF acceptable’ will be displayed in the ‘Notes’ column.

13.   Do not penalize candidates for errors in units or significant figures, unless it is specifically referred to in the ‘Notes’ column.

        Cognitive Evaluation Theory is a theory in Psychology that is designed to explain the effects of external
        consequences on internal motivation. Specifically, CET is a sub-theory of Self-Determination Theory that
        focus on competence and autonomy while examining how intrinsic motivation is affected by external forces.
