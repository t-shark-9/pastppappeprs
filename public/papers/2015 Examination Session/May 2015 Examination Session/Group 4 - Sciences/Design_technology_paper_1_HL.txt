      heat gain?

35.   One aspect of passive solar design is to use design elements, such as roof overhangs, to shade
      windows and reduce solar heat gain particularly during summer. The solar altitude in Zagreb,
      Croatia during the summer solstice is 68 degrees.

Questions 36–40 relate to the following case study. Please read the case study carefully and answer
the questions.

European legislation requires all new cars to meet minimum statutory safety standards to protect the
occupants of cars and other road users, for example, pedestrians. Figure 10 shows some of the tests
designed by European New Car Assessment Programme (Euro NCAP) for pedestrian protection.
A legform test, for example, is used to test the damage to a pedestrian if his/her lower leg were hit by a
car bumper. Bumpers can be designed to deform on impact.
