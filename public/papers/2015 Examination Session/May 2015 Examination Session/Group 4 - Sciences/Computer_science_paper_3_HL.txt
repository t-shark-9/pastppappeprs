Answer all questions.

1.   (a)   Define the term brute-force decryption.                                                    [2]

     (b)   Outline the role of the Device Description Repository in mobile banking.                   [2]


2.   (a)   The Case Study suggests that providing both security and usability can be “a difficult
           compromise” (page 2).

           Explain why this may be true, with specific reference to an area referred to in the
           Case Study.                                                                                [4]

     (b)   Describe how the SSL protocol involves the use of both symmetric and asymmetric
           encryption.                                                                                [4]


3.   An attack specifically targeted at bank transactions is called the Man-in-the-Browser attack.

     (a)   Outline how this attack is carried out.                                                    [2]

     (b)   Explain why only some methods of authentication are able to counter this type
           of attack.                                                                                 [4]


4.   TransEuropa has decided to focus on the use of QR codes, instead of NFC, with its mobile
     payments app.  This app will allow payments to be made in different stores and for cash to
     be taken out at ATMs.

     By making a comparison of the two technologies, discuss the reasons why QR codes have
     been chosen over the use of NFC.                                                                [12]
