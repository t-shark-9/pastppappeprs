Subject Details: Biology SL Paper 2 Markscheme
Mark Allocation

Candidates are required to answer ALL questions in Section A [30 marks] and ONE question in
Section B [20 marks]. Maximum total = [50 marks].

1.   A markscheme often has more marking points than the total allows. This is intentional.

2.   Each marking point has a separate line and the end is shown by means of a semicolon (;).

3.   An alternative answer or wording is indicated in the markscheme by a slash (/). Either wording can
     be accepted.

4.   Words in brackets ( ) in the markscheme are not necessary to gain the mark.

5.   Words that are underlined are essential for the mark.

6.   The order of marking points does not have to be as in the markscheme, unless stated otherwise.

Extended response questions - quality of construction

        Extended response questions for SL P2 carry a mark total of [20]. Of these marks, [18] are
         awarded for content and [2] for the quality of construction of the answer.

      Two aspects are considered:
           expression of relevant ideas with clarity
           structure of the answers.

      [1] quality mark is to be awarded when the candidate satisfies EACH of the following criteria.
         Thus [2] quality marks are awarded when a candidate satisfies BOTH criteria.

     Clarity of expression:
        The candidate has made a serious and full attempt to answer all parts of the question and the
        answers are expressed clearly enough to be understood with little or no re-reading.

     Structure of answer:
        The candidate has linked relevant ideas to form a logical sequence within at least two parts
        of the same question (eg within part a and within part b, or within part a and within part c
        etc. but not between part a and part b or between part a and part c etc.).

      It is important to judge this on the overall answer, taking into account the answers to all parts
         of the question. Although, the part with the largest number of marks is likely to provide the
         most evidence.

      Candidates that score very highly on the content marks need not necessarily automatically
         gain [2] marks for the quality of construction (and vice versa).

           b. head is glycerol and phosphate;
           c. tails are fatty acid chains;
           d. head hydrophilic and tails hydrophobic;
           e. hydrophilic molecules/heads attracted to/soluble in water;
           f. hydrophobic molecules/tails not attracted to water but attracted to each other;
           g. (properties of phospholipids leads to) formation of double layer in water;
           h. stability in double layer because heads on outer edge are attracted to water
              and tails are attracted to each other in middle;
           i. phospholipid bilayer in fluid/flexible state because of attraction of non-polar
              tails to each other;
           j. (fluidity) allows membranes to change shape/vesicles to form or fuse with
              membrane/(fluidity) allows cells to divide;
           k. non-polar amino acid side chains attracted to (hydrophobic) tails;                   [8 max]
