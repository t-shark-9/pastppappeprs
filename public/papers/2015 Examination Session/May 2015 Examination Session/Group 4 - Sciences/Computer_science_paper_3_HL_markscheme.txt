Mark allocation

Candidates are required to answer all questions. Total 30 marks.

General

A markscheme often has more specific points worthy of a mark than the total allows. This is intentional.
Do not award more than the maximum marks allowed for that part of a question.

When deciding upon alternative answers by candidates to those given in the markscheme, consider the
following points:

          Each statement worth one point has a separate line and the end is signified by means of
           a semi-colon (;).

          An alternative answer or wording is indicated in the markscheme by a “/”; either wording can
           be accepted.

          Words in ( … ) in the markscheme are not necessary to gain the mark.

          If the candidate’s answer has the same meaning or can be clearly interpreted as being the
           same as that in the markscheme then award the mark.

          Mark positively. Give candidates credit for what they have achieved and for what they have
           got correct, rather than penalizing them for what they have not achieved or what they have
           got wrong.

          Remember that many candidates are writing in a second language; be forgiving of
           minor linguistic slips. In this subject effective communication is more important than
           grammatical accuracy.

          Occasionally, a part of a question may require a calculation whose answer is required for
           subsequent parts. If an error is made in the first part then it should be penalized. However,
           if the incorrect answer is used correctly in subsequent parts then follow through marks
           should be awarded. Indicate this with “FT”.

          Question 4 is marked against markbands. The markbands represent a single holistic
           criterion applied to the piece of work. Each markband level descriptor corresponds to a
           number of marks. When assessing with markbands, a “best fit” approach is used, with
           markers making a judgment about which particular mark to award from the possible range for
           each level descriptor, according to how well the candidate’s work fits that descriptor.

General guidance

 Issue             Guidance
 Answering         • In the case of an “identify” question read all answers and mark positively up to the
 more than           maximum marks. Disregard incorrect answers.
 the quantity      • In the case of a “describe” question, which asks for a certain number of facts
 of responses        eg “describe two kinds”, mark the first two correct answers. This could include
 prescribed in       two descriptions, one description and one identification, or two identifications.
 the questions     • In the case of an “explain” question, which asks for a specified number of
                     explanations eg “explain two reasons …”, mark the first two correct answers.
                     This could include two full explanations, one explanation, one partial explanation
                     etc.

1.   (a)   A method designed to break/crack an encryption code/key / decrypt the key/code (not
           password);
           By trying every possible combination;                                                 [2]
           Note: First mark can be awarded for “decrypts encrypted information” or similar.

     (b)   It contains data about different mobile devices;
           So that (downloaded) content can be adjusted/customised to suit the device /
           check if the phone is of a suitable standard to access the site;                      [2]


2.   (a)   Award up to [4 marks max].
           Award [1 mark] for the example which deals with an appropriate area in the Case
           Study.
           Award [1 mark] for making clear that increasing one will decrease the other.
           Award [1 mark] for the security process involved.
           Award [1 mark] for an effect on usability.
           Award [1 mark] for an extended description of the consequence of this.

           Example: paying for coffee in a coffee shop;
           If the process requires the entering of username/passwords/some kind of
           biometric factor which will increase security;
           If the customer is going to use a smartphone to pay he/she wishes this to be a
           fast, uncomplicated process (usability), not the opposite;
           The customer might decide that it is in fact easier paying by cash/credit card;

           Example: authentication;
           The use of out-of-band via a mobile phone as an additional layer of security;
           This will increase the time required to make a transaction;
           Which may well put the customer off using internet banking/make him
           change banks;
           Note: “Internet banking/mobile banking” requires some elaboration before the
           first mark can be awarded.

           Example: login procedure;
           Increasing from one-factor to two-factor;
           Two-factor is more secure but takes more time for the user;
           One-factor is quicker for the user, but less secure e.g. if someone finds out your
           PIN;                                                                                  [4]

     (b)   Asymmetric encryption is necessary so that a session key/password can be
           safely exchanged / to authenticate the sender/receiver;
           As this will be sent with a private key that can only be decoded by the
           intended recipient;
           Once the key/password has been exchanged symmetric encryption can
           take place;
           As this requires less processing (by server and client) and this allows
           transactions to be carried out faster;                                                [4]
           Note: Award [2 marks max] for an understanding of the two methods of
           encryption.
           e.g. Asymmetric uses a public key to encrypt and a private key to decrypt:
           Symmetric uses the same key for both encryption and decryption. Do not award
           full marks if the reason for asymmetric is not given (session key transfer).

3.   (a)   Man-in-the-Browser is a type of Trojan/virus (any malware) that resides in
           browser/extensions/user scripts/code/embeds/attaches itself in the browser (not
           “webpage”);
           It modifies the onscreen content / modifies bank account details of the recipient in
           transactions / keyloggers after transactions;                                          [2]

     (b)   Award up to [4 marks max].

           Example 1:
           Normal login process takes place before the modified data is sent so SSL does
           not prevent the attack;
           SSL protocols/encryption takes place after the data has been modified so does
           not affect the attack / Authenticates the user not the data entered in the browser;
           Out-of-band verification / Uses mobile phones (SMS messages from the bank)/
           email/phone call;
           To confirm the transaction with the legitimate user / spot the modified details;

           Example 2:
           Two-band/multi-band authentication will not prevent the attack;
           Because MitB only changes the content not the login details / they may be
           keylogged;
           Out-of-band verification / Uses mobile phones (SMS messages from the bank)/
           email/phone call;
           To confirm the transaction with the legitimate user / spot the modified details;       [4]

4.   Areas that should be explored include:
Technology
     NFC
     • Produces radio waves that operate in a short range.
     • Powered by NFC waves (induction) generated by retailer’s NFC chip: passive mode.
     • Or by the phone’s own power source: active mode.
     • Passive mode only allows data to be sent / active allows two-way transfer
       (offers/coupons etc).
     QR Codes
     • A 2-D barcode that contains the user’s account details.
     • Software is well established.
     • Scanned by the retailer’s POS scanner / ATM’s incorporated scanner.
Processes
     • In both cases the user opens a “mobile wallet app” with a password.
     • Payment service is selected.
     • Either QR code is generated and scanned or phone is placed close to POS terminal
       (or “tapped”).
     • With NFC (Barclaycard for small amounts) phone can just be tapped on already
       prepared POS terminal with no prior steps taken by user.
Security
    • Both methods remove the dangers of card-cloning.
    • In both cases the account data can be stored in a “secure element” on the SIM card.
    • Or at the financial institute’s server / in the cloud.
    • NFC signals can be picked up outside of the nominal range.
    • QR code difficult to intercept without taking the phone.
Level of Acceptability – user
     • No agreed way of incorporating NFC chips.
     • Could be part of phone circuitry / incorporated into the SIM card / attached as
        a sticker.
     • QR codes require no additional hardware on the client side / software generated.
Level of Acceptability – retailer
     • NFC requires purchasing of additional hardware / costs.
     • Without knowing that the technology will be taken up universally.
     • QR codes require only the (already present) scanner.
Conclusion
     • There needs to be a final conclusion based on the arguments previously presented.
