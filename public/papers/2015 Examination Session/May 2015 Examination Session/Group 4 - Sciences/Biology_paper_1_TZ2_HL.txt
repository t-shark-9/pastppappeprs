23.   The curly hair of the coat of Selkirk Rex cats is due to the presence of the allele SC. These cats
      can either have tight curls or be moderately curly, whereas the coat of other cats is usually made
      of straight hair with no curls because of the allele SS. Circles indicate female cats and squares
      indicate males.
