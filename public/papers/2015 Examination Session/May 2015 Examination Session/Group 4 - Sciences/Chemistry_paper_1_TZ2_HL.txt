40.   What is the best way to minimize the random uncertainty when titrating an acid of unknown
      strength against a standard solution of sodium hydroxide (ie one of known concentration)?

      A.   First standardize the sodium hydroxide solution against a standard solution of a
           different acid.

      C.   Keep your eye at the same height as the meniscus when reading the burette.

      D.   Repeat the titration several times.
