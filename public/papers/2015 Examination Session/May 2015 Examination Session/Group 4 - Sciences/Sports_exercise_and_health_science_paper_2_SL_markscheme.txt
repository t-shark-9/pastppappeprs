General marking instructions

1.    Follow the markscheme provided, award only whole marks and mark only in RED.

2.    Make sure that the question you are about to mark is highlighted in the mark panel on the right-hand side of the screen.

3.    Where a mark is awarded, a tick/check () must be placed in the text at the precise point where it becomes clear that the candidate deserves the
      mark. One tick to be shown for each mark awarded.

4.    Sometimes, careful consideration is required to decide whether or not to award a mark. In these cases use RM™ Assessor annotations to support
      your decision. You are encouraged to write comments where it helps clarity, especially for re-marking purposes. Use a text box for these additional
      comments. It should be remembered that the script may be returned to the candidate.

5.    Personal codes/notations are unacceptable.

6.    Where an answer to a part question is worth no marks but the candidate has attempted the part question, use the “zero” annotation to award zero
      marks. Where a candidate has not attempted the part question, use the “SEEN” annotation to show you have looked at the question. RM™ Assessor
      will apply NR once you click complete.

7.    If a candidate has attempted more than the required number of questions within a paper or section of a paper, mark all the answers. RM™ Assessor
      will only award the highest mark or marks in line with the rubric.

8.    Ensure that you have viewed every page including any additional sheets. Please ensure that you stamp “SEEN” on any additional pages that are
      blank or where the candidate has crossed out his/her work.

9.    There is no need to stamp an annotation when a candidate has not chosen an optional question in Section B. RM™ Assessor will apply NR once you
      click complete.

10.   Mark positively. Give candidates credit for what they have achieved and for what they have got correct, rather than penalizing them for what they
      have got wrong. However, a mark should not be awarded where there is contradiction within an answer. Make a comment to this effect using a text
      box or the “CON” stamp.

Mark Allocation

Candidates are required to answer ALL questions in Section A [30 marks] and ONE question in Section B [20 marks]. Maximum total = [50 marks].

Markscheme format example:

                  internal paced skills are javelin throw/gymnastics routine

1.   Each row in the ‘Question’ column relates to the smallest subpart of the question.

2.   The maximum mark for each question subpart is indicated in the ‘Total’ column.

3.   Each marking point in the ‘Answers’ column is shown by means of a tick () at the end of the marking point.

4.   A question subpart may have more marking points than the total allows. This will be indicated by ‘max’ written after the mark in the ‘Total’ column.
     The related rubric, if necessary, will be outlined in the ‘Notes’ column.

5.   An alternative wording is indicated in the ‘Answers’ column by a slash (/). Either wording can be accepted.

6.   An alternative answer is indicated in the ‘Answers’ column by ‘OR’ on the line between the alternatives. Either answer can be accepted.

7.   Words in angled brackets ‹ › in the ‘Answers’ column are not necessary to gain the mark.

8.   Words that are underlined are essential for the mark.

9.   The order of marking points does not have to be as in the ‘Answers’ column, unless stated otherwise in the ‘Notes’ column.
                                                                                                                                                continued…

10.   If the candidate’s answer has the same “meaning” or can be clearly interpreted as being of equivalent significance, detail and validity as that in the
      ‘Answers’ column then award the mark. Where this point is considered to be particularly relevant in a question it is emphasized by OWTTE (or words
      to that effect).

11.   Remember that many candidates are writing in a second language. Effective communication is more important than grammatical accuracy.

12.   Occasionally, a part of a question may require an answer that is required for subsequent marking points. If an error is made in the first marking point
      then it should be penalized. However, if the incorrect answer is used correctly in subsequent marking points then follow through marks should be
      awarded. When marking, indicate this by adding ECF (error carried forward) on the script. ‘ECF acceptable’ will be displayed in the ‘Notes’ column.

13.   Do not penalize candidates for errors in units or significant figures, unless it is specifically referred to in the ‘Notes’ column.

c   maximal oxygen consumption/VO2 max represents the functional capacity of the oxygen transport Definition of VO2 max
    system and is sometimes referred to as maximal aerobic power/aerobic capacity                must refer to oxygen
    maximal oxygen uptake quantifies the maximum rate that an individual can take in and use being used as much as
    oxygen/it represents the maximum amount of oxygen a person can use to make ATP per minute an uptake of oxygen.
    it is most often expressed in milliliters per kilogram of body weight per minute/litres per minute
    ‹because oxygen and energy needs differ relative to size›
    VO2 max is more useful as an indicator of a person’s aerobic potential or upper limit than as a
    predictor of success in endurance events
    VO2 max is determined by maximal heart rate, stroke volume and AVO2/arteriovenous oxygen
    difference
    recent research suggests that genetics play a role in how much an individual can increase VO2
    max
    amongst groups of people following the same training program there will be responders and non-
    responders                                                                                                              6 max
    there can be differences in VO2 max for trained versus untrained/males versus females/young
    versus old
    it can vary for an individual depending on the mode of exercise
    variations (persons score) in VO2 max during different modes of exercise reflect the quantity of
    activated muscle mass eg there is more muscle mass activated during treadmill running compared
    to either cycling or arm ergometry
    VO2 max can be measured using tests such as treadmill test, beep test or some suitable test
    stated
    a persons score can differ depending on the quality of the test being done eg treadmill versus
    12 minute run – which is used to estimate VO2
    training improves physiological features such as capillarization, %rbc which will improve VO2
    skill level/training status/experience can increase the VO2 max values

d   exercise lowers the concentration of insulin in the blood, reducing its function in glucose transport
    exercise is a stimulus for skeletal muscle glucose uptake, ‹with the increase in muscle contraction
    being greater than that elicited by maximal insulin stimulation›
    the magnitude of exercise induced increase in muscle glucose uptake is related to both the
    intensity and duration of the exercise
    blood glucose will decrease during exercise as muscles take it in
    the delivery of glucose and insulin to contracting skeletal muscle is increased during exercise as
    a consequence of the large increase in muscle blood flow                                                                    4 max
    local factors in the muscle play the major role in glucose uptake ‹these include increased
    sarcolemmal transport of glucose and activation of the glycolytic and oxidative enzymes
    responsible for glucose metabolism›
    calcium signalling in the muscle and the mechanical stretch receptors in the lungs also increase
    glucose uptake
    the pathway for glucose into cells is different to that induced by insulin
    the effect of muscle contraction intake persists into early post ex to restore depleted stores

7   a   stretching is a useful component of a warm up before an exercise session/cool down after exercise
        stretching may be used as part of a general flexibility training programme
        to improve the range of motion at a joint/improve performance
        reduce injury risk ‹in long-term›
        static stretching is when the limb is moved slightly beyond the terminal position slowly and then maintained in
        that position ‹eg for 10–30 seconds›
        dynamic stretching involves movement based activities within a comfortable range of motion / these are active
        and simulate exercise in the muscle
        ballistic stretching involves bouncing movements to achieve the terminal range of motion ‹not recommended›
        PNF stretching involves combination sequences using relaxation and contraction of the muscles being
        stretched                                                                                                                    4 max
        recent research questions the effectiveness of static stretching as a necessary component of the warm-up
        there is little, if any, evidence that stretching pre- or post-participation prevents injury or subsequent muscle
        soreness
        research indicates that lengthening a muscle may inhibit its ability to transfer force in power events
        static stretching has also been shown to lead to a decrease in force production, power performance, running
        speed, reaction and movement time, and strength endurance
        warm up to include dynamic exercises/stretching to increase muscle temperature/loosen-up muscles and
        stimulate blood flow
        dynamic stretching does not seem to elicit the performance reduction effects of static and PNF stretching/

    the centre of gravity refers only to the vertical direction ‹of the force of gravity›
    the centre of mass is the mathematical point around which the mass of a
    body is evenly distributed
    OR
    the balancing point of the body
    the centre of mass depends on the distribution of the material in the body or
    object
    the centre of mass is a theoretical point whose location may change from
    instant to instant during a movement
    OR
    the change in position of the centre of mass results from the rapidly changing
    positions of the body segments during movement
    the centre of mass does not have to be inside the limits of the body
    the centre of mass will be affected by the density of the body or object and
    also by its shape                                                                                                                    4 max

    the body is in a reverse “C” shape with the centre of mass essentially outside
    the body
    this position allows for maximal leg drive ‹summation of force›, and leverage
    to allow the elbows to be located below the bar for the final lift above the
    head
    Fosbury Flop:
    the athlete bends their body like a banana around the bar and their centre of
    mass is below and outside the body/may be below the bar OWTTE
    the jumper using the Fosbury technique will therefore not have to raise their
    centre of mass as high as an athlete performing the scissors when clearing
    the same height
    using the Fosbury technique the jumper will be able to clear a higher bar/
    athlete will more easily clear the bar

    lift force acts perpendicular to direction of motion                                  Award [6] for an answer that explains the
    the lift only occurs if the object is spinning                                         principle using an example.
    OR
    the lift only occurs if the object is perfectly symmetrical
    lift force is produced by any break in the symmetry of the air flow about an
    object
    when a body or object is rotating while moving through the air ‹eg a spinning
    ball› the air is dragged around the rotation of the ball
    this causes an increased velocity on either the top or bottom of the ball and
    decreased velocity on the other
    the relationship between air flow velocity and air pressure is an inverse one,
    and is expressed in Bernoulli’s principle
                                                                                                                                       6 max
    a spinning ball creates areas of different pressure
    a ball will move towards the low pressure region of a rotating ball

    for example, top spin ground stroke in tennis:                                    Award [3 max] for the application.
    because the rotation of spin is in the same direction as the movement of air
    particles at the bottom of the ball, this increases velocity at the bottom of the
    ball
    causing a low pressure area at the bottom, the top of the ball is subsequently
    a high pressure area
    the horizontal drag force caused by the movement from low to high pressure
    sees the ball drop
    the aim of this form of spin is to hit the ball with pace but see it land within the
    boundary designated by the court. This is opposite to the lift force generated
    when a golf ball is struck
