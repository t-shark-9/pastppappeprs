General marking Instructions


   Assistant Examiners (AEs) will be contacted by their team leader (TL) through Scoris™, by e-mail
   or telephone – if through Scoris™ or by e-mail, please reply to confirm that you have downloaded
   the markscheme from IBIS. The purpose of this initial contact is to allow AEs to raise any queries
   they have regarding the markscheme and its interpretation. AEs should contact their team leader
   through Scoris™ or by e-mail at any time if they have any problems/queries regarding marking.
   For any queries regarding the use of Scoris™, please contact emarking@ibo.org.

1.   Follow the markscheme provided, award only whole marks and mark only in RED.

2.   Make sure that the question you are about to mark is highlighted in the mark panel on the
     right-hand side of the screen.

3.   Where a mark is awarded, a tick/check () must be placed in the text at the precise point where it
     becomes clear that the candidate deserves the mark. One tick to be shown for each mark
     awarded.

4.   Sometimes, careful consideration is required to decide whether or not to award a mark. In these
     cases use Scoris™ annotations to support your decision. You are encouraged to write comments
     where it helps clarity, especially for re-marking purposes. Use a text box for these additional
     comments. It should be remembered that the script may be returned to the candidate.

5.   Personal codes/notations are unacceptable.

6.   Where an answer to a part question is worth no marks but the candidate has attempted the
     part question, enter a zero in the mark panel on the right-hand side of the screen. Where an
     answer to a part question is worth no marks because the candidate has not attempted the part
     question, enter an “NR” in the mark panel on the right-hand side of the screen.

7.   If a candidate has attempted more than the required number of questions within a paper or section
     of a paper, mark all the answers. Scoris™ will only award the highest mark or marks in line with
     the rubric.

8.   Ensure that you have viewed every page including any additional sheets. Please ensure that you
     stamp “seen” on any page that contains no other annotation.

9.   Mark positively. Give candidates credit for what they have achieved and for what they have
     got correct, rather than penalizing them for what they have got wrong. However, a mark should not
     be awarded where there is contradiction within an answer. Make a comment to this effect using a
     text box or the “CON” stamp.

Mark allocation

Candidates are required to answer ALL questions. Total = [45].

1.    A markscheme often has more marking points than the total allows. This is intentional.

2.    Each marking point has a separate line and the end is shown by means of a semicolon (;).

3.    An alternative answer or wording is indicated in the markscheme by a slash (/). Either wording can
      be accepted.

4.    Words in brackets ( ) in the markscheme are not necessary to gain the mark.

5.    Words that are underlined are essential for the mark.

6.    The order of marking points does not have to be as in the markscheme, unless stated otherwise.

7.    If the candidate’s answer has the same “meaning” or can be clearly interpreted as being of
      equivalent significance, detail and validity as that in the markscheme then award the mark.
      Where this point is considered to be particularly relevant in a question it is emphasized by
      WTTE (or words to that effect).

8.    Remember that many candidates are writing in a second language. Effective communication is
      more important than grammatical accuracy.

9.    Occasionally, a part of a question may require an answer that is required for subsequent
      marking points. If an error is made in the first marking point then it should be penalized. However,
      if the incorrect answer is used correctly in subsequent marking points then follow through
      marks should be awarded. When marking, indicate this by adding ECF (error carried forward) on
      the script.

10.   Do not penalize candidates for errors in units or significant figures, unless it is specifically referred
      to in the markscheme.

1.   (a)   hydrocarbons/volatile organic compounds/VOCs AND nitrogen monoxide/NOx                    [1 max]
           Note to markers: To award one mark there must be a correct response from each
           group

     (b)   damages crops/forests/vegetation;
           damages fabrics/rubber materials/building materials
           irritates eyes;
           can cause breathing difficulties;
           may increase risk of infection /depresses immune system;
           increases local temperature that adds to the urban heat island /ozone is a
           greenhouse gas at ground level and contributes to warming/higher temperatures;            [2 max]
           Do not accept only ‘negative effect on health’

     (c)   (i)    sunlight activates the (photochemical) production of ozone and changes
                  over the day;
                  industrial/transport/domestic use of fossil fuels increase in daytime
                  (releasing pollutants);
                  thermal inversions undergo daily cycles;                                           [2 max]
                  Do not accept ‘change in temperature influences ozone levels’

           (ii)   high emission of air pollutants in the valley (eg, due to higher concentration
                  of industry / higher population increasing vehicle use);
                  due to the topography it is more difficult for pollutants to be dispersed by the
                  wind;
                  calm winds and cold night temperature can allow thermal inversion to occur
                  (warm layer of air traps cooler air below it);
                  thermal inversion traps the air pollutants/smog in the valley;                     [2 max]
                  Do not accept only ‘more people live in valley’, this needs to be related to
                  release of pollutants that are precursors of ozone.

2.   (a)   greater energy consumption for domestic activities for example, use of electrical
           devices (such as televisions, computers, air conditioning systems etc) in
           North America;
           greater energy consumption for industry in North America;
           use of more energy for transport of food/goods in North America;
           greater use of energy for heating in cold winters in parts of North America;
           greater individual travel in North America;                                            [2 max]
           Do not accept only ‘more technologically advanced’ unless it is linked to an
           increase in energy use.
           Accept responses in the converse.
           Accept other reasonable responses.

     (b)   different agricultural systems used for food production may require different
           amounts of land/water (eg, some crops require less water than others);
           differences in dietary preferences will require different amounts of land/water for
           production (eg, meat based diet has a higher ecological footprint than a
           vegetarian diet);
           different climatic conditions may have very different efficiency for food production
           requiring different areas of land;
           urbanization may be very different taking up different percentage/quantity of
           available land;
           water consumption will increase ecological footprint and may be different;
           rate of pollution/waste production requiring assimilation by the environment may
           vary greatly between countries;
           some sources of energy (eg, geothermal) may have a lower ecological footprint
           than others (eg, fossil fuels);
           by importing goods manufactured in another country, the importing country would
           not increase their own footprint (the impact will occur in the country of production
           where energy is used and waste produced);                                              [3 max]

     (c)   development of new/cheaper/more efficient technologies for renewable energy;
           pressure from environmental organizations/lobbyists/environmental movements/
           green politics;
           effective/powerful international agreements/legislation;
           depleted reserves of fossil fuels /increase prices on fossil fuels;
           increased awareness of detrimental impacts of fossil fuels;
           increasing concern for energy security;                                                [2 max]

(e)   in 1971 radioactive substances were not in demand and therefore had little value
      (eg Uranium once had little use and therefore had low value as a resource);
      by 2010 the development of nuclear technology, increased demand and led to an
      increase in value / by 2010 we became aware of global warming/pollution effects
      of fossil fuel, nuclear energy became more significant and with increase in
      demand there was an increase in value of uranium;
      for 2030 the projected decline in use of nuclear power is a consequence of an
      increase in concern over accidents/safety of radioactive materials and will be
      reflected in a decline in value of uranium;                                          [3 max]
      Accept other reasonable answers for each period.

3.   (a)   biomass is reduced along a food chain due to energy loss;
           energy is lost in respiration/heat/entropy/movement/metabolism/excretion;
           not all biomass is passed on to next trophic level because not all food/prey is
           discovered/captured/eaten/edible;
           some eaten material is not absorbed/is lost through defecation;                       [2 max]
           Do not accept only ‘10% rule/ 10% of energy is passed onto next level/ 90% of
           energy is lost from one trophic level to the next’. It must be related to loss of
           biomass.

     (b)   Sampling: Use random /stratified sampling using quadrats to determine total
           number of producers in community / extract all producers from a known area of
           community;
           Dehydrating: Dry/dehydrate a sample of individuals / of all producers taken from a
           known area to find dry weight/organic mass / find dry weight of producer from
           database;
           Extrapolating: Multiply the average dry weight of individuals/sample by the
           estimated number of producers/community area;                                         [3 max]

     (c)   in early stages of succession the conditions for photosynthesis/plant life/primary
           productivity are very limiting so primary productivity is low;
           …and there are no consumers/insufficient food for consumers so secondary
           productivity is low/zero;
           succession leads to improvement in physical limiting factors so primary
           productivity increases;
           with more food available, secondary productivity (from consumers) increases;
           in later stages, succession leads to establishment of K strategists so the gross
           primary productivity is high;
           …but because of large size/storage/respiratory losses, net primary productivity is
           low;
           the increased food supply will lead to high gross secondary productivity;
           …but the long food chains lead to more respiratory loss/inefficient transfer so low
           net secondary productivity;                                                           [4 max]

           increase in price of ivory;
           trade driven underground due to ivory ban;
           lack of alternative income/food due to effects of drought/civil war;
           lack of wildlife protection due to limited funds/civil war;
           population growth increasing contact and conflict between humans and elephants
           (eg, crop raiding/destruction of property by elephant leading to elephant culls);        [1 max]

     (e)   Agreement with statement:
           they are only one amongst many species;
           loss of species is part of natural evolution (eg, dinosaurs/dodo);
           ecosystem will adapt to the loss of species/elephants;
           elephants/large species can be a threat/kill humans/raid farms/grain stores;
           Do not accept ‘other species are not dependent on elephants for food’.

           Disagreement with statement:
           elephants/every species has right to live (biorights);
           they have an intrinsic/aesthetic value;
           they may be a keystone species/other species may be dependent on
           them/required to maintain stability;
           loss of elephants/large species will result in loss of biodiversity (species/genetic);
           humans have a moral duty to conserve species;                                            [3 max]

           Award marks for justification, not the viewpoint in isolation.
           Credit should only be given for reasons supporting one viewpoint.

     (c)   loss of tree root system to hold soil particles together leading to soil erosion;
           loss of trees that reduced wind velocity and prevented top soil being blown away;
           loss of tree canopy that intercepts rainfall and reduces its impact on the soil and
           reduces soil erosion;
           loss of vegetation increases surface runoff/potential risk of floods and increases
           soil erosion;
           loss of forest (and ecosystem) leads to loss of organic matter;
           deforestation leads to reduced recycling of nutrients;
           alternative use of land eg, intensive/unsustainable agriculture/overgrazing may
