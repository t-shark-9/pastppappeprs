Each word is assigned 0 or 1 or 2 points. Those worth 1 or 2 points indicate this value immediately
following the word, while those with zero points have no numerical indication.

A one point word (for example an adverb or conjunction) needs only a correct translation to be awarded
the point. For a two point word, if the translation persuades you that the candidate understands the
meaning of the word, one point is awarded; if the candidate persuades you that the grammar of the word
is understood, the second point is awarded.

When two or three words are joined by “_” they are to be treated as one word or two words. A two word
phrase worth two points includes one point for vocabulary and one point for grammar. The vocabulary
point is awarded only if both words are translated correctly in context; a vocabulary error in either or both
words results in no points for vocabulary. The grammar point is awarded only if the phrase’s grammar is
understood correctly. In the case of a three word phrase award two points if the translation is perfect,
one if there is one error.

The maximum number of points is [105].
