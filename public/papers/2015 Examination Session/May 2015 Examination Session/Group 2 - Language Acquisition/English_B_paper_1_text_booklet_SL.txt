          The Types of Handshakes… You Better Grab The Right One!
          by Sam Diener on August 20, 2009



         I did not learn how to shake hands properly
         until I was 23. That’s four years of high
         school, four years of college, and nearly a
         year in the work world. In fact, I probably
 5       spoiled thousands of first impressions before
         finally someone was generous enough to
         say, “Hey Sam, you are an idiot.” Well, not
         an “idiot”, but you get the point.

         There are different types of handshakes: they
10       all mean something different. Just in case
         you didn’t know this, your bad handshake will cost you: the interview, the contact,
         your job, or any other situation where you meet people for the first time. You are your
         handshake. A handshake that gives the wrong information is an awful message to send to
         someone when you first meet. Don’t let your hand seem like a dead fish. Don’t crush the
15       other’s bones, either.

         Okay, here are a few rules:

           1.    Handshakes last at the longest for one second.

           2.    Always, always shake with your right hand. If you use your left hand, this might seem
                 rude to some people. As a follow up to this, if you have a nametag, it always goes on
20               your right side so it is in perfect view of the other person when they shake your hand.

           3.    Do not cover the other person’s hand or use two hands in your shake. That can
                 sometimes be seen as aggressive, or too personal.

           4.    Avoid being in the dominant position when you shake hands. The dominant person in
                 the handshake comes over the top and takes the upper position (think palm down) in
25               the shake. You don’t want to seem as if you were pushing yourself on the other person.

           5.    The business handshake has the palm perpendicular to the floor. However, your initial
                 handshake as a job-seeker or in presenting yourself to any authority should be with
                 an open palm presented face up at a 45 degree angle, at which point you accept their
                 hand. This gives the perception that you are open and interested in what the person
30               has to say.

                                           Interview with Sir David
                                           Attenborough


         After another summer of intermittent but intense heat waves
         across Europe, the challenge of combating climate change is
         a concern that is becoming more and more urgent.
         Sir David Attenborough, the distinguished natural history
 5       programme-maker and WWF* ambassador, is now convinced
         that this is perilous and all too real. He explains why to WWF’s
         Peter Denton.

         Nearly 30 years ago, Sir David declared that mankind had
         unprecedented control over the world. What happened
10       next was climate change – a global phenomenon.
         “That’s so,” agrees Sir David. “We’re going to find irreversible,
         more extreme weather changes. It’s not just rainfall – there’ll
         be more violent rain storms, and heat waves will be more
         severe.”

15       One long-term result of this will be modification of vegetation and land, which itself
         will bring about a new distribution of wildlife. Some species, says Sir David, will lose out
         completely.

         “Arctic animals will have nowhere to go,” warns Sir David. “There doesn’t seem much
         doubt that unless something happens, we will go on losing ice, and polar bears will
20       find it increasingly hard to hunt. They are certainly on the list of the highly endangered
         animals; for the first time not because of man’s destruction, not because of his hunting,
         but because their basic living conditions have changed and disappeared.”

         Sir David wonders: “The issue is, how great are the variations we are seeing and have
         seen over the past few years? Are they within the bounds of normal variation that
25       Europe has experienced over the past thousand years, or are they in excess of that?
         The only way you can answer that sensibly and responsibly is to get the evidence.”

         WWF’s view
         So is climate change as serious a problem as WWF says it is? “Yes, I would have thought
         probably in excess of that. I think that there are very great dangers.”

30       “The trouble is,” Sir David warns, “we’re piling damage upon damage. A carbon
         dioxide molecule will survive in the atmosphere for a century or more. So all we can do
         is reduce the rate at which we’re adding to it to try and slow things down.”
                                                –5–                M15/2/ABENG/SP1/ENG/TZ0/XX/T


      “We’ll never reverse the damage caused by climate change”, Sir David says, “but if we
      consider it seriously and learn to lessen its effects, the catastrophe foreseen by some
35    can be avoided. In the end, it’s down to us.”

             Are you a bystander
             to cyberbullying?


         [–X–]
         You’ve probably heard the word “bystander” used to describe those who witness physical bullying and
         do nothing, but did you know that it’s possible to be a bystander to cyberbullying, too? “Cyberbullying”
         means using any kind of technology to threaten, hurt, or humiliate others.

         Whenever you read an abusive comment posted on someone’s timeline, look at embarrassing photos of
 5       someone, or follow a link to online content that is designed to abuse or embarrass someone, you are a
         bystander. Bystanders to cyberbullying can play a huge role in putting a stop to this abuse.

         [ – 39 – ]
         • Part of what motivates cyberbullies is the belief that others approve of what they are doing. Speaking
            out against what’s happening can take away the motivation to keep doing it.
         • If you step in, other people are more likely to step in too. Most young people are just waiting for
10          someone to take the first step.
         • Young people are more likely to convince each other to stop bullying than adults are. You can have a
            bigger impact on cyberbullying than your teachers or parents.

         [ – 40 – ]
         • If you see cyberbullying on Facebook, you can report it as abusive.
         • If you know the person who is cyberbullying, you can message them to let them know that you
15          are upset by what they are doing, and ask them to stop.
         • If it’s safe to do so, you can take a stand by commenting on a post, for example: “I’m going to unfollow
            this thread because I think it’s hurtful. I encourage others to do the same.”

         [ – 41 – ]
         As a bystander, you can help by being a friend to the person who has been targeted. You can also
         encourage them to call Kids Help Phone to speak to a counsellor. Don’t worry, callers are always
20       anonymous and it’s always confidential.
         Kids Help Phone number: 1-800-668-6868.
