                                               Section A

Complete one of the following tasks. Write 250 to 400 words.

1.   Cultural diversity

     You watched a film in which the main characters did not have a common language but still
     managed to work collaboratively.  Write an article for your school magazine describing how
     the characters communicated with each other and reflecting on how necessary it is to share a
     language.


2.   Customs and traditions

     To celebrate different traditions, your town council is holding a costume party in which all those
     who attend must wear traditional costumes.  Write an email to a friend describing what your chosen
     costume is and why you have chosen it.  


3.   Health

     Young people in your town are increasingly too reliant on dietary supplements (such as energy
     boosters, bodybuilding supplements or weight loss supplements).  To raise awareness about the
     issue, your principal asked you to give a talk to your schoolmates in which you discuss the severity
     of the issue and suggest how it can be overcome.


4.   Leisure

     Your school board plans to introduce an alternative educational programme that emphasizes
     learning through entertainment and would like to incorporate students’ suggestions into the new
     programme.  Write a proposal in which you explain what your suggestions for the new programme
     are and how students will benefit from them.


5.   Science and technology

     You recently read an article in which the author claimed that natural sciences (such as chemistry,
     biology or physics) are not as beneficial as social sciences (such as economics or history) in the
     21st century.  Write a blog entry in which you discuss the claim and give reasons for your opinion.    
                                                  –3–                   M15/2/ABENG/HP2/ENG/TZ0/XX

                                              Section B

Based on the following stimulus, give a personal response and justify it.  Choose any text type that you
have studied in class.  Write 150 to 250 words.

6.   Some people believe that happiness lies in being accepted by those around us while others insist
     that happiness is achieved only when we learn to accept ourselves.
