Answer one question. Refer closely to the novel you have selected to study, a clean copy of which may
be brought into the examination.

1.   Select a passage from a novel you have chosen to study where the appearance of a character
     in a specific setting raises unsettling questions for the reader. Outline how you would stage this
     appearance and setting for an audience, paying particular attention to elements of intrigue
     and/or surprise.


2.   Select a passage from a novel you have chosen to study where an important character makes
     a speech of pivotal importance to the narrative. How would you stage this speech so that its
     importance is underlined for an audience?


3.   Select a passage from a novel you have chosen to study which deals with despair and euphoria.
     How might staging, design and acting combine to register one of these experiences for an
     audience?
