Text 1

The text is an extract from an opinion article in a UK newspaper deploring attitudes to learning foreign
languages in Britain.

An adequate to good analysis will:

• show understanding of the text type
• identify the specific UK problem that has prompted the opinion article
• recognize that the writer is highly critical and identify some of the things he is angry or critical about.
• identify the potential audience as well as who the writer’s criticisms are directed at
• comment on the diction and the style of the article (eg, tone, use of colloquial expressions, emphatic
  language, rhetorical questions, enumeration, statistics)
• comment on the illustration and on parallels to be made between it and the text
• recognize the shifts in point of view (notably pronouns)
• identify some ways in which the writer entertains the reader.


A good to excellent analysis may also:

• analyse more fully the writer’s criticisms, possibly noting his enthusiasm for language learning and his
  aversion to utilitarianism, materialism or trust in market forces
• comment more extensively on the contexts to which the writer refers (including the general or
  international contexts in addition to the British) and the potential audiences he is reaching
• comment more extensively on the rhetorical features of the piece, including, for example, discussion
  of the cautionary as well as of the critical aspects of the writer’s discourse
• comment more extensively on the effects of the shifts in point of view.
• discuss some of the images in the text (such as “our cage” or being “encased in one language”)
  together with a more detailed interpretation of the illustration
• comment further on the subtleties of the writer’s humour (eg, irony).

Text 2

The text is part of a letter written by a soldier in World War I to his wife describing the events he took part
in before and after entering the town of Ypres in 1915.

An adequate to good analysis will:

• identify the situation the letter-writer is in and his possible purpose in writing to the primary addressee
• enumerate some of the things that readers past or present learn about the situation from the
  letter-writer’s news and describe some of the effects, or possible effects, on them
• make some comments about stylistic features that may include the letter-writer’s choice of diction or
  imagery
• notice the letter-writer’s use of pronouns
• notice the contrast between the cheerful tone of the letter-writer and the gravity of his situation and
  give some examples
• possibly comment on such details as the address and dateline, the way the letter-writer signs off, or
  on the title of the work in which his letter was published.


A good to excellent analysis may also:

• notice that this first-hand account of conditions on the battlefield would also have been of interest to a
  reader in 1917, when it was published, perhaps even to a reader today
• identify the letter-writer more specifically, making inferences about his background, class or rank
• comment on the effects of pronoun shifts in the letter
• explore more fully the interest for readers of this letter as well as the possible effects on them
• notice particularly what the reader learns about the logistical and organizational uncertainties of the
  soldier’s life at the front and perhaps comment on the critical nature of his remarks
• comment more fully on the narrative voice of the letter-writer, such as changes in tone or diction,
  including examples of the use of humour or irony
• analyse more fully the stylistic features of the letter, drawing attention perhaps to the cinematographic
  quality of some of his account
• comment on the effects on readers of such details as the address and dateline, the way the letter-
  writer signs off, or the title of the work in which his letter was published.
