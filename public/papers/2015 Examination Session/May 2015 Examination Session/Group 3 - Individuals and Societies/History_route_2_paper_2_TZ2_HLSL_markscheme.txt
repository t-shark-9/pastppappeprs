Paper 2 markbands: The following bands provide a précis of the full markbands for paper 2 published in
the History guide (2008) on pages 71–74. They are intended to assist marking but must be used in
conjunction with the full markbands found in the guide. For the attention of all examiners: if you are
uncertain about the content/accuracy of a candidate’s work please contact your team leader.

  16–20: Answers are clearly structured and focused, have full awareness of the demands of the
         question, and, if appropriate, may challenge it. Detailed specific knowledge is used as
         evidence to support assertions and arguments. Historical processes such as comparison
         and contrast, placing events in context and evaluating different interpretations are used
         appropriately and effectively.
  13–15: Answers are clearly focused on the demands of the question. Specific knowledge is applied
         as evidence, and analysis or critical commentary are used appropriately to produce a specific
         argument. Events are placed in context and there is sound understanding of historical
         processes and comparison and contrast. Evaluation of different approaches may be used to
         substantiate arguments presented.
  10–12: Answers indicate that the question is understood but not all implications considered.
         Knowledge is largely accurate. Critical commentary may be present. Events are generally
         placed in context and understanding of historical processes, such as comparison and
         contrast are present. There may be awareness of different approaches and interpretations
         but they are not based on relevant historical knowledge. There is a clear attempt at a
         structured approach.
  8–9:   The demands of the question are generally understood. Historical knowledge is present but
         is not fully or accurately detailed. Knowledge is narrative or descriptive in nature. There may
         be limited argument that requires further substantiation. Critical commentary may be
         present. There is an attempt to place events in historical context and show an understanding
         of historical processes. An attempt at a structured approach, either chronological or thematic
         has been made.
  6–7:   Answers indicate some understanding of the question but historical knowledge is limited in
         quality and quantity. Historical context may be present as will understanding of historical
         processes but underdeveloped. The question is only partially addressed.
  4–5:     There is little understanding of the question. Historical details are present but are mainly
           inaccurate and/or of marginal relevance. Historical context or processes are barely
           understood and there is minimal focus on the task.
  1–3:     Answers do not meet the demands of the question and show little or no evidence of
           appropriate structure. There are no more than vague, unsupported assertions.
  0:       Answers not meeting the requirements of descriptors should be awarded no marks.

  Examiners and moderators are reminded of the need to apply the markbands that provide the
  “best fit” to the responses given by candidates and to award credit wherever it is possible to
  do so. If an answer indicates that the demands of the question are understood and addressed but
  that not all implications are considered (eg, compare or contrast; reasons or significance;
  methods or success), then examiners should not be afraid of using the full range of marks allowed
  for by the markscheme: ie, responses that offer good coverage of some of the criteria should be
  rewarded accordingly.

Topic 1    Causes, practices and effects of wars

1.   To what extent is the term “limited war” applicable to 20th century conflicts?

     Candidates should demonstrate a clear understanding of the requirements of the question and
     effectively deploy knowledge of the key issue raised by the question. As such, they will need to
     consider the merits of applying the term “limited war” to 20th century conflicts and assess these
     against any potential weaknesses.

     Candidates should show understanding of the term “limited war”, for example: the limited aims of
     the parties involved; limited mobilization of the economy (including no recourse to conscription);
     restricted use of weaponry (for example not using nuclear weapons); limited impact on civilian
     populations.

     The Cold War as a whole should not be used as an example. However, proxy wars which took
     place within the context of the Cold War could be argued to be limited wars; for example US
     support for Afghan resistance to the Soviet invasion of 1979.

     While many conflicts in the 20th century were clearly not limited wars, others are more debatable.
     For example, the Korean War was limited in that nuclear weapons were not deployed. However,
     the degree of destruction wrought on Korean society could make the argument that it was not just
     a limited war. Examiners should accept any valid examples (which could include civil wars;
     however clear links should be made to the question when using these as examples).

     The above material is an indication of what candidates may elect to write about in their responses.
     However, it is not exhaustive and no set answer is required.

     Examiners and moderators are reminded of the need to apply the markbands that provide the
     “best fit” to the responses given by candidates and to award credit wherever it is possible to
     do so.

2.   Evaluate the role of technology in prolonging the First World War.

     Candidates should demonstrate a clear understanding of the requirements of the question and
     effectively deploy knowledge of the key issue raised by the question; in this case, the impact of
     technology during the First World War and the extent to which various developments prolonged
     that war.

     Candidates’ analyses may incorporate the impact of various technologies, for example machine
     guns, pill boxes, hand grenades, poison gas, barbed wire, long range artillery, early tanks and
     aircraft, long range naval gunnery and submarines. However, the impact of these technologies
     must be examined in terms of their role in prolonging (or otherwise) the First World War.

     Of relevance could be the “assembly line” production methods that allowed factories to produce
     seemingly endless quantities of armaments. This, perhaps, more than the nature of the arms was
     what allowed the fighting to continue. Another approach may be that technological advances in
     weaponry were often met, almost immediately, by counter-measures such as gas and gas masks;
     machine guns and tanks and so preventing any one technological advance from making a decisive
     difference that would have ended the war earlier.

     The above material is an indication of what candidates may elect to write about in their responses.
     However, it is not exhaustive and no set answer is required.

     Examiners and moderators are reminded of the need to apply the markbands that provide the
     “best fit” to the responses given by candidates and to award credit wherever it is possible to
     do so.


3.   Examine the impact of resistance movements on the outcome of any one war.

     Candidates should demonstrate a clear understanding of the requirements of the question and
     effectively deploy knowledge of the key issue raised by the question; therefore, the focus must be
     on resistance movements and these need to be addressed in terms of their impact on the outcome
     of the chosen war. A resistance movement can be considered to be any movement fighting against
     an established government or occupying power in a war. For balance, other factors should be
     addressed, including: economic strength; conventional military actions. However these should be
     used as comparative factors and the focus of the assessment should remain on the impact of
     resistance movements.

     The Second World War is likely to be a popular choice and this could give candidates an
     opportunity to use knowledge gained of their own country’s history; for example in Eastern Europe,
     Russia and the countries of the former Soviet Union or even the Far East. However, accept any
     valid choice and expect detailed historical knowledge rather than unsupported assertions.

     The above material is an indication of what candidates may elect to write about in their responses.
     However, it is not exhaustive and no set answer is required.

     Examiners and moderators are reminded of the need to apply the markbands that provide the
     “best fit” to the responses given by candidates and to award credit wherever it is possible to
     do so.

4.   Compare and contrast the role of foreign intervention in the Nigerian Civil War (1967–1970) and
     the Nicaraguan Revolution (1976–1979).

     Candidates should demonstrate a clear understanding of the requirements of the question and
     effectively deploy knowledge of the key issue raised by the question. In this case, there should be
     an ongoing analysis of the similarities and differences in the role of foreign intervention in the
     named countries.

     Areas of comparison:
     In Nigeria, France sold arms to Biafra and Portugal permitted both Guinea-Bissau and Sao Tome
     to act as staging posts for supplies to Biafra. Meanwhile, the Nigerian government under Yakubu
     Gowon bought arms from the USSR and maintained good relations with the US and the UK.
     African states were against support for Biafra as they were unwilling to set the precedent of
     allowing such a secession. Both sides in the conflict used foreign mercenaries.

     In Nicaragua, uncertain US support for Somoza under Carter was replaced by strong support for
     the anti-Sandinista rebels, the Contras, under Reagan (in spite of the Boland Amendment of 1983).
     On the other side, Cuba assisted the Sandinista National Liberation Front (FSLN) before and after
     it took power.

     Areas of contrast:
     Economic interests were arguably of greater importance in the Nigerian case where the oil fields of
     the East were of great international interest. In Nicaragua, foreign intervention was motivated by
     ideology and the Cold War context of Latin America.

     Other factors that had an impact on the conflicts could include: military strength; economic
     resources; popular support.

     The above material is an indication of what candidates may elect to write about in their responses.
     However, it is not exhaustive and no set answer is required.

     Examiners and moderators are reminded of the need to apply the markbands that provide the
     “best fit” to the responses given by candidates and to award credit wherever it is possible to
     do so.

5.   With reference to either the Spanish Civil War (1936–1939) or one of the Chinese Civil Wars
     (1927–1937 or 1946–1949), to what extent was ideology the major cause of conflict?

     Candidates should demonstrate a clear understanding of the requirements of the question and
     effectively deploy knowledge of the key issue raised by the question. They should focus on the
     issue of ideology as a cause of their chosen conflict and critically assess the strengths and
     weaknesses of arguing this to be the major factor.

     In favour of the statement:
     In all three cases, arguments which agree with the quotation should be relatively straightforward to
     produce. It is easy to argue that Spain was ideologically polarized in the years leading up to the
     outbreak of the Civil War in 1936. For both Chinese Civil Wars, the Chinese Communist Party
     (CCP) and the Guomindang, GMD (Kuomintang, KMT) had strong ideological differences over
     China’s future development.

     Against the statement:
     For Spain, there were many deeply rooted social divisions that arguably had limited links to
     ideology; for example between Church and anti-clericals or between Catalonia/Basque country and
     central government authority. In China between 1927 and 1937, it could be argued that warlords
     played a significant role and many of them had limited ideological motivations for their actions with
     regionalism and the acquisition of power being more important. Finally, in China between 1946
     and 1949, one could maintain that it was the vacuum of power left by the defeat and withdrawal of
     Japan that precipitated the conflict.

     The above material is an indication of what candidates may elect to write about in their responses.
     However, it is not exhaustive and no set answer is required.

     Examiners and moderators are reminded of the need to apply the markbands that provide the
     “best fit” to the responses given by candidates and to award credit wherever it is possible to
     do so.


6.   Examine the social impact of the Second World War in any one country.

     Candidates should demonstrate a clear understanding of the requirements of the question and
     effectively deploy knowledge of the key issue raised by the question. In this case, there needs to
     be a specific and detailed analysis of the social impact of the Second World War on one country.
     Other factors may, briefly, be considered in terms of comparisons; however emphasis must remain
     on social factors.

     The issues related to social impact may include: changes to the role of women (for example their
     entry into the labour force); reduction of class divisions; the growth of refugee populations; the
     increase of restrictions on civil liberties; the negative effect on minorities (either religious or ethnic).
     Popular countries could include the US, China, Japan, the UK, France, Germany, the Soviet Union
     or Poland but accept any valid examples. Candidates have the opportunity here to use knowledge
     of their own national histories. Responses should provide relevant, specific historical detail and not
     just generalities or unsupported assertions.

     The above material is an indication of what candidates may elect to write about in their responses.
     However, it is not exhaustive and no set answer is required.

Topic 2    Democratic states — challenges and responses

7.   To what extent did the constitution of Weimar Germany have more strengths than weaknesses?

     Candidates should demonstrate a clear understanding of the requirements of the question and
     effectively deploy knowledge of the key issue raised by the question. As such, there should be a
     focused and detailed discussion of the strengths and weaknesses of the Weimar constitution with
     an assessment of their overall significance.

     In their responses, candidates may challenge the commonly-held view that the constitution was an
     unqualified weakness in Weimar Germany, and will need to demonstrate detailed knowledge of
     both the constitution and its impact.

     Strengths
     These may include: universal adult suffrage; that it was truly democratic; the rights of freedom of
     speech, assembly and habeas corpus were established; Article 48 was essential to enable
     decisive government in the face of crisis, as shown in 1923 to 1924; the strong showing by
     pro-Weimar parties the in early years; the survival of potentially fatal threats between 1919 and
     1923. Further, proportional representation facilitated the representation of a broad range of
     opinion.

     Weaknesses
     These may include: an ultra-democratic version of proportional representation led to a profusion of
     parties making majority government difficult; for a country used to authoritarian rule it was perhaps
     too rapid a change towards full democracy given German history before 1918; Article 48 was open
     to misuse.

     The above material is an indication of what candidates may elect to write about in their responses.
     However, it is not exhaustive and no set answer is required.

     Examiners and moderators are reminded of the need to apply the markbands that provide the
     “best fit” to the responses given by candidates and to award credit wherever it is possible to
     do so.

8.   To what extent were social and economic challenges met in either India (1947–1964) or Canada
     (1968–1984)?

     Candidates should demonstrate a clear understanding of the requirements of the question and
     effectively deploy knowledge of the key issues raised by the question. They will need to identify
     the social and economic challenges faced by their chosen country, assess how the government
     attempted to deal with these and then consider the extent to which the challenges were
     successfully dealt with.

     India (1947–64)
     Nehru’s government was guided by a concern for the poor, self-reliance and a distrust of western
     investment. A relevant social aspect where his government did not meet the challenge was on
     gender issues. Candidates may comment upon the development of infrastructure with state
     monopolies established in railways, atomic energy and defence manufacturing and government
     regulation of coal, steel, shipbuilding and communications.

     In 1950 the State Planning Commission established a series of five year plans starting in 1952.
     However, there was a poor growth rate compared to other developing countries in Asia and a
     declining agricultural sector. The lack of foreign investment arguably hindered growth. The
     Industries (Development and Regulation) Act 1951 resulted in the dominance of the bureaucracy
     over the economy.

     Nevertheless there was some progress such as steel mills, dams and Institutes of Technology.

     Candidates may also comment on affirmative action on behalf of the lower castes, and on Nehru’s
     huge achievement in building a cohesive secular state.

     Canada (1968–84)
     Major challenges were: rising unemployment; stagflation in the late 1970s; economic crisis in the
     early 1980s; migration to the cities; regional variations in economic performance; rising costs of
     welfare and medicare; the problems facing the First Nation peoples and the Inuit. 1968 to 1984
     was dominated by Pierre Trudeau and the actions of his government included: further expansion
     of welfare provision; partial devolution of power to the First Nation peoples, but no progress for the
     Inuit; decriminalization of homosexuality; in the late 1970s, reduced spending on education and
     health; the failed National Energy Policy.

9.    Compare and contrast policies promoting either employment or social welfare in two democratic
      states.

      Candidates should demonstrate a clear understanding of the requirements of the question and
      effectively deploy knowledge of the key issue raised by the question. For this question, this entails
      an ongoing analysis of the similarities and differences of the chosen factor in any two applicable
      states. Responses should provide relevant, specific historical detail and not just generalities.

      Employment
      Measures taken might include: government support to struggling industries; protective tariffs;
      provision of training and education to the unemployed; attempts to create demand in the economy
      through schemes of public works or other types of government spending (governments may have
      cut interest rates or taxes).

      Social welfare
      Welfare systems provided assistance, in the form of monetary payments (such as pensions or
      benefit payments), vouchers or housing assistance. Provision may have been made for the
      unemployed, the poor, the elderly, the disabled, those with dependants (usually children), and the
      sick. Candidates may analyse how welfare systems were financed (perhaps through an insurance
      system or general taxation), how generous they were, and how extensively they catered for the
      disadvantaged.

      The above material is an indication of what candidates may elect to write about in their responses.
      However, it is not exhaustive and no set answer is required.

      Examiners and moderators are reminded of the need to apply the markbands that provide the
      “best fit” to the responses given by candidates and to award credit wherever it is possible to
      do so.


10.   Evaluate the success of education polices in two democratic states, each chosen from a different
      region.

      Candidates should demonstrate a clear understanding of the requirements of the question and
      effectively deploy knowledge of the key issues raised by the question. There will need to be a
      detailed appraisal of the extent of successes of the named factors in any two applicable countries.

      Although examples will vary according to the countries chosen, a detailed analysis of various
      factors is expected and these could include: impact on literacy rates; access to primary, secondary
      and tertiary education; the use of selective or comprehensive systems; levels of educational
      achievement; range of provision; technical, vocational and “academic” education; the issue of
      whether or not there was equal access for boys and girls; and if there was equal access to pupils
      from different racial or ethnic groups.

      The above material is an indication of what candidates may elect to write about in their responses.
      However, it is not exhaustive and no set answer is required.

11.   To what extent was the successful establishment of democracy in South Africa matched by social
      and economic change?

      Candidates should demonstrate a clear understanding of the requirements of the question and
      effectively deploy knowledge of the key issue raised by the question; that is the extent to which
      social and economic change in South Africa kept up with the establishment of democracy in the
      country. Both factors mentioned in the question should be analysed and a conclusion should be
      reached.

      When discussing social and economic policies, candidates may analyse the ambitious plans of the
      Reconstruction and Development Programme (RDP) including health care, land redistribution,
      house-building, and electrification. RDP was wound up in 1996, but candidates may assess the
      degree to which plans were achieved as the government adopted relatively conservative economic
      policies. Comment may be made on the slow pace of land reform despite the removal of
      restrictions on Black ownership, the desegregation of education (though questions remained about
      the level of progress made in the townships), the success of electrification, the volatility of the
      economy (in the 1998 crisis the government adopted strict monetary policies to control inflation; the
      price of gold fell but the crisis was short-lived and revival came quickly in 1999), and the thriving
      tourism, wine, fruit and armaments industries. However, by 2000 there were still questions on
      whether or not there had been sufficient economic growth to satisfy the many demands for
      improved social provision.

      Some candidates may challenge the assumption that democracy was successfully established and
      this should be credited.

      The above material is an indication of what candidates may elect to write about in their responses.
      However, it is not exhaustive and no set answer is required.

      Examiners and moderators are reminded of the need to apply the markbands that provide the
      “best fit” to the responses given by candidates and to award credit wherever it is possible to
      do so.


12.   Examine the impact of powerful pressure groups on democratic states.

      Candidates should demonstrate a clear understanding of the requirements of the question and
      effectively deploy knowledge of the key issue raised by the question. They will need to consider
      the positive and negative effects of powerful pressure groups and present a conclusion that is
      balanced and that draws upon detailed knowledge of named groups and their role in and
      relationship with a specific state or specific states.

      Candidates may analyse the activities of well-known pressure groups such as the feminist and
      peace movements of the 1960s, campaigns against nuclear disarmament or in favour of human
      rights, but there are plenty of other examples. The evaluation of impact should include a
      judgment as to whether such groups have been able to affect government policies and legislation.
      Candidates may consider whether powerful pressure groups have more influence than political
      parties or indeed whether they can shape the policies of political parties.

Topic 3     Origins and development of authoritarian and single-party states

13.   Examine the political conditions that led to the rise of two authoritarian/single-party leaders.

      Candidates should demonstrate a clear understanding of the requirements of the question and
      effectively deploy knowledge of the key issue raised by the question. There could be an ongoing
      analysis of the similarities and differences in the political conditions that led to the rise of two
      authoritarian or single-party leaders. Narrative accounts with tagged-on conclusions are not as
      effective as responses that adopt a thematic approach.

      Detailed knowledge and understanding of political conditions, and relevant links the rise of the
      chosen rulers is required and the political conditions that may be discussed could include: the
      unpopularity of previous regimes because of corruption; repression; a lack of civil liberties;
      constitutional deficiencies; divided opposition; the lack of political stability in government; the weak
      leadership of previous regimes; political threats to existing regimes, for example fear of revolution.

14.   With reference to two authoritarian/single-party leaders, each chosen from a different region,
      to what extent was complete totalitarian rule difficult to achieve?

      Candidates should demonstrate a clear understanding of the requirements of the question and
      effectively deploy knowledge of the key issue raised by the question. In this case, there should be
      a critical analysis of the merits (or otherwise) of the statement in terms of the chosen exemplars.
      Detailed knowledge of the chosen rulers/leaders is expected. The focus of the answers should be
      on the leaders’ time once in power.

      There will need to be at least implicit understanding of “totalitarianism”, and answers will need to
      provide a focused critique of the level of totalitarianism in their chosen states. In doing this,
      candidates may evaluate the effectiveness of the methods used to establish totalitarian rule by
      addressing the following: did the ruler hold ultimate constitutional power? Was there a unified body
      of secondary leadership in support of the ultimate leader? Was there any sort of representative
      assembly? Did the ruler have authority over the armed forces? Were there any rival political
      parties or independent trade unions? How effective were the security forces? Was there any
      opposition? Was there an independent judiciary? Was there any criticism from religious leaders?
      Was the Church controlled or attacked? Did the ruler have control over the economy? Did any
      freedom of expression survive?

      The above material is an indication of what candidates may elect to write about in their responses.
      However, it is not exhaustive and no set answer is required.

15.   “The nature and extent of opposition to Peron between 1946 and 1955 did not justify the measures
      he took against it.” To what extent do you agree with this statement?

      Candidates should demonstrate a clear understanding of the requirements of the question and
      effectively deploy knowledge of the key issues raised by the question. There should, therefore,
      be a detailed and well-supported analysis of the nature and extent of opposition to Juan Peron
      alongside a well-substantiated critique of the measures he employed to deal with it.

      Until the last months of his rule Peron seemed in almost full command; Congress was dominated
      by his supporters while the opposition was fragmented and ineffective. The Supreme Court was
      also taken under Peronist control. Opponents were systematically denied the right to free
      expression; they found it almost impossible to stage meetings and demonstrations and the press,
      which had been sympathetic to the opposition, and radio were taken under government control.
      The Law of Disrespect was strengthened to silence opponents, many of whom fled into exile.
      Pro-government mob violence was used against the offices of the newspaper La Prensa and there
      were attacks on the Casa del Pueblo, Casa Radical and Jockey Club immediately after Eva
      Peron’s death.

      Candidates may comment on the harsh treatment of the socialist politician Cipriano Reyes, who
      was tortured and imprisoned. The Labour Party was denied a license to fight elections.

      Peron confronted the academic and intellectual community: 1500 university lecturers were fired,
      including the novelist Jorge Luis Borges. While relations with the Catholic Church had
      deteriorated, the Church could not be categorized as an “opponent” until Peron decided to confront
      it. The Church was defiant in the face of controversial laws to legalize divorce and prostitution.
      Peron genuinely saw the Church as a threat and candidates may discuss the validity of this
      perception.

      The above material is an indication of what candidates may elect to write about in their responses.
      However, it is not exhaustive and no set answer is required.

      Examiners and moderators are reminded of the need to apply the markbands that provide the

16.   With reference to either Mao or Stalin, evaluate the reasons for, and impact of, his hostility
      to religion.

      Candidates should demonstrate a clear understanding of the requirements of the question and
      effectively deploy knowledge of the key issue raised by the question. As such, there must be a
      focused and well-supported appraisal of the motivation for and consequences of hostility to religion
      by the chosen leader.

      In the case of both leaders, candidates may comment upon the communist attitude to religion,
      which was atheistic. In the Soviet Union the Orthodox Church had been associated with the tsarist
      regime and “bourgeois reaction” and had been attacked by the communist authorities before Stalin
      took power (there had been large-scale arrests of priests, the confiscation of property and religion
      had been banned from schools): Mao Zedong (Mao Tse-tung) considered religion to be one of the
      “four bonds” that enslaved the peasantry and saw Western Churches as agents of imperialism.
      Outright proscription in both countries was thought to be politically unwise: freedom of worship
      was, theoretically, constitutionally protected by both rulers. Both rulers may have considered
      religious belief as a dangerous rival ideology, potentially damaging to their cult-of-personality
      propaganda.

      Stalin
      Stalin extended the attack on religion. The vast majority of religious houses and churches were
      closed down; some were physically destroyed, while others were converted to anti-religious
      purposes. Tens of thousands of Orthodox priests and clergy were sent to prison, executed for
      counter-revolutionary activity or driven into hiding. A law of 1929 banned promotion of religion
      (church libraries, bible-reading groups, even the display of religious books in churches). The
      clergy was subjected to punitive taxation and lost the right to live in church property. Relentless
      anti-religious propaganda was led by the League of Militant Godless. Christmas Day was
      nicknamed the “Day of Industrialization” and so on. There was apparently some relaxation in 1937
      with the recognition of Patriarch Sergei and 51 bishops as the central authority of the Church, but
      waves of arrests, church closures and anti-religious terror followed. There may be some comment
      on the harnessing of religious belief to the Patriotic War effort. Assessment may highlight the
      stubborn persistence of religious belief as shown in the 1937 census.

      Mao
      The policies that could be analysed may include: the impact of the “Resist America and Aid Korea”,
      “Suppression of Counter-Revolutionaries” and “anti-Rightist” campaigns on religious minorities;
      actions taken against foreign missionaries; the placing of the Catholic and Protestant Churches
      under the control of government bureaux; measures such as compulsory work on the Sabbath,
      mass accusation meetings where religious leaders were attacked by their own followers. Religious
      practice had to be within the framework of the Party line. The Cultural Revolution saw the closure
      of all places of religious observance and the wholesale destruction of religious property. There
      may also be comment on the persecution of Buddhism in Tibet. Mao came very close to
      eliminating religion altogether but there were remnants left and these saw a resurgence after his
      death.

      However, it is not exhaustive and no set answer is required.

17.   With reference to one authoritarian or single-party state, to what extent do you agree that the
      media was dominated by propaganda?

      Candidates should demonstrate a clear understanding of the requirements of the question and
      effectively deploy knowledge of the key issue raised by the question. The answer should critically
      assess the strengths or weaknesses of the statement in terms of the country chosen.

      The term “media” applies to methods of mass communication, specifically the press, radio and,
      where relevant, television. Candidates could include cinema in this; however it is likely that this
      would be restricted to official newsreels. Other areas of cultural activity are not valid for
      discussion. Candidates are invited to challenge the perception that the media in authoritarian and
      totalitarian states was totally focused on propaganda, when the reality was that many regimes
      realized that there was a need to go beyond persuasion and that entertainment was needed too.
      Methods of entertainment included popular music, radio drama and other forms of light
      entertainment.

      It will be necessary to identify the main propaganda messages and explain how they were
      promoted. In many states, rulers realized that their citizens would not tune into boring speeches or
      watch crude propaganda.

18.   Evaluate the extent to which the economic policies of either Castro or Hitler achieved their aims.

      Candidates should demonstrate a clear understanding of the requirements of the question and
      effectively deploy knowledge of the key issue raised by the question. They should appraise the
      economic policies of their chosen ruler and assess whether or not they achieved what they were
      designed to.

      Castro
      The aims of Castro’s economic policies should be identified: key areas being to end foreign
      ownership of Cuban resources including sugar plantations, tobacco plantations, to embark on land
      redistribution to the peasants by ending the latifundia system. This would improve the economic
      wellbeing of the peasants and retain wealth in Cuba.

      In 1959 the First Agrarian Reform Bill was enacted, land was expropriated and redistribution in
      relatively small units began. Sugar plantations tended to be turned into cooperatives to try and
      maintain efficiency. All other foreign holdings in Cuba were nationalized. There was a central
      command economy and price control of rents and services. In 1968 the “revolutionary offensive”
      was implemented to try and increase productivity, thereby centralizing the economy even more.

      A Second Agrarian Reform bill was passed, Five Year Plans were also introduced to try and
      industrialize further.

      The success of these policies is debatable, certainly many landless peasants now gained land;
      however, some may argue that government control of prices discouraged anything more than
      subsistence farming. Cuba’s economy remained dependent to a great extent on the sugar trade
      and there was limited money for other investment. The nationalization of foreign holdings resulted
      in the US trade embargo in 1960, which thus removed Cuba’s major trading partner and made
      Cuba reliant on trade and aid, and especially oil, from the Soviet Union. Some candidates may
      consider the impact of the collapse of the Soviet Union on the Cuban economy.

      Hitler
      Hitler’s initial aim was to secure his political position and then to prepare the country for war. This
      meant rearmament and self-sufficiency. Reducing unemployment was an immediate priority and to
      that end, public works programmes such as the autobahns were important. Hjalmar Schacht’s
      New Plan aimed to deal with the balance of payments crisis. Mefo bills were introduced to fund
      rearmament and from 1935 this was a priority. The Four Year Plan (1936), directed by Goering
      aimed to achieve self-sufficiency in key industrial products in preparation for war. Unemployment
      was eradicated, helped by conscription and the removal of women and Jews from official statistics
      and, by 1938, there was a labour shortage. Despite the scarcity of some basic foodstuffs, many
      Germans were pleased that the economic crisis seemed to be over and there was full employment.

      However, it is not exhaustive and no set answer is required.

Topic 4     Nationalist and independence movements in Africa and Asia and post-1945 Central
            and Eastern European states

19.   Compare and contrast the methods used to achieve independence from British rule in India and
      Gold Coast (Ghana).

      Candidates should demonstrate a clear understanding of the requirements of the question and
      effectively deploy knowledge of the key issue raised by the question. In this case, there should be
      a critical analysis of the similarities and differences employed by those who sought to achieve
      independence from British rule in India and the Gold Coast (Ghana).

      Areas of comparison:
      Candidates may initially identify the comparisons of British rule in both countries: often indirect and
      working through existing leadership and as well as the creation of an educated elite. Other
      comparisons may include: methods such as the use of non-violent protest such as strikes and
      mass demonstrations; the way that nationalist leaders challenged the British rule and were then
      imprisoned; the co-operation of nationalist leaders with Britain.

      Areas of contrast:
      The pace of the independence negotiations was different because in the Gold Coast (Ghana) it
      occurred in a relatively short space of time following the Second World War whereas in India it was
      a long-drawn-out process over decades; the granting of independence to India and Pakistan in
      1947 influenced the British decision to dismantle its empire in Africa during the 1950s and 1960s;
      in India, the sectarian issues and violence ultimately influenced the form of independence and
      resulted in partition into India and Pakistan.

      Candidates may compare and contrast the methods used by Gandhi and/or Jawaharlal Nehru
      and/or Jinnah with those of Nkrumah and/or other Gold Coast (Ghanaian) leaders.

20.   With reference to two colonial states in either Africa or Asia, examine the importance of armed
      struggle in achieving independence.

      Candidates should demonstrate a clear understanding of the requirements of the question and
      effectively deploy knowledge of the key issue raised by the question. They should consider the
      merits and demerits of the statement in terms of the impact that armed struggle had on the
      achievement of independence in their chosen states.

      Candidates may choose any two colonial states in Africa or Asia. Candidates may choose to
      answer this question in a thematic way and may examine some of the following issues: the impact
      of the Second World War; the support for the philosophy/ideology of the nationalist leaders for
      example Ho Chi Minh’s Marxism; the rise of a mass movement within the colonial state; the
      willingness of the imperial power to grant independence; the failure of the resistance of European
      settlers in the colonial state to the granting of independence; the impact of world opinion; the
      impact of the Cold War; and whether there was external intervention by other countries or agencies
      such as the United Nations.

      A number of colonial states gained their independence only after armed struggle against the
      imperial power such as Algeria, Angola, Kenya, Zimbabwe and Vietnam. Sectarian violence
      occurred during the Indian independence struggle and at the end of the Second World War this
      proved to be a catalyst in the independence process. Armed struggle against the imperial power
      was not always the main reason for the achievement of independence and largely peaceful
      transitions occurred in countries such as Ceylon (Sri Lanka), the Gold Coast (Ghana), Nigeria and
      some of the French North African colonies.

      Some candidates may challenge the assumption in the question and choose two countries where
      armed struggle was not the main factor in the granting of independence and they should be
      credited for this.

      The above material is an indication of what candidates may elect to write about in their responses.
      However, it is not exhaustive and no set answer is required.

21.   Evaluate the importance of external factors in the achievement of independence from French
      colonial rule in either Algeria or Vietnam.

      Candidates should demonstrate a clear understanding of the requirements of the question and
      effectively deploy knowledge of the key issue raised by the question. They should appraise the
      importance of external factors as the main contributor to the achievement of independence in their
      chosen country, and whilst they should refer to internal factors, this should be done in a
      comparative sense with the focus on external factors retained. Candidates may decide that either
      external or internal factors were more important or they may conclude that it was a combination of
      both that led to independence.

      Algeria
      External factors: growing anticolonial sentiment in France since the Second World War;
      opposition to the cost and violence of the war; the collapse of the Fourth Republic; and De Gaulle’s
      presidency was welcomed by the colons (French settlers) and the army. However De Gaulle
      began to negotiate with the National Liberation Front (FLN); realising that military victory over them
      was unlikely he offered self-determination. This policy had great popular support in France with a
      referendum returning a vote of 90 per cent in favour. In 1962 the final conference led to the Evian
      Agreement; Algeria was granted independence and Ben Bella became the first President.

      Internal factors: Demands for independence had begun to emerge in the interwar years with a
      number of different leaders (Messali Hadj, Ben Badis, Ferhat Abbas) with a range of different goals
      from complete independence to political emancipation within a French framework. The colons did
      not accept the idea of an Algerian state as they believed that Algeria was part of France.

      In 1945 the brutal suppression of the Setif uprising led to increasing support for various nationalist
      groups. Between 1945 and 1953 the various groups increased demands for independence and
      paramilitary groups were formed by Ben Bella, eventually forming the FLN, which began using
      guerrilla tactics against the French administration. Ben Bella was imprisoned between 1956
      and 1962.

      Ferhat Abbas joined the FLN and supported the armed struggle, which became increasingly
      ferocious; the Battle for Algiers, Barricades Week (1960) and the formation of the Organisation de
      l'armée secrete (OAS).

      Vietnam
      External factors include: the impact of the Second World War and Japanese occupation. The
      Japanese slogan “Asia for the Asians”, as well as the Japanese administration, inspired nationalist
      groups, but there was also resistance to the Japanese occupation. After the defeat of the
      Japanese, Ho Chi Minh declared Vietnamese independence in September 1945, but President
      Truman did not recognize the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, instead supporting the return of the
      French. This led to the Vietminh struggle against the French between 1946 and 1954, which
      resulted in a Vietnamese victory at Dien Bien Phu. The 1954 Geneva Conference divided Vietnam
      at the seventeenth parallel: North Vietnam under Ho Chi Minh became the Democratic Republic of
      Vietnam (DRV): South Vietnam was proclaimed the Republic of Vietnam (RVN) under Ngo Dinh
      Diem.

      Internal factors: Ho Chi Minh created the Vietnamese Revolutionary Youth League in 1925 in
      China. In 1927 another group, the Viet Nam Quoc Dan Dang (VNQDD), modelled on the
      Guomindang, GMD (Kuomintang, KMT) was formed and led violent protests, but was crushed by
      the French in 1930. Ho Chi Minh founded the Indochinese Communist Party and developed
      peasant support throughout the 1930s. A communist-led coalition of Vietnamese nationalists, the
      Viet Nam Doc Lap Dong Minh (Vietnamese Independence League), known as the Vietminh, was
      formed by Ho Chi Minh in 1941 with the aim of fighting both the French and the Japanese.

22.   Examine the reasons for, and the consequences of, one Central/Eastern European state’s
      challenge to Soviet control between 1950 and 1968.

      Candidates should demonstrate a clear understanding of the requirements of the question and
      effectively deploy knowledge of the key issues raised by the question. In their responses they
      should, therefore, analyse and assess why, and with what effect, their chosen country challenged
      Soviet control within the set period.

      Popular choices may be Hungary or Czechoslovakia, but candidates may choose any Central or
      Eastern European state. Candidates may initially explain establishment of Soviet control. The
      treatment by the Red Army along with implementation of communist economic policies in industry
      and agriculture; the loss of liberties; the isolation from the West; the non-acceptance of Western
      aid; the beginning of the Cold War; the establishment of the Warsaw Pact; the suppression of
      national identity; and the shortages of material goods all contributed to the growth of resentment
      towards Soviet control.

      The challenges to Soviet control were varied: the Hungarian Revolution occurred in 1956; there
      were riots in East Berlin in 1953 and in Poland in 1956; and the Prague Spring was in 1968.
      Candidates will need to examine the specific reasons leading to the challenge in the chosen
      country.

      The consequences also varied; from the overt use of Soviet military force in the cases of Hungary
      and Czechoslovakia to the tightening of repressive measures and purges in other countries. The
      construction of the Berlin Wall, and the brutality towards those who tried to escape to the West,
      may also be seen as a consequence. The Soviet desire to reinforce a buffer zone around its
      borders and the increasingly bitter rhetoric of the Cold War shaped the consequences of internal
      challenges to Soviet control.

23.   Examine the reasons for conflict among the successor states of Yugoslavia.

      Candidates should demonstrate a clear understanding of the requirements of the question and
      effectively deploy knowledge of the key issue raised by the question. In this case, there should be
      a critical assessment of the various reasons why the successor states became involved in conflict.

      Candidates may trace the reasons for conflict amongst the successor states of Yugoslavia to the
      problems that existed before dissolution and war. After the First World War, Yugoslavia was
      created as a pan-Slavic country that comprised six federal states and two provinces. Overall, it
      was multi-ethnic and multi-religious, but the regions or states had antagonisms towards, and
      historical differences with, each other. These differences were never fully resolved, but during the
      Tito years from 1948 to 1980 they were controlled and unified by the dictatorship. After the death
      of Tito, different political leaders such as Tudjman in Croatia and Milosevic in Serbia pursued
      economic and social policies that accentuated these differences and thus weakened the overall
      unity of Yugoslavia.

      Slovenia and Croatia became independent in 1991, but Serbia invaded Croatia due to its high
      proportion of ethnic Serbs. Ethnic and religious differences became particularly important after the
      independence of Bosnia and Herzegovina in 1992, because conflict developed initially between the
      minority Orthodox Bosnian Serbs, the majority Bosnian Muslims (Bosniaks) and minority Roman
      Catholic Croats. The policies of ethnic cleansing and relocation were pursued by opposing armies.
      Other reasons included: the economic problems inherited from the former Yugoslavia; the
      interruption of trade and industry; the lack of resources in the smaller states and thus the lack of
      foreign investment; the political instability in each state. All of these increased the intensity of the
      conflict. Candidates may also argue that foreign recognition of the independence of states such as
      Slovenia, Croatia and Bosnia and Herzegovina was a significant reason for the development of
      conflict.

      Answers should not go beyond the year 2000.

24.   Examine the changes in social and cultural conditions since independence in one post-colonial or
      new Central/Eastern European state.

      Candidates should demonstrate a clear understanding of the requirements of the question and
      effectively deploy knowledge of the key issues raised by the question. They must select one
      appropriate state and consider how the social and cultural conditions of that state have changed
      (for better or worse) after it achieved independence. Discussion of political and economic
      developments may be allowable, but they need to be in the context of social and cultural change.

      Most post-colonial states experienced social changes due to the new political administration: there
      may have been a shift in the balance of power and status within the different religious or tribal or
      ethnic groups; social and economic inequalities may have become more or less, accentuated.
      New governments may have introduced policies to improve education, welfare, health and
      infrastructure and this may have had an impact on social mobility. Economic issues such as trade
      with the former colonial power, investment, and the challenge of competing in the world economy
      may have had both a positive and/or negative impact on living standards.

      Changes in cultural conditions may include the rise of nationalism, a focus on the teaching of
      national history and local languages, the development or recovery of unique national cultural
      traditions such as the revival of the arts, the rise of a tourist industry, the promotion of sport and
      involvement in world sporting competitions as a way of fostering national unity.

      The above material is an indication of what candidates may elect to write about in their responses.
      However, it is not exhaustive and no set answer is required.

Topic 5    The Cold War

25.   Examine the reasons for, and the impact in Europe of, the formation of NATO.

      Candidates should demonstrate a clear understanding of the requirements of the question and
      effectively deploy knowledge of the key issues raised by the question. There should be a detailed
      consideration of the rationale for the formation of NATO as well as an analysis of the
      consequences of its formation on Europe.

      This should not be an essay on the origins of the Cold War.

      The short term circumstances in which NATO was formed are likely to be well known and should
      be addressed. They include: the alliance was an extension of the Brussels Defence Pact (1947); it
      was formed in the aftermath of the Berlin Blockade and the establishment of the West German
      state; member nations included the major powers and other smaller nations such as Portugal,
      Denmark and Norway; a joint NATO military command was formed and the founding treaty stated
      that an attack on one member was an attack on all NATO members. West Germany joined in
      1954 and it could be argued that it formed part of the policy of Containment.

      The NATO alliance was very clearly a defensive alliance; however it was also a very public
      confirmation to Europe that in the longer term the US would not revert to isolationism (the Marshall
      Plan had been temporary). It had the effect of reassuring various nations (for example the French
      were reassured that a rearmed West German state would not be a threat). In the short term NATO
      contributed to the notion of a unified Europe. Economic benefits also resulted from the alliance:
      trade between member nations increased; it stimulated economic recovery (for example the
      alliance led to orders for West German machine tools). It also helped to maintain the influence of
      the US on European affairs. As such, although the alliance was primarily a defensive one, it was
      also a means to maintain and extend US influence in Europe.

26.   Evaluate the influence of Cold War tensions on two military conflicts, each chosen from a different
      region.

      Candidates should demonstrate a clear understanding of the requirements of the question and
      effectively deploy knowledge of the key issues raised by the question. They should provide a clear
      appraisal of the various effects of the Cold War on the chosen countries.

      In their responses, candidates could use a number of possible examples including: Korea; conflicts
      in the Middle East (Suez, 1967 or the 1973 Arab–Israeli conflicts); Vietnam; Chile; Angola;
      Afghanistan; Congo.

      Responses should make clear links to the Cold War as a cause, catalyst and/or an ongoing
      facilitator of the conflicts being discussed but they could also argue that some conflicts were much
      more to do with local tensions and/or problems and that Cold War tensions were less significant.
      Also, please note that the examples chosen should be military conflicts. For example, the Berlin
      Blockade and the Cuban Missile Crisis would not be suitable examples as although they were
      crises, they were not military conflicts.

      However, it is not exhaustive and no set answer is required.

27.   “Stalin and Truman were equally responsible for the emergence of the Cold War.” To what extent
      do you agree with this statement?

      Candidates should demonstrate a clear understanding of the requirements of the question and
      effectively deploy knowledge of the key issue raised by the question. They should critically assess
      the merits (or otherwise) of the given statement and provide a well-supported and consistent
      argument about whether or not Stalin and Truman were equally responsible for the emergence of
      the Cold War.

      In their responses some candidates may consider longer term tensions dating back to 1917. They
      may refer to the establishment of Comintern; the Riga Axioms; Soviet support for the Republic in
      the Spanish Civil War; wartime tensions over the delay in the opening of the Second Front; and
      Soviet actions in liberated nations.

      The immediate causes of tension were events in Germany between 1945 and 1949; tensions over
      reparations; the Truman Doctrine and the Marshall Plan; the establishment of the Information
      Bureau of the Communist and Workers’ Parties (Cominform) and the Council for Mutual Economic
      Assistance (COMECON); the Sovietization of Eastern Europe; the formation of Bizonia and
      Trizonia; and the Berlin Blockade.

28.   With reference to two Cold War crises, to what extent did brinkmanship risk direct superpower
      conflict after 1956?

      Candidates should demonstrate a clear understanding of the requirements of the question and
      effectively deploy knowledge of the key issue raised by the question. For this question, this entails
      the critical assessment of the role of brinkmanship in heightening tensions between the
      superpowers in the context of any two Cold War crises.

      The two major Cold War crises where brinkmanship seemed to make war a real possibility were
      Berlin in the years 1958 to1961 and the Cuban Missile Crisis 1962, although some candidates may
      well cite the 1973 Arab–Israeli Conflict when it seemed that the US and the Soviet Union might go
      to war in support of their client states in the region.

      Whatever examples are chosen candidates should have specific knowledge of events, including
      the build-up of the crisis, the level of military preparedness of each power and the way in which war
      was avoided.

      If Berlin and Cuba are chosen as examples candidates may argue that the threat of war was much
      greater over Cuba because of the danger to the continental United States. However in the case of
      Berlin and despite much public support for West Berlin and a series of bad-tempered summits
      (Paris, Vienna) that seemed to indicate an escalating crisis, in the end Kennedy promised to
      defend access to Berlin from West Germany but not access from West to East Berlin. This gave
      Khrushchev and Ulbricht what they wanted: a means of halting refugees fleeing to the West. In
      August 1961 the Berlin Wall was built and, although he condemned its creation, Kennedy took no
      action as a war over Berlin would have been relatively unpopular at home.

      However, it is not exhaustive and no set answer is required.

29.   Evaluate the contribution of the local Communist Party to the Sovietization of one state in
      Central /Eastern Europe in the years 1944 to 1949.

      Candidates should demonstrate a clear understanding of the requirements of the question and
      effectively deploy knowledge of the key issue raised by the question. There should, therefore, be
      an appraisal of the role of the local Communist Party in the Sovietization of the chosen state.
      Other Sovietizing factors (for example, the presence of the Red Army and Soviet “Advisers”)
      should be considered, but only in terms of their relative importance. As such, emphasis should be
      retained on the importance (or not) of the key factor.

      Chosen examples could include Poland, Hungary, Czechoslovakia, Romania and Bulgaria;
      however the Baltic States are not valid examples as they were annexed by the Soviet Union.
      In many of the relevant states the Communist parties were small (Czechoslovakia was the
      exception), and in the post-war period coalition governments were established. In most cases the
      local Communists sought control of key ministries that would enable them to extend their power.
      These included the Interior, Justice and Agriculture ministries, for example.

      Elections were held in most cases by 1946/1947 and in each case it was clear that the
      Communists were unlikely to gain control via the ballot box. Subsequently the pattern of
      intimidation, rigged elections and the fusion of Communist with often much larger Socialist parties
      began. This in turn led to Communist-dominated governments and the formation of so called
      People’s Democratic Republics.

      The local Communists were the means by which the Soviet Union was able to establish and
      maintain control without the overt use of force.

30.   With reference to one Central/Eastern European state, examine the economic impact of the
      break-up of the Soviet Union.

      Candidates should demonstrate a clear understanding of the requirements of the question and
      effectively deploy knowledge of the key issue raised by the question. There should, therefore, be a
      critical analysis of the how the break-up of the Soviet Union economically affected the candidate’s
      chosen country.

      The economic impact could include: much greater freedom to trade, national economies being
      dominated by market forces that often led to inflation and had an impact on standards of living: the
      emergence of large companies that ran major industries; economic disparity in society with the
      emergence of the very rich (oligarchs); the establishment of western companies/chains in Eastern
      Europe. Some candidates may argue that much of the economic change was largely focused in
      urban areas and that in rural areas the agricultural economy was weak and that there has been
      limited economic change.

      The privatization of previously state-run agencies and enterprises and the emergence of big-
      business should also be considered. Responses should be supported with specific detailed
      evidence relating to the chosen exemplar.

      However, it is not exhaustive and no set answer is required.
