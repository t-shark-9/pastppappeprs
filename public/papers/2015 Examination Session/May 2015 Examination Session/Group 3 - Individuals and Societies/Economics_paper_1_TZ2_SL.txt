Microeconomics

1.   (a)   Explain the view that an increase in price will lead to an increase in the quantity

     (b)   To what extent are subsidies the most effective way of encouraging the consumption of
           merit goods?                                                                                  [15]


2.   (a)   Explain the likely effects of falling costs of factors of production on price and output in
           agricultural markets.                                                                         [10]

     (b)   Discuss the impact on different stakeholders of governments using price floors
           (minimum prices) to support farmers when agricultural prices are falling.                     [15]

Answer one question from this section.

Macroeconomics

3.   (a)   Explain the effect of a rise in saving and a fall in investment on the circular flow of
           income of an economy.                                                                     [10]

     (b)   Discuss the view that an economy will always return to the full employment equilibrium
           level of output in the long run.                                                          [15]


4.   (a)   Explain how business spending on research and development and government
           expenditure on infrastructure might shift the long-run aggregate supply curve.            [10]

     (b)   Evaluate the effectiveness of interventionist supply-side policies to achieve economic
           growth.                                                                                   [15]
