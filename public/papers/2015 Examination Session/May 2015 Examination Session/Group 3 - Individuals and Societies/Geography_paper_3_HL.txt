Answer one question.

Wherever possible, answers should include case studies and examples, and, where relevant, large,
well drawn maps, sketches and diagrams.

1.   (a)   Using examples, distinguish between transboundary pollution and
           transnational waste movement.                                                           [10]

     (b)   “Due to global interactions, there is no longer a global periphery.” Discuss
           this statement.                                                                         [15]


2.   (a)   Using examples, explain the factors responsible for the global spread of
           consumer culture.                                                                       [10]

     (b)   “National governments cannot control global interactions.” Discuss this
           statement.                                                                              [15]


3.   (a)   Using located examples, analyse the importance of outsourcing for
           transnational corporations (TNCs).                                                      [10]

     (b)   “International migration is the main reason for the loss of distinctive
           local cultures.” Discuss this statement.                                                [15]
