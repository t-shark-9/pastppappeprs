1.   (a)   Using examples, distinguish between transboundary pollution and transnational
           waste movement.                                                                                   [10]

           Transboundary pollution (TBP) is pollution that crosses a national border accidently or
           inadvertently due to physical processes (atmosphere, currents, etc). Recent examples of
           transboundary pollution (TBP) include forest fires in Indonesia causing smog in Singapore;
           Chinese pollution reaching Japan; and radiation from Fukushima reaching the shores of the
           USA. Also credit acid rain (if clearly shown to be transboundary) and credit Chernobyl
           (1986). [The Gulf of Mexico oil spill was not a TBP event because only the USA was
           affected. Candidates using this example only may still attain band D according to other
           criteria, but ought not be awarded band E.]

           Transnational waste movement (TWM) includes landfill in China originating in USA;
           European e-waste arriving in Accra (Ghana); ship-breaking in Bangladesh; Trafigura’s
           chemical waste from Europe arriving in Ivory Coast. This is a purposeful/intended global
           interaction / trade transaction. It is acceptable to view discarded household goods (eg clothes
           for charity) as a form of waste. Waste can also be a very valuable resource when recycled,
           so TWM can be seen as a positive interaction.

           Good answers are likely to provide detailed exemplification. They are also likely to make a
           better effort to distinguish (beyond simply employing comparative language such as
           “whereas”): eg TBP may involve the dispersal of point source pollution into multiple
           territories whereas TWM is a movement from one territory to another; TBP has negative
           impacts / costs money but TWM can also be positive / makes money; TBP is accidental but
           TWM is deliberate, etc).

           For band C, expect some description of a TBP event and a TWM (do not expect balance).

           At band D, expect either a detailed explanation of a TBP event and a TWM (do not expect
           balance) or a good attempt to distinguish between them.

           By band E, expect both aspects to be addressed.

(b)   “Due to global interactions, there is no longer a global periphery.” Discuss this
      statement.                                                                                          [15]

      Credit all content in line with the markbands. Credit unexpected approaches wherever
      relevant.

      The global periphery may be defined as regions outside/beyond the core. Historically, some
      states were identified as being peripheral due to their spatial distance/isolation or lack of
      integration into economic and political systems. In 2015, this idea of peripheral states is
      only a very basic/antiquated starting point. A contemporary account might acknowledge
      also the existence of semi-peripheral states (middle-income countries) or the presence of
      important global hubs/cores such as Lagos in states that some people might still view as
      being part of a global periphery.

      Another approach might be to discuss the extent to which various global flows and
      interactions (from international aid to social networks) have networked/connected the
      majority of the world’s states and a large proportion of their peoples. To give a counter-
      argument, examples might be cited of isolated states and regions, from which we can infer
      the existence of a “global periphery”.

      Possible themes include:
      • economic globalization of low-income countries through trade, aid, loans
         [Guide 3] that may originate in EU/USA “core” countries but also emerging
         economies/BRICs/NICs [Guide 1 and 3]
      • cultural interactions between countries in the core and periphery [Guide 5]
      • isolated states eg North Korea, China (culturally); non-globalized tribal groups [Guide 6
         and 7]
      • the “shrinking world” effect that brings connectivity to previously peripheral places
         [Guide 3]
      • branded commodities and global media that help to connect places through the growth of
         a common “core” culture (possibly modified by glocalization) which more and more
         places share [Guide 5].

      Good answers may discuss differing degrees of “peripheral” states (perhaps including semi-
      periphery, non-globalized periphery). Another approach might be to discuss the multi-scale
      existence of core and periphery patterns (recognizing the global importance of world cities in
      Asia, Africa and Latin America). Another approach might be to discuss what is meant by
      “global interactions” in the context of this question (referring to a variety of trade flows, aid
      flows, migration flows, information flows, etc).

      For band D, expect a structured discussion of how global interactions have contributed to the
      disappearance/persistence/modification of a “global periphery” of places/people. This
      should include either a synthesis of several well evidenced themes taken from the subject
      guide, or nuanced and evidenced conclusion/evaluation of the statement.

      At band E, expect both of these elements.
                                                       –6–                   M15/3/GEOGR/HP3/ENG/TZ0/XX/M


2.   (a)   Using examples, explain the factors responsible for the global spread of
           consumer culture.                                                                                 [10]

           Consumer culture may be described and exemplified as the spread of purchasing habits
           (branded clothes, fast food, music), or analysed in greater depth as the spread of a capitalist
           worldview wherein everyday life is commoditized and branded. Multiple traits of consumer
           culture might be identified, including:
           • changing tastes in food (linked with retail and restaurant TNCs)
           • fashion (linked with global media corporations)
           • music purchasing (linked with online platforms such as iTunes and YouTube).

           The key factors that can be explained include:
           • the expansion of TNCs in a drive for new markets (may involve glocalization)
           • the growth of global media and ICT (operating either as an independent factor or as a by-
              product of innovation by TNCs such as Microsoft and Apple)
           • the concept of cultural imperialism (linked either to the activities of TNCs or superpower
              states with “soft power” such as the USA).

           Good answers may note that the factors are interrelated and reinforce one another (TNCs
           drive innovation, for instance). Another approach might examine how different factors
           might be linked with different aspects/traits of consumer culture (the spread of designer
           clothes can be related to container shipping and TNCs; the purchasing of online games and
           music can be related to ICT).

           For band C, expect two factors to be described and linked with the spread of culture and/or
           commodities.

           At band D, expect either more detailed explanation of a range of factors linked with the
           spread of culture/commodities or greater explanation of what is meant by “the spread of
           consumer culture”.

           By band E, expect both aspects to be addressed.

(b)   “National governments cannot control global interactions.” Discuss this statement.                 [15]

      Credit all content in line with the markbands. Credit unexpected approaches wherever
      relevant.

      Management by national government may comprise migration controls, rules for FDI, terms
      attached to loans and aid, the issues of internet control and censorship. Successes and failure
      to control may be highlighted either between different countries, or different kinds of global
      interaction (trade/migration/information flows), or both.

      Possible themes include:
      • MGOs such as the EU and NAFTA as evidence the statement is correct and countries
         must now group together in order to try to manage global interactions in ways that re-
         establish some control [Guide 6]
      • cultural globalization as an unstoppable force (or not) and national attempts to control
         flows of media and information [Guide 5]
      • the power of global financial institutions eg IMF and its insistence that national
         governments institute reforms eg SAPs [Guide 3]
      • migration issues and controls [Guide 3, 6, 7]
      • government promotion of localism [Guide 7]
      • transboundary pollution [Guide 4]
      • government attitudes towards foreign direct investment and financial flows
         [Guide 2]
      • military conflicts eg ISIS in the Middle East [current affairs]

      Good answers may be structured around different kinds of global interactions (eg contrasts
      management of economic interactions and cultural globalization in the course of the essay).
      Another approach might be to discuss the effectiveness of the actions of different types of
      government (democracies and autocracies).

      For band D, expect a structured discussion of how national governments control/cannot
      control different kinds of global interaction. This should include either a synthesis of several
      well evidenced themes taken from the subject guide, or nuanced and evidenced
      conclusion/evaluation of the statement.

      At band E, expect both of these elements.
                                                      –8–                   M15/3/GEOGR/HP3/ENG/TZ0/XX/M


3.   (a)   Using located examples, analyse the importance of outsourcing for transnational corporations (TNCs).
                 [10]

           Outsourcing is when a company hands internal functions to an outside company
           (a client relationship), for example US/EU clothing companies outsource to Bangladesh; ICT
           outsourcing to Bangalore/Philippines; BP outsourcing of Gulf of Mexico oil rig operation to
           Halliburton; McDonald’s outsourcing the management of its restaurants to local companies in
           some states.

           Outsourcing overlaps with foreign direct investment to a large extent if the TNC invests or has
           an ownership stake in the company it outsources to. There is considerable overlap between
           outsourcing and other forms of FDI (“offshore” branch plant construction) in terms of the
           important factors that drive these practices:
           • cheap labour (and other low costs eg health and safety)
           • low taxes (including use of Export Processing Zones/SEZs)
           • local supplier’s ability to source cheap parts/materials or greater familiarity with market
               (glocalization).

           These generic factors should be credited, even if the candidate’s link to proper outsourcing (as
           opposed to other forms of FDI) is insecure.

           Good answers may show awareness that some companies may prefer to keep their operations in-
           house or may only outsource non-essential operations, or are beginning to “re-shore” operations
           to reduce supply chain risks (Japanese tsunami, disturbances in Ukraine, Nigeria, Kenya, etc).
           Another approach might be to analyse how some types/sectors of TNCs (mining operations,
           agribusinesses) may be less reliant on outsourcing than manufacturers and retailers with large
           and complex supply chains. Another approach might be to analyse how some TNCs, such as
           Amazon and Starbucks, have been criticized by the governments of sovereign states for the
           claim that they have “outsourced” operations to different subsidiaries of their own company (in
           an attempt to avoid corporation tax).

           For band C, expect some description of the reasons why it is important for TNCs to have
           different operations/activities carried out in different places.

           At band D, expect either more detailed explanation of why different operations/activities are
           carried out in different places or a good attempt to analyse why out-sourcing is important for
           different TNCs.

           By band E, expect both aspects to be addressed.

(b)   “International migration is the main reason for the loss of distinctive local cultures.”
      Discuss this statement.                                                                          [15]

      Credit all content in line with the markbands. Credit unexpected approaches wherever
      relevant.

      The focus might be how a range of reasons/factors, including migration, helps explain the
      loss (or not) of distinctive local cultures. Likely reasons include internet/media, tourism,
      rising wages in emerging economies and elsewhere / changing employment structures.
      Credit physical reasons too, such as suggested climate change refugees (Tuvalu, Maldives).

      Alternatively, candidates might discuss the extent to which migration brings loss/harm or
      benefits to the world’s many local cultures in both source and host regions for migration.
      Rather than addressing other factors, the discussion can encompass a range of ways in which
      migration and diaspora growth impacts on local cultures, including their preservation (the
      cultural “fossilization” of diaspora source nations, for instance).

      Possible themes relating to migration and/or local culture include:
      • migration, diaspora and multiculturalism [Guide 5]
      • homogenous urban landscapes [Guide 4]
      • tourism and the tourist gaze [Guide 5]
      • cultural imperialism [Guide 5]
      • global media and TNCs as agents of change [Guide 5 and 7]
      • nationalist movements [Guide 6]
      • isolationism [Guide 7].

      Good answers may discuss what is meant by “loss”: culture comprises many traits, some of
      which may persist while others are lost or change. Another approach might be to discuss the
      emergence of new hybrid or “melting point” cultures eg in World Cities: these may replace
      previously homogenous cultures but they can be just as distinctive as the more homogenous
      cultures that were found there before.

      For band D, expect a structured discussion, the central elements of which are migration, local
      cultures and possibly some additional reasons/factors. This should include either a synthesis
      of several well evidenced themes taken from the subject guide, or nuanced and evidenced
      conclusion/ evaluation of the statement.

      At band E, expect both of these elements.
