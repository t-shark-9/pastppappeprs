Microeconomics

     (b)   Discuss the view that the overuse of common access resources is best addressed by
           government.                                                                              [15]

     (b)   Evaluate the view that monopolies, despite their inefficiencies, may often be considered
           desirable.                                                                               [15]

Answer one question from this section.

Macroeconomics

3.   (a)   Using the concept of the Keynesian multiplier, explain the possible impact of a rise in
           government spending on economic growth.                                                   [10]

     (b)   To what extent might unemployment represent an economic and social problem?               [15]


4.   (a)   Explain how business spending on research and development and government
           expenditure on infrastructure might shift the long-run aggregate supply curve.            [10]

     (b)   Evaluate the effectiveness of interventionist supply-side policies to achieve economic
           growth.                                                                                   [15]
