These sources and questions relate to Locarno and the “Locarno Spring” (1925).

Source A                The Treaty of Mutual Guarantee between Germany, Belgium, France,
                        Britain and Italy (the Locarno Treaty) (1925).

Article I: The high contracting nations collectively guarantee the maintenance of the territorial status quo
resulting from the frontiers between Germany and Belgium and between Germany and France, and the
permanent nature of the frontiers as fixed by the Treaty of Peace signed at Versailles on 28 June, 1919.

Article II: Germany and Belgium, and also Germany and France, mutually undertake that they will in no
case attack or invade each other or resort to war against each other.

Article III: Germany and Belgium, and Germany and France, undertake to settle by peaceful means and
in the manner laid down all questions of every kind which may arise between them and which it may not
be possible to settle by the normal methods of diplomacy. Any question with regard to which the nations
are in conflict shall be submitted to judicial decision, and the nations undertake to comply with such
decision.


Source B                Arthur Rosenberg, a German historian who emigrated to London in 1933, writing
                        in the academic book A History of the German Republic (1936).

The basic idea of the Locarno Pact is that Germany, France and Belgium promise to guarantee their
existing frontiers, and refrain from any attempts to alter them by force – an obligation that involved the
final renunciation [surrender] by Germany of all claim to Alsace-Lorraine. This renunciation did not
involve Germany in any great sacrifice, since after 1919 no serious German politician entertained notions
of regaining Alsace-Lorraine ... On the other hand France agreed not to extend her frontiers to the
Rhineland by force. Britain and Italy bound themselves in event of an armed violation of the
Franco-German frontier to come to the assistance of the attacked Power with their military forces.
The Locarno Pact also anticipated Germany’s entry into the League of Nations and therefore the
application of the terms of the Covenant to Franco-German relations. Germany became a member of
the League of Nations in 1926 and was formally recognized as a Great Power again.

Source D               G P Gooch, a British historian and politician, writing in the academic book
                       Studies in Diplomacy and Statecraft (1942).

The existing frontiers between France and Germany, and Belgium and Germany, were accepted by all
three states, and guaranteed by Britain and Italy. We committed ourselves to assist either France or
Germany against the unprovoked aggression of the other. It was natural that Poles and Frenchmen,
united by a fear of what Germany might do when she recovered her strength, should urge us to
guarantee the western frontier of Poland. It was equally natural that we should decline.
Germany seemed resigned to her losses in the west but not in the east. It is true that she signed
arbitration treaties with Poland and Czechoslovakia and promised not to attempt to change the Polish
frontier by force; but there was no renunciation of claims in the treaty, and no thought of it in German
hearts. Our policy may be summarized in a sentence: we guaranteed an accepted frontier,
and refused to uphold one which was not agreed.


Source E               Anna Cienciala, a Polish-American historian and Titus Komarnicki, who was a
                       Polish politician and lecturer at the Polish School of Political and Social Sciences
                       in London, writing in the academic book From Versailles to Locarno. Keys to
                       Polish Foreign Policy, 1919–1925 (1984).

Stresemann had separated the security problems of Eastern and Western Europe … As far as
Germany’s eastern borders were concerned, Stresemann emphasized that Locarno gave Germany the
opportunity of recovering territories lost to Poland. [He] called Locarno an “armistice” and outlined the
task for German foreign policy after Germany’s entry into the League: the revision of reparations;
the protection of Germans who were living outside the Reich; the “correction” of eastern frontiers –
that is the return of Danzig and the Corridor to Germany; a border “correction” in Upper Silesia;
and, finally, the union of Germany and Austria … Stresemann [said] that he had not made any moral
renunciation at Locarno, such as the right to make war, since it would be madness for Germany to think
of a war with France. So, in return for giving up what he did not possess – the possibility of making war
on France – he had obtained many concessions for Germany … Britain claimed that they had produced
a détente on the eastern frontiers of Germany, but the prospects for Poland were dismal.

1.        (a)       What, according to Source A, were the aims of the Locarno Treaty?                                                                                           [3]

          (b)       What is the message conveyed by Source C?                                                                                                                   [2]


2.        Compare and contrast the views expressed in Sources D and E about the achievements of
          the Locarno Treaty.                                                                                                                                                   [6]


3.        With reference to their origin and purpose, assess the value and limitations of Source A and
          Source B for historians studying the “Locarno Spring”.                                                                                                                [6]



4.        “Locarno resulted from a desire for peace on the part of the nations involved.” Using the
          sources and your own knowledge, to what extent do you agree with this statement?                                                                                      [8]
