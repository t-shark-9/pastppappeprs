                                  Latvia to join the eurozone monetary union

          Latvia will become the 18th country to adopt the euro after being approved for membership
           by the European Commission. The country has met the criteria for eurozone membership,
           including low inflation, low long-term interest rates, a stable exchange rate, low public debt
           and low budget deficits.

          Latvia joined the European Union (EU) customs union in 2004. This resulted in a large
           increase in the availability of credit and strong economic growth in Latvia. However, the
           2008 global financial crisis resulted in the collapse of one of its leading banks and massive
           economic instability. Economic output fell by about 20 % and Latvia had to accept a bailout
           (loans) from the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the EU.

          Latvia kept the lat (the Latvian currency) pegged to the euro throughout the crisis. At the
           time, some economists argued that devaluation would have been a better way to improve the
           economy. However, Latvia followed the path of other countries such as Greece and Ireland,
           and chose to improve competitiveness through austerity measures. This involved increasing
           direct taxes and cutting government spending and public sector wages.

          By late 2010, the economy was growing again and Latvia had repaid the loans to the IMF
           and the EU. In 2012, the economy expanded by 5.6 %, the fastest of any country in the
           EU, although output was still 12 % below its pre-crisis peak. In addition unemployment was
           falling, but it remained high at 12.4 %.

          For Latvia, which shares a border with Russia, the attraction of the euro is about economics
           and security. Entering the eurozone in January 2014 is part of a process of shifting away
           from the influence of Russia, and following its northern neighbour Estonia which joined the
           eurozone in 2011. Lithuania hopes to join the eurozone in 2015.

          Public support for joining the eurozone has been low. Evidence from one survey suggests
           that a small majority of Latvia’s population opposes membership, fearing that prices will rise
           and Latvians will be drawn into the problems facing Europe’s struggling economies.

          Nonetheless, there are signs that support is growing. The Latvian prime minister said that
           “switching to the euro will help economic growth and bring increased foreign investment.
           Unlike countries that can afford to ignore the euro and additional integration, Latvia cannot
           easily stand on its own. This is good news, not only for Latvia, but also for the eurozone.
           It shows that there is still confidence in the single currency”.

2.       Study the extract below and answer the questions that follow.


                                      Is India in danger of another crisis?

          The Indian prime minister has tried to reduce concerns that the country is headed for a
           balance of payments crisis, similar to the one that the country experienced in 1991. At that
           time, India was on the verge of defaulting on its foreign debt and had to be rescued by the
           International Monetary Fund (IMF).

          There are a few key similarities between the situation in 2013 and the situation in 1991.
           India still has a persistent current account deficit and its weak currency, the rupee, makes it
           more difficult to finance the deficit. Officials are worried because the current account deficit
           is larger, and the rupee is weaker than it was in 1991.

          The rupee has declined by more than 15 % between May and August this year (2013), and
           has hit a record low against the US dollar. This is largely to do with the expectation that the
           Federal Reserve (US central bank) may not continue to use monetary policy to stimulate the
           US economy. As a result, there is speculation that the US interest rate might rise at some
           point in the future. The consequence of this is that money is leaving developing economies
           such as India.

          The countries that are most at risk are those with large current account deficits, and India has
           one of the largest. The current account deficit hit a record high of 6.7 % of gross domestic
           product (GDP) in 2012. Domestic issues make the situation even worse: India has a large
           budget deficit as well as a high rate of inflation. Both are reasons why portfolio investors
           would like to take their money out of India. Furthermore, economic growth has also dropped
           to 5 %, the slowest growth since 2003.

          In a recent speech, the prime minister noted that the current account deficit was high, and
           blamed increased imports of gold as a key factor. In recent months, the government has
           sharply raised tariffs on gold. Surprisingly, the Indian government and the central bank have
           also proposed measures to support the rupee.

          After the crisis in 1991, there were many reforms and the country became more globally
           integrated. This led to a period of strong growth. However, reforms have slowed down and
           analysts say that this has prevented India from reaching its tremendous potential.
           The threat of a crisis may be just what is needed for the government to speed up the
           supply-side reforms necessary to increase growth and reduce the current account deficit.
           These reforms would include policies to promote industry, reduce the regulatory burdens and
           importantly increase investment in education.

                                         Economic growth in Peru

          The Peruvian economy has been growing by an average of 6.4 % per year since 2002 with
           a slightly appreciating exchange rate and low inflation. Growth was in the 6–9 % range
           for 2010–2013, due partly to a leap in private investment. This was especially in the raw
           materials extraction sector, which accounts for more than 60 % of Peru’s total exports.
           Rising Asian demand for copper and gold has been a large contributor to Peru’s growth.

          Despite Peru’s strong macroeconomic performance, dependence on mineral and metal
           exports and imported food makes the economy vulnerable to fluctuations in world prices.
           This is reflected in its volatile terms of trade (Figure 1).

          The Peruvian president has pursued moderate, pro-market policies while adding new
           government programmes in order to provide additional social support for the poor. Peru’s
           rapid expansion coupled with transfer payments and other benefits have helped to reduce
           the poverty rate. The percentage of people living on less than US$2 a day has halved to
           about 28 % since 2003, but inequality persists (Figure 2) and continues to present a threat
           to the new government. The president has pledged to further cut the poverty rate to 15 %
           through increased transfer payments, an increase in the minimum wage, and pensions.

          There has also been deregulation in business practices, making it much easier to start and
           run a private firm. Changes in employment regulations have created more flexibility in the
           labour market.

          Peru’s free trade policy has continued under the president’s administration.
           The United States-Peru Trade Promotion Agreement was signed on 12 April 2006, opening
           the way to greater trade and investment between the two economies. Peru signed trade
           agreements with South Korea, Japan and Mexico in 2011.

          Peru has continued to attract foreign investment. However, political disputes and protests
           may harm some projects, particularly in mining. Poor infrastructure hinders the spread of
           growth to Peru’s inland areas. Much of the economy remains informal and untaxed. The
           strengthening of the sol (Peru’s currency) could hurt the economy. In 2013, the central bank
           purchased a record US$13 billion in the foreign exchange market in an attempt to keep the
           national currency from rapid appreciation.
