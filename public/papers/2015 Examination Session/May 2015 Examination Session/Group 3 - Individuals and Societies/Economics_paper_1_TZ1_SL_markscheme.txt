1.   (a)     Explain why governments impose price floors (minimum prices).                        [10]

             Answers may include:
              definition of price floor
              diagram of the application of a price floor
              explanation of possible reasons for a price floor, for example regarding
               equity (minimum wage), to support the income of producers (agricultural
               price supports) or to discourage the consumption of demerit goods
              examples of where a price floor has been applied.

             Award a maximum of level 2 if only one reason is given.
             Level 4 can be awarded if two reasons are given.

2.   (a)   Explain the view that an increase in price will lead to a decrease in the
           quantity demanded whilst an increase in demand will lead to an increase in
           price.                                                                            [10]

             demanded, due to the law of demand, through a movement along the
             demand curve, and an increase in demand due to a change in non-price
             determinants, leading to an increase in price through a shift to the right of
             the demand curve
            examples of instances to which this might be, or has been, applied.

4.   (a)   Explain how business spending on research and development and
           government expenditure on infrastructure might shift the long-run aggregate
           supply curve.                                                                   [10]

           Answers may include:
            definitions of research and development, infrastructure, long-run aggregate
             supply
            diagram to show a shift in the LRAS
            explanation of how research and development in new technology will
             improve the quality of physical capital, hence increasing productive
             capacity and shifting the LRAS to the right. Explanation of how increased
             government expenditure in infrastructure will increase productive capacity
             and shift the LRAS to the right
            examples of research and development and infrastructure.

(b)   Evaluate the effectiveness of interventionist supply-side policies to achieve
      economic growth.                                                                  [15]

      Answers may include:
       definition of interventionist supply-side policies and economic growth
       diagram to show the impact of interventionist supply-side policies on
        economic growth
       explanation of the interventionist supply-side policies that could be used to
        increase the rate of economic growth through:
        - education and training
        - research and development
        - infrastructure
        - industrial policy
       examples of the application of interventionist supply-side policies
       synthesis or evaluation.

      Evaluation may include: the use of interventionist supply-side policies used to
      increase economic growth including:
       cost and effectiveness of the interventionist supply-side policies
       time it takes for the policy to increase economic growth
       implications for different stakeholders
       suggestion of alternatives to interventionist supply-side policies.

      Examiners should be aware that candidates may take a different approach
      which, if appropriate, should be rewarded.

      Opinions or conclusions should be presented clearly and should be supported
      by appropriate examples.
