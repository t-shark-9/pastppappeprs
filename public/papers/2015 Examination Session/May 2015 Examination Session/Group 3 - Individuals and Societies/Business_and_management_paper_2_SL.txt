Answer one question from this section.

1.   Nzuri Kio (NK)

     Nzuri Kio (NK) is a company that manufactures products made of glass, such as windows and
     table tops. NK sells its products in its own regional trading bloc, a group of eight countries that all
     have developing economies. NK is located in a poor country where the national government is not
     very efficient and public sector services are limited. The country’s infrastructure needs investment,
     and quality of life is low. At school, students are in very big classes, with over sixty students in
     each; few students complete middle school.

     The manager of NK is considering purchasing new, high-quality equipment for its factory:
     glass-making machines from Carrucci SpA. Carrucci SpA is an Italian company that makes
     the best glass manufacturing equipment in the world. Its computerized equipment is innovative
     and very efficient. Glass can be cut perfectly, with almost no waste. However, the equipment is
     expensive and requires highly skilled workers. The new equipment would lead to a better product,
     which should result in higher sales and a higher gross profit margin.

     The total cost of the equipment is $800 000. NK is considering two different sources of finance:
     • (Option A) a seven-year $720 000 bank loan.
     • (Option B) selling $800 000 in shares.

     Financial information for NK, for the year ending 31 May 2014:

      Cash                     $176 000
      Cost of goods sold      $3 900 000
      Creditors                $230 000
      Debtors                  $674 000
      Expenses                $3 800 000
      Interest                 $120 000
      Loan capital                X
      Net fixed assets        $2 600 000
      Retained profit          $970 000
      Share capital            $300 000
      Sales revenue           $8 200 000
      Short-term borrowing     $270 000
      Stock                    $320 000
      Tax                        $70 000

(Question 1 continued)

     (a)   Using a PEST framework, describe two external factors that may affect NK.                [4]

     (b)   Using data from the table:

		         (i)    calculate loan capital X (show all your working);                                 [2]

		         (ii)   construct a fully labelled balance sheet for NK;                                  [4]

		(iii)           calculate NK’s gross profit margin (no working required);                         [1]

		(iv)            calculate NK’s forecasted gearing ratio for Option A and for Option B (show all
                  your working).                                                                    [4]

     (c)   Examine the disadvantages of Option A and of Option B as sources of finance for
           the purchase of the new equipment.                                                       [5]




                                                                                              Turn over

2.   Exploration Toys (ET)

     Exploration Toys (ET) manufactures educational toys. Dr Berac Loïc set up the business in 2006.
     ET’s unique selling point (USP) is that its toys are not only safe and fun, but also teach children
     to explore and solve problems. ET sells directly to consumers online, business-to-customers
     (B2C), and relies only on word-of-mouth promotion*. ET set its toy prices higher than those of its
     competitors.

     Table 1: selected data for ET, for 2014.

      Sales revenue                      €300 000
      Number of toys sold                  12 500
      Fixed costs                        €121 800
      Variable cost per toy                   €10

     By 2014, sales had stopped growing. A marketing consultant told Berac that with only
     word-of-mouth and B2C e-commerce sales, the situation would not improve. She recommended
     that ET restructure its marketing mix to include more promotion, lower prices, and an additional
     sales method called “toy parties”. ET would need to recruit part-time sales associates
     (representatives) to host the toy parties. At the parties parents could see the toys and children
     could play with them. The sales associates would sell ET’s toys on a commission-only basis.

     However, if sales grew significantly ET would need to lease a larger factory, which would
     increase fixed costs. Berac forecasted financial data based on the marketing consultant’s
     recommendations.

     Table 2: forecasted financial data for ET, for 2015.

      Cash sales revenue          €352 000
      Closing cash balance at
      year-end 2014                €37 000
      Fixed assets                 €40 000
      Fixed costs                 €180 000
      Raw materials               €128 000
      Sales commissions            €32 000
      Other variable costs         €32 000




* word-of-mouth promotion: information passing from one person to another or others
                              through oral communication

(Question 2 continued)

     (a)   Describe ET’s current distribution channel and the channel recommended by the
           marketing consultant.                                                                         [4]

     (b)   (i)     Using Table 1, calculate ET’s net profit margin for 2014 (show all your working).     [2]

		(ii)             Using Table 2, calculate ET’s forecasted net profit margin for 2015 (show all
                   your working).                                                                        [2]

		         (iii)   Comment on the change in net profit margin from 2014 (actual) and 2015
                   (forecasted).                                                                         [3]

     (c)   Using relevant data from Table 2, prepare an annual cash-flow forecast for ET,
           for 2015.                                                                                     [4]

     (d)   Examine two reasons why ET originally charged higher prices for its toys than those
           charged by its competitors.                                                                   [5]

Answer two questions from this section.

3.   Starvation Peak Running Shoes (SP)

     Starvation Peak Running Shoes (SP) is
     a shop that sells running shoes in Santa
     Fe, New Mexico, United States (US). Its
     name comes from the local mountain called
     “Starvation Peak”.

     SP customers can buy running shoes at
     a lower price online, but SP has a unique
     selling point (USP) concerning its vision and
     its local reputation. SP’s vision statement is:
     “Running sustains life, locally and globally”.
                                                             Starvation Peak, New Mexico
     SP is very well known locally, as they
     support the local running community in the Santa Fe area. They do so in several ways by:
     • sponsoring “running days” at schools
     • giving discounts to children and students
     • offering “running clinics”, where SP employees help people improve their running techniques
     • organizing races and other local events.

     The biggest event organized by SP is its annual “Race to the Top” on Starvation Peak. According
     to a local legend, a tribe of Native Americans forced enemies up to the peak, where they died
     of hunger (starvation). SP promotes the event with the slogan: “Running sustains life, even on
     Starvation Peak”. “Race to the Top” has been popular for ten years. However, there are now
     conflicts between stakeholders. Local businesses like the event, as it attracts tourists to the area.
     One pressure group, however, argues that it portrays Native Americans in a negative way. Another
     pressure group argues that the event damages the natural environment of the mountain. The local
     authorities managing Starvation Peak have been asked to refuse permission for SP’s
     “Race to the Top”.

     (a)   Describe one type of below the line promotion that SP may use to promote its
           “running clinics”.                                                                          [2]

     (d)   Advise the local authorities as to whether permission for SP’s “Race to the Top” should
           be refused.                                                                                 [7]

4.   The significance of changes in international labour mobility

     Though the global population may grow from 7 billion in 2011 to 7.6 billion by 2020, many countries
     will experience a decline in the number of working-age people. Already in Japan and Europe, each
     year more people retire from the workforce than young people enter it. By 2020, this problem will
     also affect Russia, Canada and China. Other countries such as India, Brazil and Indonesia have
     young populations and young workforces.

     Unfortunately, many people lack the skills that employers need. A recent study found that 31 % of
     employers worldwide struggle to fill jobs requiring basic skills. 65 % of multinational companies
     have difficulty recruiting new employees with advanced skills. In emerging economies the problem
     is worse. Difficulties in meeting operational objectives of recruitment prevent many companies
     from meeting their strategic objectives.

     Companies are responding by recruiting new employees from other countries. This practice is
     called “expanded recruitment”. It has led to more international labour mobility, diverse workforces
     within companies, and diversity in global cities.

     Supporters of expanded recruitment argue that the labour problem is demographic: the best
     solution is to make labour mobility easier. Furthermore, diversity both within companies and in
     society should improve international understanding and will increase creativity. Critics of expanded
     recruitment argue that it does not solve the real problem: many jobs require advanced skills, and
     most educational systems have not responded to those needs. Expanded recruitment has also
     created other issues for companies, such as problems in communication.

     Expanded recruitment has also led to some anger in countries and local communities not
     accustomed to large immigrant populations.

     (a)   Identify one opportunity and one constraint for companies caused by demographic
           change.                                                                                      [2]

     (b)   Comment on one potential communication problem for a company with a diverse
           international workforce.                                                                     [2]

     (c)   Explain the statement “difficulties in meeting operational objectives of recruitment
           prevent many companies from meeting their strategic objectives”.                             [4]

     (d)   Analyse one strategy that a global company could adopt for developing future human
           resources (you may refer to a global company that you have studied).                         [5]

5.   Coca-Cola India

     The American company Coca-Cola is investing financially and strategically in India. Thirteen
     Indian businesses have received contracts to prepare and package Coca-Cola drinks across India.
     Over 7000 distributors and 2.2 million retailers, supermarkets and restaurants are selling
     Coca-Cola drinks. For Coca-Cola, success in India is an important part of the business’s strategy,
     as India has a population of over 1 billion people. A question faced by Coca-Cola is whether it
     should use market development or market penetration strategies.

     Coca-Cola India has a wide product portfolio including Coca-Cola and other brands such as
     Limca and Sprite. Coca-Cola India directly employs over 25 000 people and has created indirect
     employment for more than 150 000 people through its vast logistics, supply and distribution.

     Coca-Cola India has recently piloted an online store for the growing e-commerce market through
     the website Coke2Home.com. The online store will provide consumers with an alternative channel
     to buy Coca-Cola drinks. Consumers can also learn about the full range of Coca-Cola’s drinks on
     the website and sign up to receive special promotions via email or mobile phone message.

     Although the online store is working very well in some cities, there are still some difficulties:
     • Because delivery costs are high, Coke2Home.com accepts only large orders such as for parties
        and celebrations.
     • Many Coca-Cola retailers and supermarkets fear that Coke2Home.com will create a new form
        of competition.
