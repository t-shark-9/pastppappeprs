                                               Section A
Prescribed subject 1           The origins and rise of Islam c500–661

1.   (a)   What, according to Source C, were the ways in which Islam helped in the early Arab
           conquests?                                                                                   [3]

            It acted as the driving force and gave the conquests impetus;
            It was a cohesive movement that helped to unite a diverse group;
            The promise of heaven as offered by Islam was a deciding factor for the participation of
             some people.

     Award [1] for each relevant point up to a maximum of [3].

     (b)   What is the message conveyed by Source E?                                                    [2]

              The Arab conquests were substantial, covering a wide territory;
              The Arabs were able to advance into the Byzantine and Sassanian Empires;
              Based on the dates of the battles, the speed of the advance was relatively quick;
              The speed and extent of the conquests may show the strength of Arab forces;
              Medina was the origin of the campaigns;
              The Arabs were initially a land-based power.

     Award [1] for each relevant point up to a maximum of [2].
                                                 –4–                  M15/3/HISTI/BP1/ENG/TZ0/XX/M


2.   Compare and contrast the views expressed in Sources A and B about the reasons for the early
     success of the Arab conquests.                                                              [6]

     For “compare”
      Both sources generally discuss the weaknesses of the both the Byzantine and Sassanian
       Empires;
      Both sources stress the toll that war had taken on the two empires;
      Both sources discuss the Byzantine Empire’s weak hold over Syria which ‘was still tenuous’ in
       Source A and ‘undermined’ in Source B.

     For “contrast”
      Source A mentions Arab strengths, such as organized force and/or military skill and experience
       and/or the role of the camel in facilitating effective “campaigns fought over wide areas” whereas
       Source B suggests that the Arabs undertook a “violent assault” on their opponents;
      Source B also diminishes the importance of the Arabs in achieving success whereas Source A
       stresses the significance of their actions, motives and convictions;
      Source A suggests that both empires were similarly weak and largely unable to withstand the
       Arab onslaught whereas Source B suggests that Byzantium was stronger and was inhibited as
       much by other outside forces as much as by the Arabs.

     Do not demand all of the above. If only one source is discussed award a maximum of [2]. If the two
     sources are discussed separately award [3] or with excellent linkage [4–5]. For maximum [6] expect
     a detailed running comparison/contrast. Award up to [5] if the two sources are linked/integrated in
     either a running comparison or contrast.
                                                   –5–                    M15/3/HISTI/BP1/ENG/TZ0/XX/M


3.   With reference to their origin and purpose, assess the value and limitations of Source C and
     Source D for historians studying the early growth of the Islamic Empire.                              [6]

     Source C
     Origin:        Philip Hitti, a professor of Semitic literature writing in a general history book in 1937.

     Purpose:       General history book covering the whole history of the Arabs and so is designed to
                    give an overview.

     Value:         Hitti, as a professor, might be considered to have some expertise. He is likely to
                    have done much research before writing the book and he has the benefit of
                    reflection.

     Limitations:   As a textbook that covers a large period it does not have the depth of information on
                    the topic that a specialist study would. Hitti might not be an expert on all the topics
                    within the book. His writings may be influenced by his cultural and/or religious
                    outlook.

     Source D
     Origin:        John Bagot Glubb, a retired British military officer with some experience in the
                    Middle East. The book is a non-academic short history written in 1978.

     Purpose:       To provide a general and non-specialist overview of the history of the Arab peoples
                    for a popular audience.

     Value:         The author has some military understanding and has experience in the Middle East.
                    He may, therefore, have a good understanding of the nature of warfare in those
                    conditions. He has the benefit of hindsight and may have had access to a wide
                    range of resources.

     Limitations:   The book is a general text that covers a large period. It is a non-specialist volume
                    on the political history of the region. The author is not an academic historian and
                    may lack knowledge or understanding of the past. The author’s treatment of the
                    early Islamic conquests might be narrow and based on his military background; in
                    addition, the author’s Western background may influence his writings.

     Do not expect all of the above. Ideally there will be a balance between the two sources,
     and each one can be marked out of [3], but allow a [4/2] split. If only one source is assessed,
     mark out of [4]. For a maximum of [6] candidates must refer to both origin and purpose, and value
     and limitations in their assessment.
                                                 –6–                  M15/3/HISTI/BP1/ENG/TZ0/XX/M


4.   Using the sources and your own knowledge, to what extent do you agree that it was the weakness
     of the Byzantine and Sassanian Empires that allowed the early Muslim conquests?             [8]

     Source material
     Source A:   Both empires had been weakened by wars and plague. The Byzantines’ hold over
                 Syria was insecure. However, the Arabs were organized and also had strengths.
                 They had military skill and experience. Many also had religious or economic
                 reasons to succeed.
     Source B:     Both empires had been ravaged by war and this had exhausted them. There were
                   also religious divisions, a succession crisis in the Sassanian Empire and peasant
                   discontent. The Byzantine Empire also had rebellious subjects. Both governments
                   were very unpopular and therefore vulnerable.
     Source C:     The focus is on Arab strengths, including: religious enthusiasm that brought unity
                   and the desire to go to heaven; the desire to achieve economic gains; the necessity
                   for conquest amongst some groups.
     Source D:     This source is focused on Arab military strategy and the use of camels to bring
                   success. This allowed them to move freely in the desert, which the Byzantines and
                   Sassanians could not.
     Source E:     The size of both of the empires may imply an inherent weakness. Also, the number
                   of battles fought could have weakened the empires. But they could have weakened
                   the Arabs too. The fact that campaigns originated in Medina may imply organization
                   while dates may imply priorities and territorial targets.
     Own knowledge
     This may include reference to: the general historical context associated with the successful
     conclusion of the Apostasy Wars under Abu Bakr (632–634). This may be seen as a dress
     rehearsal for the conquests, in that they provided Arabs with experience, contributed to their zeal
     and allowed the caliphate to exploit their raiding energies. Triumph in the Apostasy Wars and the
     unity of Arabia naturally led to expansion beyond Arabia. The power vacuum that was a result of
     the collapse of both empires (with particular attention to social factors, such as discontent among
     local Christian Arabs in Syria and Egypt and minorities in Iraq and Persia) may also be discussed.
     There is enough evidence that Muslim armies were not only welcomed by such groups but also
     that they were supported and aided by them. Tolerant Muslim policies towards the Christian and
     Jewish populations of Syria, Egypt and Iraq might have encouraged these people to desert their
     rulers and join the Muslim armies. Religious factors such as Islam acting as an ideology that
     cemented the bond among the Arab forces and unifying them are also valid areas for
     consideration. Reference may also be made to the effective leadership of Umar ibn al-Khattab
     (634-644) who succeeded Abu Bakr and complemented his work. This was the catalyst for
     full-scale conquests that transformed the Islamic umma into an empire in a short period. Umar ibn
     al-Khattab’s Caliphate also demonstrated that conquests were planned (it may be noted that Syria
     had been a priority). In supporting the idea of planned conquests, reference may be made to the
     fact that a standing army had been created by Umar, armies were assembled in Medina and
     commanders had been appointed by the Caliph based on an established policy.
     Some candidates might provide more details on the weaknesses of the Byzantine and Sassanian
     Empires such as the collapse of Hira and, therefore, the influence of the Sassanians in that area
     (they lost control of the region and this made it easier for the Arabs to seize it); the Sassanian
     Empire was alien in its customs, language and religion; the problems of succession in the
     Sassanian Empire (particularly the policies of Khusrau II Parvez); floods in irrigated areas of
     Southern Iraq also weakened the Sassanian Empire.
     Do not expect all the above and accept other relevant material. If only source material or own
     knowledge is used the maximum mark that can be obtained is [5]. For maximum [8] expect
     argument, synthesis of source material and own knowledge, as well as references to the sources
     used.

                                             Section B
Prescribed subject 2          The kingdom of Sicily 1130–1302

5.   (a)   What, according to Source A, were the qualities of William I as king?                   [3]

            Although William was powerful, he was a poor ruler, and it is even suggested that he was
             mad;
            William made poor decisions about appointments, removing able administrators and
             relying solely on the advice of one man who helped considerably in the collapse of the
             kingdom;
            William allowed the court of Sicily to deteriorate;
            William was a tyrant, locking his father’s advisors in prison.

     Award [1] for each relevant point up to a maximum of [3].

     (b)   What is the message conveyed by Source E?                                               [2]

              The palace is a symbol of William’s power as a ruler;
              The kingdom was wealthy, as suggested by the splendour of the palace and its gardens;
              The palace may show that he supported architecture and cultural activities;
              He used grandiose architecture to express and suggest great power and dominance;
              The palace may reflect some Muslim influence in Sicily.

     Award [1] for each relevant point up to a maximum of [2].
                                                –8–                  M15/3/HISTI/BP1/ENG/TZ0/XX/M


6.   Compare and contrast the views expressed in Sources B and C about the nature of
     William I’s rule.                                                                                 [6]

     For “compare”
      Both sources mention the fear that William’s rule generated;
      Both passages suggest that William successfully suppressed rebellion;
      Some candidates may suggest that the firmness of justice mentioned in Source C is similar to
       the unforgiving nature of William towards treason or rebellion.

     For “contrast”
      Source B suggests that William dealt harshly with his own rebellious subjects, but Source C
       suggests that William was just, (although some may develop this and note Source C also
       suggests that justice was firm);
      Source B shows only William’s cruelty whereas Source C refers to his achievements and
       wealth;
      Source B describes William as pitiless, whereas Source C offers a more positive image, using
       words such as glorious and brilliant;
      Source C magnifies William’s reputation whereas Source B refers only to his actions in Sicily.

     Do not demand all of the above. If only one source is discussed award a maximum of
     [2]. If the two sources are discussed separately award [3] or with excellent linkage [4–5]. For
     maximum [6] expect a detailed running comparison/contrast. Award up to [5] if two sources are
     linked/integrated in either a running comparison or contrast.
                                                   –9–                   M15/3/HISTI/BP1/ENG/TZ0/XX/M


7.   With reference to their origin and purpose, discuss the value and limitations of Source C and
     Source D for historians studying the government of William I.                                         [6]

     Source C
     Origins:       A letter from the Pope to William written just after the end of the revolts of 1156.

     Purpose:       To accept the terms of the Treaty of Benvenuto and to flatter William after being
                    besieged by him.

     Value:         It is contemporary to events and provides evidence of how the Pope tried to flatter
                    William, showing William’s power and how even Popes were forced to recognize
                    him.

     Limitations:   It is written to flatter and therefore the praise of William may not be justified. There
                    is no evidence of the claims the letter made about justice, peace and fear. It might
                    be seen as a piece of propaganda.

     Source D
     Origins:       Malcolm Barber, a professor of history specialising in the Middle Ages in an
                    academic book that was published in 2004.

     Purpose:       To convey information and inform those interested in a specific period in medieval
                    history.

     Value:         Barber is a professor of history who specializes in the period and who may be
                    considered to be an expert in the subject. He is likely to have done much research
                    before writing it. He is likely to have used a range of sources and will have the
                    benefit of reflection.

     Limitations:   The book covers a large period and it may not have the requisite depth of
                    information on the topic that a specialist study would. Barber might not be an expert
                    on all the topics within the book. He also refers back to Falcandus so may be
                    influenced or prejudiced by his views.

     Do not expect all of the above. Ideally there will be a balance between the two sources,
     and each one can be marked out of [3], but allow a [4/2] split. If only one source is assessed,
     mark out of [4]. For a maximum of [6] candidates must refer to both origin and purpose, and value
     and limitations in their assessment.

8.   Using the sources and your own knowledge, to what extent do you agree with the view in Source C
     that William’s rule brought a period of peace to his kingdom’s people?                       [8]

     Source material
     Source A:   Falcandus suggests that the influence of Maio did not bring peace but resulted in the
                 destruction and overthrow of the realm. He also suggests that William’s rule
                 resulted in deterioration of the organization of the court.

     Source B:     This source considers the outcome of the 1156 rebellion, which shows that William
                   was able to defeat the rebels. The source also suggests that William was
                   determined to leave such an impression in Apulia that there would not be another
                   rebellion

     Source C:     This source suggests that William restored peace. It suggests that William
                   established a period of just rule. The author also noted that William created fear
                   among his enemies, which it might be argued would stop future unrest or, it might be
                   argued, encourage disquiet. However, the circumstances in which the letter was
                   written might be noted and it could be suggested that the Pope had little choice but
                   to flatter William.

     Source D:     The source suggests that although unrest had been put down, the defeat of the
                   rebels had not removed the causes of their grievances and therefore suggest that
                   future unrest was likely. It could be argued that the influence of Maio added to the
                   tension; he was unpopular and had excluded from government and consultation
                   those whom the king was accustomed to consult. It suggests that there could be
                   factional strife and that many in the kingdom would feel excluded, particularly given
                   the nature of Maio’s personality.

     Source E:     The building of such a palace during William’s rule suggests strength and the
                   tranquillity of the palace gives the impression of stability and wealth. The latter
                   would also suggest that there was peace in the kingdom. The palace gives the
                   impression that William had power, suggesting his rule was not challenged, or at
                   least that was the impression he wanted to give. The affluence reflected in the
                   palace might also help to create such an image.

     Own knowledge
     This may include reference to the supposed conspiracy surrounding Maio and rumours that he was
     plotting William’s assassination. There might be reference to the murder of Maio in 1160 and the
     attack by a mob on his palace. Until Maio’s death there was stability, but once he was killed the
     kingdom was more volatile. Against this, some may note that peace was made with the Greeks in
     1158, but that the African dominions were lost. After Maio’s death it might be noted that for a while
     William was in the hands of the conspirators who proposed to either murder or depose him.
     However, it could also be noted that this failed as the army and people rallied to him and he was
     able to crush the unrest. This was followed by a peaceful period under the influence of palace
     administrators such as Matthew Ajello, also known as Matthew the notary.

     Do not expect all the above and accept other relevant material. If only source material or own
     knowledge is used the maximum mark that can be obtained is [5]. For maximum [8] expect
     argument, synthesis of source material and own knowledge, as well as references to the sources
     used.
