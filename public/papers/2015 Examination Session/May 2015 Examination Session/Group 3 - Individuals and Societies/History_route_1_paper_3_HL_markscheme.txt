Paper 3 markbands: The following bands provide a précis of the full markbands for paper 3 published in the
History guide (2008) on pages 77–81. They are intended to assist marking but must be used in conjunction with
the full markbands found in the guide. For the attention of all examiners: if you are uncertain about the
content/accuracy of a candidate’s work please contact your team leader.

  18–20: Answers are clearly focused with a high degree of the awareness of the question and may challenge it
         successfully. Knowledge is extensive, accurately applied and there may be a high level of conceptual
         ability. Evaluation of different approaches may be present as may be understanding of historical
         processes as well as comparison and contrast where relevant. Evaluation is integrated into the answer.
         The answer is well-structured and well-focused. Synthesis is highly developed.
  15–17: Answers are clearly structured and focused, have full awareness of the demands of the question, and if
         appropriate may challenge it. Accurate and detailed historical knowledge is used convincingly to support
         critical commentary. Historical processes such as comparison and contrast, placing events in context
         and evaluating different interpretations are used appropriately and effectively. Answers are well-
         structured and balanced and synthesis is well-developed and supported with knowledge and critical
         commentary.
  12–14: Answers are clearly focused on the demands of the question. Relevant in-depth knowledge is applied
         as evidence, and analysis or critical commentary are used to indicate some in-depth understanding but
         is not consistent throughout. Events are placed in context and there is sound understanding of historical
         processes and comparison and contrast. Evaluation of different approaches may be used to
         substantiate arguments presented. Synthesis is present but not always consistently integrated. Focus
         on AO3 and AO4.
  9–11: Answers indicate that the question is understood but not all implications considered. Knowledge is
         largely accurate. Critical commentary may be present. Events are generally placed in context, and
         historical processes, such as comparison and contrast, are understood. There is a clear attempt at a
         structured approach. Focus on AO1, AO2 and AO4. Responses that simply summarize the views of
         historians cannot reach the top of this markband.
  7–8:   The demands of the question are generally understood. Relevant, historical knowledge is present but is
         unevenly applied. Knowledge is narrative or descriptive in nature. There may be limited argument that
         requires further substantiation. Critical commentary may be present. An attempt to place events in
         historical context and show an understanding of historical processes. An attempt at a structured
         approach, either chronological or thematic has been made.
  5–6:   Answers indicate some understanding of the question, but historical knowledge is limited in quality and
         quantity. Understanding of historical processes may be present but underdeveloped. The question is
         only partially addressed.
  3–4:    There is little understanding of the question. Historical knowledge is present but the detail is insufficient.
          Historical context or processes are barely understood and there are little more than poorly substantiated
          assertions.
  1–2:    Answers do not meet the demands of the question and show little or no evidence of appropriate
          structure. There is little more than unsupported generalization.
  0:      Answers not meeting the requirements of descriptors should be awarded no marks.

  Examiners and moderators are reminded of the need to apply the markbands that provide the “best fit” to the
  responses given by candidates and to award credit wherever it is possible to do so. If an answer indicates
  that the demands of the question are understood and addressed but that not all implications are considered
  (eg, compare or contrast; reasons or significance; methods or success), then examiners should not be
  afraid of using the full range of marks allowed for by the markscheme: ie, responses that offer good coverage of
  some of the criteria should be rewarded accordingly.

Christianity c500–1300

1.   Examine the reasons for, and the results of, monastic reform after 900.

     The reasons for monastic reform after 900 may include: monastic reform was part of a wider desire
     for the reform of corruption and immorality in the Church into which monasteries had fallen; pious
     individuals such as Duke William I of Aquitaine who founded the monastery of Cluny became a
     beacon for the reformers; there was a widespread desire to escape the lawless and brutal
     conditions of the medieval period; a desire for a more ascetic and pious lifestyle became
     widespread and led to the foundation of orders such as the Carthusians and Cistercians who
     practiced strict codes of conduct and piety. In addition to these, the rise of highly inspirational
     leaders such as Bernard of Clairvaux attracted thousands to the new monastic orders. A further
     cause of monastic reform was the Crusades, which led to the founding of military orders to combat
     Islam and defend the Holy Land. Overall, monastic reform was part of a wider movement for the
     reform of the Church, a desire for a more ascetic life and a more ordered and peaceful society.

     The results of the monastic reform movement may include: an enormous number of new orders
     founded for both men and women attracted thousands of adherents; the movement assisted in
     Church reform and produced numerous leaders for the Church; monasteries were centres of
     culture and learning, which aided the growth of education, increased social services and helped
     create a new respect for order. Furthermore, extensive contributions to the economy through their
     reforms of agriculture and construction projects encouraged technical progress. The negative side
     was that many of those who were attracted to the new orders lacked genuine piety and, as the
     wealth and influence of the new orders increased, contributed to the descent back into the
     corruption and immorality that had previously existed. This served to weaken the reputation of the
     Church over time and led to renewed calls for change and reformation.

     responses. However, the list is not exhaustive and no set answer is required.

2.   Examine the reasons for the increase in the political and social influence of the Church after 1000.

     Candidates must discuss the reasons for the rise in the social and political influence after 1000CE.
     Candidates should discuss a range of reasons and not limit themselves to the discussion of a
     single example such as the Investiture crisis.

     The reasons for the increase in the political and social influence of the Church may include: the
     movement of Church reform increased respect for the Church; numerous new monastic orders
     increased its influence in the economy, education, charity and social work; outstanding individuals
     such as Saint Bernard and Popes Gregory VII and Innocent III asserted the rights and
     independence of the Church with respect to secular rulers (this led to the Investiture controversy
     and an Imperial Diet at Worms as well as conflicts with rulers in France and England). The Church
     was able to assert its moral authority over secular rulers as a general principle and influence their
     policies in numerous cases, the Crusades further increased the power and prestige of the Church.
     The wealth of the Church and its monopoly on the spiritual fate of the population gave it
     considerable authority. The Church guarded this monopoly by erasing all heresies and dissent.
     The presence of many clerics in secular administrations gave the Church further influence.

     The above material is an indication of what candidates may elect to write about in their
     responses. However, the list is not exhaustive and no set answer is required.

The Fatimids 909–1171

3.   Evaluate the reasons why the Fatimids failed to replace the Abbasid Caliphate.

     The reasons for the failure of the Fatimids to replace the Abbasid caliphate include the fact that
     their seizure of Baghdad in 1056 and their declaration of the end of the Abbasid dynasty were not
     successful because of the opposition of the Seljuks. Failure was based on growing internal
     problems in the Fatimid Empire which brought about civil war and divisions within the army. There
     was increasing political division between the Fatimid caliph and the head of the administration. At
     the moment when they made their attempt to seize the caliphate in Baghdad, their power was in
     decline and thus the effort could not be sustained. Also the Fatimids were diverting some of their
     attention to their struggles with the Umayyads in Spain and this contributed to the weakening of
     their power versus the Abbasids. The resurgence of the Sunni orthodoxy, further weakened the
     Fatimid efforts to seize power.

     responses. However, the list is not exhaustive and no set answer is required.

4.   “The Fatimid state was very progressive in its political, religious and economic policies.” Discuss.

     Religious matters
     The Fatimids were a revolutionary group in so far as they were a major religious group that
     departed from both the Sunni and existing Shia divisions of Islam. They practised liberal policies
     with respect to other faiths within their empire as well as other groups within Islam. They did not
     force conversions or discriminate against non-Ismaili citizens despite having conquered their
     territories. This allowed them to expand and prosper. Their relations resembled the Convivencia
     practised in Muslim Spain.

     Politics
     The Fatimid Empire had a very pragmatic approach to government. The office holders were
     largely chosen by merit regardless of family or religious association. This brought men of ability to
     the administration and minimized internal conflict between different sectors of society. This
     method was very different from the governments in other areas, which tended to be dominated by
     a particular sect or kinship group. This inclusive policy of selection by merit was very progressive.

     Trade
     The Fatimids understood and supported the expansion of trade. They were among the leaders in
     sea-borne commerce, as well as establishing links by sea from the Indian Ocean to the
     Mediterranean. They also encouraged and developed extensive trade with Western Europe. Their
     expansion of trade was also a vehicle for the expansion of their version of Islam, as missionaries
     often accompanied merchants. They understood trade as both a source of wealth but also a
     means to expand political and cultural influence.

     Candidates may comment on the fact that the governmental and religious policies of the Fatimids
     deteriorated over time, which led to internal disputes, factions, civil war and collapse. This
     indicates that these policies were not well established in the state.

     responses. However, the list is not exhaustive and no set answer is required.

Monarchies in England and France 1066–1223

5.   Evaluate the reasons for the increased power of the French monarchy by 1223.

     Policies of the French government which aided in the increase in power may include: the Capetian
     rulers pursued a steady policy of increasing their territories; reducing the power of nobles; alliances
     with the Church and the towns, which increased their power and prestige and allowed them to
     recruit a bureaucracy to impose their authority. Increased use of taxation and legal systems
     expanded central power and reduced local rivals. The use of diplomacy and marriage increased
     territory and influence as well.

     The demise of powerful rivals such as the Angevins was a major cause of the increase in their
     power; the internal divisions in the Angevin family increased the ability of the French kings to
     expand territory and influence. The failure of their rivals, for example, the Holy Roman Emperor
     and kings of England to defeat them militarily further solidified and confirmed their power.

     responses. However, the list is not exhaustive and no set answer is required.

     so.


6.   Examine the reasons for, and the results of, William I’s (1066–1087) and Henry I’s (1100–1135)
     attempts to reduce the power of the nobility.

     Both William I and Henry I sought to increase their authority through reducing the power of those
     nobles who might prove to be their major rivals. The methods and results may include: William I
     built castles manned by royal troops to enforce his authority; Henry I destroyed illegal castles and
     forced nobles to seek building permission; William I limited noble landholdings and retained
     significant territory for himself, this reduced noble power and increased his own (and was a policy
     that was continued by Henry I); the feudal system required all nobles to swear fealty to the ruler as
     another means of control; Henry and William developed good relations with the Church, which
     increased their power; both men developed effective taxation systems through the Domesday
     Book and pipe rolls, which increased their power; their use of the sheriffs and other bureaucrats as
     well as a central legal system further weakened the potential power and influence of the nobles.
     The replacement of nobles with middle-class officials further limited their influence in government.

     responses. However, the list is not exhaustive and no set answer is required.

The Crusades 1095–1291

7.   “The Papacy had more non-religious than religious reasons to launch the First Crusade
     (1095–1099).” To what extent do you agree with this statement?

     The non-religious motives of the Papacy may include: a desire to increase power and prestige with
     respect to the Orthodox Church by conquering the Holy Land and Jerusalem and thus laying claim
     to the leadership of the Christian world; the conquered territories would come under the influence
     of Rome thus expanding the Pope’s rule; a successful crusade would increase the power of the
     Papacy in its struggle with secular rulers in Europe; the Crusade would provide opportunities for
     the Church to increase its wealth and social prestige; the Papacy could curb violence in Europe by
     encouraging, for example, aggressive knights to use the Crusade as an outlet for their energies.

     Candidates may argue that the Papacy had religious motives for the Crusades. These might
     include: a genuine desire to defeat Islam and recover the Holy Land for Christianity; a missionary
     duty to spread the faith and defeat the infidels; a desire to increase levels of religious devotion in
     Europe.

8.   To what extent was the foundation of the Crusader States the most significant result of the
     First Crusade (1095–1099)?

     The reasons that the foundation of the Crusader States was such a significant outcome of the First
     Crusade include: the Crusader States gave the Christians a firm presence in the Middle East that
     might be used to expand their influence; they had the potential to be united into one powerful
     Christian kingdom; they provided the basis for military garrisons and supported the building of
     castles and the establishment of the military orders such as the Templars and the Hospitallers who
     defended the Christian territory; the capture and establishment of Jerusalem as a Christian city
     marked the First Crusade as a success and increased the prestige of the Papacy, which had
     sponsored the First Crusade. This gave the Popes increased power and prestige within Europe
     and in their relations with the Byzantine Empire.

     The establishment of the Crusader States would also be an inducement to others to come to the
     Middle East and try to acquire land and territories as a means to enrich themselves and this
     process might further expand the Christian influence.

The Mongols 1200–1405

9.    Examine the reasons for, and the results of, the Mamluk victory at ‘Ayn Jalut.

      The reasons for the defeat of the Mongols at ‘Ayn Jalut may include: the Mongols had limited
      forces available, as the majority of the army had returned to the East because of the death of the
      Khan; the Mamluks had an outstanding commander in Baybars who adopted some of the Mongol
      tactics in order to defeat them; the Mongol general made a serious tactical error during the battle
      and fell into a trap set by the Mamluks; the Mongols found the terrain difficult due to the lack of
      water and pasture for their horses; the Mongols failed to achieve an alliance with the Christians,
      which would have strengthened their forces.

      The results of the battle may include: the Mongol conquest of the Middle East was halted and Syria
      and Egypt were never conquered; the Mongols concentrated their empire eastward from Iraq into
      Iran and China; the Mamluks became the ruling dynasty in Egypt until 1517; Egypt became the
      centre of the Arab world.

10.   “The successful invasion of the Muslim world by the Mongols was the consequence of their military
      skill and tactics.” To what extent do you agree with this statement?

      Mongol military skill and tactics may include: individual skills of warriors as horsemen and archers;
      the speed of their movements; their ability to endure hardship and move quickly over long
      distances; their ability to learn new military techniques such as siege warfare; the tactics of
      surprise and movement that they used to defeat opponents. In addition their military reputation
      caused many opponents to surrender or flee without fighting. Their use of psychological warfare
      also caused many opponents to collapse without a struggle for fear of extermination. The Mongols
      also extended mercy to those who surrendered, which further undermined the morale of their
      opponents who preferred not to fight and encouraged non-resistance.

      The non-military reasons for their victory may include: the weakness of the Muslim powers and
      their inability to organize any defence; the desire of many citizens to overthrow their rulers, which
      led them not to resist; the religious and political divisions of the Islamic world made it impossible to
      mount a serious defence.

Muslim, Christian and Jewish interactions in Spain 711–1492

11.   Examine the reasons for the success of the Reconquista.

      The reasons for the success of the Reconquista may include: the collapse of the Umayyad
      caliphate in 1031 created a series of small Muslim kingdoms; in-fighting provided the Christian
      kingdoms with an opportunity to recover their power; attempts to recover Muslim power through the
      Almoravids and the Almohads failed as they fought each other for control and alienated Muslims in
      Spain through their harsh policies; some Muslim rulers made alliance with Christians to escape the
      rule of the Almohads. Pope Innocent II launched a major Crusade in Spain that brought significant
      reinforcements to the Christian kingdoms. This resulted in the defeat of the Almohads at Las
      Navas de Tolosa in 1212, which allowed the Christians to recover extensive territory.

      Further military support for the Christian kingdoms came from military orders such as the Templars
      and others that were established in Spain. The political and dynastic unity of the Christian
      kingdoms increased their power and limited strife amongst them. All efforts could now focus on the
      recovery of Muslim territory.

      This process continued throughout the 14th and 15th centuries and was aided by continued
      internal dissension in the Muslim kingdoms, which weakened their resistance. The final defeat was
      as a result of the joining of the two powerful Spanish kingdoms Castile and Aragon into one state,
      which had the power to finally eliminate Muslim power in 1492.

12.   Evaluate the success of Umayyad rule in Spain up to 1031.

      The success of Umayyad rule in Spain may include: the creation of the spirit of convivencia in
      which Muslims, Jews and Christians lived in general harmony and demonstrated a model for multi-
      faith and multi-ethnic societies (this was responsible for the intellectual achievements of Umayyad
      Spain and was reflected in the libraries, universities and schools that attracted scholars from both
      the Islamic world and medieval Europe); the economy of Umayyad Spain was successful in the
      development of trade, agriculture and industry; cultural achievements were notable in the
      architecture of great mosques and palaces as well as the artistic works that were displayed there;
      urban centres were developed that exceeded any in Europe with features such as street lighting,
      which was unknown in Europe; the Umayyads successfully defended and expanded their territory
      throughout the period of their rule and regularly defeated their opponents in the Christian
      kingdoms. They failed however to maintain this after 1031 as they were weakened by disputes
      over the succession and the ambition of military leaders who sought to increase their power. This
      resulted in internal dissension and civil war that brought the collapse of the dynasty in 1031.

Emperors and kings 1150–1300

13.   Evaluate the importance of Simon de Montfort in the rise of parliament in England in the
      13th century.

      The importance of Simon de Montfort in the rise in parliamentary power can be ascertained in a
      number of ways, including: his leadership of the movement to limit the king’s power during the
      reign of Henry III; he was instrumental in the creation of the Provisions of Oxford, which provided a
      structure to limit the king’s power and led to a civil war between the king and the barons; de
      Montfort led the barons and defeated and captured the king at Lewes; he laid down a new
      structure for parliament that demanded representation from two knights per shire and two
      burgesses from each borough. This was the basis of future parliaments and expanded it to include
      more than the nobility. Ultimately, it may be argued that de Montfort brought the middle classes
      into parliament. Nevertheless, de Montfort’s uncompromising personality caused a division in the
      parliamentary ranks and alienated many supporters. His death in the resumed civil war with the
      king was probably helpful as it allowed the two sides to reach a compromise in the Statutes of
      Marlborough in 1267.

      De Montfort did not achieve all of his goals but he had made parliament a permanent fixture in
      English and later, British, power, a permanent one. He expanded its membership to a wider part of
      the population and helped establish the principle of the necessity of the need for parliamentary
      consent for taxation and other acts.

      Candidates may comment that his importance may have been overstated as he was part of a
      larger movement by the nobility, beginning with Magna Carta in 1215, to limit the power of the king.
      De Montfort, though a capable military leader, could not have achieved his goals without the
      support of many nobles and others who were working towards the same results. The movement
      continued after his death, as there was a broad consensus that royal power should be limited and
      that parliament should play a role in legislation.

14.   Examine the reasons why either Frederick I (1155–1190) or Frederick II (1220–1250) had difficulty
      in establishing their authority.

      The reasons that caused Frederick I difficulty in establishing his authority may include: he was not
      strong enough to exert his control in Germany so had to rely on alliances with powerful groups
      such as the Welfs; he was not able to achieve his goal of banning private war in Germany as he
      was often absent from the country and could not enforce his decrees; Germany was a feudal
      country where nobles and others guarded their rights and there was no effective central
      administration to control them. Other reasons came from his continuing struggles to control the
      Papacy and the Italian cities. This led to a long series of wars and confrontations that forced
      Frederick to spend much time in Italy, which weakened his hold on Germany, cost much money
      and manpower and was ultimately responsible for his lack of success, as shown by his defeat by
      the Lombard League in 1174. The collapse of his alliance with the Welfs in Germany further
      limited his ability to extend his authority.

      The reasons that limited Frederick II’s ability to establish his authority may include: Germany
      lacked a strong central government and was dominated by the nobility; the divisions within
      Germany increased during his reign and further limited his power; he spent most of his time and
      energy on Italian issues including disputes with the Church and this led to his excommunication on
      a number of occasions and undermined his authority; his struggles against the Italian city states
      were not successful and very costly in men and money; his focus on Italy and especially Sicily
      distracted him from Germany and thus made it difficult to expand his authority there.

Late medieval political crises 1300–1485

15.   Examine the political significance of the deposition of either Edward II (1307–1327) or Richard II
      (1377–1399).

      In the case of both kings, the power of the aristocracy was demonstrated and continued a
      tendency to limit the king's influence that had begun in the 13th century. This reversed a trend in
      expanding royal power and limiting noble power that had begun with William I. This caused a lack
      of respect for the monarchy and central government and created the possibility of the division of
      the state amongst the powerful nobles. The king was forced to behave in a way that pleased the
      nobles. In addition, nobles acquired large private armies to defend their positions and this led to
      conflict and the possibility of civil war.

      In the case of Edward II the immediate political impact was somewhat limited, as his son took the
      throne and re-established his authority to a great degree. Nevertheless, the idea that a king could
      be deposed and killed set a new precedent for the future.

      In the case of Richard II, the Lancastrian family took over the monarchy and began a new dynasty.
      This led to jealousy and resentment and furthered the idea that the king was recognized only as
      long as he could gain support or subdue the nobility. This led to further disputes and struggles to
      acquire the throne and led, ultimately, to the Wars of the Roses.

16.   Evaluate the reasons for, and the results of, challenges to the authority of one 15th century
      monarch.

      Candidates must select one 15th century monarch. Popular choices will be Henry VI and Edward
      IV of England as well as Louis XI and one of the Dukes of Burgundy. Whichever monarch is
      chosen candidates must assess both the reasons for and results of the challenge(s) to their
      authority.

      The reasons for challenges may include: disputes over their claim to the throne; unpopular
      domestic or foreign policies; losses in war; opposition from or conflict with the Church; demands for
      new political power-sharing structures; unattractive personal characteristics or behaviour.

      The results of these challenges may include: attempts to overthrow the monarch; rebellion or civil
      war; changes in government policy or structure; abdication or deposition of the monarch; rise in
      power of powerful factions; suppression of dissent and increased monarchical power; dissolution or
      destruction of any rival group or family.

14th century famine, pestilence and social change

17.   To what extent was the Black Death (1348–1349) the principal cause of the Peasants’ Revolt?

      Candidates must produce a response that outlines their view of the importance of the Black Death
      as a cause of the Peasants’ revolt in 1381. Although they may not see the Black Death as having
      any significance, it must be addressed in their response.

      The causes of the Peasants’ Revolt may include: resentment at poll taxes imposed to pay for the
      war in France; social disintegration brought on by the demise of the feudal system and increasing
      numbers of landless peasants expelled from estates; social unrest caused by challenges to the
      Church through the efforts of John Wycliffe and the Lollards; the presence of a child king which
      encouraged factions and dissent; charismatic leaders such as John Ball; attempts by government
      to limit the freedoms and economic power of peasants and workers through regulations on wages;
      increased power of towns and new commercial economic classes increased pressure for changes
      in government.

      Reasons associated with the Black Death may include: the failure of institutions such as the
      government and the Church to find a solution to the plague destroyed public confidence;
      individuals rejected traditional values and societal structures; lower-class people became more
      aware of their own worth and power after the Black Death had made labour scarce and expensive
      and they demanded more economic and political rights; government attempts to limit the ability of
      survivors to benefit from economic circumstances created anger in the lower classes.

      responses. However, the list is not exhaustive and no set answer is required.

18.   “Famine and plague in the 14th century brought significant economic change to the medieval
      world.” Discuss.

      The famines and plagues caused a significant decline in the population that made labour scarce
      and expensive. This led to landlords shifting to stock-raising from agriculture as it required less
      labour. Also, landlords leased land in larger units to surviving peasants who paid rent instead of
      feudal dues.

      This commercial agriculture reduced the need for large numbers of peasants and caused many to
      be expelled from the land. These landless groups migrated to towns where they became workers
      in new industries; towns increased in size and economic importance. Stock-raising (sheep)
      increased the supply of wool and led to a further growth of textile production and trade. Economic
      power was shifted from the rural landowners to the urban commercial classes. Furthermore, the
      population became more urban, which created a significant change in the nature of employment
      and relative economic power.

      Note: Candidates are required to refer to both famines and plagues in their response. An analysis
      of the impact of the Black Death alone indicates only some understanding of the question.

The Ottomans 1281–1566

19.   Examine the significance of either Mehmet II (1451–1481) or Selim I (1512–1520) as a ruler of the
      Ottoman Empire.

      Candidates must choose one set rulers. They should not produce a narrative of the career of the
      chosen individual but instead provide a clear analysis of how effective and/or important their
      chosen ruler was.

      Mehmet II
      The importance of Mehmet II may include: he captured Constantinople and thus destroyed the
      Byzantine Empire; he expanded and reformed the army through the introduction of artillery and
      other modern technology; he expanded the empire significantly, encompassing areas such as
      Serbia, Moldavia, Wallachia and Albania; he restored Constantinople as a great city through
      extensive rebuilding; he created an international community by encouraging Christians and Jews to
      settle in the Ottoman Empire. This made the Empire much more advanced than the West in terms
      of religious freedom and tolerance. He established and laid the basis for further development of
      law codes and administrative practices that strengthened the Empire. He invited Christian, Jewish
      and Islamic scholars and artists to come to Istanbul to expand and develop its intellectual and
      cultural importance.

      Selim I
      Selim I made a significant contribution in continuing the work of Mehmet II in law and
      administration. He expanded the Empire eastwards and defeated the Safavids in Persia (these
      were Shi’ites who opposed the Sunni orthodoxy of the Ottomans). He conquered Egypt and North
      Africa, eliminating the Mamluk state and greatly expanding the wealth and power of the Empire.
      He also gained control of the holy cities of Mecca and Medina and thus made the Ottomans
      responsible for them and for the annual pilgrimages to them that were crucial to Islamic faith. This
      gave the Ottomans additional prestige in the Islamic world.

20.   “The Ottoman conquest did not bring great change to the Islamic world.” To what extent do you
      agree with this statement?

      Candidates must assess the extent to which the Ottoman conquest had a significant impact on the
      Islamic world. They may challenge the question but must remain focused on the issue of the
      degree of impact.

      The impact that the Ottoman conquest had on the Islamic world may include: a large increase in
      territory in Europe, Middle East and North Africa; the Ottomans created the largest and most
      powerful empire at the time, which severely threatened much of Europe; the prestige of Islam and
      its reputation as a progressive, tolerant and well-ordered society was highest under the Ottomans;
      the Ottoman conquest produced conflict within the Islamic world through the war with the Safavids
      in Persia and this widened the Sunni/Shia divide; the Ottomans brought their military system and
      law codes to the empire along with their philosophy of toleration and maintaining an inclusive
      society; they maintained an effective communication system and trade routes as had existed
      previously; they did not have much impact on the power of local leaders as they left many in place,
      provided they submitted the taxes required and peace was maintained. It may be argued that they
      did not seek to change the areas that they conquered provided that those areas paid taxes and
      maintained loyalty to the regime.

Renaissance government and society in Italy 1300–1500

21.   With reference to two of the following: Julius II; the Medici family; the Sforza family, evaluate the
      impact of their patronage of the arts.

      The importance of the patronage of the suggested people and/or groups may be seen in a number
      of ways, including: the expansion of the employment of artists and increased production of works
      of art in new styles; increased rivalry and/or conflict between cities that sought the talents of the
      best artists; increased expenditure on artworks, which may be argued to have had a broader
      economic impact; the built environment was improved in many areas as palaces, civic buildings
      and, in some cases, cities were extensively and elaborately decorated; Italy was firmly established
      as the centre of the Renaissance, the values and intellectual developments of which would have a
      significant effect on Europe at the end of the period (and beyond).

22.   To what extent was either Venice or Florence a model of Renaissance ideals and practice?

      Venice
      Venice was a republic, which was consistent with Renaissance political philosophy. It was ruled by
      a wealthy oligarchy in an authoritarian fashion. Its philosophy prized service to the state and the
      safety of the state as the highest priorities for citizens. All citizens, even the patrician class, were
      expected to take active leadership roles in the service of the state.

      Venice was a class-based society where power and wealth resided in the hands of a wealthy
      commercial class who were a minority of the population. Venice also reflected the secular and
      cosmopolitan characteristics of the Renaissance in the highest degree. The Church was controlled
      by the government and ignored the dictates of Rome if they conflicted.

      Commercial wealth was the basis of its power, as was the case in all Renaissance cities, and
      Venice worked to expand and increase its power throughout the period. Trade and manufacturing
      were at their most sophisticated levels in Venice. New ideas, products and techniques were
      welcomed from all parts of the world and new technologies, such as printing, were actively
      supported.

      Venice was a major patron and supporter of the arts and the humanist ideals of the Renaissance.
      It employed the most famous artists, created the most elaborate and impressive works of art and
      sheltered scientists and intellectuals who were persecuted or banned in other parts of Italy. Venice
      was the quintessential Renaissance state.

      Florence
      The ways in which Florence would serve as an example of the Renaissance may include: Florence
      was referred to as the cradle of the Renaissance; in government it was a republic controlled by a
      mercantile oligarchy of the wealthy; civic duty and virtue were constantly emphasized and were a
      yardstick by which to judge rulers; the political machinations of Florence produced the work of
      Machiavelli who characterized Renaissance ideas and practice of politics and statecraft.

      Florence was based on trade and commerce, which enabled it to remain independent and become
      a major patron of the arts. Commerce was the basis for the Renaissance insofar as wealth
      encouraged secular pursuits and funded the movements of art, humanism and science. Florence
      was a major patron of the arts and was amongst the first cities to display the new techniques and
      ideas. Florence was a constant patron (through the Medici family) of many of the Renaissance’s
      leading artists.

      Overall Florence was a model and a mentor to many Italian city states of the period, republican,
      commercial, humanist and devoted to civic pride and service.

New horizons: exploration 1400–1550

23.   Examine the motives for long-distance travel within the Islamic world.

      The motives for long-distance travel within the Islamic Empire may include: a tradition of travel for
      commercial reasons such as trading caravans; the expansion of the Islamic world through
      conquest facilitated and encouraged more widespread travel; traders and merchants travelled
      great distances on land and sea as they now had more opportunities available; the size and unity
      of the Islamic world made travel possible for scholars and missionaries who wished to study and
      gain converts for Islam; a relative unity of language and culture facilitated travel within the Islamic
      for many who may have otherwise not been interested in such pursuits; the exchange of ideas
      between great centres of learning such as Cordoba, Cairo and Baghdad encouraged individuals to
      travel to meet other scholars and exchange ideas; the widespread study of science and search for
      knowledge encouraged scholars to travel in pursuit of knowledge from Spain to India.

24.   “National and dynastic rivalries were the most important motive for Western exploration and
      expansion.” To what extent do you agree with this statement?

      This question requires that candidates address the issue of national and dynastic rivalries as a
      principal motive for expansion. Candidates may challenge the statement and support other factors
      as more important but they must address the issue of national rivalries in their response.

      National or dynastic rivalries
      These played a significant role as a number of European nations such as Spain, Portugal, the
      Netherlands and England sought to increase their economic and military power as well as their
      prestige by discovering and exploiting new territories in Asia and the Americas. This rivalry is seen
      in the conflict that led to the treaty of Tordesillas as well as the combats in Asia between Dutch,
      Portuguese and Spanish adventurers. England’s attempts to increase its influence and wealth led
      to the voyages of Cabot and Raleigh.

      These rivalries led to the dispatch of numerous expeditions, colonists and troops, which greatly
      expanded the areas that were discovered and then controlled by the West.
