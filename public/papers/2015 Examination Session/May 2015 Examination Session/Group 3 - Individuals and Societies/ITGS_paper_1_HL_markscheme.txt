Examiners should be aware that in some cases, candidates may take a different approach, which if
appropriate should be rewarded. If in doubt, check with your team leader.

In the case of an “identify” question read all answers and mark positively up to the maximum marks.
Disregard incorrect answers. In all other cases where a question asks for a certain number of facts
eg “describe two kinds”, mark the first two correct answers. This could include two descriptions,
one description and one identification, or two identifications.

It should be recognized that, given time constraints, answers for part (c) questions are likely to include a
much narrower range of issues and concepts than identified in the markband. There is no “correct”
answer. Examiners must be prepared to award full marks to answers which synthesize and evaluate
even if they do not examine all the stimulus material.

                                                 Section A
1.    BodyGuardian

     Note to examiners.
      All part a questions are marked using ticks and annotations where appropriate
      Part b and part c are marked using markbands. Use annotations and text comments
        to provide a rationale behind the marks you awarded. Do not use ticks

      (a)   (i)    Identify two health indicators that could be measured by the BodyGuardian
                   device.                                                                          [2]

                   Answers may include:
                    body temperature
                    respiratory rate
                    blood pressure
                    sugar levels (blood glucose)
                    heart rate/pulse rate
                    electrocardiogram (ECG).

                   Award [1] for each of the above up to a maximum of [2].

            (ii)   Identify four steps taken by the software to decide if a health indicator
                   measurement needs to be sent to a doctor for a decision.                         [4]

                   Answers may include:
                    device takes the measurement
                    measurement converted to digital data/ analogue to digital conversion
                     (ADC)
                    data sent from BodyGuardian device to smartphone
                    patient data is uploaded to mHealth system for analysis
                    value is compared with the “normal” value stored in device for patient
                    if value is outside accepted range, then signal is sent to doctor for action
                     to be taken
                    if value is inside accepted range, then no signal is sent
                    device waits for next time interval to take new measurement.

                   Consider any four steps in the response.

                   Award [1] for each step up to a maximum of [4].
                                              –5–                 M15/3/ITGSX/HP1/ENG/TZ0/XX/M




(b)   The managers of mHealth are investigating the nature of passwords used by
      doctors to access patient information. The two options being investigated are:
       the doctor creates a password that does not need to be changed
       the mHealth system requires doctors to create a strong password that must be
        changed every 40 days.

      Analyse these two options.                                                              [6]

      Answers may include:
       Option: password created by doctor that does not need to be changed
        - familiar for doctor and probably easy for him to remember
        - no need to write it down therefore it will not be found by others
        - others with access to the computer may “guess” it if they know the doctor
          well
        - if the password is discovered/cracked it can be used for an indefinite time
          period. the doctor may not be aware that the password has been
          compromised
        - may allow doctor to access account faster as no need to look-up the
          password
        - a password that is never changed creates a security problem as people
          close to doctor may find out the password (ie see it, guess it)
        - may not be a strong password
       Option: strong password created by doctors that must be changed every 40
        days
        - secure as it may not be related to the doctor – therefore difficult to guess
        - the need of constantly updating the password in mHealth will improve the
          security as it may be harder to guess
        - may be difficult for doctors to remember which variant of the password they
          have used
        - doctor may need to keep it written down – therefore it has the risk of being
          found by others
        - may have difficult characters that may not be in a keyboard of mobile
          devices.

      [1–2]: A limited response that demonstrates minimal knowledge and
      understanding of the topic and uses little or no appropriate ITGS terminology.
      Only one of the options is addressed in the response.

      [3–4]: A partial analysis, either lacking detail or balance, that demonstrates some
      knowledge and understanding of the topic. Some relevant examples from the
      scenario are used within the response. There is some use of appropriate ITGS
      terminology in the response. Both options are either explicitly or implicitly implied
      in the response.

      [5–6]: A balanced and detailed analysis of the issue which demonstrates
      thorough knowledge and understanding of the topic. Relevant examples from the
      scenario are used throughout the response. There is appropriate ITGS
      terminology throughout the response. Both options are explicitly addressed in
      the response.

(c)   As part of the development of the BodyGuardian device, it is being tested in
      clinical trials by doctors and patients.

      Discuss the implications for doctors and patients of trialling the BodyGuardian
      device before it is sold publicly.                                                   [8]

      Answers may include:
       may have to do double checks: with and without the device – this will take
        more time and put the patient under unnecessary stress / may take time from
        busy doctors
       if doctors/patients discover that incorrect information is being sent from the
        device they may not trust it / feel uncomfortable about having to use it
       if device works well doctors/patients may advertise it positively, making others
        more willing to use it
       doctors/patients may need training to use the device
       patients in the trial may feel their health is being more effectively monitored
       patients and/or doctors may provide feedback to improve final device
       patients may need to be assured that security measures have been taken to
        protect the privacy of their data
       doctors may have an opportunity to learn how to use the device before it is
        sold publicly.

      In part (c) of this question it is expected there will be a balance in the ITGS
      terminology between IT technical terminology and the terminology related to
      social and ethical impacts.

2.   3D printing

     Note to examiners.
       All part a questions are marked using ticks and annotations where appropriate
       Part b and part c are marked using markbands. Use annotations and text
        comments to provide a rationale behind the marks you awarded. Do not use ticks

     (a)   (i)    Identify two ways that a 2D image file can be input into the 3D printer
                  software.                                                                     [2]

                  Answers may include:
                   2D images imported imported into the 3D printer software
                   2D images are opened by the 3D printer software
                   2D file is converted into a format required by the 3D printer software by
                    another file conversion program.

                  Award [1] for each way up to a maximum of [2].

           (ii)   Identify four of the steps required to produce Charlie’s replacement foot.    [4]

                  Answers may include:
                   images of the other duck's foot are imported into the 3D
                    printer/modelling software
                   the software creates a 3D image/model of the foot from the images
                   the 3D image/model is edited to make it the same size as Charlie’s foot
                   printer is loaded with the type of raw material needed for creating the
                    foot
                   the 3D image/model of the foot is sent to the 3D printer
                   the 3D printer creates the replacement foot

                  Award [1] for each step up to a maximum of [4].

(b)   Analyse Alejandro Toys’s decision to either use open source software or to
      purchase proprietary software to produce the company’s 3D toys.                       [6]

      Answers may include:
       open-source software is often free or low-cost, allowing the company to aquire
        more software within a limited budget / proprietary software may demand a
        higher level of investment by the company
       open-source software can be changed or customised to suit the company’s
        requirements – the source code is available for programmers to modify /
        proprietary software can only be modified by the manufacturer
       open-source software may have “bugs” that have not yet been reported which
        affect the company’s production (ie may take time to be fixed) / proprietary
        software manufacturers may release patches/bug-fixes on a regular basis
       open-source software may not have all the options/features needed by the
        company / proprietary software often has a greater range of options/features
       manufacturers of proprietary software can provide support and assistance to
        the company / open-source software often has limited support
       using open source software for producing the 3D toys may require hiring more
        programming staff to upgrade the software

      [1–2]: A limited response that demonstrates minimal knowledge and
      understanding of the topic and uses little or no appropriate ITGS terminology.
      Only open-source software or proprietary software is explicitly referred to in the
      response.

      [3–4]: A partial analysis, either lacking detail or balance, that demonstrates some
      knowledge and understanding of the topic. Some relevant examples are used
      within the response. There is some use of appropriate ITGS terminology in the
      response. Both open-source software and proprietary software are explicitly or
      implicitly referred to in the response.

      [5–6]: A balanced and detailed analysis of the issue which demonstrates
      thorough knowledge and understanding of the topic. Relevant examples are
      used throughout the response. There is appropriate ITGS terminology
      throughout the response. Both open-source software and proprietary software
      are explicitly referred to in the response.

(c)   It is now possible to use a 3D printer to print a large range of products in addition
      to toys. These include guns, bicycles and human prosthetic limbs. However
      some governments are concerned about the software for 3D printers being freely
      available on the internet.

      To what extent should governments regulate the access to software for
      3D printers?                                                                            [8]

      Answers may include:
      Regulation of the access to software for 3D printers
       could aim to ensure good quality of the 3D objects being made. 3D software
        may allow for sub-standard / faulty 3D objects to be manufactured, creating
        risks for users
       could aim to prevent the manufacture of artifacts that are only sold with a
        licence (eg guns). However if similar shapes are needed for other articles,
        their manufacture may be prevented by mistake Eg: if a certain shape is
        recognized the software may not allow it to be printed
       could protect manufacturers of copyrighted products. Owners of 3D printers
        would be prevented from making them
       could prevent owners of 3D printers making their own objects freely, stifling
        innovation
       could mean an invasion of privacy. It is possible to know what blueprint is
        being downloaded to which IP address
       to what extent is regulation possible.

      In part (c) of this question it is expected there will be a balance in the ITGS
      terminology between IT technical terminology and the terminology related to
      social and ethical impacts.

3.   Small town book shop moves to computer-based records

     Note to examiners.
       Part a and part b questions are marked using ticks and annotations where
        appropriate
      Part c are marked using markbands. Use annotations and text comments to provide
        a rationale behind the marks you awarded. Do not use ticks

     (a)   (i)    Daniela needs to see the books in alphabetical order, with the “Subject
                  area” sorted from A to Z and then the “Number of books” sorted from
                  largest to smallest.

                  State the author that would appear in the first row of the sorted spreadsheet
                  using only the books shown in Figure 5.                                         [1]

                   Badke

                  Award [1] for the correct answer shown above.

           (ii)   State the formula that would be required to add up the cost of all the books
                  in the book store.                                                              [1]

                  Answer may include:
                   =SUM(G2:G401)
                   =SUMA(G2:G401)
                   =ADD(G2:G401)
                   =  (G2:G401). (where xxxx is another valid formula which adds the
                    numbers in cells G2 through G401)
                   =G2+G3+...+G401

                  Award [1] for any one of the above.

(iii)   Daniela now thinks that she should have installed a database for the
        information about the books. Outline two advantages that a database
        would have over a spreadsheet for the El Hoyo book shop.                      [4]

        Answers may include:
         queries can be done to select specific records, ie English books
         reports can be made (ie summary of all the books that have been
          purchased, labels can be printed to label the books/bookshelves etc.)
         databases may reduce data redundancy and allow for more efficient
          storage & updating of data than spreadsheets
         a user interface can be included for the book shop staff without much IT
          knowledge, using spreadsheets may require a greater level of IT
          capability
         databases allow for data for a large number of books to be stored and
          accessed without increasing complexity for the user.
         databases allow the field choices to be set so that only certain types of
          data may be entered (e.g. Type of book, language etc.). Spreadsheets
          to not have this possibility.
         a database can limit the view of the data for particular users (e.g.
          Daniela as the shop manager, may be able to view more data than the
          rest of the staff), a spreadsheet does not have this capability

        Note:. If an advantage is generic with no reference to the book shop, a
        maximum of 1 mark is awarded for identifying the advantage.

        Award [1] for identifying an advantage and an additional [1] for an outline
        for that advantage.

        Award up to a maximum of [4] for the question.

(b)   Explain three impacts that the new computer system may have for the staff at the
      book shop.                                                                          [6]

      Answers may include:
       the salesperson may have to learn/receive training on how to use the
        computer and software. This may involve additional time commitment.
       the salesperson may request new software applications (ie image editing
        software to create posters about the books) or hardware (ie barcode
        scanners) and this may involve costs
       shop owner may now expect the salesperson to perform analysis of
        sales/inventory
       having a computer may allow the salesperson to perform additional tasks
        (ie printing of advertisements about new books, mail merged letters, ordering
        books from their supplier)
       employees work will be easier and faster as they can check directly in the
        computer if they have a copy of the book
       staff will no longer have to calculate the costs of books manually leading to
        less errors in charging customers/fewer customer complaints.

      Award [1] for each impact identified, and an additional [1] for an appropriate
      explanation of that impact.

      Award a maximum of [6] for the response.

(c)   El Hoyo receives a large number of tourists during the summer when the fruit
      festival takes place, but suffers from periods of poor internet connectivity.
      Daniela has now created a separate area in the book shop that has several
      computers with free broadband internet access so that tourists can use them to
      check their emails and find information about the local area.

      Evaluate the impacts of this initiative for Daniela as shop manager.                 [8]

       Answers may include:
        additional staff with IT expertise may be needed to work in that area if the
         demand is high installation, maintenance and repairs may be needed if the
         equipment is used frequently
        antivirus and firewalls may be needed to be installed
        the shop may become a popular place and sales of books may increase
        Daniela’s investment may not be cost effective if demand for the bookshop’s
         internet access decreases
        Daniela may need to develop an acceptable use policy
        Daniella may have access to the browser histories on the computers and
         could use that information to help decide what books to stock
       staff are able to query the book database for specific information (e.g. all of
         the books written by a certain author, all books which cost less than $200).

      In part (c) of this question it is expected there will be a balance in the ITGS
      terminology between IT technical terminology and the terminology related to
      social and ethical impacts.

                    system development personnel
                    project management team.

                   Note: reward a specific member of any team i.e. someone who would be on
                   the project management team, but do NOT reward two members of the
                   same team.

                   Award [1] for each of the points identified above up to a maximum of [2].

           (ii)    Identify two characteristics of a “prototype”.                                [2]

                   Answers may include:
                    early working model of a system or subsystem
                    used to test the system (eg interface, functioning)
                    used to demonstrate how the system will work
                    used to check whether the systems will meet the target user’s
                     requirements.

                   Award [1] for each of the points identified above up to a maximum of [2].

           (iii)   Identify two types of information that should have been gathered at the
                   beginning of the automated baggage system project.                            [2]

                   Answers may include:
                    amount of baggage the system will need to handle
                    maximum size and weight of baggage
                    needs of individual airlines
                    time parameters ie when is the automated baggage system scheduled to
                     open
                    number of concourses or gates to be served by the system
                    cost estimate.

(b)   Explain three reasons why the use of the AGILE system of project development
      might have prevented the failure of the automated baggage system project.             [6]

      Answers may include:
       project could be adapted to changing needs of the stakeholders
       the concerns of lower level managers would have been heeded (eg resolving
        issues early on before they became significant
       small parts of the system can be tested as they are developed (eg the parts of
        the baggage system that failed would have been caught early)
       requires stakeholders and developers to work together throughout the process
        (eg airlines would have communicated requirements throughout the process)
       developers work in teams increasing communication
       deadlines can be adjusted based on concrete information about the current
        performance of the system.

      Award [1] for each reason why the use of the AGILE system of project
      development might have avoided the failure of the automated baggage system
      project.

      Award [1] linked to each reason identified for why the use of the AGILE system of
      project development might have avoided the failure of the automated baggage
      system project. [1] giving a maximum of [2] for each reason.

      Mark as [2 + 2 + 2].

(c)   To what extent is the success of projects such as the Penrose Airport automated
      baggage system dependent on the involvement of key stakeholders throughout
      the development process?                                                              [8]

      Advantages may include:
       needs of all stakeholders will be taken into account from the beginning/avoids
        sudden dramatic changes in the project
       key stakeholders will have a clear idea of how the project is progressing
       regular communication with stakeholders ensures that the solution will meet
        their needs
       affords developers the possibility of working with experts who have detailed
        knowledge of the system requirement
       enables early recognition of small problems before they become huge
        problems
       regular communication ensures that necessary resources can be identified
        and provided.

      Disadvantages may include:
       if views of some stakeholders are divergent from the rest, the project could fail
       coordination problems, ie between stakeholders, could cause delays in the
         project
       if there is no centralized control and knowledge, the project could fail
       meetings with stakeholders can be time consuming and/or non-productive.

      In part (c) of this question it is expected there will be a balance in the ITGS
      terminology between IT technical terminology and the terminology related to
      social and ethical impacts.

(b)   Explain why Zunica Chocolates uses both alpha testing and beta testing to
      ensure the functionality of their website.                                            [6]

                        Alpha                                      Beta

       White box testing ie checks internal       Black box testing ie tests how it
       workings of the software (code).           actually performs.

      [1–2]: A limited response that indicates very little understanding of the topic.

      [3–4]: A reasonable explanation of how both alpha and beta testing can be used
      to ensure the success of the project. The answer may be unbalanced and lack
      appropriate reasoning at the lower end of the band.

      [5–6]: A clear, detailed explanation of how both alpha and beta testing can be
      used to ensure the success of the project.

(c)   To what extent could the use of a Gantt chart such as the one above lead to the
      successful development of Zunica Chocolates's website?                                [8]

      Benefits may include:
       use of a Gantt chart visualizes the process eg helps to maintain organization
       it illustrates which tasks must be completed before the next one can begin
       task can be viewed against a calendar showing start and end dates
       resources required for tasks can be linked to the tasks on the chart.

      Drawbacks may include:
       it is a linear ie step-by-step process so it is very inflexible. Changes are
        difficult to make
       errors are difficult to correct
       changes could result in significant costs
       chart can be too simplistic ie does not provide enough detail for a complex
        project ie this chart leaves out the construction of the database
       it is difficult to show where there is slack time in the project.

      In part (c) of this question it is expected there will be a balance in the ITGS
      terminology between IT technical terminology and the terminology related to
      social and ethical impacts.

6.   Telepresence robots

     Note to examiners.
       All part a questions are marked using ticks and annotations where appropriate
       Part b and part c are marked using markbands. Use annotations and text
        comments to provide a rationale behind the marks you awarded. Do not use ticks

     (a)   (i)    Identify two of the sensors that the robot must have in order to move
                  around the classroom.                                                         [2]

                  Answers may include:
                   cliff/edge detection
                   sensor to detect edge of the wireless network
                   sensor to detect battery level
                   motion sensor
                   proximity sensor (obstacle detection)
                   visual sensor.

                  Note: do not accept distance sensor or cameras.
                  Award [1] for each sensor identified up to a maximum of [2].

           (ii)   Outline two characteristics that make the VGo different from a fixed video
                  system such as Skype.                                                         [4]

                  Answers may include:
                   the VGo robot is portable while the video system must be available in
                    every classroom
                   the student controls the VGo robot, can move from class to class along
                    with everyone else while a portable video system must be wheeled
                    around by a staff member
                   the student controls the VGo while someone in each classroom needs to
                    position the camera
                   the student can move around the classroom as if she were physically
                    present but the video system is relatively fixed
                   the camera in the VGO system can look all around instead of having a
                    fixed perspective
                   student can control the robot from a remote place
                   student can zoom in and out to see details or get a better perspective on
                    the room.

                  Award [1] for each characteristic that makes the VGo different from a fixed
                  video system such as Skype identified up to a maximum of [2].

                  Award [1] for each expansion of each characteristic identified up to a
                  maximum of [1] giving a maximum of [2].

                  Mark as [2 + 2].

(b)   Analyse the impact that using a VGo robot would have on a student who cannot
      attend school in person.                                                              [6]

      Advantages may include:
       students will be able to participate fully in interactive class discussions/group
        work/working in pairs so they will have the full educational experience
       students will be able to move from class to class with peers/go to the
        lunchroom/chat while walking through the halls so they will be able to develop
        friendships
       student can participate in some extracurricular activities.

      Disadvantages may include:
       sitting in front of a computer monitor can be tiring for the user
       parents might have privacy concerns about using cameras in class
       if the robot loses power, drops the internet connection or there’s a hardware
         or software failure, the student will not be able to follow the lesson
       The student might play with the robot and get distracted
       Other students in school might make the student using the robot feel
         uncomfortable
       if the student is not confident or competent at using the VGo, the student’s
         ability to follow the lesson will be reduced

      [1–2]: A limited response that indicates very little understanding of the topic.

      [3–4]: A reasonable description of the positive and negative impacts of using the
      VGo robot in this scenario. The answer may be unbalanced and lack appropriate
      reasoning at the lower end of the band.

      [5–6]: A balanced and thorough analysis of the positive and negative impacts of
      using the VGo robot in this scenario.

(c)   Larsson Laboratories, which makes drugs for rare diseases, is considering the
      use of VGo robots for company communications. The head office is in central
      Stockholm, with a research laboratory in a nearby town and a production facility
      in Germany. The VGo robots would be used for meetings and visits to the
      laboratory and production facility by managers, as well as by workers who are in
      the office for some of the time, and work from home (telecommute) for the rest.

      Discuss the potential effects of the use of VGo robots for Larsson Laboratories.      [8]

      Advantages may include:
       the system would allow employees who telecommute to interact with
        colleagues in the office
       would save the business the costs of travel ie transportation,
        accommodations, meals; especially important for global companies
       employees can gain visual access to remote facilities such as manufacturing
        facilities, laboratories, etc
       employees can be more productive as time will not need to be spent on travel
        eg managers can visit multiple locations in a short period of time
       allows for “walk and talk” or “watercooler” discussions ie informal collaboration
       allows direct monitoring and interaction with employees if the supervisor is not
        physically present
       fewer people physically present means less risk of contamination in the
        laboratory.

      Disadvantages may include:
       trust is harder to build when working with telecommunication technologies eg
         personal relationships are often critical in business environments
       bandwidth can be a problem ie video requires significant bandwidth.
         Companies may be limited in the use of robots by cost of bandwidth or may
         find their networks cannot handle the telepresence robots
       security is a problem because remote control cameras are moving around a
         financial institution or research laboratory
       the use of the internet to transmit the video opens up the company to
         breaches of security
       can make employees uncomfortable because they feel as if they’re being
         spied on
       cannot be sure the robot will be controlled by the person who is supposed to
         be controlling it
       the field of vision of VGo’s camera is not as wide as a human’s, so it is
         impossible to have a view of the whole room
       a moving robot may risk expensive equipment or spill chemicals if not
         controlled correctly by the remote control user.

      In part (c) of this question it is expected there will be a balance in the ITGS
      terminology between IT technical terminology and the terminology related to
      social and ethical impacts.

                   identified up to a maximum of [2].

           (ii)    Programs like AARON often contain fuzzy logic. Identify two
                   characteristics of fuzzy logic.                                              [2]

                   Answers may include:
                    based on degrees of truth not “true or false”, eg percentages
                    can quantify natural language expressions that state imprecise values,
                     eg hot, warm, cool
                    can be used in situations where precise values are not known, eg the
                     temperature in a clothes dryer
                    uses the logical values between 0 and 1 ie things can be partly true and
                     partly false at the same time.

                   Award [1] for each characteristic identified.

           (iii)   Identify two characteristics of machine learning.                            [2]

     (b) (i)    AARON needs to select colours for leaves and flowers in each drawing.
Once a shape is selected, it must follow these rules:
                 AARON can colour large flowers red
                 AARON can colour small flowers blue
                 if the shape is a leaf, AARON can colour it green
                 if the shape is neither a leaf nor a flower, AARON should not colour it.

                 Copy and complete the information below to construct a decision tree that
                 AARON could use to colour its drawings.                                      [4]

                  exactly four terminators
                  no false leads.

                 Any four points, award [1] each up to a maximum of [4].

(ii)   Explain one weakness of using a decision tree like this one for AARON.         [2]

       Answers may include:
        the decision tree is based on preset parameters which may not address
         all of the eventualities encountered when AARON is trying to complete a
         painting
        “flower size: large or small” is ambiguous and relative
        the decision tree is made up of binary choices which are very limited,
         ie only two choices for colour/only flowers vs. leaves. This could be very
         limiting OR could lead to a huge decision tree thus a very slow program
        the decision tree may be influenced by new information as a result of
         machine learning during the creation of a painting by AARON. This may
         lead to paintings being created using different inference rules (and not
         being consistent in the style intended).

       Award [1] for identifying one reason why the use of a decision tree like the
       one in b(i) for AARON may be considered a weakness.

       Award [1] for why the use of a decision tree like the one in b(i) for AARON
       may be considered a weakness. [1] giving a maximum of [2].

(c)   Discuss the museums’ decision to list AARON as the artist when exhibiting
      AARON’s paintings and drawings.                                                      [8]

      Reasons supporting the decision may include:
       each of AARON’s works is unique, ie AARON remembers its drawings so it
        does not repeat itself
       AARON makes all the decisions so it is the artist
       works to be exhibited in museums are judged to be art by the curators, ie they
        are appreciated as fine art
       it is impossible to know what an artist was feeling when she/he created the
        work of art
       human brains work creatively while we are unconscious, ie asleep.

      Reasons against the decision may include:
       Harold Cohen wrote the program so he is the artist
       AARON cannot experience the world the way a human can so he cannot
        create art
       AARON is not conscious so it cannot make decisions about the quality of its
        art
       there can be multiple copies of the program, so there is no individual artist
       AARON can only create images out of the knowledge that Cohen has
        programmed into it
       real art communicates the emotion/passion of the artist.

      In part (c) of this question it is expected there will be a balance in the ITGS
      terminology between IT technical terminology and the terminology related to
      social and ethical impacts.
