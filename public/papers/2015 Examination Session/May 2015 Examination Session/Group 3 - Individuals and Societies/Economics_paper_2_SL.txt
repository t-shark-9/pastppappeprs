                                  Latvia to join the eurozone monetary union

          Latvia will become the 18th country to adopt the euro after being approved for membership
           by the European Commission. The country has met the criteria for eurozone membership,
           including low inflation, low long-term interest rates, a stable exchange rate, low public debt
           and low budget deficits.

          Latvia joined the European Union (EU) customs union in 2004. This resulted in a large
           increase in the availability of credit and strong economic growth in Latvia. However, the
           2008 global financial crisis resulted in the collapse of one of its leading banks and massive
           economic instability. Economic output fell by about 20 % and Latvia had to accept a bailout
           (loans) from the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the EU.

          Latvia kept the lat (the Latvian currency) pegged to the euro throughout the crisis. At the
           time, some economists argued that devaluation would have been a better way to improve the
           economy. However, Latvia followed the path of other countries such as Greece and Ireland,
           and chose to improve competitiveness through austerity measures. This involved increasing
           direct taxes and cutting government spending and public sector wages.

          By late 2010, the economy was growing again and Latvia had repaid the loans to the IMF
           and the EU. In 2012, the economy expanded by 5.6 %, the fastest of any country in the
           EU, although output was still 12 % below its pre-crisis peak. In addition unemployment was
           falling, but it remained high at 12.4 %.

          For Latvia, which shares a border with Russia, the attraction of the euro is about economics
           and security. Entering the eurozone in January 2014 is part of a process of shifting away
           from the influence of Russia, and following its northern neighbour Estonia which joined the
           eurozone in 2011. Lithuania hopes to join the eurozone in 2015.

          Public support for joining the eurozone has been low. Evidence from one survey suggests
           that a small majority of Latvia’s population opposes membership, fearing that prices will rise
           and Latvians will be drawn into the problems facing Europe’s struggling economies.

          Nonetheless, there are signs that support is growing. The Latvian prime minister said that
           “switching to the euro will help economic growth and bring increased foreign investment.
           Unlike countries that can afford to ignore the euro and additional integration, Latvia cannot
           easily stand on its own. This is good news, not only for Latvia, but also for the eurozone.
           It shows that there is still confidence in the single currency”.

                                     Brazil’s currency slides to new low

          In August 2013, the exchange rate of Brazil’s currency, the real, fell to its lowest level
           against the United States dollar (US$) since February 2009 because of the poor performance
           of its economy. This fall is expected to continue, at least in the short term.

          Much of the weakness of the real is due to the possibility that the US central bank may soon
           start to reverse its easy monetary policy as a result of increased growth in the US. There is
           speculation that the US interest rate might rise at some point in the future. The consequence
           of this is that money is leaving developing economies such as Brazil.

          Brazil’s central bank tried to fight the outflows by raising interest rates three times in 2013
           to a high of 9 % and injecting US$7.6 billion into the foreign exchange market in one week.
           Even with such interventions, the value of the real was down by more than 10 %. The central
           bank defends its actions, saying that its interventions prevented even larger falls in the value
           of the currency.

          A weaker currency poses additional problems for the central bank in the form of imported
           inflation. The speed of the real’s decline creates problems for companies, which struggle to
           make plans when they do not know where the currency will be in the future.

          In contrast, the finance minister sees a possible advantage to a weaker currency. “The new
           exchange rate makes Brazil more competitive,” the minister told reporters after meeting
           with leading business people. He acknowledged, however, that the sudden swings in the
           currency “are not positive for the economy”.

          Analysts say that the value of the real is unlikely to increase until the economic outlook
           improves. Forecasters expect economic growth to remain low at 2.2 % in 2013. This is
           slightly up from the previous year, but much lower than the 7.5 % growth in 2010. Brazil is
           also concerned about inflation, which is at an annual rate of 6.3 %. This is near the top of the
           government’s target range and is another reason why the central bank has raised interest
           rates.

          Brazil also moved from a US$9.9 billion trade surplus in 2012 to a US$5 billion trade
           deficit in 2013, contributing to the economy’s problems. Brazil’s current account deficit
           has increased significantly. The combination of these economic events presents difficult
           problems for policy makers.

     (b)   Using an exchange rate diagram, explain how the speculation that the US central bank

     (c)   Using an AD/AS diagram, explain how the move from a trade surplus to a trade deficit

                                                   Equatorial Guinea

          Equatorial Guinea has the third largest reserve of oil in Africa, discovered in 2006. However,
           the country does not have a single oil refinery that can convert the oil into gasoline (petrol).
           The government has made agreements with multinational corporations (MNCs) from China
           and the United States (US) for unrefined oil to be exported in exchange for cash payments
           and loans. Other natural resources that have not yet been exploited include gold, zinc and
           diamonds. Beyond the oil sector, subsistence farming still dominates. The oil boom has
           led to inflationary pressures, with an average annual inflation rate of 6.1 % in the period
           2003–2013.

          Equatorial Guinea is now the richest country in Africa in terms of per capita income.
           The World Bank estimate for gross national income (GNI) per capita at purchasing power
           parity (PPP) for 2012 was US$21 715; while a current estimate puts income per capita as
           high as US$33 600. When last profiled in 1995, income per capita was just US$330.

          Very little of the income goes towards economic development. It is true that roads now run
           deep into the interior of the country, and that there has been a recent surge in infrastructure
           investment, following the first phase of Horizon 2020, the government’s National
           Development Plan. Nonetheless, the majority of Guineans still live without clean drinking
           water and sanitation, with continual power cuts, while average life expectancy stands at just
           51 years – the eighth lowest in the world. Inequality is growing day by day.

          As the country moves into the second phase of the National Development Plan, the
           government is planning to redirect public investment from infrastructure towards the
           development of new economic sectors, such as fisheries, agriculture, tourism and finance.

          There is a lack of accurate economic data that makes it difficult to track progress on
           socioeconomic indicators. A World Bank public expenditure review carried out in 2010
           recommended a reallocation of resources towards human development, especially education
           and health.
