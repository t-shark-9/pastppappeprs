Answer one question. The answer must refer to both theoretical perspectives and theory/schools
of thought in anthropology and their application to specific and clearly identified ethnographic
illustrations. Each question is worth [20 marks].

1.   Discuss the work of one anthropologist or one school of thought in relation to the contrast between
     universalistic and particularistic perspectives.


2.   Evaluate how either a diachronic perspective or a conflict-centred perspective has helped to
     better understand one of the following:

     • marginalization
     • modernization
     • inequality.


3.   Evaluate the relationship between agency-centred and structure-centred perspectives in the
     work of one anthropologist you have studied.


4.   Discuss why an anthropologist would use an idealist perspective.


5.   Compare and contrast two schools of thought in relation to one of the following:

     • a cohesion-centred perspective
     • a synchronic perspective
     • a materialist perspective.
