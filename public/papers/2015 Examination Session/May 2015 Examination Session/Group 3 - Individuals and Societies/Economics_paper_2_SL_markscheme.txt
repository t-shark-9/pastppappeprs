                        An explanation that it is a form of economic integration where
                        member countries agree to liberalize trade (trade freely amongst
                        themselves) and adopt a common external tariff (or common trade
                        policies towards non members).

           (ii)   Define the term direct taxes indicated in bold in the text (paragraph ).      [2]

(b)   Using an AD/AS diagram, explain how devaluation of the lat (the Latvian
      currency) might have been used to improve the Latvian economy during the
      financial crisis (paragraph ).                                                       [4]

           For drawing a correctly labelled AD/AS diagram showing a shift of AD to
           the right and an increase in real GDP or for an explanation that devaluation
           of the lat may have caused an increase in aggregate demand through an
           increase in exports and/or a decrease in imports, thus bringing about an
           increase in real GDP.

       2   There is a correct diagram and an accurate written response.                    3–4
           For drawing a correctly labelled AD/AS diagram showing a shift of AD to
           the right and an increase in real GDP and for an explanation that
           devaluation of the lat may have caused an increase in aggregate demand
           through an increase in exports and/or a decrease in imports, thus bringing
           about an increase in real GDP.

      Candidates who incorrectly label diagrams can be rewarded with a maximum
      of [3].

      For AD/AS, the vertical axis may be price level, average price level, PL or APL.
      The horizontal axis may be output, real output, national output, real national
      output, national income, or GDP. A title is not necessary.

(c)   Using a production possibilities curve (PPC) diagram, explain the change in
      Latvia’s economy from 2008 to 2012 (paragraphs  and ).                               [4]

       1   There is a correct diagram or an accurate written response.                      1–2
           For drawing a correctly labelled PPC diagram showing a movement from
           one point within the curve to a new point closer to the curve or for an
           explanation that Latvia experienced economic growth from 2008 to 2012,
           which means that there was an increase in output shown as a movement to
           a new point, closer to the PPC.

       2   There is a correct diagram and an accurate written response.                     3–4
           For drawing a correctly labelled PPC diagram showing a movement from
           one point within the curve to a new point closer to the curve and for an
           explanation that Latvia experienced economic growth from 2008 to 2012,
           which means that there was an increase in output shown as a movement to
           a new point, closer to the PPC.

      Candidates who incorrectly label diagrams can be rewarded with a maximum
      of [3].

      Candidates might show a different combination of points within the PPC on the
      diagram. There might be an initial movement from one point inside the curve to a
      further point inside the curve to reflect the 20 % drop in output in 2008. To show
      the change from 2008 to 2012, there must be a new point closer to the PPC.

      For a PPC, the axes could be two alternative products, one on each axis,
      eg Good A and Good B or Schools and Cars; or two groups of products or two
      sectors, eg Consumer Goods and Producer Goods. A title is not necessary.

       increased investor confidence
       reduction in transaction costs in trade with the eurozone
       increased foreign investment (paragraph )
       increased economic growth (paragraph )
       greater integration with the eurozone helps reduce dependence on Russia
         (paragraph )
       renewed confidence in the eurozone will bring benefits to all members
         (paragraph )
       may help to bring down unemployment, which is high (paragraph )
       Latvia had to exercise discipline to meet the criteria to join the eurozone which
         built a good economic foundation for moving forward (paragraph ).

      Responses may include:
       interest rates may be raised to support the currency, having contractionary

        help keep an already high inflation rate in check (paragraph )
       the central bank may have to use foreign reserves to support the currency
        (paragraph ); to date, attempts have been futile as real depreciated a further
        10 % (paragraph )
       there is a danger of imported inflation (paragraph ); inflation is already at
        6.3 % which is at the top end of the target range (paragraph )

Advantages of government intervention policies:
 price floor increases farmers’ incomes however, floor not as high as Ghana
  which may promote smuggling of cocoa into Ghana (paragraph )
 inelastic supply and demand reduces problems of surplus supply usually
  caused by price floors
 government investment will help improve crop yields thus increasing net X and
  AD and employment possibilities (paragraph )
 investment will also promote diversification into the production of rice as well
 government provides necessary infrastructure – increase PPC (paragraph )
 government can provide merit goods (paragraph )
 investment in human capital – improved life expectancy and literacy rate
  (Figure 1 and paragraph )
 possibility of income redistribution through taxation
 possibility to correct market failures – improvement in literacy rate
  (paragraph )
 capacity to reduce corruption (paragraph )
 Ivory Coast has seen improvement in literacy rates (paragraph )
 market-oriented policy of reducing business regulations (paragraph ) may
  attract MNC’s which may provide jobs therefore possibly breaking the poverty
  cycle for some.

Disadvantages of government intervention policies:
 increased government expenditures could exacerbate the existing debt
   problems for heavily indebted poor countries (Extract 2)
 corruption remains a problem
 lack of incentive to become more efficient with price floor in place
 price floor may encourage over-supply
 can lead to excessive bureaucracy and hence red tape and inefficiency plus
   increased demands on the budget
 policies not helping women – women under-represented in new businesses
   (paragraph )
 reduced government expenditure on health care will negatively impact
   development which may lead to lower life expectancy leading to a lower HDI
   rank. On the positive side, free health care to mothers and children would limit
   the negative impact of the cut. As such Ivory Coast may not continue to see a
   steady improvement in life expectancy (Figure 1)
 if citizens now have to pay for health care, they may forego expenditure in
   other areas, such as education.

Any reasonable evaluation that offers a considered and balanced review of the
strengths and limitations of government interventionist policies in promoting
economic development in Ivory Coast.

      Responses may include:
       a definition of economic growth
       a definition of economic development
       the increased export revenue (paragraph ) will lead to economic growth, but
        not necessarily development
       loans (paragraph ) may lead to growth and/or development, depending upon
        their type
       inflationary pressures (paragraph )
       income per capita will increase (paragraph ), but this is not necessarily
        economic growth
       little of the wealth leads to development (paragraph )
       the influence of MNCs (paragraph )
       likelihood of growing inequality (paragraph )
       long-run problems when the oil reserves run out

       surge in infrastructure
       oil revenue may facilitate exploration of other natural resources such as gold,
        zinc and diamonds (paragraph ) which will lead to growth but not necessarily
        development
       World Bank recommended a reallocation of resources towards education and
        health (paragraph ) – oil revenues may be directed at implementing the
        recommendation
       at the very least the government does have a National Development Plan and
        they are into Phase 2 of this plan (paragraph ).
