                               Core theme – patterns and change

                                                Section A
1.   Populations in transition

     (a)   Describe what is meant by old-age dependency ratio.                                      [2]

           It is the ratio of the number of individuals over 64 (allow 60 or 65 as well) [1] to
           the number of people of working age / the number of economically active
           individuals [1].

     (b)   Identify which country on the graph is predicted to have the fastest growth in
           old-age dependency between 2010 and 2050.                                                [1]

           China

     (c)   Explain two reasons why the population is ageing in the five countries shown.          [2+2]

           Explained reasons must address why the percentage of elderly is increasing in
           relation to other age groups.

           Award [1+1] for each valid and distinct reason, provided that it is developed by
           means of explanation, exemplification and/or detail.

           For example: Improved medical care [1], diseases linked to longevity treated,
           allowing increased life expectancy [1].

           Possibilities include:
            falling fertility/decline in younger cohorts
            improved nutrition and diet/healthier lives.

     (d)   Suggest two reasons why men have a lower life expectancy than women in most
           countries.                                                                             [2+2]

           Award [1] for each valid and distinct reason, and [1] for development and/or
           exemplification.

           For example: Men tend to practise/engage in more risky occupations (civilian) [1]
           eg mining, construction, thereby increasing their mortality rate [1].

           Other possibilities include:
            most armed forces mainly men/combat increases mortality
            high-risk behaviour / lifestyle choices (smoking, drinking, diet)
            biological/physiological make-up of men compared to women
            crime related factors.

           It is important that the two factors are distinct and NOT a similar reason
           developed twice.
                                                  –4–                M15/3/GEOGR/BP1/ENG/TZ0/XX/M


2.   Disparities in wealth and development

     (a)   Describe the relationship shown on the graph.                                           [2]

            The relationship is positive / as HDI increases the combined gross enrollment
             increases [1].
            Use of data to provide evidence of this relationship OR use of data to identify
             Qatar as an anomaly [1].

     (b)   State the three components that make up the Human Development Index (HDI).              [2]

            Life expectancy/longevity
            School enrollment/expected years of schooling/education/literacy
            Gross National Income (GNI)/GDP/national income (per capita not essential)

              Do not accept income alone. Must have all three for [2], two correct [1]. [0]
              for only one correct.

     (c)   Suggest two reasons why composite indices (such as the HDI) are used to
           measure global or regional disparities.                                               [2+2]

           Award [1+1] for each valid and distinct reason, provided that it is developed by
           means of explanation, exemplification and/or detail. Credit responses based on
           other valid composite indices.

           For example: HDI is better than a single indicator like GDP per capita [1]; gives a
           broader measure of social development [1].

           Possibilities include:
            allows for comparison between and/or within nations
            indicates where aid could be directed
            allows measurement of progress/lack of progress over time.

     (d)   Explain one advantage and one disadvantage of using debt relief to reduce
           global disparities.                                                                   [2+2]

           Award [1+1] for each distinct valid reason, provided that it is developed by means
           of explanation, exemplification and/or detail.

           For example: Reduces the amount of funds leaving a nation as debt repayments
           [1]; allows nations to redirect funds toward development projects [1].

           Possibilities include:

           Advantages
            encourages more investment from overseas countries
            infrastructural projects can now be prioritized
            could stem migration out of the country.

           Disadvantages
            the same conditions attached to debt relief as attached to loans
            corruption so benefits are not felt by all
            might not be sufficient to make a difference to the total debt
            any reference to dependency must be strongly related to debt relief and not
              aid.

3.   Patterns in environmental quality and sustainability

     (a)   Describe the trend of CO2 emissions in Asia between 1990 and 2010.                       [3]

           Any two valid descriptive points for [2] plus [1] for accurate quantification/use of
           data from the vertical axis (actual figures or proportions).
               The emissions have increased.
               Sharp rise in emissions after 2002.
               Emissions relatively stable in the 90s.

     (b)   Suggest two reasons why CO2 emissions in Europe have decreased since 1990.             [2+2]

           Award [1+1] for each valid and distinct reason, provided that it is developed by
           means of detail and/or exemplification.

           For example: Development of renewable/alternative sources of energy [1]
           replacing fossil fuels [1].

           Possibilities include:
            policies to reduce use of fossil fuels (including Kyoto protocol)
            political will (including growth of green parties)
            more efficient vehicle/appliances
            improved public transport systems
            education/increased awareness lowering consumption
            industries relocating outside of the region

           Credit should also be given to attempts to explain the decrease by referring to
           periods of economic recession.

     (c)   Distinguish between global climate change and the enhanced greenhouse effect.            [4]

           Award [1] for a valid description of global climate change and [1] for a valid
           description of the enhanced greenhouse effect. The final [1+1] are reserved for
           any two valid distinguishing characteristics between the two.

           Descriptions:
           Global climate change is the change in the global pattern of climate precipitation,
           temperature, winds, pressure systems). The enhanced greenhouse effect is the
           increasing amount of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere as a result of human
           activities.

           Distinguishing characteristics could be:
            GCC can relate to any aspect of climate whereas the EGE specifically impacts
              upon temperature
            GCC can have natural causes whereas the EGE is anthropogenic
            GCC can involve cooling/glacial periods whereas EGE is associated with
              global warming
            EGE is a major cause of GCC.

4.   Patterns in resource consumption

     (a)   State which two regions had the most sustainable ecological footprint in 1975.      [2]

           Africa [1] and Asia Pacific [1].

     (b)   Explain the pattern of regional ecological footprints in 2010.                      [4]

           Award [1] for stating a pattern of some kind. For example: “Economically
           developed regions (eg Oceania, North America, Western Europe) have higher
           footprints”.

           Award [1] for each valid point made that explains why footprints may be high or
           low in different regions. Ideally responses should refer to both resource
           consumption and waste generation but this is not essential for full marks.

           For example: High Income nations that have high standards of living [1] tend to
           consume vast quantities of non-renewable energy [1] and generate lots of
           greenhouse gases [1] hence the high ecological footprint.

           Possibilities include:
            quality of life/affluence
            sources of energy
            levels of energy consumption
            dominant economic activities/degree of industrialization
            levels of development
            diet, for example of ecological footprint of meat
            levels of recycling/re-use

           Accept alternative valid explanations.

           Responses referring to population size should not be credited.

     (c)   Explain the anti-Malthusian view of the relationship between population and
           resources.                                                                         [5]

           Responses should describe the anti-Malthusian view (it could be implied within
           the explanation) [1].

           For example: Resources will keep pace with population growth.
           Carrying capacity will increase as human population increases.

           Responses should explain TWO arguments used by anti-Malthusians [2+2].

           Award [1] for each basic explanation, with an additional [1] for extension or
           exemplification.

           Possibilities include:
            the use of technological fixes, eg in agriculture to achieve higher yields
            resource substitution overcomes resource depletion
            recycling allows conservation of existing resources.

5.   Examine the reasons for and against preserving the biodiversity of tropical rainforests.   [15]

     Responses should demonstrate some understanding of biodiversity and acknowledge
     that tropical rainforests have immense biodiversity.

     Reasons for preserving biodiversity could include:
      ecological/climate value (some plants store more carbon dioxide and emit more
       oxygen than others)
      role as a carbon reserve and possible contribution to climate change mitigation
       attempts
      value in terms of gene pool (flora/fauna)
      actual and potential future value for industry/medicine/food
      economic value for ecotourism, and other sustainable uses
      habitat for endangered peoples (and endangered animals/plants).

     Reasons against might override the need to preserve biodiversity and could include:
      clearance for timber or other resources
      clearance of land for agriculture (livestock/soya beans), transport, settlement
      most tropical rainforest is in developing countries that need the resources for
       development
      elimination/reduction of tropical pests and diseases
      the need to defoliate areas during warfare
      the high cost of preserving forests in areas where population is growing and needs
       resources
      forest area may be reduced or lost in the future anyway due to climate change.

     Answers that address only the importance of preserving the rainforest and not the
     importance of preserving the biodiversity of the rainforest should not progress beyond
     band C.

     At band D, responses should show some understanding of biodiversity and are likely to
     examine a limited number of reasons, almost entirely for preservation, with limited
     development.

     At band E, responses will be underpinned by an understanding of biodiversity, will
     examine several reasons and include some consideration of the reasons against
     preserving biodiversity, possibly with some simplistic evaluation.

     At band F expect a more balanced approach using specific detailed knowledge, prior to

6.   The third Millennium Development Goal is to “promote gender equality and empower
      women”. To what extent might international migration play a role in helping this goal
     to be achieved?                                                                            [15]

     There are many possible approaches to this question.

     It would be expected that responses show a clear understanding of this particular MDG
     and some understanding of outcomes for gender empowerment and/or equality.
     This can be stated or implied. It would also be expected that most responses make
     use of valid recent example(s) of international migrations that could impact upon the
     migrants themselves or on women either in the source country or the destination, ie the
     impact may not be isolated to just the migrants (for example the migration of
     Indonesian and Filipino women to Hong Kong as domestic workers has had numerous
     positive and negative outcomes for gender empowerment within the host society).
     Voluntary or forced migrations may be discussed in the response but the examples
     referenced must involve movement across an international border.

     The focus of the argument will depend on the examples chosen. Candidates may look
     at the large-scale movement of women from countries such as the Philippines or
     Indonesia to other regions to do domestic work. Alternatively the essay may focus on
     the movement of economic migrants of both genders from, for example, Mexico to the
     USA, and how this migration and the flow of remittances and ideas impacts upon
     gender roles/empowerment for both the migrants and those still in the country of origin.

     There are some obvious positive and negative outcomes for gender as a result of
     migration:

     Example: Domestic workers from Indonesia to Hong Kong:
     For the female migrants:
     + independence, travel, financial security;
     – abuse, trauma of being away from families, low wages, live-in policy, right of abode
     For the destination:
     + Most households have two working adults, with women having successful careers;
     – Domestic and childcare work is still seen as “women’s work” and grossly underpaid.

     These gender-related outcomes would be determined by the movement(s) being
     utilized in the response.

     At band D, expect an example/examples of international migrations and a description
     of impacts of this movement on gender empowerment.

     At band E, expect an example/examples of international migrations and some
     explanation of both positive and negative impacts of this/ these movements on gender
     empowerment.

     At band F, expect an example/examples of international migrations and some
     explanation of both positive and negative impacts of this/these movements on gender
     empowerment and there should be some attempt at an evaluation of the “to what
     extent” part of the statement.

7.   Discuss the extent to which two or more named countries or regions have met their
     Millennium Development Goals (MDGs).                                                        [15]

     Responses should show a clear understanding of what the MDGs set out to achieve.

     All goals need not be covered in the response. Strong responses are likely to identify
     that some countries/regions have been more successful than others in meeting their
     targets. For example, answers may focus on populations in Southeast Asia and
     South Asia where considerable progress has been made compared with
     Sub-Saharan Africa where many nations are behind on some targets.

     Alternatively answers may focus on the fact that poverty, hunger, education and
     reduced child mortality targets have been very successful but targets linked to gender
     empowerment are still far off-target in many places.

     Stronger candidates may recognize that some of the MDG targets are different for
     different regions/countries and that they are tied to percentages; thus, it has been
     easier for some countries to meet their targets than others and therefore, even when
     targets are met, large numbers of people may still be experiencing a low quality of life.

     At band D, responses are likely to describe some of the MDGs with limited reference to
     actual progress within a country or region.

     At band E, responses are likely to have generally accurate knowledge of MDGs and
     make some reference to progress in two or more countries/regions, possibly with some
     simplistic evaluation.

     At band F, a range of MDG targets will be discussed, with accurate knowledge of the
     level (or lack) of progress being made in two or more countries/regions, leading to
     some conclusion/evaluation of the extent to which the goals have been met.
