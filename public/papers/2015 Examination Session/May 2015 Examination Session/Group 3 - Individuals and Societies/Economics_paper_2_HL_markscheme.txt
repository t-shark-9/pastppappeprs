                        member countries agree to liberalize trade (trade freely amongst
                        themselves) and adopt a common external tariff (or common trade
                        policies towards non members).

(b)   Using an AD/AS diagram, explain how devaluation of the lat (the Latvian
      currency) might have been used to improve the Latvian economy during the

           For drawing a correctly labelled AD/AS diagram showing a shift of AD to
           the right and an increase in real GDP or for an explanation that devaluation
           of the lat may have caused an increase in aggregate demand through an
           increase in exports and/or a decrease in imports, thus bringing about an
           increase in real GDP.

       2   There is a correct diagram and an accurate written response.                    3–4
           For drawing a correctly labelled AD/AS diagram showing a shift of AD to
           the right and an increase in real GDP and for an explanation that
           devaluation of the lat may have caused an increase in aggregate demand
           through an increase in exports and/or a decrease in imports, thus bringing
           about an increase in real GDP.

      Candidates who incorrectly label diagrams can be rewarded with a maximum
      of [3].

      For AD/AS, the vertical axis may be price level, average price level, PL or APL.
      The horizontal axis may be output, real output, national output, real national
      output, national income, or GDP. A title is not necessary.

(c)   Using a production possibilities curve (PPC) diagram, explain the change in
      Latvia’s economy from 2008 to 2012 (paragraphs  and ).                               [4]

       1   There is a correct diagram or an accurate written response.                      1–2
           For drawing a correctly labelled PPC diagram showing a movement from
           one point within the curve to a new point closer to the curve or for an
           explanation that Latvia experienced economic growth from 2008 to 2012,
           which means that there was an increase in output shown as a movement to
           a new point, closer to the PPC.

       2   There is a correct diagram and an accurate written response.                     3–4
           For drawing a correctly labelled PPC diagram showing a movement from
           one point within the curve to a new point closer to the curve and for an
           explanation that Latvia experienced economic growth from 2008 to 2012,
           which means that there was an increase in output shown as a movement
           to a new point, closer to the PPC.

      Candidates who incorrectly label diagrams can be rewarded with a maximum
      of [3].

      Candidates might show a different combination of points within the PPC on the
      diagram. There might be an initial movement from one point inside the curve to a
      further point inside the curve to reflect the 20 % drop in output in 2008. To show
      the change from 2008 to 2012, there must be a new point closer to the PPC.

      For a PPC, the axes could be two alternative products, one on each axis,
      eg Good A and Good B or Schools and Cars; or two groups of products or two
      sectors, eg Consumer Goods and Producer Goods. A title is not necessary.

      Command term
      “Evaluate” requires candidates to make an appraisal by weighing up the
      strengths and limitations.

      Responses may include:
       definition of monetary union.

       increased foreign investment (paragraph )
       increased economic growth (paragraph )
       greater integration with the eurozone helps reduce dependence on Russia
         (paragraph )
       renewed confidence in the eurozone will bring benefits to all members
         (paragraph )
       may help to bring down unemployment, which is high (paragraph )
       Latvia had to exercise discipline to meet the criteria to join the eurozone which
         built a good economic foundation for moving forward (paragraph ).

                  For explaining that a current account deficit occurs when the outflow of
                  money for imports of goods and services plus investment income and/or
                  transfers is greater than the revenue gained from exports of goods and
                  services plus investment income and/or transfers or for explaining that a
                  budget deficit exists where government domestic revenue is less than
                  government expenditure.

             2    There is a correct explanation.                                                  3–4

                  transfers is greater than the revenue gained from exports of goods and

                  budget deficit exists where government domestic revenue is less than
                  government expenditure.

             To achieve full marks for the definition of current account deficit, students must
             refer to more than simply “trade in goods and service”. That is, there must be
             reference to at least one of “investment income” or “transfers”.

           people to save in the US rather than in India, and to do so they will have to
           exchange (sell) their rupees for dollars thus increasing the supply of
           rupees, and lowering the value of the rupee.

      Responses may include:

      Expenditure switching policies:
       an explanation of expenditure switching policies (trade protection and
        devaluation/depreciation) as a means of reducing spending on imports
       government has shown a willingness to use trade protection – gold tariffs
        (paragraph ) (but trade protection may go against international trade
        agreements)
       falling rupee may help with expenditure switching (paragraph ), depending
        on the PED for exports and imports (Marshall-Lerner condition)
       to encourage the “switch” from imports to domestic goods government should
        let the rupee continue to fall, not support it (paragraph ), (but the falling
        rupee causes other problems).

      Expenditure reducing policies:
       an explanation of expenditure reducing policies as a means of reducing
        spending on imports
       economic growth has dropped to 5 % so little room for expenditure reducing

  competitiveness of exports
 need to speed up reforms to help India reach its potential (paragraph )
 market-oriented policies, eg reducing the regulatory burden may encourage
  investment and increase productivity (paragraph )
 interventionist policies, eg increase investment in education and policies to
  support industry may help increase growth (paragraph ).

To reach Level 3, students must be aware of the particular situation in the Indian
economy, not just present an evaluation of policies to reduce a current account
deficit in general.

      Command term
      “Discuss” requires candidates to offer a considered and balanced review that
      includes a range of arguments, factors or hypotheses. Opinions or conclusions
      should be presented clearly and supported by appropriate evidence.

      Responses may include:
       definition of trade, aid, economic development.

      Benefits of trade for economic development:
       access to export markets (paragraph ) and revenue (paragraph )
       increased employment
       access to imports from China (paragraph )
       import new technologies (paragraph )
       exploit comparative advantage
       economies of scale
       improvements in efficiencies
       greater choice
       all of the above could result in higher economic growth, which might lead to
        economic development through higher incomes.

      Limitations of trade for economic development:
       overdependence on a narrow range of commodity exports (Figure 1) leads to
         the inability to expand in value-added sectors
       vulnerability to price fluctuations and economic conditions in China results in
         fluctuations in government and business revenues
       overexploitation of resources in African countries may be a threat to
         sustainable development
       diagram to show negative externalities.

Benefits of aid for economic development:
 target specific sectors, eg agriculture, housing, education, healthcare
  (paragraph )
 targets development of human capital through education and training
  (paragraphs  and )
 break the poverty cycle, filling gaps
 building key infrastructure (paragraphs ,  and Figure 2).

Limitations of aid:
 overdependence
 potential for abuse through corruption
 poorly targeted aid
 politically motivated aid targeted at inappropriate sectors
 tied aid.

To reach level 3, students must show awareness of the ways in which aid and
trade impact upon economic development (not simply discuss the advantages
and disadvantages of aid and trade in general).

      Command term
      “Discuss” requires candidates to offer a considered and balanced review that
      includes a range of arguments, factors or hypotheses. Opinions or conclusions
      should be presented clearly and supported by appropriate evidence.

      Responses may include:
       definition of economic development
       identification and explanation of market-oriented policies:
        - deregulation (paragraph )
        - increased flexibility in the labour market (paragraph )
        - free trade policy (paragraph )
       identification and explanation of interventionist policies:
        - new social programmes for the poor (paragraph )
        - transfer payments (cash transfers, pensions) (paragraph )
        - increased minimum wage (paragraph )
       market-oriented policies may lead to:
        - higher private investment (paragraphs  and ) will lead to economic
           growth, which may or may not translate into economic development
        - lower or higher unemployment, depending on the type of policy
        - benefits of free trade (greater choice, lower prices, higher consumer
           surplus) that may enhance peoples’ standards of living
        - efficient allocation of resources
        - higher economic growth, which may or may not translate into economic
           development
        - more inequality which hinders economic development
        - externalities associated with mining which worsen the standards of living of
           workers and third parties
        - insufficient provision of infrastructure and other merit goods

 Interventionist policies may lead to:
  - increased equality (lower Gini coefficient)
  - reduction in the poverty rate (paragraph )
  - opportunity cost issues
  - provision of infrastructure
  - reduction in the informal and untaxed sectors.

To reach Level 3, students must show awareness of the ways in which
market-oriented policies and government intervention impact upon economic
development (not simply discuss the advantages and disadvantages of the two
strategies).

Any reasonable discussion.
