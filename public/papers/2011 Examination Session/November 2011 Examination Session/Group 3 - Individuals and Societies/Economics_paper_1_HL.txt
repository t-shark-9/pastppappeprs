Answer one question. Each question is worth [25 marks].

1.    (a)   Explain the different objectives that a firm in an oligopolistic market structure
            might try to achieve.                                                                [10 marks]

      (b)   Evaluate the view that an oligopolistic market is an inefficient market structure.   [15 marks]


2.    (a)   Explain what the multiplier is and, using a numerical example, demonstrate how
            it can be calculated.                                                                [10 marks]

      (b)   Evaluate whether real Gross Domestic Product (GDP) can be increased by the
            use of demand-side policies.                                                         [15 marks]


3.    (a)   Explain, using a diagram, how government intervention can change the
            exchange rate of a currency.                                                         [10 marks]

      (b)   Reducing the value of a country’s currency is an effective solution for a
            balance of payments deficit on the current account.  Evaluate this view.             [15 marks]


4.    (a)   Explain the differences between foreign direct investment (FDI) and aid.             [10 marks]

      (b)   Evaluate the view that aid is an effective means to achieve economic growth
            and development in less-developed countries (LDCs).                                  [15 marks]
