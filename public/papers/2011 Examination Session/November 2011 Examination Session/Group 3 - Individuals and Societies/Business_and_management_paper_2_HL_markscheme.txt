                                              SECTION A

1.   (a)   Define the following terms:

           (i)    partnership                                                                     [2 marks]

                  A partnership is a type of unincorporated organization made up of no more
                  than 20 owners (depending on the country of origin). A partnership will
                  normally have unlimited liability for its owners and key functions will be
                  shared out according to the partnership agreement.


                  Candidates are not expected to word their definition exactly as above.

                  Award [1 mark] for a basic definition that conveys partial knowledge and
                  understanding.

                  Award [2 marks] for a full, clear definition that conveys knowledge and
                  understanding similar to the answer above.

                  For only a relevant: example or application to the stimulus award [1 mark].

           (ii)   working capital.                                                                [2 marks]

                  Working capital, sometimes called circulating capital, is the amount of
                  money needed to pay for the day-to-day running of a business. Without
                  working capital, businesses cannot trade. Working capital provides funds to
                  purchase raw materials or pay invoices to creditors. It is shown in a balance
                  sheet as the difference between current assets and current liabilities.


                  Candidates are not expected to word their definition exactly as above.

                  Award [1 mark] for a basic definition that conveys partial knowledge and
                  understanding.

                  Award [2 marks] for a full, clear definition that conveys knowledge and
                  understanding similar to the answer above.

                  For only a relevant: example or application to the stimulus award [1 mark].

(b)   Explain two disadvantages for RL of having too much working capital in
      unsold second-hand books.                                              [4 marks]

      Possible disadvantages could include:
      • Opportunity costs of too much money tied up in stock, which is leading to a
        significant liquidity issue.
      • Space in the central London bookshop is being used up in such a manner that
        customers are beginning to provide negative feedback which could lead to
        some concerns around word-of-mouth promotion and customer service.
      • It would seem that with the growing influence of competition, the value of
        RL’s stock of unsold second-hand books may decrease. If the closing stock
        value of unsold books decrease then cost of sales will increase, negatively
        impacting on RL’s gross profit.
      • Accept any other relevant disadvantage.


      Mark as 2+2.

      Award [1 mark] for each appropriate disadvantage identified for RL of having too
      much working capital and [1 mark] for an appropriate explanation that directly
      refers to RL up to a maximum of [2 marks].

      Award [1 mark] for a relevant explanation which is theoretical and has not been
      applied to RL.

(c)   (i)   Construct a fully labelled decision tree for James’ “three options of
            physical expansion for RL”.        Calculate the predicted outcome
            for each option and identify the most profitable option (show all
            your working).                                                        [7 marks]

       The decision tree is not accurately constructed, the calculations of each
       option are not all presented or accurate, but there is some evidence of a
       general knowledge of the model.

       [3 to 5 marks]
       The principal elements of the decision tree are constructed but may not be
       entirely accurate. The calculations of each option are largely correct and
       clearly presented at the top end of the markband. Deduct [1 mark] per
       error. Working may not be shown.

       [6 to 7 marks]
       The decision tree is accurately constructed. The calculations of each option
       are correct and well presented. For [7 marks] a key is provided. Workings
       are shown.

(ii)   Explain one advantage and one disadvantage for RL of using a decision
       tree as a decision-making tool.                                       [4 marks]

       Possible advantages for RL include:
       • The brothers can clearly see all the options and sub-options in the visual
         representation which gives a clear indication of costs and outcomes
         for RL.
       • The model provides a quantification of the outcomes of each option as
         well as the risk attached with the probabilities of success and failure for
         RL.

       Possible disadvantages for RL include:
       • The expected financial return (and thus the final decision) will depend on
         the probabilities. We have no information as to how James arrived at
         these figures as they are estimated.
       • External and non-financial figures are not included in the diagram, for
         example moving the bookshop to a large shopping centre outside of
         central London could alienate some loyal customers. The reactions of
         competitors are unknown and the risk attitude of the brothers is not
         reflected in the decision tree.

(d)   Contrast James’ strategy of physical expansion with Nick’s e-commerce
      strategy.                                                             [6 marks]

      James’ expansion option 2(a) without a café produces an expected monetary value
      of UK£460 000. This money will go some way to easing some of the liquidity
      problems and with more space perhaps it will allow RL to sell some of the older
      stock which may become worth less as time passes.

      However, the cost of the expansion will be UK£900 000 and we have no
      information on how the brothers intend to pay for this. The liquidity problem
      could indicate difficulty in obtaining financial support from external sources of
      funds. Also we need to consider the non-financial factors and the current external
      environment, which could influence the decision to take a calculated risk on
      moving the bookshop outside of central London.

      Nick’s idea of an e-commerce facility is perceived as a cheaper option and may
      allow RL to compete head on with the new and existing online booksellers such as
      Amazon and allow them to find new customers to sell to. There could be some
      considerable savings to be made as well as easing growing customer frustration.

      However, RL’s brand value may diminish if it is now perceived as just another
      online bookseller. It may also find it hard to compete with Amazon which has a
      greater presence online and brand loyalty of its own. Will RL have to find a new
      promotional catchphrase or can “Hard to find but worth the time” be successfully
      applied in an e-commerce environment? There could be considerable hidden
      costs of training and the setting up of a supply chain if an e-commerce facility is
      to be successfully established.

                  TQM is the establishment of a culture of quality affecting the attitudes and
                  actions of all employees at all levels in an organization. Every work group
                  or department must think of those they work for as customers. Emphasis is
                  put on customer service, the creation and production of high-quality
                  products, the use of zero defect policies hence getting things right the
                  first time. Overall, quality is higher while costs are reduced.

                  Redundancy is the laying off of an employee due to a lack of available
                  work, as the employer is unable to afford to employ him/her anymore, or the
                  business no longer has the need for an employee to carry out work of a
                  particular kind.

(b)   (i)   Explain why “the global economic recession in 2009–2010 resulted in a
            severe fall in demand for Fabia dresses” and what the likely
            consequences of the economic recovery are for Fabia.                  [5 marks]

            The global economic recession during 2009–2010 resulted in a significant
            fall in demand because the main targeted segment is women with income
            elastic demand. The dresses are perceived and positioned as luxury
            products. During a recession the income of many customers falls or there
            may be a fear of possible loss of income. These customers tend to reduce
            consumption of luxurious products first. They are, therefore, very
            responsive to a fall or possible fall in their income. Hence for every 1 %
            fall in the income of the women in the targeted segment, the demand for the
            luxury dresses will fall by a larger percentage, which can result in a rather
            significant fall in demand. Conversely, during economic recovery, when
            income increases or is expected to increase, for every 1 % increase in their
            income, these women will increase their demand for the dresses by a larger
            percentage, given the luxurious nature of the product, hence Fabia is likely
            to benefit significantly.

            Accept any other relevant explanation.


            [1 to 3 marks]
            Limited knowledge of the concept is evident. A list may be provided

(ii)   Using Table 1 and any other relevant information, calculate whether
       outsourcing the production of dresses to Patella would be profitable for
       Fabia at 200 000 dresses per annum (show all your working).              [6 marks]

       Candidates are expected to produce calculations of Fabia’s profit before
       and after a possible outsourcing decision to Patella.

       Any relevant methods used by the candidate should be rewarded provided
       the method used is accurate and full workings are shown. Candidates may
       calculate profit before and after simply by calculating TR – TC, or they may
       decide to work on the margin – loss of contribution versus a fall in fixed
       cost, in order to reach the answer.

       Candidates are also expected to clearly present their calculations / findings.
       Some examples of calculations that could be included are shown below
       (all figures are in US$):

       Current level of profit before outsourcing:
       TR – TC
       200 000 × 150 – ( 7m + 80 × 200 000 )
       30m − 23m = 7m
       Or
               7m
                           = 100 000 units are required to break-even.
       70 ( contribution )
       MOS = 200 000 − 100 000 = 100 000 units.
       100 000 units × 70 ( contribution ) = 7m total profit.

       After outsourcing:
       Loss of contribution = 5 per garment × 200 000 units = 1m.
       But Fabia saves 5m on fixed costs.
       Hence net gain of 4m of extra profit.
       Or
       TR –TC
       30m − ( 2m + 85 × 200 000 units )
       30m − 19m = 11m
       11m − 7m = 4m extra profit.

       Accept any relevant method used.


       Use Own Figure Rule (OFR) if the original calculations are not accurate.
       Do not double penalize.

(c)   Analyse the proposal to outsource the production of dresses to Patella.                [6 marks]

      On the one hand, if Fabia outsources the production to Patella it will gain an
      extra $4m of profit. Fabia will be able to concentrate on the design and
      marketing. Given the fact that the design is one of its main USPs, it might be
      appropriate just to concentrate on its core competencies and try to establish a
      greater market share. Fabia’s USP will be maintained or even improved.
      Although Fabia still has a considerable underutilized capacity and should be able
      to respond to an increase in demand, Patella can produce considerably more
      dresses for Fabia.

      However, the redundancy of 65 % of its workforce due to the closure of the
      manufacturing facility will add extra costs – redundancy payment. This is likely
      to reduce the amount of the above financial gain. It might also affect the
      motivation of the remaining employees. A constant fear of further redundancy
      might affect trust, morale and productivity.

      Fabia’s image of being ethical might be severely impaired due to Patella being a
      company which takes advantage of the lack of regulations in Vietnam. Patella
      might act unethically in terms of its treatment of employees, damage to the
      environment and pressure on suppliers – unfair trade.

      Moreover, domestically, it might lose its ethical reputation given the massive
      redundancy. The two issues above may result in a fall in demand despite the
      predicted economic recovery.

      In terms of production – using Patella might erode the quality of their product
      and the advantages of using TQM. Again, quality is Fabia’s USP and therefore
      should be guarded. Fabia is likely to lose control of the production process and
      the resultant quality. Moreover, once the factory is shut, Fabia will find it
      difficult to re-open it again should it wish to terminate the contract with Patella.

      Given the fact that Patella is located in Asia, Fabia may also reduce
      transportation costs – further financial benefits. However, Patella might increase
      the future price of its dresses – the financial benefits might be reduced.

      Accept any other relevant analysis.

                  A market segment is a sub-group – people with similar characteristics and
                  similar needs – within a larger market. Market segments are often identified
                  by age, gender, level of education or occupation, social class, income,
                  ethnic group, geographical region, religion, or political affiliation.

                  Flow production is a continuous and automated production process where
                  each stage is linked with the next so production time is minimized. Flow
                  production is an increasingly highly automated process using capital-
                  intensive production methods.

                  Flow production is normally associated with large production runs of
                  largely standardized homogeneous products.

(b) Explain what Shira could do in order to overcome the workers’ resistance
    to change.                                                               [6 marks]

    Shira should openly communicate with workers about the need (driving forces)
    for change. She should listen to their fears resulting from the implementation of
    TQM and try to address them. Some of the workers may fear working in groups
    and may find the possible job enlargement and enrichment challenging. She
    should explain how TQM will benefit the whole company in terms of the benefits
    of empowerment and group decision-making. She could provide opportunities for
    training and development for those employees who feel they may not be able to
    cope with the new production method. Shira could also use financial incentives to
    reward group performance as well as non-financial rewards to further motivate
    the workers.

    TQM will lead to significant management/cultural changes for Nesbit with the
    redeployment of some workers into new roles. Job descriptions will need to be
    rewritten. Shira should be able to demonstrate that moving to TQM should
    improve job satisfaction and lead to positive outcomes for Nesbit at a time when a
    number of competitors are threatening their market position. Job security could
    be enhanced.

    Shira might consider some modification of her proposed changes in line with
    employee suggestions.

(c)   Analyse the usefulness of Shira hiring an agency “to prepare a market audit
      and to conduct market research”.                                            [6 marks]

      Some of the arguments for hiring an agency include:
      • The task is given to a specialized organization who will have the expertise in
        terms of staff and resources to carry out thorough research.
      • The agency identified a gap in the market.
      • The agency will be more objective in their approach without any bias in
        obtaining the figures. This will be important for the accuracy of the market
        audit and the market research.

      Some of the arguments against hiring an agency include:
      • It is likely to be more expensive to hire an agency than for Shira to conduct the
        research herself.
      • An agency will concentrate on external factors and perhaps not too much on
        Nesbit’s internal strengths and weaknesses. Consequently the recommendation
        may not take into account Nesbit’s financial position and the workers’
        resistance to producing the new healthy chocolate bar.

      Accept any other relevant analysis.


      N.B. it is not expected that the candidates incorporate all of the above arguments.

(d)   Discuss whether the launch of Veneziano could change customer perceptions
      of Nesbit.                                                                [9 marks]

      Nesbit has been the market leader and enjoys brand loyalty amongst its youth
      segment of the chocolate market. The introduction of the new healthy chocolate
      bar will delight some stakeholders who may feel that Nesbit is being dynamic,
      innovative and socially responsible. TQM may result in lower levels of waste and
      hopefully cost and perhaps there may be some scope for the development of other
      new bars via research. The new bar Veneziano will be priced higher than its
      current products and this will also highlight a change (both positively and
      negatively) in customer perception.

      However, it is going to be difficult to change the perception of a company on the
      release of one new product. Some new customers will want to see further
      evidence that the company is willing to position itself away from the youth
      market into more healthy type of chocolate. New promotional campaigns to
      change perceptions will cost additional funds and it will take time to convince
      customers that this company has changed irrevocably. Some may be sceptical
      about Nesbit’s motive and will not change their overall perception. Of course
      some younger consumers may be dismayed at these changes and continue to see
      Nesbit as only a “youth” targeting company.

      Possible judgment:

      Veneziano represents a potentially lucrative move for Nesbit and early sales have
      been impressive. Shira should seek new additional customer feedback once this
      healthy chocolate bar has been established or other new bars are released onto the
      market to be confident of Nesbit’s new positioning as an adult chocolate
      company.

4.   (a)   Describe two characteristics of a public limited company.                              [4 marks]

           Characteristics of a public limited company like GSK may include:
           • Finance is raised through selling shares to the public.
           • A public limited company has to go through the initial stage of flotation/
             “going public”.
           • After “going public”, shares are traded on a stock exchange. Therefore the
             shares can be bought and sold by the public.
           • The owners have limited liability and can only lose as much as the sum of their
             investment.
           • There may be a divorce of ownership and control.

           Accept any other relevant characteristic.

           Award [1 mark] for each relevant and correct characteristic of a public limited
           company identified and [1 mark] for each clear description of the characteristic
           up to a maximum of [2 marks].

     (b)   Using the concept of price elasticity of demand, explain GSK’s pricing
           strategy for its flu vaccine.                                          [6 marks]

           GSK plans to use price discrimination strategy by cutting prices in sub-Saharan
           Africa to a quarter of the British and American prices. It appears that GSK
           assumes that the people who will be or are affected in the British and American
           markets are more price inelastic than those who are affected in sub-Saharan
           Africa. The possible reason is that the flu vaccine may be regarded as more of a
           luxury product among the poorer sufferers and more of necessity among the
           relatively richer ones in British and American markets. By charging higher price
           for those who can afford the products and have a low price elasticity of demand
           (less than 1), GSK will increase its total revenue. Similarly, by lowering the price
           to those with a high price elasticity of demand (more than 1) GSK will increase its
           total revenue as well. Given the fact that costs are likely to remain constant,
           profit will increase while GSK can still be perceived as ethical.

           Accept any other relevant explanation.

                                        Development




          [Source: http://tutor2u.net/business/strategy/ansoff_matrix.htm, accessed 4 March 2011]


      To extend GSK’s product range, particularly in cosmetic products through
      acquisitions of companies such as Stiefel Laboratories, Inc., an American
      manufacturer of skincare products.

      This strategy can be seen as a related diversification on the Ansoff matrix.
      GSK can still use its core competencies/experience/knowledge in the consumer
      product market but enter into a different but somewhat related market/of
      consumer skincare. It will enable GSK to fulfil its objectives of reducing its
      dependency on a few cash cows in the pharmaceutical industry. A synergy can be
      created with the newly acquired companies that can possibly enhance/create
      GSK’s world dominance and create economies of scale.
                                        – 21 –            N11/3/BUSMT/HP2/ENG/TZ0/XX/M


While risk will be reduced, GSK might face some problems with its acquisition
of a company like Stiefel Laboratories, Inc.. Legal issues, cultural issues, over
diversification, increased costs/diseconomies of scale and so on might erode
GSK’s competitive advantage and focus in the market.

To enter emerging, fast-growing economies by acquiring Dr. Reddy’s,
an Indian generic drugs company.

This strategy can be classified as product development – generic products. Some
candidates may classify it as market development – taking its current products as
well as new generic ones into fast-growing economies. Although it is stated in
the stimulus material that GSK is operating in many countries, some are likely to
be fast-growing economies.

Nevertheless, give credit to these candidates.       Some might see this move as
diversification.

By buying a company that specializes in generic products, GSK makes its product
more affordable and can be further seen as a more ethical organization. GSK can
use price differentiation in this way. Furthermore, its profit is likely to increase as
the demand for generic products in the fast-growing economies is likely to be
high. Lower prices will result in increased TR (relatively elastic PED).

However:
One can argue that selling both generic and non-generic drugs may confuse some
customers and they will be seeking the generic rather than the branded ones.
Brand erosion may occur and GSK might find it difficult to justify high prices for
the non-generic products. On a more technical note, purchasing another company
may involve costs. Legal and cultural barriers may reduce the effectiveness of
this strategy.

Accept any relevant arguments for or against each option.


Credit candidates who applied the other strategy and examined the effects. For
example: “to collaborate with other pharmaceutical companies”. This decision
may be seen as part of a new product development growth strategy.

(d)   Discuss GSK’s aim to “balance the need to make a profit with the ethical side
      of health care”.                                                              [9 marks]

      Some of the possible issues/arguments which are relevant to the commercial
      side and the need to be profitable:
      GSK must anticipate the needs in the market and come up with a new,
      effective and innovative product ahead of its major competitors to keep its
      competitive edge. The costs and duration of the research and development
      (R&D) stage are significantly large and long. Despite the fact that in 2009, the
      group received 195 million orders for flu vaccines and it is expected that sales
      into 2010 will reach US$1.3 billion, the level of profit might be considerably
      lower given the enormous costs in R&D and the length of time it takes to develop
      such a product. GSK spent 18 years and US$3 billion preparing by researching
      and developing new flu vaccines for the flu pandemic. The relationship between
      the product life cycle, investment profit and cash flow should also be discussed.
      GSK will only reap the profit when the product starts growing. During the
      development and the introduction stages coupled with the possible heavy costs
      spent on branding, this product draws cash but does not generate profit/TR.
      Therefore, one may argue that while there is a need/demand for this product, GSK
      should indeed charge as high a price as possible to recoup the costs of R&D and
      to generate sufficient profit to enable it to develop further solutions/cures for other
      diseases for the benefit of mankind. There is also the issue of generic products
      versus GSK’s branded product. After the patent expires or even before, due to
      imitation, other pharmaceutical companies might produce similar products
      charging considerably lower prices which can erode GSK’s profit. The
      shareholders also expect good returns for such a long and risky investment
      otherwise they might sell their shares with a possible significant effect on the
      value of GSK.

      Accept any relevant argument.

      The arguments above can be judged as significant in determining GSK’s decision
      to be highly commercial, profit-orientated and charge a high price for the flu
      vaccine.

      However, some of the possible arguments for being ethical:
      Andrew is aware that it is expected by many stakeholders like the wider
      community, World Health Organization, governments of countries where the
      incidence of the flu is high but the standards of living of most members of the
      population is low, that GSK perhaps should be more ethical/socially responsible
      and should not consider profit at all times as their main objective. Consequently,
      GSK plans to cut prices in sub-Saharan Africa to a quarter of the British and
      American prices and to share research with rivals on tropical diseases. It is clear
      that the pricing strategy chosen is of price discrimination. Given the fact that it is
      going to be done on a geographical basis, the strategy is likely to work to a large
      extent. There is always a danger of the re-selling of a product in developing
      countries, but it is a risk that GSK is probably willing to take to be seen as an
      ethical organization. On the other hand, collaborating with rival companies may
      result in the transfer of knowledge/industry secrets to competitors. GSK’s
      competitive advantage/USP may be eroded.
                                      – 23 –            N11/3/BUSMT/HP2/ENG/TZ0/XX/M


However, being ethical can also benefit GSK in the long term especially given its
strategic growth option in terms of approval by the local government of their
acquisition and/or joint venture, resulting in possible tax concessions and so on.
TR/profit may also increase due to price discrimination.

Accept any other relevant argument.

It looks as if GSK has other strategies that enable growth, reduced risk and
increased profit in the long as well as the short term. Therefore, being ethical and
reducing the price in sub-Saharan Africa will not likely create too much
resentment among the shareholders – especially if those affected or government in
the British and American markets are willing to pay higher prices. The other risks
mentioned above may also be seen as manageable and not very significant.
GSK’s aim seems very viable/achievable without much, if any resentment.

stimulus material.

(b)   Explain the effects on Eat Well’s profit and loss account resulting from using
      LIFO and FIFO stock valuation (figures are not required).                      [6 marks]

      If Eat Well uses a FIFO method of stock valuation, the value/price of the stock
      that is bought first is used. Given the fact that the last batch of stock is
      measured/counted as closing stock and assuming that the older stock is cheaper,
      the method of FIFO results in higher value of closing stock, consequently lower
      value of cost of goods sold and higher level of gross profit as opposed to LIFO.
      The use of LIFO stock valuation will result in a lower value of closing stock as
      the older/assuming cheaper stock is left. Higher cost of goods sold will therefore
      result in lower gross profit (GP).

      Given the higher recorded GP under FIFO, the use of the FIFO method results in
      higher tax liability that will further increase the current liability of Eat Well with a
      direct negative effect on its retained profit. The use of LIFO will produce an
      opposite effect. Under LIFO, Eat Well may benefit from a lower tax rate/lower
      current liability and therefore the use of this method can mitigate the increase in
      the level of tax by the government.

      Accept any other relevant explanation.


      N.B. it is expected that the candidates explain the differences between the
      methods and its effects on Eat Well’s profit and not just assert that it is
      different/opposite.

      It is not expected that the candidates use figures to demonstrate/reinforce the
      above issues.

      goods sold in a clear and appropriate manner. Appropriate reference is made to
      Eat Well.

(c)   Analyse Kaa’s decision to change Eat Well’s stock control method to
      just-in-case (JIC).                                                 [6 marks]

      Just-in-time (JIT) stock control method is designed to minimize the costs of
      holding stock by the use of a planned schedule and use of resources through the
      production/operation process. The system relies on a very efficient ordering and
      delivery system as stock is ordered and arrives upon the start of the operation.
      If a just-in-case (JIC) stock control method is used, Kaa will have to decide on the
      level of the buffer stock he wants to keep. It should not be too high as the stock is
      a very perishable product/food. At the same time and for the same reason Kaa
      will have to decide on the maximum level of stock to be kept to accommodate
      unexpected demand. The higher the level of stock, the more expensive it will be
      for Eat Well with a greater chance of the stock/food deteriorating. If it is a risk
      that Kaa wants to take he has to correctly estimate the lower and upper level of
      stock and has to calculate or agree upon how quickly the delivery will arrive
      (lead time) and establish an order level. The estimation of these figures might be
      difficult. Once established the system should not be technically difficult to
      operate with the use of a computer and software. Kaa will reduce the occurrences
      of being left out of stock due to frequent delays in deliveries of ingredients as he
      can use the buffer stock. Eat Well is less likely to suffer from a loss of reputation.
      Using a wholesaler will also enable Kaa to respond to customers’ demand for a
      more varied menu and less offerings of local dishes. Kaa will also reduce his
      dependency on unreliable local farmers and be able to gain purchasing economies
      of scale due to bulk buying of the ingredients. This may resolve the current cash-
      flow problems. However, by not using JIT stock control, Kaa may experience
      further cash-flow problems as his money will be tied up in stock. More waste will
      occur especially given the nature of the business and the fact that currently Eat
      Well prides itself on the fresh ingredients it uses.

      Accept any other relevant argument for and against provided it is relevant and
      applicable.


      It is expected that the candidates will use two arguments for and two arguments
      against JIC for the response to be judged as a balanced one.

(d)   Discuss the usefulness of market research for Kaa in order to “determine
      how to attract more customers and how to compete more effectively”.      [9 marks]

      Given the current changes/threats in the external environment mentioned in the
      stimulus as well as some internal weaknesses, one can argue that Eat Well should
      carry out both primary and secondary research.

      Eat Well will need to find out more about:
      • the consumers tastes, preferences, opinion regarding the use of organic food,
        the need for more varied and less traditional dishes
      • the 7Ps used by the new/successful competitor nearby
      • the possible changes required to Eat Well’s current marketing mix in order to
        become more competitive
      • the competitors’ customers’ opinions/preferences
      • the changes in the government regulations and the possible effects in terms of
        practices and costs on Eat Well
      • internal financial issues like costs, expenses and prices in order to address the
        current cash-flow problems
      • accept any other relevant/applicable information that might be needed.

      Given the above, some of the methods and sources that can be used are:

      Primary research
      Possible sources to be consulted: current customers, potential customers/members
      of the local community, competitors’ customers. Kaa should assess their opinions
      and get some recommendations regarding the above. Primary research is
      effective but expensive.       The possible methods that can be used are:
      questionnaires, personal interviews, telephone interviews, postal surveys, any
      other relevant IT-based research, focus groups, consumers panels, interviews.
      The above can give Kaa up-to-date, unique, and personal first-hand information in
      order to adjust its own marketing mix, especially the menu. However, the above
      methods are time-consuming, very costly and are subject to human bias. It is
      doubtful if Kaa himself has the time, the experience or the desire to carry out the
      research by himself. He will need to design and carry out the primary research in
      an appropriate way that will give relevant accurate results. He is, after all, the
      chef. Moreover, the sampling methods to be chosen as well as the unpredictable
      nature of human response might reduce the validity of the results. Eat Well is
      quite likely not to have the expertise to conduct the market research appropriately.
      Subcontracting it to a specialized organization is a valid but expensive option.

      Accept any other relevant primary source or method provided it is well applied to
      the needs of Eat Well.

      N.B. it is not expected that each sampling method will be assessed. It is also not
      expected that the candidates make an explicit distinction between sources
      and methods.

Secondary research
Eat Well can look for data and research that have been done before by more
specialized bodies. The information can be accessed very quickly and cheaply,
especially with the use of technology. While any other organization, including its
competitors have access to the information, it can still prove very relevant, useful
and affordable for Eat Well which is a small family-run organization experiencing
some cash-flow problems. Some of the relevant sources that Eat Well can use
are: government publications on the new health and safety regulations as well as
eating habits of the population. Printed information from the competitors can also
be used. Information like the menus, costs of production, ingredients, any
relevant information on the use of the 7Ps, market share, the profit and the
market share. Commercial publications can be used as well as industry specific
publications where information about health, eating habits, or any relevant
changes in the external environment can be found. Internal documents can also
be used like the profit and loss account to assess the fluctuation in demand, the
costs of production, the suitability of the pricing strategy or any other relevant
issues regarding the 7Ps.

Accept any other relevant secondary source provided it is applied to the needs of
Eat Well.

However, the information gathered may be outdated, unreliable or does not
directly meet Eat Well’s needs. Overall, both types of market research should be
used. Given the fact that Eat Well is only a small local restaurant, perhaps the use
of primary research is possible and more relevant as the market is very
geographically concentrated supplemented by a cheaper and more general
secondary research. However, a different discussion which concludes that
secondary research is more preferable should be fully accepted provided it is
substantiated.


Accept any other relevant discussion.
