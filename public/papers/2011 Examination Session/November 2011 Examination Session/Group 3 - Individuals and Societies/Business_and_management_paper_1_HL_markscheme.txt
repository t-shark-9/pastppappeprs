                                                SECTION A

1.   (a)   Describe Andrew Grandin’s:

           (i)    chain of command at Reach Out                                                       [2 marks]

                  Chain of command is the formal line of authority through which orders and
                  decisions are passed down from top to bottom of the hierarchy in a given
                  organization. In the case of Reach Out and Andrew, the chain of command
                  is very short as there are only three levels: Laura and Neil on top, Andrew in
                  the middle of the chain and all the therapists at the bottom of the
                  chain/hierarchy.


                  Award [1 mark] for a basic description, which shows some understanding
                  of the concept of “chain of command”.

                  Award [2 marks] for a clear description correctly applying the concept of
                  “chain of command” to Andrew Grandin.

           (ii)   span of control at Reach Out.                                                       [2 marks]

                  Span of control is the number of people who report directly to one manager
                  in a hierarchy – in this case: all the therapists report to Andrew as he is their
                  manager. It is a wide span of control because there are many therapists.


                  Award [1 mark] for a basic description, which shows some understanding
                  of the concept of “span of control”.

                  Award [2 marks] for a clear description correctly applying the concept of
                  “span of control” to Andrew Grandin.
                                            –8–              N11/3/BUSMT/HP1/ENG/TZ0/XX/M


(b)   Using the case study, comment on two sources of income (current or
      potential) for Reach Out other than the therapist scheme.          [4 marks]

      Besides the therapist scheme, Reach Out has several other sources of income
      (current ones and potential ones):
      • as shown in Appendix 1: the sales of subsidized PECS cards – although the
         cash flow shows that this is not an actual source of income yet
         (as Reach Out has not started selling the PECS cards)
      • as shown in Appendix 1: the charity contributions (donations) of $200 every
         month (a very small amount but a regular one)
      • as mentioned in the case study (Option 2): the possible sale of branded
         products such as clothes and accessories with the Reach Out name and logo
      • as mentioned in the case study (Option 3): the possible sponsorship from
         N-Pharma.


      Mark as 2+2.

      Award [1 mark] for each appropriate source of income identified and [1 mark] for
      an appropriate comment that directly refers to Reach Out up to a maximum of
      [2 marks].

(c)   Analyse the social and economic impacts of the actions of the non-profit
      organization Reach Out.                                                  [7 marks]

      The social and economic impacts of the actions of Reach Out include the
      following:
      • Reach Out provides a social service without which many families could not
         afford treatment for their children with autism: Reach Out has a positive social
         impact on these families, especially on the children.
      • Some private sector providers must be affected by the competition from
         Reach Out; they may lower their fees (currently up to four times higher); they
         are affected economically in a negative way as they run the risk of losing
         business.
      • The popularity of the actions of Reach Out contributes to the awareness raising
         of autism and could make it a funding priority for policy makers (this would be
         a positive impact).
      • The public sector (national or local government) may decide that they do not
         need to spend money on autism support, as organizations such as Reach Out
         now cater for it (this would be a negative impact for families).
      • Accept any other relevant impact.
      • Accept any other relevant substantiated analysis. Theoretical comments from
         outside the case study are acceptable.


      Candidates are not expected to refer to all the above points for top marks, but
      their analysis must be balanced with regards to the positive and negative social
      and economic impacts, in order to reach the highest level of the markband.

      Marks should be allocated according to the markbands on page 3.

2.   (a)   Describe Laura Chan’s desired pricing strategy for Reach Out’s PECS cards. [4 marks]

           Laura’s pricing strategy may be described in several ways:
           • Laura’s starting point (mentioned in Reach Out’s mission statement) is the fact
             that competitors’ PECS cards are very expensive: she wants her PECS cards to
             be much more affordable. Her pricing strategy is therefore competition-based
             strategy.
           • As Reach Out is a new entrant, it needs to create and gain market share against
             its competitors; the pricing strategy could be described as penetration pricing
             (as Laura may later decide to put her prices up, once she has developed brand
             loyalty towards Reach Out’s PECS cards).
           • It could be a loss leader as the PECS cards will be subsidized.
           • Cheaper PECS cards affordable to all families can be classified as
             market-based strategy, which further supports the fact that she does not use
             cost-based pricing strategy.

           Accept any other relevant answer.


           Award [1 mark] for each valid point, statement or application to Reach Out, up to
           a maximum of [4 marks].
                                           – 10 –          N11/3/BUSMT/HP1/ENG/TZ0/XX/M


(b)   Explain two reasons why Neil Johnson prepared a STEEPLE analysis for
      Reach Out (line 31).                                                 [4 marks]

      Neil prepared a STEEPLE analysis for several reasons:
      • Preparing a STEEPLE is necessary in order to write a SWOT analysis (as the O
        and T refer to the external environment).
      • As a businessman, Neil knows that the external environment must be analysed
        and taken into account when deciding on any strategic move, STEEPLE is a
        very important initial step for the development of any business plan.
      • The use of a STEEPLE is vital for the identification of opportunities and
        threats which Neil can use to strategically match with Reach Out’s internal
        strengths and weaknesses. (For example some candidates may answer by
        outlining some key findings from the STEEPLE model like political factors:
        in the absence of support from the public sector, there is a demand for
        affordable therapists such as the ones provided by Reach Out).
      • The STEEPLE framework is comprehensive as it covers social/cultural
        technological, environmental, economic, political, legal and ethical factors.

      Accept any other relevant explanation.


      Candidates are not expected to write a STEEPLE analysis for Reach Out.

      Mark as 2 + 2.

      Award [1 mark] for each correct reason identified and [1 mark] for an
      appropriate explanation that directly refers to Reach Out up to a maximum of
      [2 marks].
                                            – 11 –            N11/3/BUSMT/HP1/ENG/TZ0/XX/M


(c)   Neil Johnson wanted to “outsource the therapist scheme management role to
      an independent freelancer” (line 110). Examine whether Reach Out will
      benefit from outsourcing this role.                                       [7 marks]

      Outsourcing this management role has several advantages, so Reach Out would
      benefit in the following ways:
      • An independent freelancer could be paid according to their performance or
         according to the exact number of hours or days they work, as opposed to
         receiving a regular salary irrespective of the quantity of their work. This might
         increase motivation and improve the performance of the freelancer.
      • An independent freelancer could be dismissed and replaced more easily than an
        internal member of staff. This allows more flexibility in staffing.
      • An independent freelancer without personal/emotional interest in Reach Out
        may be in a better position to manage the therapists.

      However, outsourcing this management role has disadvantages too:
      • Reach Out may face an irregular and uncertain level of expenses, which may
        put some strain on the budget, or reduce its ability to budget.
      • Laura and Neil may not be able to control the quality of the work in the same
        way as if the manager were an internal member of staff reporting directly to
        them.
      • An independent freelancer is likely to have other commitments and other
        contracts, so they may not be able to prioritize their work as flexibly as
        Reach Out might sometimes require.
      • An independent freelancer may prove more expensive that an internal member
        of staff.

      Accept any other relevant substantiated examination.

3.   (a)   Define the following terms:

           (i)    commission (line 40)                                                          [2 marks]

                  A commission is the payment an employee receives when he or she sells a
                  good or service. Commissions are typically a percentage of the value of the
                  good or service sold, which encourages employees to sell more products.

                  Organizations sometimes pay their employees a base salary plus
                  commission; other organizations (where permitted by law) pay only
                  commission.

                  Dismissal occurs when an employer terminates the contract of an employee;
                  it is colloquially called “firing”. The employee must have been incompetent

(c)   Neil Johnson “eventually decided to donate the $10 000 himself” (line 36).
      Analyse the consequences for Reach Out of Neil’s decision.                 [7 marks]

      Neil’s decision has several consequences for Reach Out:
      • Reach Out does not need to pay him back (even without interest), which is
        financially better for the charity, especially in its first months of operation.
      • Reach Out is not dependent on any bank or any community grant scheme from
        the local public authorities; this gives Reach Out more autonomy.
      • Neil may be more motivated to make Reach Out successful as he has invested
        some of his personal money.
      • This decision shows Laura that Neil is really committed to Reach Out,
        giving her further confidence in the venture.
      • Having donated towards the setup of Reach Out Neil may have a sense of
        ownership and may expect to have more decision-making power. This may
        cause tension between Laura and Neil, which in turn may affect the
        performance of the charity.


      To be balanced the answer must consider both the positive and negative
      consequences.

      Accept any other relevant substantiated analysis. Theoretical comments from
      outside the case study are acceptable.

4.   (a)   Describe two advantages of preparing a budget for Reach Out (line 32).                 [4 marks]

           Preparing a budget has several advantages for Reach Out:
           • Laura and Neil can plan the money they have or are about to have (identifying
              streams of income, see Appendix 1 with the cash-flow forecast)
           • Reach Out can use the budgeting process to plan the timing of their
              expenditure on PECS cards
           • it can help Reach Out prioritize its activities
           • it can help allocate resources (e.g. if the therapist scheme keeps increasing,
              they may need to spend more to manage it)
           • it makes it possible to identify variances to understand possible financial
              problems and to analyse corrective action.

           Accept any other relevant answer.

           Award [1 mark] for each relevant and correct advantage of preparing a budget
           identified and [1 mark] for an appropriate description that directly refers to Reach
           Out up to a maximum of [2 marks].

(b)   Neil Johnson tried to convince Laura Chan that (Option 2) would be a
      worthwhile investment by using a break-even model (lines 130–131). Explain
      two limitations of using break-even analysis as a decision-making tool.    [4 marks]

      Using break-even analysis as a decision-making tool has the following limitations:
      • break-even is best suited for the analysis of one product at a time; Neil is using
        break-even analysis for the entire hypothetical family brand, which may not be
        suitable
      • break-even analysis requires estimated projections of expected sales; as Neil
        proposes a new type of venture for Reach Out, he cannot be sure of his
        forecasts (there is no suggestion that he has done any market research)
      • it is sometimes difficult to classify a cost as being only variable or only fixed
      • the break-even model assumes linear progression and ignores issues like
        economies of scale, price variation, etc.
      • break-even assumes that a business will sell all of its output, which is unlikely
        to be the case
      • break-even ignores qualitative issues such as stress and motivation at higher
        levels of output and the reaction of competitors
      • break-even is a static model, which does not work effectively in dynamic
        markets.

      Accept any other relevant explanation.


      Mark as 2+2.

      Award [1 mark] for each limitation to using a break-even model identified and
      [1 mark] for an appropriate explanation up to a maximum of [2 marks]. At least
      one limitation should directly refer to Reach Out. The other limitation can be
      generic.

(c)   Explain two key functions of management, applying to Reach Out the theories
      of writers such as Fayol, Handy or Drucker.                                 [4 marks]

      According to Fayol, management is about planning, organizing, commanding,
      coordinating and controlling. This is exactly what Laura and Neil do, managing
      both Reach Out as a whole and managing Andrew. Andrew too is a manager in
      Fayol’s sense, as he coordinates the activities of the therapists.

      According to Handy, management is about addressing and solving problems, as a
      doctor would do; identify the problems (symptoms); find out the causes of the
      problems; decide on the action and implement them. In the case of Reach Out,
      this is well illustrated by the problem with Andrew which Neil tried to sort out,
      although not successfully.

      According to Drucker, management is about setting objectives, especially
      strategic objectives, which is what Laura and Neil try to do, although not
      successfully as they do not have a similar view about the future direction of
      Reach Out, so from Drucker’s viewpoint, they are not good managers.

      Accept any other relevant explanation or relevant theory.


      Candidates may explain two key functions of management by referring to only
      one writer (going into depth and detail) or to two writers. Both approaches are
      acceptable.

      Mark as 2+2.

      Award [1 mark] for each relevant key function of management with reference to a
      theorist.

      Award an additional [1 mark] for each appropriate explanation that directly refers
      to Reach Out.

      Award [1 mark] overall, if only two key functions are explained with no reference
      to relevant theory or Reach Out.

(d)   Evaluate the value of Neil Johnson’s fishbone diagram (Appendix 2) as a
      decision-making tool.                                                   [8 marks]

      As a decision-making tool, a fishbone diagram has several advantages:
      • it shows a range of possible causes for a given problem; here, the increase in
        the number of complaints is not just directly due to therapists’ absenteeism and
        poor punctuality, but also to other indirect factors identified in Neil’s diagram
        (e.g. the fact that the therapists are not properly supervised)
      • it is visually easy to follow and to understand the roots and ramifications of
        problems: it makes it easier to decide where action should be taken (e.g. here
        deciding what to do in order to prevent complaints)
      • it is comprehensive and systematic; it organizes causes by themes (such as
        “communication systems” and “management systems”).

      However, as a decision-making tool, a fishbone diagram also has disadvantages:
      • causes and effects are sometimes interrelated, for example the breakdown of
        communication between families and Reach Out’s central office is due to the
        fact that Andrew Grandin is not properly trained and due to the fact that he has
        no computing skills; on the diagram, these issues are not linked together –
        so deciding to act on one without considering the other would be of little
        benefit (it could even create further problems!)
      • the diagram does not include quantifiable data (it is a qualitative model,
        unlike a decision tree), it does not show how much each factor actually
        contributes to the problem (e.g. for families, the lack of communication from
        Reach Out could be of very little importance if therapists turned up on time)
      • the diagram does not show what needs to be prioritized in terms of decisions
        and actions (e.g. how important is it for Reach Out to put some contingency
        planning in place?): it is only a tool to aid decision-making.

5.   (a)   Identify one type of on-the-job training and one type of off-the-job training
           that Laura Chan could use with Andrew Grandin.                                [2 marks]

           On-the-job training could include:
           • coaching
           • mentoring
           • shadowing
           • accept any other relevant form of on-the-job training.

           Off-the-job training could include:
           • day release
           • workshops
           • seminars
           • a training course
           • accept any other relevant form of off-the-job training.

           training identified up to a maximum of [2 marks].

     (b)   (i)   Using Item 2, calculate the quantity of merchandise that Reach Out
                 must sell in order to meet Neil Johnson’s target (show all your working). [2 marks]

                  target + fixed costs    120 000 + 100 000
                                        =
                 price – variable costs        10 – 5

                 Then the required sales figure is 44 000 units of merchandise per year.

                 Alternative workings:

                 Target = total revenue – total cost

                 Which can be written as:

                 120 000 = 10Q – 100 000 – 5Q
                 220 000 = 5Q
                 Q = 44 000

                 Accept any other correct method other than the ones shown.


                 Award [1 mark] for the correct workings and [1 mark] for the correct
                 calculation.

(ii)   Using the case study and Items 1.1 and 1.2, identify two areas of
       concern with the therapist scheme and explain how Laura Chan can
       make qualitative improvements to these concerns.                  [5 marks]

       Areas of concern could include:
       • communication – with Reach Out and the therapists
       • frequency of the sessions
       • punctuality/attendance of therapists
       • materials to use at home
       • merchandise
       • knowledge of therapists
       • accept any other relevant area of concern.

       Laura could use a variety of methods to improve the quality of the service
       but she may wish to focus on the following areas:
       • HR – motivation of the therapists
       • training – of Andrew
       • ICT – better booking systems
       • communication – different forms
       • quality circles – to identify improvements
       • redeploy Andrew and appoint a secretary to coordinate bookings
       • increase the number of therapists used/trained
       • accept any other relevant method of improvement.

       Accept any other relevant explanation.

       [3 to 5 marks]
       Two areas of concern have been identified and the explanation is relevant
       with some understanding of the concepts and an attempt to explain two
       ways of improving the areas of concern identified. At the top of the
       markband there is more detail and development of concepts. A maximum
       of [3 marks] should be awarded if the answer does not refer to Reach Out.

(c)   Analyse the value to Reach Out of organizing it into two distinct profit
      centres.                                                                 [9 marks]

      The move to create two profit centres may have the following positive effects:
      • creates a healthier working environment – less friction
      • allows Laura and Neil to focus on one area
      • Laura and Neil will be accountable for specific responsibilities
      • it can help to identify financial strengths and weaknesses
      • improved cost control
      • leads to more motivation – for all including Andrew
      • accept any other relevant positive effect.

      However, creating the two profit centres may also lead to the following negative
      effects:
      • unhealthy competition between Laura and Neil – which could make things
         worse
      • allocating the fixed costs attributable to which profit centre – could lead to
         arguments as to the correct apportion of the fixed costs – again divisive
      • attributing the funds – how will the funds that are generated be apportioned?
         Who will decide and on what basis?
      • focus on their own areas of concern – they may lose the big picture
      • accept any other relevant negative effect.

      Accept any other relevant analysis.


      If the response is a one-sided relevant approach award a maximum of [5 marks].

      Marks will be allocated according to the markbands on page 5.

(d)   Using Lewin’s force field analysis and the information contained in the
      case study and Items 1–4, evaluate Raj Gupta’s recommendation to pursue
      Option 2 and to reorganize Reach Out.                                   [12 marks]

      It should be recognized that, given time constraints, answers are likely to include
      a much narrower range of issues and concepts than identified below. There is no
      “correct” answer.

      Examiners must be prepared to award full marks to answers which synthesize and
      evaluate even if they do not examine all the stimulus materials.

      The answer should be considered within a strategic framework using Lewin’s
      force field analysis.

      It is to be expected that the answer will include relevant information from the
      case study, extension material and Items 1–4 and employ a range of business
      concepts, tools and terminology.

      The proposed changes of Raj Gupta do seem to offer the possibility of improving
      matters with each manager being given a clearly defined area of responsibility and
      clear targets through separate profit centres. This should encourage a more
      responsible approach to the business by both parties, which could put it in a strong
      position as the market for the product develops.

      Raj’s recommendation – developing a family brand and reorganizing the business
      into two profit centres.

      Driving forces for the change could include:
      • selling the merchandise will spread awareness of the charity
      • the growing number of sufferers
      • the fact that Reach Out seems to have identified a gap in the market
      • the success of the business model so far
      • the growing demands on the therapists
      • the need for quality improvements
      • the need to resolve the various issues – such as Andrew’s role
      • Neil has a big incentive to increase revenues as his salary is “10 % of the total
         cash receipts”
      • extra revenue can be used for developing the PECS cards
      • Reach Out needs to meet the growing demand for its services – this requires
         resourcing
      • separate profit centres allows the two managers to work on their own projects
      • no agreements on strategic options 1 and 3
      • accept any other relevant factor.
                                      – 23 –            N11/3/BUSMT/HP1/ENG/TZ0/XX/M


Restraining forces for the change could include:
• separate profit centres allows the two managers to work on their own projects
  without consultation/collaboration
• the difference in approaches by Laura and Neil
• the problems between Laura and Neil have not really been solved just
  postponed
• the lack of single purpose/leadership
• the effectiveness of branding – Item 4
• Andrew – his position/role is still uncertain
• the introduction of PECS cards – will need coordination
• the costs of the proposed changes
• the time necessary to implement the changes
• if the plan succeeds there will be a big difference in salaries for Laura and Neil
• is merchandising sustainable in the long term (Item 3)?
• Option 1 may be easier to implement
• accept any other relevant factor.

Accept any other relevant recommendation.


Candidates would be expected to offer a substantiated judgment as to whether the
businesses can improve. They might consider the fact that despite the proposed
changes this still leaves the business without any consistent direction for future
progress. If anything the proposed changes may actually just postpone the
collapse of the relationship between Laura and Neil by a year.

Candidates that do not use Lewin’s force field analysis model would not be able
to reach the top markband.

Award a maximum of [7–9 marks] where both the case study and Items 1–4 have
not been used, i.e. only one set of data.

Marks will be allocated according to the markbands on page 6.
