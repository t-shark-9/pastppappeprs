content/accuracy of a candidate’s work please contact your team leader.


        0:      Answers not meeting the requirements of descriptors should be awarded no marks.


       1–3:    Answers do not meet the demands of the question and show little or no evidence of
               appropriate structure. There are no more than vague, unsupported assertions.


       4–5:    There is little understanding of the question. Historical details are present but are
               mainly inaccurate and/or of marginal relevance. Historical context or processes are
               barely understood and there is minimal focus on the task.


       6–7:    Answers indicate some understanding of the question but historical knowledge is
               limited in quality and quantity. Historical context may be present as will
               understanding of historical processes but underdeveloped. The question is only
               partially addressed.


       8–9:    The demands of the question are generally understood. Historical knowledge is
               present but is not fully or accurately detailed. Knowledge is narrative or descriptive
               in nature. There may be limited argument that requires further substantiation.
               Critical commentary may be present. There is an attempt to place events in historical
               context and show an understanding of historical processes. An attempt at a
               structured approach, either chronological or thematic has been made.


       10–12: Answers indicate that the question is understood but not all implications are
              considered. Knowledge is largely accurate. Critical commentary may be present.
              Events are generally placed in context and understanding of historical processes,
              such as comparison and contrast are present. There may be awareness of different
              approaches and interpretations but they are not based on relevant historical
              knowledge. There is a clear attempt at a structured approach.


       13–15: Answers are clearly focused on the demands of the question. Specific knowledge is
              applied as evidence, and analysis or critical commentary are used appropriately to
              produce a specific argument. Events are placed in context and there is sound
              understanding of historical processes and comparison and contrast. Evaluation of
              different approaches may be used to substantiate arguments presented.


       16–20: Answers are clearly structured and focused, have full awareness of the demands of
              the question, and if appropriate may challenge it. Detailed specific knowledge is
              used as evidence to support assertions and arguments. Historical processes such as
              comparison and contrast, placing events in context and evaluating different
              interpretations are used appropriately and effectively.

Topic 1   Dynasties and rulers

1.   Compare and contrast the rule of the Holy Roman Emperors Otto I and Frederick I
     (Barbarossa).

     Candidates must produce a properly structured response dealing with both comparison and
     contrast.

     For “compare”
     Responses may include, but not be limited to:
     • both men struggled to assert their authority over rivals in Germany;
     • both were ultimately successful though only after numerous, very difficult conflicts with rivals;

     • both sought to exert political control in Italy;
     • both had serious conflicts with the Papacy;
     • both supported scholarship and learning – notably Frederick and the Justinian Code;
     • both worked to spread Christianity and the influence of the Church.

     For “contrast”
     Responses may include, but not be limited to:
     • Otto exerted more effective control in Italy than Frederick;
     • Otto controlled the clergy and Papacy more effectively than Frederick;
     • Frederick developed a more professional administration;
     • Frederick used the Justinian Code to justify royal power;
     • Frederick undertook a Crusade to the East;
     • Frederick was forced to seek reconciliation with the pope, Otto was not.

     If only one ruler is discussed, mark out of a maximum of [7 marks].

2.   Analyse the political and administrative impact of the Carolingian Empire between 768 and
     814.

     The impacts of the Carolingian Empire are numerous. This question deals with the governmental,
     legal and administrative changes that were brought about. Candidates should not focus their
     responses on cultural aspects such as the Carolingian Renaissance, schools of learning, etc.

     The impacts of the Carolingian Empire that could be considered include, but are not limited to:
     • Charlemagne’s work to codify laws which applied universally and replaced the collection of
       tribal-based laws that existed previously;
     • this was an attempt to emphasize the rule of law as a civilizing force and replace primitive
       customs and practices;
     • the establishment of royal agents or bureaucrats to oversee the application of royal laws and
       administration to enforce uniformity in all areas – basis of royal administrations to support the
       power of the monarch;
     • he sought to limit local power and subordinate it to the central government;
     • establishment of the legal divisions in society between warriors and peasants – this established
       the feudal system outlining the rights and obligations of the different classes;
     • this set the model for medieval European social and political structure for many years;
     • ironically this weakened the power of kings by giving much land to nobles in exchange for
       military service – this impoverished the monarchy and made it less powerful;
     • he expanded his Empire to the east and began German colonization to the east;
     • he brought a number of German tribes into the Christian church – expanded Western
       civilization;
     • he revived the idea of the Western Roman Empire – later the Holy Roman Empire;
     • he encouraged people to believe that a renewal of the civilization of Rome would occur;
     • established a complex relationship with the Papacy which would later be the basis of much
       dispute and conflict between rulers and popes;
     • model of absolute authority which other monarchs would seek to emulate.

3.   “The Norman and Angevin rulers of England proved more effective in developing their
     power than the Capetian rulers of France of the same period.” To what extent do you agree
     with this statement?

     Areas to consider may include, but not be limited to:
     • the amount of territory/wealth controlled by the monarch;
     • the military strength of the monarch;
     • the ability to control vassals and enforce their obligations to the king;
     • support of the Church;
     • number and strength of rivals to the monarch’s power;
     • strategies to maintain/increase power by the monarch;
     • ability of monarch to impose/enforce policies: taxation, law, legislation;
     • personal qualities of rulers;
     • ability to develop effective bureaucracy and administration.

     Candidates may challenge the statement by demonstrating a gradual increase in the power of the
     Capetian monarchs particularly towards the end of the twelfth century.


4.   Assess the reasons for the collapse of one Islamic dynasty.

     Candidates may choose any Islamic dynasty from the time period covered by the syllabus.
     Popular choices will be the Umayyads, Abbasids or Fatimids. The collapse of Muslim rule in
     Spain may also be considered. Choices may not extend beyond AD1500.

     Responses must be analytical in nature. Simple narratives or descriptions will not score well.

     The reasons for the collapse of a dynasty may include, but not be limited to:
     • Strife brought about by religious divisions in Islam, e.g. the Sunni/Shia divide. Opposition
        movements such as Kharijites;
     • Racial tensions between Arab and non-Arab sections of the empire;
     • the size of the empire and the difficulties of administration;
     • family and personal rivalries leading to plots and power struggles;
     • weakness of individual rulers;
     • external invasions – Crusades, Ottomans – military defeats;
     • corruption and inefficiency of administrations – leading to uprisings and rebellion;
     • rise of rival claimants from other clans and families.
                                                 –7–                 N11/3/HISTI/BP2/ENG/TZ0/XX/M

5.   What changes in the nature of Islamic government were instituted by the Umayyad dynasty?

     Candidates should focus on changes in government and administration. Responses may include,
     but not be limited to:
     • the position of caliph became essentially hereditary for the first time;
     • the capital moved to Damascus to be at the centre of an expanding empire – move away from
        the geographic origin of Islam;
     • the army became a professional, paid force – more reliable power for the central government;
     • government was centralized along the lines of the Byzantine or Iranian Empires;
     • new ruling bureaucracy replaced the families of Mecca and Medina;
     • bureaucrats chosen for their loyalty to the caliph and enforced his laws;
     • bureaucrats were professional administrators – no longer bound by tribal loyalties;
     • Arabic became the official language of the empire;
     • empire was based in cities, not the countryside;
     • new coinage with Islamic symbols was introduced;
     • many large public buildings were created – mosques to indicate the power of Islam and its
        permanence.


6.   Describe the major challenges to the authority of either one medieval European or one
     Islamic ruler.

     The challenges to the power of either Christian or Islamic rulers are very similar and cover a wide
     range of possibilities. They should be illustrated with specific examples.

     These may include, but not be limited to:
     • conflicts with religious leaders;
     • challenges from powerful vassals or subjects/rebellions/civil war;
     • lack of skilled administrators;
     • internal family rivals and challenges;
     • external threats, invasions;
     • economic or financial weakness or crisis;
     • natural disasters, plagues;
     • disputes over the succession.

Topic 2   Society and economy

7.   Assess the social and economic role of either Christian churches and cathedrals or the urban
     mosques of Islam.

     Both Christian cathedrals and urban mosques played an important role in their societies, beyond
     their function as houses of worship.

     Candidates should discuss both social and economic impacts although the responses need not be
     evenly divided between the two categories.

     Economic contributions may include, but not be limited to:
     • extensive employment of skilled labour in the construction;
     • creating a demand for the production of a wide range of building and decorating materials;
     • markets and fairs sprung up in the immediate vicinity;
     • the cathedrals and mosques required a range of goods and provided employment;
     • they were places of pilgrimage which brought increased economic activity to the places where
       they were located;
     • they were centres of education which attracted teachers and students, this fostered population
       growth and increased business activity;
     • they taught literacy and numeracy skills which improved the skills of merchants and
       manufacturers;
     • their existence helped to stimulate the growth of the towns in which they were located and led
       to further development of trade and industry;
     • they could provide support to the less fortunate – relieve economic distress in times of crisis.

     Social contributions may include, but not be limited to:
     • they were central meeting places where communities could gather to meet, interact and discuss
       issues;
     • they were centres of education and culture;
     • they were the centres of festivals, celebrations and other important community events;
     • they were models for art, culture, architecture and other artistic endeavours;
     • they could provide centres for refuge or sanctuary for a variety of reasons.

     If only the social or economic role is discussed, mark out of a maximum of [12 marks].

8.   Analyse the reasons for the decline of the institution of serfdom in medieval Europe.

     The reasons for this decline may include, but not be limited to:
     • the principal reason for the decline of serfdom was the changing economy of Europe after the
       eleventh century;
     • the rise of trade and towns created markets and opportunity for profits by landlords and
       peasants;
     • manors were converted to commercial farms producing goods such as wool and grain for towns
       and export;
     • only the most successful peasants were retained – others were dispossessed;
     • traditional taxes and dues were converted to cash rents which the landlord used to buy new
       products or support his life in the towns;
     • populations of manors were reduced as many changed to stock-raising which required few
       workers – enclosure movement;
     • land was purchased by city merchants who had no interest in traditional serfdom but only in the
       commercial possibilities of the land;
     • new agricultural areas such as those developed by the Cistercians did not embrace serfdom but
       were commercial operations from the beginning;
     • manors lost population to the new towns where serfs could escape their duties and find
       employment;
     • Black Death caused a labour shortage, allowed serfs to escape feudal restrictions.


9.   Assess the major factors which promoted trade in the Islamic world.

     Candidates should produce a clear analytical response of the major factors that encouraged and
     maintained trade and its expansion in the Islamic world.

     Major reasons may include, but not be limited to:
     • a tradition of trade amongst the population of Arabia over long distances;
     • Muhammad was a merchant and this lent prestige to the occupation;
     • wealthy trading communities of the Middle East and large urban areas such as Constantinople
       created large markets for commerce;
     • the size of the Islamic Empire opened access to products from China to Spain;
     • the lucrative nature of products such as spices and gold brought many people into trade;
     • stable governments for long periods of time aided the expansion of trade;
     • merchants were respected members of communities;
     • caliphs promoted trade as a source of wealth for their governments;
     • Europe created a huge demand for products from the Islamic world;
     • Islamic Empire contained all the major trading routes between East and West.

10.   For what reasons, and with what results, did guilds emerge in medieval European towns?

      The reasons for the emergence of guilds may be divided into both general and specific types.

      The general reasons may include, but not be limited to:
      • they had existed in Roman times and the tradition was continued in Constantinople and in Italy;
      • forming an association gave individuals greater power, protection and influence;
      • they were social organizations that offered a wide range of activities attractive to individuals
        such as companionship, charity, festivals, meeting places and a sense of identity.

      Specific reasons may include, but not be limited to:
      • merchant guilds were established to protect and help their members both in their town but also
        on journeys to other areas;
      • promoted honesty and prevented unfair competition and illegal actions;
      • craft guilds were created to service the needs of those who made the same product or sold the
        same goods;
      • they were formed to provide a social organization for members often centred on the same inn
        and church;
      • they were a source of charitable support for members in need;
      • they acquired a monopoly on the production of a product from the ruler;
      • they protected each other from outside competition and from unfair practices by their members;
      • they sought to promote equality amongst members;
      • they encouraged honesty and good workmanship;
      • supported religion by banning work on Sundays and religious holidays.

      The results of the establishment of guilds may include, but not be limited to:
      • their constitutions and legislations provided a model for municipal government;
      • improved and maintained quality of goods;
      • provided a system of vocational training – providing skilled workmen;
      • major source of social welfare programmes – model for municipal and other public
        programmes;
      • helped develop a class of wealthy merchants and businessmen who contributed to the
        expansion of the medieval economy and who had the means to support schools and other
        institutions;
      • did prove an obstacle to new production methods in certain industries.

      If candidates discuss only reasons or results, mark out of a maximum of [12 marks].

11.   Examine the importance of the contribution of women to either medieval European or
      Islamic society.

      The contributions of women in both societies are often overlooked. Women made important
      contributions in both medieval European and Islamic society.

      Their contributions may be analysed in categories such as:
      • economic: they were producers, property holders and administrators, businesswomen, workers
        in family farms and businesses;
      • administration: they were rulers in their own right or played significant roles within their
        families, administering estates, territories and empires;
      • social: organized and established family life, households, domestic arts, educated children and
        established manners and customs for behaviour;
      • cultural: writers, poets, artists in various forms, scholars, contributors to religious life and
        leadership.

      Credit other areas of contribution or relevant examples. Specific examples should be provided for
      all points.


12.   Analyse the role and importance of one city in the Islamic world.

      The Islamic world incorporated a number of cities from its beginning – partly from conquest and
      partly as a result of new government centres and the expansion of trade.

      The city played a key role in the Islamic world in a number of ways.

      These include, but are not limited to:
      • centres of government and administration. The Islamic Empire was administered from central
        capitals. Therefore cities were important centres for caliphs and their administrations, armed
        forces, bureaucrats, etc.;
      • important centres of commerce – major markets and headquarters for large merchant
        enterprises;
      • key centres for learning where a number of schools, centres of learning were concentrated;
      • artistic centres – many skilled artists and artisans were located there near the caliphs. Their
        work was a model for many parts of the empire;
      • religious centres – great urban mosques and influential Islamic scholars were in residence as
        well as teachers of law and other influential religious authorities.

Topic 3     Wars and warfare

13.   Analyse (a) the reasons for the outcome, and (b) the consequences, of one of the following
      battles: Hastings (1066); Manzikert (1071); Hattin (1187); Poitiers (1356).

      All of these battles were of great significance.

      The areas to consider when analysing the reasons for the outcome may include, but not be limited
      to:
      • the size and composition of the opposing forces – levels of experience, ability to
          cooperate, internal disputes or divisions;
      • the experience and skill of the respective leaders;
      • differences in weapons or technology;
      • differences in strategy and tactics before and during the battle;
      • geographic location of the battle and the influence this may have had;
      • intangible factors relating to morale, enthusiasm, belief in the cause, loyalty to leaders or ideas.

      The areas to consider when analysing the consequences may include, but not be limited to:
      • political changes: overthrow of defeated leaders;
      • change in strategic balance;
      • conquest or takeover of territory, population;
      • economic consequences;
      • religious consequences;
      • social consequences.

      Responses to this question must analyse both the reasons for the outcome of the chosen battle as
      well as the consequences/impact of the chosen battle.

      If only one element of the question is addressed, mark out of a maximum of [12 marks].

14.   Evaluate the reasons for conflict between England and France in the twelfth century.

      Responses to this question may include, but not be limited to:
      • historic conflict and animosity between Norman and Capetian monarchs, originating in the
        eleventh century and continuing into the twelfth;
      • disputes over territory held by English monarchs in France;
      • French interference in the English Civil War;
      • English claims to the French throne caused friction;
      • aggressive actions of Henry II against French monarchs;
      • weakness of French monarchs encouraged English aggression;
      • French attempts to increase their power and recover territories;
      • family rivalries.


15.   For what reasons, and with what results, did the First and Second Civil Wars (fitna) occur in
      the Islamic world in the seventh century?

      The two civil wars broke out because of unresolved disputes about how the leadership of the
      Islamic community should be determined.

      The First Civil War occurred between 656 and 661.
      • This was a struggle between various families within the tribe of the Prophet (the Quraysh).
      • The first war broke out after a revolt against the third caliph Uthman which resulted in his
        murder.
      • He was succeeded by Ali ibn Abi Talib.
      • This led to an uprising by members of Uthman’s family and others which resulted in the First
        Civil War 656–661.
      • The war ended with the assassination of Ali ibn Abi Talib.

      The Second Civil War was a continuation of the First which broke out after the death of
      Muawiyah, the first Umayyad Caliph.
      • The reason was that the succession issues were unresolved.
      • Supporters of Ali’s family sought to re-establish their right to the caliphate – they were
        opposed by members of the Umayyad family who wished to retain their control of the
        caliphate.

      The results of the civil wars are of extreme significance for Islam.
      • Islam divided into distinct sects: the followers of Ali became the Shiites who maintained that
        only members of his family could hold power, the Kharijites emerged as a very pious group
        who claimed that the leadership should be based on truly righteous behaviour, the Umayyads
        claimed that the consensus of the community was the most important criterion.
      • As a result, Islam was divided into its main sectarian subdivisions which continue today.
      • Their identities result from their different views of the events of the civil wars.
      • The concept of a politically unified empire therefore became unrealizable – partially due to
        sectarian divisions.

      If candidates discuss only reasons or results, mark out of a maximum of [12 marks].

16.   Assess the impact of changes in military technology on medieval European warfare.

      Candidates should write an analytical essay which demonstrates how different technologies
      influenced the nature of medieval warfare. Examples of specific technologies and battles should
      be used.

      Medieval warfare changed initially from the infantry style of the Romans and barbarian tribes to
      mounted combat.

      The technology which supported this change would include: the stirrup, better armour, larger
      horses, new saddles to provide greater stability and support in combat, the lance.

      These changes made the mounted knight superior to all others. Medieval warfare became a
      contest between groups of mounted knights and these skills were practised in tournaments and
      jousts.

      Technology brought a further change when the power of mounted knights was ended by the
      development of missile weapons which could be used by common soldiers/peasants. These
      included the crossbow, the longbow and the Swiss pike which made the mounted knight
      vulnerable and made cavalry an adjunct to infantry.

      Medieval warfare consisted of sieges of castles built with high stone walls. These were often
      impregnable to assault and increased the power of the nobles who controlled them.

      The development of gunpowder and the first cannon ended the invulnerability of castles and
      forced a change in the method of fortification.


17.   Analyse the reasons for the success of the Islamic wars of conquest in the seventh and eighth
      centuries.

      Candidates must provide an analytical response which demonstrates the principal reasons for the
      success of the Islamic conquests of the seventh and eighth centuries.

      Responses should not focus only on military factors but should incorporate a range of
      non-military reasons to explain the success of these conquests. Specific examples should be
      provided to illustrate the reasons given.

      Reasons that should be considered may include, but not be limited to:
      • ability of the leaders of the wars of conquest;
      • the weakness of opponents – especially the Byzantine and Persian Empires;
      • the hostility of many groups to their overlords in the invaded areas, causing them to see the
        Islamic conquerors as liberators;
      • the willingness of many groups to join the invaders and support them;
      • the tolerant practices of Islam towards other faiths which gained them great support;
      • the enthusiasm and zeal of the Islamic warriors – inspired by their religious faith;
      • the military skills and tactics of the Islamic warriors – overwhelmed their opponents.

18.   Analyse the reasons for the defeat of the crusading movement by the Islamic world.

      This question requires a response that includes a variety of factors, both military and non-military
      in nature.

      Reasons may include, but not be limited to:
      Military:
      • emergence of talented military leaders such as Salah al-Din (Saladin), Qutuz and Baybars;
      • numerical weakness of the crusading forces during much of the period;
      • poor Western tactics leading to serious defeats at Hattin – loss of Jerusalem;
      • failure of the West to reinforce their troops in the East;
      • lack of cooperation between Eastern and Western Christians – hostility between them, as in the
        Fourth Crusade, weakened their effort against Islam.

      Non-military:
      • renewed unity amongst the Islamic forces gave them greater strength and purpose. This
        eliminated one of the reasons for early Western success;
      • Christians had weak and divided leadership during much of the period;
      • there were disagreements on the succession in Jerusalem and much division amongst the
        leaders of the various Crusades;
      • decline of the crusading spirit in the West led to a lack of interest, recruits and money for the
        cause.

Topic 4    Intellectual, cultural and artistic developments

19.   Analyse the impact of the twelfth century renaissance on medieval Europe.

      The impacts of the twelfth century renaissance are found in a number of fields.
      The infusion of classical knowledge and the philosophy of Plato, Aristotle and others created an
      alternative to the Church’s view of the world and its explanation of the universe. Church
      doctrines and related statements could now be analysed using other systems of logic. This was a
      serious challenge to the Church and forced it to develop new ideas and strategies to meet these
      challenges. The secular world was given a boost by the introduction of these new ideas,
      humanism, scepticism and rationalism became more common.

      Some specific areas in which the twelfth century renaissance had an impact would include, but not
      be limited to:
      Law:
      • a revival of the study of Roman law – this led to the replacement of many local and tribal laws
         with a codified set of laws and legal practice.

      Science:
      • a quest for the knowledge of ancient science led to a demand for many translations of classical
         works from Arabic;
      • knowledge devised by the Arabs or transmitted by them from the East was also in great
         demand;
      • great expansion of scientific knowledge and an encouragement by various European scholars to
         engage in scientific study.

      Universities:
      • these arose in Italy for the study of law and medicine – encouraged by the twelfth century
        renaissance;
      • spread to other parts of Europe;
      • centres for intellectual development, expansion of knowledge and scholarship beyond the
        control of the Church;
      • produced more scientists and humanists who continued to expand their knowledge and
        eventually challenged aspects of religion;
      • they trained all the lawyers in Canon and Civil law;
      • expanded creative thought – the Scholastic movement;
      • provided more trained administrators for state bureaucracies.

      Scholasticism:
      • new class of philosophers arose, e.g. Peter Abelard;
      • reconciliation of religion and the classical philosophy of Plato and Aristotle;
      • new traditions of using logic rather than dogma to find solutions;
      • rational scepticism appealed to the educated;
      • Thomas Aquinas developed a system to reconcile Christian belief with Aristotelian logic;
      • vernacular literatures appeared – these led to wider vernacular prose;
      • textbooks and histories, as well as poetry and literature were now written in the vernacular and
        far more accessible.

      Architecture:
      • the development of the Gothic style.

20.   In what ways did religious and secular institutions in medieval Europe both encourage and
      limit the expansion of knowledge?

      Candidates must assess the influences which helped and hindered the progress and expansion of
      knowledge in medieval Europe.

      The forces that assisted in the expansion of knowledge may include, but not be limited to:
      • the work of monastic orders in preserving and producing texts both on religious and
        non-religious subjects;
      • the establishment of cathedral schools and learning centres – notably in the Carolingian Empire
        to expand knowledge and literacy;
      • creation of the Carolingian minuscule script to make reading and writing easier;
      • increased contact with areas outside Europe which had advanced knowledge, notably the
        Islamic world through the Crusades and the universities in Spain, as well as the Byzantine
        Empire;
      • increased trade created a need for more educated individuals;
      • expanding monarchies wanted more educated individuals as administrators, etc.;
      • creation of universities was a major step forward;
      • the twelfth century renaissance and a new spirit of inquiry sparked a great increase in
        knowledge and scholarship in many fields;
      • the work of certain individuals such as Roger Bacon was very influential in inspiring new ideas
        and methods of inquiry.

      The forces working to limit knowledge may include, but not be limited to:
      • the loss of much knowledge and information with the fall of Rome, the destruction of books
        and the demise of towns and schools;
      • the loss of classical material from the Greeks and the Romans;
      • the poverty and ignorance of Europe in the early years of the medieval period – illiterate
        individuals ruling by force;
      • Church concentrated education on religious topics – did not seek to expand knowledge beyond
        that in many cases;
      • Church dogma discouraged or prevented inquiry into many fields that might challenge the
        Church’s view of the world – e.g. Roger Bacon – condemned for heresy;
      • Church controlled all education and therefore limited the curriculum;
      • poverty and lack of funds to support education was a factor for a long time;
      • prejudice towards Jews and Muslims prevented their scholarship from being used in the West
        for many years.

21.   Why was the Islamic world the centre of scientific knowledge and scholarship up to 1500?

      There are a number of reasons why the Islamic world excelled in the study and development of
      scientific knowledge.

      These reasons may include, but not be limited to:
      • the size of the Islamic Empire incorporated vast areas which contained a number of advanced
        societies such as Persia, India and China;
      • the Islamic Empire took over vast areas of the Byzantine Empire which had maintained the
        Greek and Roman work in science;
      • the tolerant polices of the Islamic Empire meant that these scholars were not persecuted but
        allowed to continue their work;
      • Islamic Empire needed the knowledge of the societies that it conquered to administer and
        maintain a large empire;
      • there was strong respect for scholarship of all types in the Islamic religion;
      • science was used for practical reasons in the Empire to maintain and improve trade through
        better navigation; mathematics helped with accounting and medical discoveries were widely
        respected and supported by leading intellectuals;
      • the establishment of numerous schools, learning centres and universities which contained
        influences from many cultures aided in intellectual development.

22.   Analyse the contribution to knowledge and intellectual development of two of the following:
      Ibn Sina (Avicenna) (980–1037); al-Ghazali (1058–1111); Ibn Rushd (Averroes)
      (1126–1198); Ibn Khaldun (1332–1406).

      Candidates must choose two of the individuals named and produce an analysis of their
      contribution to the expansion of knowledge and also intellectual development in terms of new
      approaches to thought, methods of analysis, new interpretations of material or the development of
      new areas of knowledge or methods of inquiry.

      A simple narrative of the life and accomplishments will not score well.

      Insightful candidates might comment on how the work of some of these individuals was crucial to
      the intellectual development of Western Europe as for example the twelfth century renaissance
      and the development of universities and their interest in classical learning.

      Ibn Sina (Avicenna)
      • A Persian polymath regarded as the foremost physician and philosopher of his time.
      • His medical texts were the standard at European universities as late as 1650.
      • His medical works incorporated Islamic medical knowledge with that of the Greeks. This was
        an important method to expand knowledge and understanding: synthesizing knowledge and
        being open to accepting ideas from different sources.
      • He became the father of modern medicine and introduced systematic experimentation and
        quantification into medical study.
      • He established the foundations of modern experimental medicine based on evidence and
        clinical trials especially in pharmacology.
      • A pioneer in psychology and neuropsychiatry.
      • He was an accomplished scientist not only in matters of scientific knowledge but in his use and
        promotion of the scientific method of observation, experimentation and analysis.
      • He wrote and studied extensively: on astronomy where he attacked astrology as non-scientific,
        on chemistry where he refuted alchemy and developed steam distillation.
      • He did very advanced work in physics on the theory of motion, and in optics.
      • His observations and deductions on the origins of mountains earned him the title of “father of
        geology”.
      • As a philosopher, his school of thought was the leading school of Islamic philosophy in the
        twelfth century.
      • His system of logic displaced that of Aristotle in the Islamic world.
      • His ideas were widely studied in Europe and, although disputed, they influenced a number of
        European medieval thinkers such as Albertus Magnus and Thomas Aquinas.

al-Ghazali
• A noted Islamic theologian, jurist, philosopher, psychologist and mystic.
• He influenced Islamic philosophy away from Greek philosophy and towards a more uniquely
   Islamic philosophy known as occasionalism.
• He was also responsible for bringing Sufism into the mainstream of Islam.
• He wrote a number of books, the most famous of which is The Incoherence of the Philosophers
   where he introduced a philosophical scepticism which was quite advanced. It was not seen in
   the West for several centuries after its introduction in the Islamic world.
• His book rejected the Greek influences in philosophy as corrupting to the Islamic faith.
• He does support mathematics and medicine as useful sciences. This encouraged the study of
   medicine in Islam. He particularly supported the process of anatomy and dissection.
• He also did influential work in psychology, discussing the concept of the self and the causes of
   misery and happiness. He examined the nature of the senses and how they interacted in human
   nature. Humans can be closer to God with the help of knowledge and by avoiding spiritual
   diseases such as lust, greed and cruelty.
• In the Islamic world he played a key role by integrating Sufism with Sharia. He also
   strengthened Sunni Islam.
• His work may have led to a freezing of Islamic thought, however this may be overstated
   according to modern scholars. He is associated with the decline of tolerance logic and reason
   in Islam.
• Reputed to have had a significant impact on medieval European scholars, notably Thomas
   Aquinas.

Credit any other valid material.

Ibn Rushd (Averroes)
• An Andalusian-Berber polymath whose interests and achievements spanned all intellectual
  areas from philosophy to physics.
• He stated that there is no conflict between religion and philosophy. He had a strong influence
  on Christian philosophers such as Thomas Aquinas.
• He was a scientist who based his writings on observation and experiment as in his work in
  astronomy and in analysis of the work of others. This led him to important contributions to the
  laws of motion and inertia.
• His work in summarizing many aspects of Islamic law was very influential and is still in use
  today.
• He extended his work into medicine where he identified diseases and developed therapy for
  them. His work on light led to the discovery of the retina as the principal organ of sight.
• He wrote also on politics and psychology. One of his important statements was that women
  were equal to men in all respects.
• His significance also comes from his extensive comments on Aristotle – these were very
  influential in Europe and the Islamic world.
• He worked to create a tradition of secular thought by liberating science and philosophy from
  religion.

Ibn Khaldun
• A North African polymath of the fourteenth century.
• His contributions are in the area of social science where his work is considered a forerunner of
  a number of subjects such as demography, cultural history, sociology and economics.
• He is considered by many to be the father of the social sciences.
• His most significant publication is his history of the world Kitab al-i ‘bar’.
• In sociology he developed a theory of social conflict and social cohesion.
• He examined how societies both rise and fall.

23.   Explain the role and significance of art in either medieval Europe or the Islamic world.

      The visual arts, including architecture, played a number of important roles.

      Political:
      • Art, including architecture and crafts such as metal working, was used to impress the
        population with the power and sophistication of the lord or ruler who sponsored it.
      • Art was used to display confidence, create associations with powerful organizations such as the
        Roman Empire.
      • Art was a daily reminder of the ruler’s authority.
      • In an illiterate age, visual arts were used to convey messages and propaganda and to reinforce
        community values.

      Religion:
      • Visual arts were educational – they could be used to convey religious messages and beliefs in a
        non-written form.
      • The size and magnificence of religious buildings were used to impress the population with the
        power of the organization and its central place in their lives.

      Social:
      • Art provided a means for individuals or groups to display their wealth.
      • It relieved the drab and colourless world of many in the Middle Ages.
      • Helped develop communities of artists and artisans – expanding and improving knowledge and
        techniques.

      Economic:
      • Large artistic projects such as cathedrals or mosques provided considerable employment and
        helped develop many skilled artists and craftsmen.
      • Constant search for improvements in technique and new materials spurred economic
        development, exploration and research.
      • Trade developed as demand for examples of art work from different regions grew.

24.   Analyse the contribution to knowledge and intellectual development of two of the following:
      Adelard of Bath (d.1160); Hildegard of Bingen (d.1178); Roger Bacon (1220–92);
      William of Ockham (c1285–1349).

      Candidates should comment on how the individuals chosen contributed to changes and advances
      in the intellectual life of medieval Europe. A simple recitation of their life story or list of
      achievements will not score well.

      Adelard of Bath
      • A crucial contributor to the expansion of learning in Europe.
      • He brought geometry, astronomy, trigonometry and Arabic numerals to the West.
      • He wrote books on science, both Arabic and classical, which emphasized the rational, secular,
        and investigative nature of the subject.
      • He argued that reason, not blind obedience to authority, should be the basis of understanding.
      • His work encouraged others to go to the Islamic university in Toledo and return with a broad
        knowledge of the classical and Islamic scholars.

      Hildegard of Bingen
      • A most accomplished intellectual, a true polymath whose work ranged from Christian
        mysticism to languages, science, philosophy, music and poetry.
      • She authored texts in theology, botany and medicine, as well as songs, poems and plays.
      • She was one of the most prolific composers of music in the medieval period.
      • She wrote the first morality play.
      • She composed three books of visions.
      • She wrote texts on the physical world – particularly as it related to medicine and the healing
        powers of plants, minerals, etc.
      • She transcended bans on women’s interpretation of scriptures.
      • Her material was transmitted to large numbers of people through her writings and her morality
        play.

      Roger Bacon
      • Bacon was an important proponent of experimental science.
      • He advocated mathematics as the paradigm for scientific knowledge.
      • He lectured extensively on Aristotle and attacked the scholastics as ignorant conservatives.
      • He wrote a number of texts in which he advocated the study of science based on observation
        and measurement.
      • He was a strong advocate of the modern scientific method rather than simply being an
        individual who did experiments.
      • He was imprisoned for heresy but his ideas led to the development of more modern scientific
        approaches and the Renaissance.

William of Ockham
• One of the most prominent figures of medieval philosophy along with Thomas Aquinas.
• Condemned as a heretic and forced to live in exile for the latter part of his life.
• His work was particularly important in the area of logic – he commented on the work of
  Aristotle and produced his own original work.
• In scholasticism, he advocated reform in method and content, the aim of which was
  simplification.
• The father of epistemology, arguing that only individuals exist rather than universals.
• His major contribution to science and intellectual development was the principle of parsimony
  in explanation and theory. This is Occam’s Razor – explanations should be in terms of the
  fewest possible number of causes, factors or variables.
• Natural philosophy – supported the importance of mathematics in science – developed theories
  of impetus and the motion of bodies.
• Political theorist – advocated the separation of Church and State and contributed to Western
  constitutional thought, especially limits to powers of government.

Topic 5    Religion and the state

25.   “Innocent III was the most powerful and influential pope of the medieval period.” To what
      extent do you agree with this statement?

      Candidates must examine the methods by which Innocent III sought to expand his power and
      influence and the degree to which they were successful. Answers must be analytical and not a
      simple narrative of his career.

      The methods that Innocent III used would include, but not be limited to:
      • tightened his control over church administration, forced bishops to carry out inspections,
        eliminated abuses and incompetent clergy;
      • made use of papal legates to oversee the bishops;
      • interfered in German dynastic struggles to ensure the appointment he wanted;
      • used excommunication and interdict to force rulers in France and England to acknowledge his
        authority;
      • launched the Fourth Crusade which conquered Constantinople and expanded Roman power;
      • created the Inquisition to eliminate heresy;
      • established the Dominican and Franciscan orders to meet the changing spiritual needs of the
        population;
      • organized the Fourth Lateran Council which established the seven sacraments and made
        marriage a sacrament – required for legitimacy and inheritance. This increased church power.

      The results of his work would include, but not be limited to:
      • Papal supremacy in the Church was established – heresy eliminated by the Inquisition;
      • Rome was more influential than Constantinople;
      • challenges to church doctrine were overcome through the work of the Franciscans who made
        the Church popular and the Dominicans who answered the intellectual challenges of the twelfth
        century renaissance;
      • pope had exerted his power over a number of secular rulers;
      • the Fourth Lateran Council gave the Church power over individuals through marriage and
        divorce;
      • the pope had exerted even further control over the appointment and work of the bishops.

      Candidates may challenge the quotation by referring to the work of other popes such as Gregory
      VII or Urban II as being more influential in a number of areas such as investiture of bishops and
      struggles with secular rulers.

      It may also be noted that Innocents III’s influence was not permanent and the Church continued to
      be challenged by secular rulers, opposition movements and other challengers.

26.   Assess the reasons for the rise and fall of one religious opposition movement in either the
      Islamic or the Christian world.

      Candidates must select one opposition movement in either the Islamic or Christian world and
      provide an analysis of the reasons for its growth and support and the reasons for its decline.

      Popular choices will be: the Kharijites; the Carmathians; Cathars (Albigensians); Waldensians.

      In whichever example is selected, a clear analysis of the reasons for its growth must be provided.
      These reasons may be of both a religious and non-religious nature. The same analysis must also
      be used for the explanation of the decline or collapse of the movement.

      Simple narratives are not acceptable and will not score well.


27.   Analyse the principal reasons for factional divisions in the Islamic world during the seventh
      and eighth centuries.

      Candidates should be able to analyse the reasons, both religious and non-religious, for division of
      the Islamic world into factions, both permanent and temporary.

      These reasons might include, but not be limited to:
      • disputes over the succession after the death of Mohammad;
      • rivalries amongst the various candidates for the caliphate;
      • disputed loyalties after the death of Mohammad, resulting in conflict – Ridda Wars;
      • disputes between groups in Mecca and Medina over the rule of the new empire;
      • family rivalries over the appointment of officials;
      • disputes between Arab and non-Arab members of the empire;
      • disputes over administration of new lands and division of the spoils of war;
      • Sunni/Shia divide over the succession;
      • establishment of the Umayyad dynasty.

28.   Explain the policies towards Jews in either the Christian or Islamic worlds and the results of
      those policies in the chosen society.

      Christian world:
      Jews in the Christian world were regular victims of violence and discrimination. This was the
      result of a number of reasons:
      • religious fanaticism towards all non-Christians;

29.   How did monastic orders impact medieval society in both religious and non-religious ways?

      The impact of monastic orders was extensive and varied. Candidates will have to comment on a
      range of areas, many of a non-religious nature. These areas may include, but not be limited to:

      Scholarship:
      • monasteries preserved knowledge from the fall of Rome;
      • monasteries maintained libraries of both religious and scientific books as a fund of knowledge;
      • monasteries engaged in the production and dissemination of books;
      • monasteries established schools and learning centres which educated priests and lay persons;
      • many scholars were monks who spent their lives studying and teaching. They became
        important advisers to the Church and various monarchs.

      Economics:
      • monasteries emphasized physical labour and self-sufficiency;
      • they became very efficient producers of a wide range of agricultural products and developed
        new techniques in farming which spread to the population and improved output. The
        Cistercians are notable for this;
      • their libraries gave them access to scientific and technical knowledge which they developed
        refined and taught to the population;
      • provided models for modern scientific farming and helped bring about the move from serfdom
        to commercial agriculture by many landlords who imitated their techniques;
      • were major landholders who controlled vast areas of land and were very wealthy;
      • this led to clashes with political leaders jealous of their wealth and anxious to profit from it.

      Charitable works:
      • monasteries provided social services to their communities;
      • hospitals and food and shelter for the poor were often provided;
      • they created the first welfare systems to aid the less fortunate, orphanages, etc.;
      • sanctuaries and refuges for the persecuted;
      • they developed medical skill and related knowledge that could be shared;
      • they provided an alternative to serfdom for many peasants – provided land on the monastic
        estates to those who had none;
      • often provided a less onerous life for their tenants than the traditional manor.

      Religion:
      • they were created to be a model for religious devotion, piety and Christian principles –
        Benedictine rule, for example;
      • provided a number of leaders for church reform, for example Bernard of Clairvaux;
      • provided a great number of preachers, educators and church leaders;
      • designed to be a model of behaviour and devotion;
      • became a focus of criticism in the Middle Ages due to growing wealth and a perceived lack of
        religious devotion and morality.

       Credit other areas including education at all levels and government service as administrators.
       Reference may be made to both male and female orders.

30.   Examine the reasons for disputes between religious leaders and secular rulers in either the
      Islamic or medieval European worlds.

      Candidates should illustrate their response by specific reference to examples of clashes between
      religious and secular leaders. Responses should not be narrative accounts of the clashes
      themselves, but an analysis of the issues which created the conflicts.

      Reasons for disputes may include, but not be limited to:
      • disputes over control of property and taxes;
      • personal rivalries or family quarrels;
      • disputes over the right to legislate;
      • secular rulers’ desire to control the activity of the Church within their territories;
      • claims by religious leaders to be superior to secular rulers;
      • claims by religious leaders that secular rulers had failed to maintain religious beliefs and should
        be replaced;
      • disputes over who should have responsibility for legal matters;
      • control of education and training.

      Credit other reasonable causes which are supported by evidence.
