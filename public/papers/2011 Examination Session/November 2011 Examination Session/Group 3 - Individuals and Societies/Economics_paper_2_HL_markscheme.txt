1.   Explain the problems a transition economy could face as it moves towards a free market
     economy.

     Candidates may include:
     • a definition of a transition economy as an economy in the process of moving from a centrally
       planned economic system towards a more market-oriented economic system
     • a definition of an economy based on the free market
     • an explanation of the characteristics of free market economy
     • an explanation of the characteristics of a centrally planned economy
     • problems facing an economy in transition such as:
       – inflation
       – unemployment
       – lower and/or negative economic growth
       – establishing market institutions
       – establishing currency convertibility
       – greater income inequality – loss of social safety net; increased poverty
       – current account problems
       – capital flight
       – difficulties with privatization – methods, corruption
       – consequences of privatization – layoffs, higher prices
       – side effects of removing price controls
       – rise in crime rates
     • examples of transition economies.

     Candidates who explain two problems well could be awarded full marks.

     Examiners should be aware that candidates may take a different approach which if appropriate,
     should be rewarded.

3.       Explain why firms in perfect competition can make supernormal (abnormal) profit in the
         short run but can only make normal (zero) profit in the long run.

         Candidates may include:
         • a definition of normal (zero) profit
         • a definition of supernormal (abnormal) profit
         • an explanation of the characteristics of perfect competition
         • an explanation of the process allowing normal profit only to be achieved in the long run through
           freedom of entry and exit:
           – if incumbent firms make short-run supernormal (abnormal) profit, new firms will enter the
              market causing the market supply to increase, and market price and industry profit to fall
           – this process reaches a long run equilibrium, when P/MR = MC at ATC (normal profit) and
              new firms have no incentive to enter the market
         • a diagrammatic analysis showing a firm in perfect competition making supernormal (abnormal)
           profit in the short run; S/D diagram illustrating the impact on supply and price when firms enter
           the market; perfect competition model illustrating the firm making normal (zero) profit in the
           long run.

         • an explanation of the Laffer curve
         • an explanation of the incentive effects of tax cuts – willingness to work harder; willingness to
           invest
         • an explanation of how an increase or decrease in the tax rate can increase or decrease tax revenue
           depending on where the country is on the Laffer curve

5.   Explain the limitations of the theory of comparative advantage.

     Candidates may include:
     • a definition of comparative advantage
     • an explanation of some of the various limitations due to simplifying assumptions:
          – perfect competition
          – perfect knowledge
          – full employment
          – fixed technology
          – perfect substitutability of resources
          – factor immobility
          – equal imports and exports
          – perfectly free trade
          – no transport costs
          – constant economies of scale
          – identical goods traded
     • trade based on comparative advantage may lead to over specialization, preventing development
     • theory might work well between countries at similar stages of development but not necessarily
       between LDCs and MDCs, where it could be used as a justification for exploitation.

     Candidates who explain two limitations well can be awarded full marks.

     Examiners should be aware that candidates may take a different approach which if appropriate,
     should be rewarded.

6.   Using examples, explain how the poverty cycle can be a barrier to economic development.

     Candidates may include:
     • a definition of economic development
     • measures of development, i.e. HDI
     • an explanation of the poverty cycle, as low income leading to low savings leading to low
       investment, leading to low income:
       – low income levels result in low savings levels as saving is positively related to disposable
          income
       – low savings mean that less funds will be available for lending
       – low savings lead to low investment, which in turn leads to lower aggregate demand and
          lower real GDP
     • a diagram illustrating the poverty cycle
     • examples of the poverty cycle and its effects linked to development such as:
       – households and governments not being able to spend on health care and education, resulting
          in lower economic and human development
       – households and government not being able to spend on health care and education, resulting in
          a lower quality of the labour force and a decrease in LRAS
       – resulting lack of skilled labour and/or possible political instability that come with poverty
          may discourage FDI and limit the possibility of development through trade
       – an indication that the poverty cycle is transmitted from generation to generation due to the
          low income-low savings-low investment-low income relationship, thus affecting future
          generations.

     Candidates who incorrectly label diagrams cannot be rewarded with full marks.

     Examiners should be aware that candidates may take a different approach which if appropriate,
     should be rewarded.
