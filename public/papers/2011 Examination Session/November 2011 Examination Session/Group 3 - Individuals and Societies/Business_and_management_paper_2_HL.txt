                                               SECTION A

Answer one question from this section.

1.    Revive Livre (RL)

      Revive Livre (RL), a bookshop located in central London, has one of the largest collections of
      second-hand books in Europe. RL operates as a partnership of two brothers, James and Nick Cusack.
      The bookshop is known for its untidy store layout and lack of space. These features have given the
      bookshop its memorable promotional catchphrase, “Hard to find but worth the time”, which has
      generated substantial brand value through word-of-mouth promotion. RL claims that it can find and
      order any second-hand book.

      Changes in reading habits and technology have impacted on RL. The availability of second-hand
      books from online competitors such as Amazon has become a real concern. Despite the popularity
      of RL, there has been new negative feedback on customer service and the size of the bookshop.
      Customers have complained that it is too time-consuming to find a specific book. A liquidity
      problem has also emerged. RL is holding too much working capital in unsold second-hand books.

      James has identified three options of physical expansion for RL. He argues that all options would
      provide a better service to customers and help with the liquidity problem if they proved successful.

      The estimated cost and financial return for each option is given below (for all options the probability
      of being successful is 0.6 and the probability of not being successful is 0.4):

                   Option                      Cost          Financial return if      Financial return if

       2. Purchase the building next
          door to expand the current
          bookshop:

(Question 1 continued)

      Nick has a completely different strategic vision for RL, which he believes is a less risky and cheaper
      solution to the store’s liquidity and customer service problems. He argues to keep the original central
      London bookshop and set up an e-commerce facility. The web site will also attract new customers and
      Nick believes many second-hand books in the shop may finally be sold.


      (a)   Define the following terms:

		          (i)    partnership                                                                    [2 marks]

		          (ii)   working capital.                                                               [2 marks]

      (b)   Explain two disadvantages for RL of having too much working capital in
            unsold second-hand books.                                                             [4 marks]

      (c)   (i)    Construct a fully labelled decision tree for James’ “three options of
                   physical expansion for RL”. Calculate the predicted outcome for each
                   option and identify the most profitable option (show all your working).        [7 marks]

		          (ii)   Explain one advantage and one disadvantage for RL of using a
                   decision tree as a decision-making tool.                                       [4 marks]

      (d)   Contrast James’ strategy of physical expansion with Nick’s e-commerce strategy.       [6 marks]

2.    Fabia

      Fabia is a premium dress manufacturer in Australia. Fabia produces dresses for the Australian
      market and exports to a few Asian markets. The main target segment is women with high incomes
      who prefer high quality, luxurious dresses, for which they are willing to pay premium prices.
      However, these customers are income elastic. Total quality management (TQM) is used in
      the production of the dresses. Fabia’s unique selling point (USP) is based on high quality and
      unique design, as well as its ethical business behaviour.

      The global economic recession in 2009–2010 resulted in a severe fall in demand for Fabia dresses
      and consequently profit. Despite some optimism about economic recovery, Fabia’s financial
      manager is considering outsourcing production to the Vietnamese manufacturing company Patella
      to reduce costs. Patella is a reliable mass-market* company that takes advantage of the lack of
      regulations in Vietnam with regard to employment and the environment. Patella also has access
      to cheap raw materials. Fabia would retain the design and marketing departments in Australia.
      The dresses would continue to be sold under the Fabia brand.

      Table 1: selected current data for Fabia in 2010
       Number of units sold    200 000 units per annum
       Full capacity           400 000 units per annum
       Fixed costs             US$7 million
       Variable cost per dress US$80
       Price per dress         US$150

      If Fabia outsources the production of the dresses to Patella, the closure of the manufacturing facility
      in Australia will save US$5 million on fixed costs, but 65 % of the workforce will face redundancy.

      Patella could produce up to 2 million dresses per year, charging Fabia US$85 per dress, including
      transport.

      Table 2: selected financial data for Fabia in December 2010 (all figures in US$)
       Closing balance for November 2010: 1 500 000 Fixed assets: 9 000 000
       Payment for raw materials: 1 600 000             Cash sales revenue: 2 000 000
       Capital and reserve: 15 000 000                  Depreciation allowance: 7000
       Electricity payments: 20 000                     Short-term borrowing: 3 000 000
       Salaries and marketing: 175 000                  Interest payment: 11 000

(Question 2 continued)

      (a)   Define the following terms:

		          (i)    total quality management (TQM)                                              [2 marks]

		          (ii)   redundancy.                                                                 [2 marks]

      (b)   (i)    Explain why “the global economic recession in 2009–2010 resulted in a
                   severe fall in demand for Fabia dresses” and what the likely consequences
                   of the economic recovery are for Fabia.                                     [5 marks]

		          (ii)   Using Table 1 and any other relevant information, calculate whether
                   outsourcing the production of dresses to Patella would be profitable for
                   Fabia at 200 000 dresses per annum (show all your working).                 [6 marks]

		          (iii) Using data from Table 2, prepare a cash-flow forecast for December 2010
                  for Fabia (show all your working).                                           [4 marks]

                                             SECTION B

Answer two questions from this section.

3.    Nesbit

      For years, Nesbit has produced chocolate bars targeting the youth market segment and has been the
      market leader. The market became saturated due to the entry of many competitors. Nesbit’s founder,
      Shira Nesbit, was concerned about falling market share, especially because many competitor products
      were perceived to be similar to Nesbit’s. As a result Shira decided to hire an agency to prepare a
      market audit and to conduct market research. The results confirmed Shira’s concerns.

      The audit identified a new gap in the market: a chocolate bar for health conscious consumers.
      Shira thought that it was a good opportunity for Nesbit to exploit. She estimated that a chocolate
      bar for health conscious consumers could be produced in small batches using imported cocoa beans
      from Venezuela. Shira knew that these beans had significant health benefits and that the new bar
      could change customer perceptions of Nesbit. It could also be priced considerably above other
      chocolate bars. Nesbit began the product development of the new healthy chocolate bar, “Veneziano”.

      The introduction of Veneziano gave Shira the opportunity to introduce total quality management
      (TQM) across the company. Previously chocolate bars were produced using flow production and
      only three workers were employed to check quality. With the adoption of the system of TQM,
      Shira expected that the quality of all Nesbit products could improve with zero defects and
      reduced waste. However issues remain. Nesbit workers have traditionally resisted changes
      in the production process and Shira is worried about the impact on worker motivation. Shira is
      considering change management practices.

      Early sales of Veneziano have been impressive. Shira believes that the strategy of introducing a
      new healthy chocolate bar would differentiate Nesbit from its competitors and change customer
      perceptions away from a youth chocolate company towards a more adult one. However, the move
      might be unpopular with Nesbit’s other stakeholders and would require further extensive promotion
      to change perceptions of its brands and company. Some competitors are also experimenting with
      health conscious products similar to Veneziano.



                                                          (This question continues on the following page)

(Question 3 continued)

      (a)   Define the following terms:

		          (i)    market segment                                                             [2 marks]

      (b)   Explain what Shira could do in order to overcome the workers’ resistance to
            change.                                                                           [6 marks]

      (c)   Analyse the usefulness of Shira hiring an agency “to prepare a market audit and
            to conduct market research”.                                                      [6 marks]

      (d)   Discuss whether the launch of Veneziano could change customer perceptions
            of Nesbit.                                                                        [9 marks]

4.    GSK

      As the chief executive officer (CEO) of GlaxoSmithKline (GSK), a large pharmaceutical company,
      Andrew Witty is perceived as profiting from the misfortune of others. GSK has profited significantly
      from the H1N1 flu1 pandemic. In 2009, GSK had received orders for 195 million flu vaccines and
      sales revenue from the vaccine in 2010 was US$1.3 billion. Andrew said, “If a pharmaceutical
      company cannot make a profit during a pandemic, when can it?”. GSK had spent 18 years and
      US$3 billion on researching and developing new flu vaccines.

      Although a public limited company, GSK’s aim is to balance the need to make a profit with the
      ethical side of health care. On the ethical side, GSK plans to use a price discrimination strategy of
      charging in sub-Saharan Africa, only a quarter of the price charged in British and American markets.
      GSK also plans to collaborate with rival companies to research some tropical diseases prevailing in
      developing countries.

      To boost profitability, Andrew has strategies to become less dependent on a few highly successful
      drugs. He plans to:
      • extend GSK’s product range, particularly in cosmetic products, through acquisitions of companies
         such as Stiefel Laboratories, Inc., an American manufacturer of skincare products
      • enter emerging, fast-growing economies by acquiring Dr. Reddy’s, an Indian generic drugs2
         company
      • collaborate with other pharmaceutical companies, such as via a joint venture to develop a
         treatment for AIDS.

      Andrew will also cut costs by US$1.7 billion by 2011, which will result from 10 000 redundancies.

5.    Eat Well

      Eat Well is a small family-run, local restaurant that prides itself on excellent service and local
      dishes made from fresh ingredients. Kaa Lee, the chef, is in charge of ordering the ingredients and
      devising the menu. Currently, he uses a daily just-in-time (JIT) stock control method, ordering from
      local farmers.

      Kaa is concerned about:
      • a fall in demand caused partly by a new organic restaurant that opened recently in the area
      • frequent delays in deliveries of ingredients from local farmers
      • some cash-flow problems resulting from credit given to loyal customers and from purchasing
        ingredients daily
      • customers becoming more demanding, for instance desiring more varied menus with fewer
        local dishes
      • the government becoming stricter with health and safety regulations in the food service industry
      • a recent increase in the level of tax (as this has increased the current liabilities of Eat Well)
      • changing trends in eating out habits.

      Kaa wants to carry out market research to determine how to attract more customers and how to
      compete more effectively.

      He is also considering a move to a more traditional just-in-case (JIC) stock control method,
      and ordering from one single wholesaler located in the regional capital. Kaa is unsure of which
      method of stock valuation to use: last-in-first-out (LIFO) or first-in-first-out (FIFO).


      (a)   Define the following terms:

		          (i)    current liabilities                                                          [2 marks]

		          (ii)   wholesaler.                                                                  [2 marks]

      (b)   Explain the effects on Eat Well’s profit and loss account resulting from using
            LIFO and FIFO stock valuation (figures are not required).                           [6 marks]

      (c)   Analyse Kaa’s decision to change Eat Well’s stock control method to
            just-in-case (JIC).                                                                 [6 marks]

      (d)   Discuss the usefulness of market research for Kaa in order to “determine how
            to attract more customers and how to compete more effectively”.                     [9 marks]
