work please contact your team leader.

1.   (a)   Why, according to Source A, was there opposition to Mussolini’s plan
           for a four power pact?                                               [3 marks]

            The French objected to the equality clause;
            Smaller nations were antagonized;
            The League felt that it threatened its constitutional principles.

     Award [1 mark] for each relevant point up to a maximum of [3 marks].

     (b)   What is the message conveyed by Source E?                                      [2 marks]

            Hitler is criticizing France, Britain and Italy for not keeping their promise to reduce
             their armed forces;
            France, Britain and Italy are uncertain how to respond to Hitler’s criticisms;
            The League is helpless (reference to its hands tied or Hitler sitting on its lap is
             appropriate);
            Germany is rearming and not respecting Versailles (This could be supported by
             reference to Hitler wearing a sword, rifle and pistol in a holster or to Hitler spitting
             on the Treaty).

     Award [1 mark] for each relevant point up to a maximum of [2 marks].

Do not enter half marks or + and – but compensate between (a) and (b) if necessary for a final
mark out of [5 marks].

2.   Compare and contrast the views expressed in Sources B and C about the
     Geneva Disarmament Conference (1932–1934).                                         [6 marks]

     For “compare”
      Both sources agree that there were dangers in disarmament and a threat of war;
      Both sources refer to the fact that Germany was rearming;
      Both sources emphasize the importance of the role of Britain at Geneva.

     For “contrast”
      The sources differ on the position taken by France. Source B argues that France (along
       with Britain and the US) will oppose German rearmament whereas Source C states that
       France “made considerable concessions” to German rearmament at Geneva;
      Source B states that Germany will not be allowed to rearm whereas Source C states that
       German armaments will be allowed to rise;
      Source B emphasizes the importance of the role of the US at the Geneva Conference
       whereas the US’s role is ignored in Source C;
      Source B makes no mention of the air force whereas Germany would be allowed to have an
       air force in Source C.

     End-on description of both sources would be worth up to [3 marks] if the comparative
     element is only implicit, and [4 marks] with excellent explicit linkage. If both sources
     are used with a good running linkage of both comparison and contrast award a maximum
     of [4–5 marks]. For the maximum of [6 marks] expect a detailed, comprehensive, running,
     comparison and contrast. If there is only either comparison or contrast award a maximum of
     [4 marks].

3.   With reference to their origin and purpose, assess the value and limitations
     of Source B and Source D for historians studying the Geneva Disarmament
     Conference (1932–1934).                                                                [6 marks]

     Source B
     Origin:        An extract from a memorandum by Brigadier Temperley to the British Cabinet,
                    16 May 1933.

     Purpose:       To advise the British Cabinet what actions it should take, given from a
                    military viewpoint.

     Value:         It was recorded at the time it was made and shows the views of a representative
                    of the British army It does not necessarily reflect the British government’s
                    opinion on German disarmament.

     Limitations:   The speech cannot necessarily be accepted at face value as there may be
                    ulterior reasons behind the advice that the British military is giving to the
                    British government. It may also have had to be approved by Temperley’s
                    superior officers, e.g. the General Staff. It is one person’s perception of what is
                    happening in Geneva.

     Source D
     Origin:        It is an extract from the Report of the Special Committee on Investigation
                    of the Munitions Industry (The Nye Report), to the US Congress on
                    24 February 1936.

     Purpose:       To give an evaluation of the consequences of the failure of the Geneva
                    Conference.

     Value:         The United States was neutral at the time and the extract gives the US
                    perception of what has transpired. It can be assumed that it is written by
                    observers who were present in Geneva. It also provides a different perspective
                    behind the actions of the French government.

     Limitations:   It is focusing specifically on the issue of munitions and does not analyse any
                    other factors that might have contributed to the failure of the Conference.
                    The USA was not fully committed to its involvement in European affairs.

     Do not expect all of the above. Ideally there will be a balance between the two sources, and
     each one can be marked out of [3 marks], but allow a [4/2 marks] split. If only one source is
     assessed, mark out of [4 marks]. For a maximum of [6 marks] candidates must refer to both
     origin and purpose, and value and limitations.

4.   Using the sources and your own knowledge, explain why the Geneva
     Disarmament Conference (1932–1934) failed to achieve its aims.                      [8 marks]

     Source material
     Source A:    This source clearly indicates that there was disagreement among some of the
                  nations as to the best course of action. The French objected to the equality
                  clause.

     Source B:     This source indicates that there was opposition to any relaxation of the
                   disarmament clauses of the Versailles Treaty, which would certainly
                   antagonize Germany. Confronting Germany about her rearmament could
                   increase international tension.

     Source C:     This source shows that the British knew that the Germans were rearming in
                   secret and were trying to find a way of limiting the extent of this rearmament
                   by proposing an increase in the size of the German army and allowing
                   Germany to have an air force.

     Source D:     This source shows that France, USA and Britain benefited financially and
                   militarily from the failure of the conference and also indicates that an
                   agreement was never likely to be reached.

     Source E:     This source shows that the League of Nations is unable to control Hitler, who is
                   rearming because of the failure of Britain, France and Italy to keep their
                   promises to reduce armaments.

     Own knowledge
     Own knowledge could include: the Washington and London Disarmament Conferences and
     the increase of militarism in Japan, leading to the invasion of Manchuria in 1931.
     This showed the weakness of the League of Nations in dealing with an aggressive nation.
     Also, unlike Washington and London which had more limited aims in terms of disarmament,
     Geneva was too ambitious in its aims of addressing land, air and naval warfare.
     Deciding upon which was the level “consistent with national safety” led to difficult
     negotiations which achieved little. Another reason for the failure of Geneva was the difficulty
     to find a balance between the supervision of the fulfilment of the terms (if agreed upon) and
     the principle of sovereignty. Also, there was reluctance to apply sanctions to enforce arms
     limitation. The Great Depression and its effect on the general political climate in the world
     could also be included as it brought an end to the Locarno “Honeymoon”. Hitler’s rise to
     power in 1933 could be mentioned and linked to his desire for expansion as identified in Mein
     Kampf and his aim to overcome the military and territorial clauses of the Versailles Treaty.
     The role of Italy is also important in relation to the Stresa Front and Abyssinia.

     Do not expect all the above and accept other relevant material. If only source material or own
     knowledge is used the maximum mark that can be obtained is [5 marks]. For maximum
     [8 marks] expect argument, synthesis of source material and own knowledge, as well as
     references to the sources used.
