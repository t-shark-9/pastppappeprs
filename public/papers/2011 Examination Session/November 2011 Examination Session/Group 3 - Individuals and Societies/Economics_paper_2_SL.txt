                                                New Zealand’s economy

           In April 2009, New Zealand reduced its interest rates to 2.5 %.

           The central bank governor said developments point to lower inflation than previously
            projected. The main factors behind this are weaker global economic growth and a stronger
            exchange rate than expected.

           The world economy deteriorated more than expected in the first quarter of 2009 and
            the New Zealand economy remains weak. In addition, business sentiment is low, investment
            has fallen and unemployment has increased.

           We expect the large decline in the official interest rate over the past year together with the
            fiscal stimulus to support the New Zealand economy. However, it is likely to be some time
            before economic activity returns to healthy levels.

                                   Toxic dump near Asopos River investigated

           An Athens prosecutor has ordered an investigation into allegations that an illegal dump near
            the industrial zone in Viotia, is being used by a number of manufacturing firms to dispose of
            toxic waste, severely contaminating nearby Asopos River.

           Researchers from Athens University have confirmed that river water has a concentration of
            148 micrograms (mcg) of depleted chromium per kilogram (kg), and that local water is not
            suitable for irrigation or drinking.

           High traces of toxins in river water have contaminated agricultural produce on sale in the
            shops and street markets of the area. Tests on carrots, for example, revealed concentrations
            of 663 mcg of nickel per kg, nearly six times higher than the international maximum level.
            Local residents also claim the negative externalities these manufacturers have imposed have
            caused an increase in cancer-related deaths.

           The European Environment Commissioner has criticized the government for failing
            to introduce necessary policies to deal with the problems caused by the toxins in the river.
            The government responded by announcing that indirect taxes, direct regulation and new
            legislation are being considered to solve the problem. Indirect taxes could force polluting
            manufacturers to take all costs into consideration, but estimating the size of the necessary tax is
            complicated. A proposal that the government issues pollution permits allowing firms to trade
            them to achieve the optimal level of pollution has many theoretical advantages. However,
            these may be administratively complicated as there are many firms involved and they are
            small in size.

3.       Study the extract and data below and answer the questions that follow.


                                 As trade slows, China rethinks its growth strategy

           Ships are leaving Chinese ports half empty. In the Guangdong province, many factories are
            shutting down without paying employees.

           This is the effect of millions of Americans cutting down on their spending. Chinese
            exports decreased by 9.6 % in one month. A drastic decrease in export revenues
            is a major problem in a country that has relied for many years on exports to pursue its
            growth and economic development goals.

           For the Chinese economy to rely more on domestic demand instead of export demand
            is not easy. Chinese families are forced to save a lot and do not spend much on consumer goods
            and services. They need to save a lot to be able to meet any medical emergencies and to help
            them in retirement as the government does not currently provide the general population with
            health care insurance and pensions.

           To prevent a further increase in unemployment the Chinese government is forced to help
            increase the exports of low-skill, labour-intensive industries such as textiles. “China will resort
            to export subsidies to help the export of labour-intensive industries,” the minister of industry
            and information technology said. Increased subsidies by China have the potential to create
            trade difficulties with the United States (US), particularly regarding textiles, only weeks before
            American quotas on the import of Chinese clothing are about to expire.

                                                        Nigeria’s oil economy

           Nigeria is dependent on oil for more than 90 % of its exports and foreign exchange,
            with more than 80 % of the government’s revenues coming from the oil sector. The Nigerian
            economy is highly dependent on imports for both consumption and production.

           While Nigeria has exported billions of dollars worth of oil, poverty has worsened.
            The Niger Delta, where oil is concentrated, lacks basic services including clean water,
            electricity, health care clinics and schools. In addition, the oil companies are responsible for
            environmental pollution due to gas firing, oil spills, and groundwater contamination. The oil
            industry employs 35 000 Nigerians, of a total population of 149 million, and could at most
            add 5000 new jobs per year. With an annual population growth of 2.4 %, there is a need
            for three million new jobs each year.

           The global recession that began in 2008 led to a decrease in the price of oil. The terms
            of trade have been also affected by a large depreciation of the naira (the Nigerian currency),
            which was made even greater by currency speculation.

           Given the economy’s high dependence on imports, deteriorating terms of trade will have
            serious consequences for consumption and production. As oil prices fall, the government
            will see the need to diversify into non-oil areas of production. Nigeria should invest in
            social services, roads and transportation, and should diversify into a broader range
            of petrochemicals1. It should also diversify into agriculture and agro-industry2.

           One of the ironies of reliance on oil has been that whereas Nigeria has large areas
            of fertile farmland, it is a major importer of food staples, such as rice, wheat, sugar,
            and powdered milk. If Nigeria were making better use of its agricultural potential,
            it could produce enough of these food products for its own needs, and could also
            become a net exporter. The government has taken a first step in this direction with its
            Commercial Agricultural Development Programme, intended to support small farmers, which
            is expected to increase agricultural output and create three million jobs in three years.
