work please contact your team leader.

1.   (a)   What, according to Source C, was the significance of the reorganization
           of the National Charter in the summer of 1968?                          [3 marks]

            It was revised to reflect Fatah’s leadership and the strategy of guerrilla action that the
             PLO was now to follow;
            Palestine, as it had been constituted under the British Mandate, was described as “an
             indivisible territorial unit”;
            The Palestinians rejected partition and ruled out any prospect of compromise
             with Israel. On the contrary, articles 9 and 10 committed the organization to
             “armed struggle” and “commando action”;
            The way was now clear for Arafat to become chairman of the PLO, and for the
             various armed groups to be brought into its structure.

     Award [1 mark] for each relevant point up to a maximum of [3 marks].


     (b)   What is the message conveyed by Source E?                                       [2 marks]

            Arafat shows his delight after being appointed chairman of the PLO;
            Arafat is wearing a military top as are others surrounding him – and seems to be
             carrying a weapon. This indicates that they are prepared to use force;
            Arafat is wearing the Palestinian head scarf (“keffiyeh”), symbol of Palestinian
             nationalism.

     Award [1 mark] for each relevant point up to a maximum of [2 marks].

Do not enter half marks or + and – but compensate between (a) and (b) if necessary for a final
mark out of [5 marks].

2.   Compare and contrast the views expressed in Sources B and D about the
     emergence of the Palestine Liberation Organization.                               [6 marks]

     For “compare”
      Both mention the influence of other liberation movements and refer to Vietnam explicitly;
      Both mention the creation of an organization aimed at representing Palestinian concerns;
      Both mention a military resolution of the problem;
      Both refer to the influence of the Arab world on the Palestinian cause.

     For “contrast”
      Source B mentions Korea and Cuba as other examples of national liberation struggles
       whereas Source D only refers to Algeria;
      Source D emphasizes the importance of Fatah, which is ignored in Source B;
      Source D sees Nasser as working against Western imperialism, which is not included
       in Source B;
      Source D puts the question of the emergence of the PLO in a wider historical context by
       making reference to previous conflicts.

     End-on description of both sources would be worth up to [3 marks] if the comparative
     element is only implicit, and [4 marks] with excellent explicit linkage. If both sources
     are used with a good running linkage of both comparison and contrast award a maximum
     of [4–5 marks]. For the maximum of [6 marks] expect a detailed, comprehensive, running,
     comparison and contrast. If there is only either comparison or contrast award a maximum of
     [4 marks].

3.   With reference to their origin and purpose, assess the value and limitations
     of Source A and Source D for historians studying the emergence of the
     Palestine Liberation Organization.                                                   [6 marks]

     Source A
     Origin:        Extract from the Palestine National Charter, July 1968.

     Purpose:       To explain to the world community and its members the new position taken by
                    the PLO after the amendment of the 1964 Charter.

     Value:         It was recorded at the time it was made and shows how the PLO has revised its
                    programme. It is also stating the underlying premises that will guide the course
                    of action the PLO intends to take in the future.

     Limitations:   It is a clear policy statement by the PLO challenging Israel and could be
                    interpreted as a statement of propaganda and as such it is partisan to the
                    Palestinian position.

     Source D
     Origin:        It is an extract from “Arafat’s Legacy” by Snehal Shingavi in the International
                    Socialist Review, 2005.

     Purpose:       To give an account of the background behind the emergence of the PLO.

     Value:         It was written in 2005 and the author is from a well known university and will
                    have had access to materials that analyse this event in some detail. It has the
                    benefit of hindsight.

     Limitations:   The magazine is a socialist journal that indicates that its views are to the left
                    politically as it criticizes the West. There is no information about the
                    nationality or background of the writer, which would help to identify any bias
                    that he/she might have.

     Do not expect all of the above. Ideally there will be a balance between the two sources, and
     each one can be marked out of [3 marks], but allow a [4/2 marks] split. If only one source is
     assessed, mark out of [4 marks]. For a maximum of [6 marks] candidates must refer to both
     origin and purpose, and value and limitations.

4.   Using the sources and your own knowledge, analyse the statement in
     Source D that the emergence of the Palestine Liberation Organization had
     given “Palestinian nationalism a larger audience and greater legitimacy”
     between 1960 and 1970.                                                             [8 marks]

     Source material
     Source A:    This source clearly indicates the intentions behind the creation of the PLO,
                  identifies its aims and on what basis a person is a Palestinian. This clearly
                  relates to a national identity. The source attempts to legitimise the Palestinian
                  cause (Art. 10) and the use of armed struggle (Art. 9)

     Source B:     This source indicates the split that had occurred among Arabs and implies that
                   the forming of the PLO was intended to resolve this rift. It mentions that
                   Nasser endorsed the recognition of Shukeri but does not go into any
                   explanation of why he was chosen.

     Source C:     This source mentions the fragility of the pan-Arab alliance which until 1967
                   was a hollow solution for Palestinian nationalism. It also mentions Fatah and
                   outlines the reasons behind the modification of the PLO Charter to try to assure
                   Palestinians of a greater legitimacy.

     Source D:     This source clearly shows the split between Fatah and Nasser, which shows
                   that the position of the Palestinians was uncertain prior to 1964.

     Source E:     This source shows the election of Arafat, a member of Fatah, as chairman of
                   the PLO and implies that this will mean more support from the Palestinians.

     Own knowledge
     Own knowledge could include: the background behind the emergence of the PLO, focusing
     on the role of Nasser and the consequences of the 1956 Suez Crisis. It could also refer to
     Nasser’s loss of support, the importance of the Israeli victory in the 1967 war and its impact
     on the development of the PLO, the influence of Western nations and the friction that was
     developing between Fatah, the PLO and other organizations such as the Popular Front for the
     Liberation of Palestine (PFLP) and the Popular Democratic Front for the Liberation of
     Palestine (PDFLP). The role of the United Nations could also be included.

     Do not expect all the above and accept other relevant material. If only source material or own
     knowledge is used the maximum mark that can be obtained is [5 marks]. For maximum
     [8 marks] expect argument, synthesis of source material and own knowledge, as well as
     references to the sources used.
