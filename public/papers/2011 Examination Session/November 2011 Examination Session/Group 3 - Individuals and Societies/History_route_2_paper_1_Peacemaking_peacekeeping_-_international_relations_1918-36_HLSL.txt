These sources and questions relate to the Geneva Disarmament Conference (1932–1934).

SOURCE A                Extract from The League of Nations by George Gill, 1996. George Gill was a
                        professor of History at Fordham University, New York.

Mussolini was convinced that the key to political and economic stability was the “collaboration of the four
great Western Powers” and therefore proposed a four power pact in which France, Germany, Great Britain
and Italy would support treaty revision and pledge equality to Germany if the [Geneva] Disarmament
Conference failed to do so. The French found the equality clause objectionable and removed it from the
final draft of the pact, but the plan also antagonized the smaller nations attending the [Geneva] Disarmament
Conference as another humiliating example of major power negotiations that ignored them. League officials
realized that Mussolini’s insistence on leadership by the stronger nations threatened the constitutional
principles under which the Assembly and Council functioned.


SOURCE B                Extract from a memorandum by Brigadier Temperley to the British Cabinet,
                        16 May 1933. Brigadier Temperley was the military advisor to the British
                        delegation at the Geneva Disarmament Conference.

If it is dangerous to go forward with this disarmament, what is then to be done? There appears to be one
bold solution. France, the United States and Britain should address a stern warning to Germany that there
can be no disarmament, no equality of status and no relaxation of the Treaty of Versailles unless a complete
reversion of present military preparations and tendencies takes place in Germany. Admittedly this would
provoke a crisis and the danger of war will be brought appreciably nearer. Britain would have to say that
it insists upon the enforcement of the Treaty of Versailles, and in this insistence, with its hint of force in
the background, presumably the United States would not join. But Germany knows that she cannot fight at
present and we must call her bluff. She is powerless in the face of the French army and our fleet.


SOURCE C                Extract from The Origins of the Second World War in Europe by P M H Bell, 1993.
                        P M H Bell was a lecturer in History at the University of Liverpool, UK, specializing
                        in European History.

In 1932 the British government agreed in principle to abandon the assumption that no major war was
expected for ten years, but it also decided that while the Disarmament Conference was is session no
action would be taken to rearm. It was politically impossible to begin rearmament during the conference.
Instead, the British laboured tirelessly to find the basis for an agreement on arms limitation, which meant
changing the positions of France and Germany, by bringing French armaments down and allowing German
armaments to rise … The British later proposed an increase in the German army from 100 000 to 200 000,
while the French army would be reduced, and then agreed that Germany should have an air force half the
size of the French. The French government too, under pressure from domestic opinion and reluctant to
isolate itself from Britain, made considerable concessions during the conference. Public respectability was
thus given to German rearmament, which was already secretly under way, as the British government knew.

SOURCE D               Extract from the Report of the Special Committee on Investigation of the
                       Munitions Industry (The Nye Report), US Congress, Senate, 74th Congress,
                       2nd session, 24 February 1936.

In 1932, another disarmament conference was held at Geneva. By this time the failure to prevent
the rearmament of Germany had resulted in great profits to the French steel industry, which had
received large orders for the building of the continuous line of fortifications across the north
of France, to the French munitions companies, and profits were beginning to flow into the
American and English pockets from German orders for aviation supplies. This in turn resulted in a French
and English aviation race. With Germany openly rearming, the much-heralded disarmament conference,
which convened in 1932, has failed completely. It was pointed out by a committee member that some
representatives were aware that “the effect of the failure to check the [Versailles] Treaty violation even
goes to the extent of making a subsequent disarmament convention, if not improbable in its success,
at least calculated to produce only an unworkable document”.
