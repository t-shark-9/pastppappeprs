SOURCE A                Extract from the Palestine National Charter, July 1968.

2.    Palestine, with the boundaries it had during the British Mandate, is an indivisible territorial unit.
5.    The Palestinians are those Arab nationals who, until 1947, normally resided in Palestine regardless of
      whether they were evicted from it or have stayed there. Anyone born after that date, of a Palestinian
      father – whether inside Palestine or outside it – is also a Palestinian.
9.    Armed struggle is the only way to liberate Palestine. Thus it is the overall strategy, not merely a
      tactical phase …
19.   The partition of Palestine in 1947 and the establishment of the state of Israel are entirely illegal,
      regardless of the passage of time, because they were contrary to the will of the Palestinian people and
      to their natural right in their homeland, and inconsistent with the principles embodied in the Charter
      of the United Nations, particularly the right to self-determination.


SOURCE B                Extract from “The Birth of the Palestine Liberation Organization” by
                        Abdel-Qader Yassin in the International Politics Journal (Al-Siyassa Al-Dawliya),
                        April 2004. This is an Egyptian periodical specializing in political and
                        international affairs.

National liberation movements around the world were achieving independence for their countries.
The long-term strategy of a popular war, as proved successful in Korea, Cuba and Vietnam, urged Palestinian
resistance groups to endorse a similar strategy. By the time Israel started to divert the course of the River
Jordan in 1963, the Arab world was divided into two camps: one that considered that the Palestinians alone
should shoulder the responsibility for confronting the Israelis, and the other that believed that a Palestinian
organization should be formed under the auspices of [in line with] the Arab system. In 1963, Nasser
endorsed the recognition of Ahmed Shukeiri as representative for Palestine in the Arab League and called
for the convention of the first Arab summit in 1963, where Shukeiri was asked to present the opinions of
the various Palestinian groups.


SOURCE C                Extract from The Arab–Israeli Conflict by T G Fraser, 2004. T G Fraser is a

Fatah’s new importance was soon reflected in a major reorganization of the PLO [Palestine Liberation
Organization] in the summer of 1968. The 1964 National Charter was revised to reflect Fatah’s leadership
and the strategy of guerrilla action which the PLO was now to follow. At the heart of the Charter was
the claim that Palestine, as it had been constituted under the British Mandate, was “an indivisible
territorial unit”. This reflected the Palestinians’ rejection of partition, which they had followed consistently
since 1937, and which meant no prospect of compromise with Israel. On the contrary, articles 9 and 10
committed the organization to “armed struggle” and “commando action”. The way was now clear for
Arafat to become chairman of the PLO, and for the various armed groups to be brought into its structure.

SOURCE D                Extract from “Arafat’s Legacy” by Snehal Shingavi in the International Socialist
                        Review, 2005. Snehal Shingavi is a lecturer in Middle Eastern studies at the

Egyptian President Gamal Abdul Nasser’s pan-Arab nationalism was both exciting and confusing. On the
one hand, by nationalizing the Suez Canal and calling for the unity of all Arab peoples against
puppet regimes, it represented a bold defiance of Western imperialism. On the other hand, the break-
up of the Egyptian–Syrian union in 1961 demonstrated the fragility of any pan-Arab alliance. While
it was the dominant political trend, even among Palestinians until 1967, pan-Arab nationalism proved
to be a hollow solution for Palestinians – occasionally supporting Palestinian concerns, at other times
ignoring them. Nasser failed, for instance, to defend Palestinians from Israeli attacks, like the one in Gaza in
1955, while the defeats from the 1948 war were a constant reminder of Arab inadequacy. At the same time,
the successes of the Vietnamese and Algerian resistance to the French also convinced many Palestinians
that military struggle against Israel was both possible and necessary. When Nasser announced in 1962 that
he had “no plan for Palestine”, thousands of Palestinians flocked to Fatah and its call for armed resistance
to Zionism. In 1964, Arab countries led by Egypt, established the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO)
in order to divert the growing stream of Palestinian radicalism that threatened the internal stability of a
number of these countries. But it had the opposite effect – giving Palestinian nationalism a larger audience
and greater legitimacy.
