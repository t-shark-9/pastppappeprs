Prescribed subject 2         The kingdom of Sicily (1130–1302)

These questions relate to the reign of Emperor Frederick II as King of Sicily (1198–1250).

 1.    (a)   What, according to Source A, were the successes of Frederick II as
             King of Sicily?                                                    [3 marks]

        •    He gave just and orderly government to Sicily by stamping out corruption and making
             just laws;
        •    He encouraged trade and industry and welcomed skilled immigrants;
        •    He introduced a stable coinage and reduced import duties;
        •    He established the University of Naples.

        Award [1 mark] for each relevant point up to a maximum of [3 marks].


       (b)   What is the message conveyed by Source E?                                   [2 marks]

        •    That Frederick saw himself as the successor of the Roman Emperors;
        •    That Sicily was wealthy and strong enough to issue a 20.5 carat gold coin as currency;
        •    That Frederick wanted to imitate the ancient Romans in his use of symbolism, such as
             the laurel wreath around his head, and the imperial eagle.

        Award [1 mark] for each valid point up to a maximum of [2 marks].

        Do not enter half marks or + and – but compensate between (a) and (b) if necessary for a
        final mark out of [5 marks].

2.    Compare and contrast the views expressed in Sources A and B about
      Frederick II’s treatment of his Sicilian subjects.                [6 marks]

      For “compare”
       • Both sources mention that there was a rebellion among the Muslim population;
       • Both sources mention that Frederick II crushed the Muslim rebellion;
       • Both sources mention that by the end of his reign the Muslims of Sicily had been
           deported to the Italian mainland.

      For “contrast”
       • Source A explains the successes of Frederick II as king, whereas Source B only
           focuses on his treatment of the Muslim population of Sicily;
       • Source A mentions the Muslim rebellion as merely one feature of his rule, whereas
           Source B claims that expelling the Muslims from Sicily was one of Frederick’s main
           priorities;
       • Source A only mentions that the Muslims were transplanted to the mainland, whereas
           Source B gives more detail, claiming that they were first starved into defeat;
       • Source B claims that Frederick had a respect for Muslim culture, whereas Source A
           makes no reference to this.

     End-on description of both sources would be worth up to [3 marks] if the comparative
     element is only implicit, and [4 marks] with excellent explicit linkage. If both sources are
     used with a good running linkage of both comparison and contrast award a maximum of
     [4–5 marks]. For the maximum of [6 marks] expect a detailed, comprehensive, running,
     comparison and contrast. If there is only either comparison or contrast award a maximum
     of [4 marks].

3.   With reference to their origin and purpose, assess the value and limitations
     of Source C and Source D for historians studying Frederick II’s rule in
     Sicily.                                                                      [6 marks]

     Source C
     Origin:        A set of laws decreed by Frederick II for Sicily in 1231.

     Purpose:       To give specific rules for a range of commercial activities, such as the
                    regulation of trades and crafts.

     Value:         This is part of an original series of laws enacted by Frederick II. It helps to
                    reveal his priorities and aims as a ruler.

     Limitations:   It only reveals some of Frederick’s priorities and tells us nothing about the
                    broader issues that he faced, such as his struggle against the Church.

     Source D
     Origin:        An extract from the chronicle of the thirteenth century Italian friar,
                    Salimbene.

     Purpose:       To give a highly personal view of Frederick II’s behaviour as King
                    of Sicily.

     Value:         Salimbene’s life partially overlapped with that of Frederick II. He was an
                    Italian writing in the decades after Frederick II’s death. He would have had
                    access to those who were alive during the events that he was describing.

     Limitations:   Salimbene was drawn to gossip and hearsay. He often focused on trivial
                    events that cannot be substantiated from other sources. As a friar, he is
                    likely to have taken the church view of Frederick II, which was
                    condemnatory. This edition paraphrases Salimbene and may not follow his
                    original words closely enough.

     Do not expect all of the above. Ideally there will be a balance between the two sources, and
     each one can be marked out of [3 marks], but allow a [4/2 marks] split. If only one source
     is assessed, mark out of [4 marks]. For a maximum of [6 marks] candidates must refer to
     both origin and purpose, and value and limitations.

4.   Using the sources and your own knowledge, analyse the statement in Source
     A that Frederick II’s rule as King of Sicily brought “peace and prosperity”.
                                                                                          [8 marks]

     Source material that could be used:
     Source A: This source claims that Frederick II was a successful king who, although not
               popular, introduced valuable reforms to the governance of the kingdom. His
               successes included the imposition of law and order, the regulation of trade,
               industry and commerce. It also notes that Frederick founded the University of
               Naples. It does, however, acknowledge that the Muslim population was expelled
               after the defeat of their rebellion.

     Source B: This source argues that the expulsion of the Muslims was a core aim of
               Frederick II, which he carried out ruthlessly. It notes that in spite of Frederick’s
               supposed respect for Islamic culture, he ended the Muslim civilization on the
               island in a brutal way.

     Source C: This source shows that Frederick II was an active administrator, who passed a
               series of laws for the regulation of trade and the protection of consumers to
               ensure prosperity.

     Source D: This source makes claims about Frederick II’s character, based on anecdotes
               supposedly taken from his life. It suggests that Frederick was cruel and
               unpredictable, but says nothing about his qualities as a ruler.

     Source E: Shows how Frederick II’s coin, the Augustalis, projects the image that he wanted
               to convey – the heir to the Roman Emperors. By claiming to be Caesar
               Augustus he was making a direct claim to be a lawgiver and ruler of all of Italy,
               in the manner of the Roman Emperors. The coin being gold also showed the
               wealth of Sicily at this time.

     Own knowledge:
     Own knowledge could include Frederick II’s activities as a lawgiver and administrator in
     Sicily, such as the enactment of the Assizes of Capua (1220). Frederick II wished to stamp
     his authority on Sicily, in all aspects of criminal and commercial law.

     The establishment of the University of Naples showed that Frederick II had ambitions for his
     kingdom to be a centre of learning to rival the well-established universities of northern Italy.

     Frederick II was also a significant builder in Sicily, and in the mainland provinces of the
     kingdom. The great gateway at Capua included a statue of Frederick II enthroned,
     surrounded by classical figures representing justice. His most famous building is the
     hunting lodge Castel del Monte, which emphasised his presence and authority in the
     kingdom. Frederick II also built a castle at Bari, and added to the existing one at Melfi.
                                            –7–             N11/3/HISTI/BP1/ENG/TZ0/XX/M


He was tolerant towards the Jews, whom he encouraged to settle in Sicily, under his royal
protection. However, he expelled the Genoese and brutally suppressed any signs of Muslim
insurrection. From the mid-1220s onwards, the Muslims were forcibly expelled from Sicily to
the mainland provinces. By the time of his death in 1250 there had ceased to be a Muslim
civilization on the island of Sicily.

During the 1240s, the burden of Frederick’s other commitments as Holy Roman Emperor,
especially his bitter struggle with the Papacy, meant that the governance of Sicily had ceased to
be a high priority for him.

Do not expect all the above and accept other relevant material. If only source material or own
knowledge is used the maximum mark that can be obtained is [5 marks]. For maximum
[8 marks] expect argument, synthesis of source material and own knowledge, as well as
references to the sources used.
