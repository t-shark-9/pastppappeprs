                                                SECTION A

1.   (a)   Describe Andrew Grandin’s:

           (i)    chain of command at Reach Out                                                       [2 marks]

                  Chain of command is the formal line of authority through which orders and
                  decisions are passed down from top to bottom of the hierarchy in a given
                  organization. In the case of Reach Out and Andrew, the chain of command
                  is very short as there are only three levels: Laura and Neil on top, Andrew in
                  the middle of the chain and all the therapists at the bottom of the
                  chain/hierarchy.


                  Award [1 mark] for a basic description, which shows some understanding
                  of the concept of “chain of command”.

                  Award [2 marks] for a clear description correctly applying the concept of
                  “chain of command” to Andrew Grandin.

           (ii)   span of control at Reach Out.                                                       [2 marks]

                  Span of control is the number of people who report directly to one manager
                  in a hierarchy – in this case: all the therapists report to Andrew as he is their
                  manager. It is a wide span of control because there are many therapists.


                  Award [1 mark] for a basic description, which shows some understanding
                  of the concept of “span of control”.

                  Award [2 marks] for a clear description correctly applying the concept of
                  “span of control” to Andrew Grandin.

(b)   Using the case study, comment on two sources of income (current or
      potential) for Reach Out other than the therapist scheme.          [4 marks]

      Besides the therapist scheme, Reach Out has several other sources of income
      (current ones and potential ones):
      • as shown in Appendix 1: the sales of subsidized PECS cards – although the
         cash flow shows that this is not an actual source of income yet
         (as Reach Out has not started selling the PECS cards)
      • as shown in Appendix 1: the charity contributions (donations) of $200 every
         month (a very small amount but a regular one)
      • as mentioned in the case study (Option 2): the possible sale of branded
         products such as clothes and accessories with the Reach Out name and logo
      • as mentioned in the case study (Option 3): the possible sponsorship from
         N-Pharma.


      Mark as 2+2.

      Award [1 mark] for each appropriate source of income identified and [1 mark] for
      an appropriate comment that directly refers to Reach Out up to a maximum of
      [2 marks].

(c)   Analyse the social and economic impacts of the actions of the non-profit
      organization Reach Out.                                                  [7 marks]

      The social and economic impacts of the actions of Reach Out include the
      following:
      • Reach Out provides a social service without which many families could not
         afford treatment for their children with autism: Reach Out has a positive social
         impact on these families, especially on the children.
      • Some private sector providers must be affected by the competition from
         Reach Out; they may lower their fees (currently up to four times higher); they
         are affected economically in a negative way as they run the risk of losing
         business.
      • The popularity of the actions of Reach Out contributes to the awareness raising
         of autism and could make it a funding priority for policy makers (this would be
         a positive impact).
      • The public sector (national or local government) may decide that they do not
         need to spend money on autism support, as organizations such as Reach Out
         now cater for it (this would be a negative impact for families).
      • Accept any other relevant impact.
      • Accept any other relevant substantiated analysis. Theoretical comments from
         outside the case study are acceptable.


      Candidates are not expected to refer to all the above points for top marks, but
      their analysis must be balanced with regards to the positive and negative social
      and economic impacts, in order to reach the highest level of the markband.

      Marks should be allocated according to the markbands on page 3.

2.   (a)   Describe Laura Chan’s desired pricing strategy for Reach Out’s PECS cards. [4 marks]

           Laura’s pricing strategy may be described in several ways:
           • Laura’s starting point (mentioned in Reach Out’s mission statement) is the fact
             that competitors’ PECS cards are very expensive: she wants her PECS cards to
             be much more affordable. Her pricing strategy is therefore competition-based
             strategy.
           • As Reach Out is a new entrant, it needs to create and gain market share against
             its competitors; the pricing strategy could be described as penetration pricing
             (as Laura may later decide to put her prices up, once she has developed brand
             loyalty towards Reach Out’s PECS cards).
           • Cheaper PECS cards affordable to all families can be classified as
             market-based strategy, which further supports the fact that she does not use
             cost-based pricing strategy.

           Accept any other relevant answer.


           Award [1 mark] for each valid point, statement or application to Reach Out, up to
           a maximum of [4 marks].
                                               –8–          N11/3/BUSMT/SP1/ENGTZ0/XX/M


(b)   Explain two reasons why Neil Johnson prepared a STEEPLE analysis for
      Reach Out (line 31).                                                 [4 marks]

      Neil prepared a STEEPLE analysis for several reasons:
      • Preparing a STEEPLE is necessary in order to write a SWOT analysis (as the O
        and T refer to the external environment).
      • As a businessman, Neil knows that the external environment must be analysed
        and taken into account when deciding on any strategic move, STEEPLE is a
        very important initial step for the development of any business plan.
      • The use of a STEEPLE is vital for the identification of opportunities and
        threats which Neil can use to strategically match with Reach Out’s internal
        strengths and weaknesses. (For example some candidates may answer by
        outlining some key findings from the STEEPLE model like political factors:
        in the absence of support from the public sector, there is a demand for
        affordable therapists such as the ones provided by Reach Out).
      • The STEEPLE framework is comprehensive as it covers social/cultural
        technological, environmental, economic, political, legal and ethical factors.

      Accept any other relevant explanation.


      Candidates are not expected to write a STEEPLE analysis for Reach Out.

      Mark as 2 + 2.

      Award [1 mark] for each correct reason identified and [1 mark] for an
      appropriate explanation that directly refers to Reach Out up to a maximum of
      [2 marks].
                                            –9–                N11/3/BUSMT/SP1/ENGTZ0/XX/M


(c)   Laura Chan “did not see how marketing objectives could help Reach Out
      achieve its goals” (lines 148–149). Examine how appropriate it is for
      Reach Out to have marketing objectives.                               [7 marks]

      On the one hand, marketing objectives can be associated with profit-making
      organizations, as shown by the terminology of “marketing” and “market”; Laura
      does not embrace this approach, which is why she is “not interested in brand
      development and product development”. Marketing objectives may not be
      appropriate for Reach Out because Reach Out does not operate as a commercial
      organization that needs to maximize profit to satisfy its owners or shareholders.
      Having marketing objectives may lead to some external stakeholders feeling that
      Reach Out has become too commercialized.

      On the other hand, Reach Out, like all other organizations in the non-profit sector
      does operate in a competitive environment, even if some people (such as Laura)
      find it difficult to apply business concepts to charities (or other non-profit
      organizations such as churches and political parties). Having marketing
      objectives could help Reach Out identify targets and devise a strategy to generate
      further income (hence Neil’s three options) and possibly to reduce cost; from that
      viewpoint, marketing objectives would be appropriate, especially if they choose
      Option 2, which will involve developing and distributing products: a whole new
      marketing philosophy would then be needed for Reach Out, including setting
      marketing objectives and striving to reach them. Having marketing objectives
      can help to increase donations by increasing public awareness of Reach Out.
      The existence of marketing objectives allows for a more accurate performance
      analysis.

      Accept any other relevant substantiated examination.

3.   (a)   Define the following terms:

           (i)    commission (line 40)                                                          [2 marks]

                  A commission is the payment an employee receives when he or she sells a
                  good or service. Commissions are typically a percentage of the value of the
                  good or service sold, which encourages employees to sell more products.

                  Organizations sometimes pay their employees a base salary plus
                  commission; other organizations (where permitted by law) pay only
                  commission.


                  Candidates are not expected to word their definition exactly as above.

                  Award [1 mark] for a basic definition that conveys partial knowledge and
                  understanding.

                  Award [2 marks] for a full, clear definition that conveys knowledge and
                  understanding similar to the answer above.

                  For only a relevant: example or application to the case study award
                  [1 mark].

           (ii)   dismissal (line 109).                                                         [2 marks]

                  Dismissal occurs when an employer terminates the contract of an employee;
                  it is colloquially called “firing”. The employee must have been incompetent
                  or breached the terms of their contract to be dismissed.

(c)   Neil Johnson “eventually decided to donate the $10 000 himself” (line 36).
      Analyse the consequences for Reach Out of Neil’s decision.                 [7 marks]

      Neil’s decision has several consequences for Reach Out:
      • Reach Out does not need to pay him back (even without interest), which is
        financially better for the charity, especially in its first months of operation.
      • Reach Out is not dependent on any bank or any community grant scheme from
        the local public authorities; this gives Reach Out more autonomy.
      • Neil may be more motivated to make Reach Out successful as he has invested
        some of his personal money.
      • This decision shows Laura that Neil is really committed to Reach Out,
        giving her further confidence in the venture.
      • Having donated towards the setup of Reach Out Neil may have a sense of
        ownership and may expect to have more decision-making power. This may
        cause tension between Laura and Neil, which in turn may affect the
        performance of the charity.


      To be balanced the answer must consider both the positive and negative
      consequences.

      Accept any other relevant substantiated analysis. Theoretical comments from
      outside the case study are acceptable.

                                            SECTION B

4.   (a)   Neil Johnson tried to convince Laura Chan that (Option 2) would be a
           worthwhile investment by using a break-even model (lines 130–131). Use a
           fully-labelled diagram to illustrate the break-even analysis model (no figures
           are required).                                                                 [4 marks]

           The answer must be in the form of a diagram. No figures are required. Only the
           diagram enables candidates to gain marks. If there is no diagram, the only mark
           that may be awarded here is 0.

(b)   Explain the difference between internal and external sources of finance for
      Reach Out.                                                                  [4 marks]

      The only conceivable internal source of finance for Reach Out is surplus (i.e. the
      “retained profit” of a charity) – and it is most relevant for them, as they start
      earning a surplus from the end of month 2 onwards, as shown in Appendix 1.
      Reach Out does not have other internal sources of finance, as there is no asset to
      sell (except arguably the IT equipment in Laura’s office, but this is negligible).
      Depreciation and utilizing working capital more effectively are not relevant either.

      Several external sources of finance may be considered, such as bank overdraft
      (short term), bank loan (long term) or community grant from the local public
      authorities (short or long term, not specified in the case study).

      Due to the nature of Reach Out as a charity and because of its objectives
      (ultimately selling affordable PECS cards), an internal source of finance is more
      appropriate for their projects.

      Accept any other relevant explanation.


      Award [1 mark] for a basic answer showing some limited knowledge of what
      constitutes internal versus external source of finance (such an answer could take
      the form of a couple of bullet points with the candidate only writing down what
      they have learnt and remember about sources of finance).

      Award [2 marks] for an answer which shows some knowledge and understanding
      of different types of sources of finance in the context of Reach Out.

      Award [3 marks] for an answer which lists different types of sources of finance in
      the context of Reach Out.

      Award [4 marks] for a good answer which clearly explains the difference between
      internal and external sources for Reach Out.

(c)   With reference to Reach Out and to one organization of your choice, explain
      two reasons for setting up a business.                                      [4 marks]

      Reasons for setting up a business include:
      • passion about an idea, an area or a cause; this has been the case of Laura for
        Reach Out
      • having identified a business opportunity or a gap in the market; this too has
        been the case for Laura and Reach Out
      • family tradition: being entrepreneurial is sometimes seen as a family trait;
        many entrepreneurs have had parents and even grandparents who too ran their
        own business
      • redundancy: someone lost their job and, rather than struggling to find another
        employer, they decide to be self-employed.

      Accept any other relevant explanation.


      Mark as 2 + 2.

      Award [1 mark] for each relevant and correct reason for setting up a business
      identified and [1 mark] for an appropriate explanation in context up to a
      maximum of [2 marks].

      One reason must include a reference to Reach Out. The choice of the other
      organization is not important, it is not directly assessed. It may well be a small
      business from the candidate’s community or family circle; this is entirely
      acceptable.

(d)   Laura Chan has a laissez-faire leadership style (line 115). Evaluate the
      effectiveness and implications of her leadership style for Reach Out.    [8 marks]

      Laura’s laissez-faire leadership style is particularly apparent in the way she deals
      with Andrew, as she gives him free rein (autonomy) and trusts him (too much,
      according to Neil). Such a leadership style means that power and authority are
      given to employees who determine their goals, make decisions and resolve
      problems on their own. It is an effective style with Theory Y workers (to use
      McGregor’s typology) or with employees who are highly skilled, experienced and
      educated. This type of leadership style may not be appropriate for Andrew.

      Laura’s leadership style has several consequences for a range of stakeholders:
      • Andrew may only feel comforted in his own beliefs and may not change his
        approach/behaviour, in his work.
      • Neil is feeling more and more antagonized and irritated by Laura; this may
        convince him that he and Laura cannot actually work together. Laura does not
        see the point of raising income/revenue (Options) in a business sense.
      • Parents and therapists alike may lose their trust in the scheme, if it is not
        properly managed – and indirectly the wider community could have a negative
        image of Reach Out because of Laura’s ineffective leadership style.

      Accept any other relevant substantiated evaluation.


      There is no right or wrong conclusion that candidates can reach at the end of their
      evaluation (though they are likely to conclude that Laura’s style is not effective,
      which mainly has negative implications for Reach Out); however for top marks
      there must be a final conclusion.
