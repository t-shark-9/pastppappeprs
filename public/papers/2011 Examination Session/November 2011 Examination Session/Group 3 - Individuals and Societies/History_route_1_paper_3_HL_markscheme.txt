 0:       Answers not meeting the requirements of descriptors should be awarded no marks.
 1–2:     Answers do not meet the demands of the question and show little or no evidence of
          appropriate structure. There is little more than unsupported generalization.
 3–4:     There is little understanding of the question. Historical knowledge is present but the detail is
          insufficient. Historical context or processes are barely understood and there are little more
          than poorly substantiated assertions.
 5–6:   Answers indicate some understanding of the question but historical knowledge is limited in
        quality and quantity.        Understanding of historical processes may be present but
        underdeveloped. The question is only partially addressed.
 7–8:   The demands of the question are generally understood. Relevant historical knowledge is
        present but is unevenly applied. Knowledge is narrative or descriptive in nature. There may
        be limited argument that requires further substantiation. Critical commentary may be present.
        An attempt to place events in historical context and show an understanding of historical
        processes. An attempt at a structured approach, either chronological or thematic has been
        made.
 9–11: Answers indicate that the question is understood but not all implications considered.
        Knowledge is largely accurate. Critical commentary may be present. Events are generally
        placed in context, and historical processes, such as comparison and contrast, are understood.
        There is a clear attempt at a structured approach. Focus on AO1, AO2 and AO4. Responses
        that simply summarize the views of historians cannot reach the top of this markband.
 12–14: Answers are clearly focused on the demands of the question. Relevant in-depth knowledge is
        applied as evidence, and analysis or critical commentary are used to indicate some in-depth
        understanding but is not consistent throughout. Events are placed in context and there is
        sound understanding of historical processes and comparison and contrast. Evaluation of
        different approaches may be used to substantiate arguments presented. Synthesis is present
        but not always consistently integrated. Focus on AO3 and AO4.
 15–17: Answers are clearly structured and focused, have full awareness of the demands of the
        question, and if appropriate may challenge it. Accurate and detailed historical knowledge is
        used convincingly to support critical commentary. Historical processes such as comparison
        and contrast, placing events in context and evaluating different interpretations are used
        appropriately and effectively. Answers are well structured and balanced and synthesis is
        well-developed and supported with knowledge and critical commentary.
 18–20: Answers are clearly focused with a high degree of the awareness of the question and may
        challenge it successfully. Knowledge is extensive, accurately applied and there may be a high
        level of conceptual ability. Evaluation of different approaches may be present as may be
        understanding of historical processes as well as comparison and contrast where relevant.
        Evaluation is integrated into the answer. The answer is well-structured and well-focused.
        Synthesis is highly developed.

1.   Compare and contrast the lives of monks in two of the following monastic orders: Cluniac;
     Carthusian; Cistercian.

     Early Christian monasticism was founded by Benedict of Nursia, in Monte Cassino in central Italy,
     c525. He introduced his rule, which defined the qualities and actions demanded of a monk:
     humility, obedience, prayer, silence, solitude, and stability. This rule was systematized by Benedict
     of Aniane, and received papal approval in 817. But it was felt that some changes and reforms were
     needed with the passage of time, and these took place with the foundation of new orders: the
     Cluniacs in 910, Carthusians in 1084 and Cistercians in 1098.

     For comparison, all lived a life devoted to prayer and continued the Benedictine practice of saying
     the divine office, which consisted of eight parts, when the monks came to the monastic church and
     recited at least 42 psalms. All renounced the world and private property by living a communal life.

     For contrast; the Cluniac order became a spiritual and cultural centre; their churches were more
     ornate, and the church at Cluny was a model for ecclesiastical architecture in medieval Europe. Its
     early abbots, including Odilo, were important figures in the Church and in secular affairs. This to
     some extent led to its decline by the end of the thirteenth century.

     The Carthusian rule was very strict, demanding solitude, abstinence from meat, regular fasting, and
     silence for most of the time.

     The main difference of the Cistercian order was their adoption of work, especially agriculture. To
     avoid the temptations of town life, Cistercian monasteries were built in the countryside, in formerly
     poor agricultural areas, such as marsh and moor, which they brought into cultivation. Both
     professed monks and lay brothers worked on the land. Cistercian houses became rich especially
     from their activities of sheep farming and wool trading. They also followed a strict interpretation of
     the rule of St Benedict, at least in their early years.

     If only one order is addressed, mark out of a maximum of [7 marks].



2.   In 1199 Pope Innocent III (1198–1216) wrote: “Nothing which happens in the world should
     escape the notice of the supreme pontiff”. To what extent did this view govern his policies?

     Innocent III (1198–1216) was indeed active in spiritual and temporal matters, because the pope was
     a temporal ruler as well as head of the Catholic Church. For the former, he reasserted control over
     the Papal States and was acknowledged as overlord of the kingdom of Sicily. He claimed the right
     to choose between rival emperors, and used excommunication as a weapon in England, France and
     Germany.

     As a religious reformer, he opposed heresy and preached crusades. He worked hard to improve the
     quality of diocesan and parochial clergy. He summoned the Fourth Lateran Council in 1215, and
     issued 70 reforming decrees. It could be argued that his pontificate marked the climax of the
     medieval papacy, or perhaps by some that his vigorous claims harmed the Church, and involved the
     Papacy too much in temporal affairs.

3.   Account for the rise of the Fatimids.

     The Fatimid dynasty reigned in Morocco from 909 to 969, and in Egypt until 1171.

     The reasons for the rise included:
     • the rise of the Ismaili movement with their claim of descent from Muhammad’s daughter Fatima,
       which helped the validity of their caliphs;
     • the success of their founder Ubaidallah in claiming to be Mahdi, the divinely guided one, and
       their conquest of North Africa which resulted from the conversion of the Kutama Berbers who
       provided the powerful army which conquered North Africa;
     • military success – in spite of various setbacks, and opposition, Egypt was captured, helped by
       discontent with Ikhshidid rule after inadequate Nile floods, and famine;
     • the work of Jawhar and al-Mu’izz (953–975);
     • the success of their new capital, al-Qahira (Cairo);
     • their commercial and trading prowess;
     • decline of the Carmathians (Qaramita) and nomads and rise to importance of settled areas.



4.   Discuss the importance of trade and the economy in the Fatimid Empire.

     The Fatimid Empire, based in Egypt, enjoyed a reasonably prosperous and settled period which
     enabled the expansion of trade and the economy.

     Some areas which could be discussed are:
     • the nature of Fatimid rule;
     • a succession of able rulers starting with al-Mu’izz (953–975);
     • the success of the Fatimids in opening the Mediterranean to contact and trade with Western
       Europe;
     • the development of Cairo as a caliphate and important city, with land communications to the port
       of Alexandria;
     • the demand for luxury goods;
     • the weakness and decline of other Arab lands and empires.

5.   Analyse the reasons why William I, Duke of Normandy, was able to conquer and control
     England.

     The following could be analysed in relation to the reasons why William was able to conquer
     England: William I, Duke of Normandy (1028 –1087), also known as William the Conqueror, and
     as William I of England, ruled from 1066 until his death in 1087. He succeeded his father as Duke
     of Normandy, and by 1047 he had established full control there. He visited Edward the Confessor
     in 1051, and claimed that Edward promised him the English throne. He also claimed that Harold,
     Earl of Wessex, had promised to support this claim when he was in Normandy in 1064. On
     Edward’s death Harold claimed the throne, and William, with papal support and an army that he
     had been preparing, defeated and killed Harold in the Battle of Hastings (1066).

     With regard to control, some points to analyse are: after the death of Harold there was no other
     strong claimant; the strength of William’s forces; papal support; William’s ruthless crushing of
     opposition, especially the revolts between 1067 and 1071; the introduction of Norman personnel,
     social organization, administration and legal practices; the compilation of the Doomsday Book; the
     work of Lanfranc, Archbishop of Canterbury, in introducing Norman practices/reforms into the
     Church.

     There is much material that candidates could use for this question, so do not expect or demand all
     the above, and credit other relevant material.



6.   Assess the successes and failures of Louis VII, King of France, from 1137 to 1180.

     Louis VII was king of France from 1137 to 1180. He married Eleanor of Aquitaine but divorced
     her in 1152. She married Henry Plantagenet, soon to be Henry II of England, who claimed
     Aquitaine thus causing a long series of wars over Aquitaine and Henry’s other possessions in
     France. Louis aided Henry’s sons in revolt against their father, especially in 1173 and 1174, but
     gained little from it. Whether the disputes and wars between the two monarchs were successes or
     failures for Louis could be debated.

     Louis was at least partly successful in increasing the king’s feudal rights as some magnates
     submitted their disputes to his jurisdiction, thus recognizing the king as their feudal lord. If either
     party disobeyed his judgment Louis sent his army against him.

     Louis also profited from the growth of the legend of Charlemagne. The last part of the Song of
     Roland was probably written during his reign.

     Louis had a reputation for piety; he was a second son, and had been brought up by monks, but
     became king because of the death of his elder brother. In 1147 he set out on crusade, with Eleanor.
     Her behaviour on crusade was said to be partly why Louis divorced her. The expensive crusade
     achieved nothing but Louis’ second marriage produced Phillip II (Augustus).

     If only successes or failures are assessed, mark out of a maximum of [12 marks].

7.   “The Christian Crusades developed naturally from pilgrimages.” To what extent do you
     agree with this statement?

     The tradition of pilgrimage for Christians in medieval Europe was established early. By AD350
     there was a regular pilgrimage route from Bordeaux to Jerusalem, with hospices on the way.
     Christian pilgrimages to the Holy Places continued after Jerusalem had fallen to Islam.
     Non-spiritual reasons played their part, but for many it was a truly religious experience.
     Current Christian/Catholic doctrine preached the necessity of atonement for sins, and pilgrimage
     to the Holy Land was regarded as the best way to obtain forgiveness.

     Generally since the fall of Jerusalem to the Muslims, Christian pilgrimage was allowed. However,
     it was expensive and increasingly dangerous. Believing in safety in numbers, groups often joined
     together. In 1064 about 7000 pilgrims drawn from all social classes set out from Germany under
     the leadership of the Archbishop of Mainz. Many suffered losses from brigands. Also, the situation
     was changing with the conversion to Islam of the Seljuk Turks. They disrupted the whole region,
     and in 1071, at Manzikert, defeated the Byzantine army and captured the emperor. They also
     overran Muslim territories. Thus the system of allowing Christian pilgrimage to Jerusalem ended.
     However the call to crusade was also partly caused by the request of the Byzantine Emperor
     Alexius I, for help. In 1095 Pope Urban II preached and proclaimed the First Crusade.

     Candidates must decide and argue to what extent the Crusades did develop from pilgrimages. Other
     reasons can be put forward, but the focus of the question must be the quotation.

8.   Evaluate the impact of the Crusades up to 1200, on either medieval Europe or the
     Islamic world.

     The question asks how the Crusades, up to the end of the twelfth century affected either medieval
     Europe or the Islamic world. Effects could be considered up to about the middle of the thirteenth
     century, and will vary as to whether Europe or the Islamic world is chosen. However many of the
     same points could be considered for both. Here are some points that could be discussed:
     • religious effects: did the Crusades strengthen or weaken religion, or change religious beliefs or
        practices?
     • political effects: these could be considered for medieval Europe or the Islamic world as a whole,
        and/or individual countries. Absent rulers often led to trouble at home;
     • social effects: Crusades gave occupation to men who might have caused trouble at home, and
        provided occupations and sometimes wealth or even territory to younger sons, or those who had
        no prospects in their own country;
     • economic effects: new trade routes were opened up, new products were seen, and later imported;
     • military effects: methods, weaponry, tactics, etc. were developed, and sometimes mercenaries
        were employed;
     • effects on individuals: reputations were gained or lost on both sides. Important leaders, such as
        Richard I, Godfrey de Bouillon, Nur al-Din, Salah al-Din (Saladin), could be considered;
     • ideas and learning were spread.

     The impact of at least some of the above should be evaluated. There is much material that could be
     used, and selection and focus will be needed.



9.   In what ways, and to what extent, did conditions in the Islamic world contribute to the rise of
     the Mongols?

     The rise of the Mongols was assisted in the following ways by the situation in the Islamic world:
     • Mongol conquests gained momentum at the beginning of the thirteenth century, with the
       conquest of north China (1211–1212).
     • By 1220, the Mongols were in control of Central Asia.
     • In the 1230s they occupied central Russia, Ukraine, Poland and Hungary.
     • In 1243 they annihilated a Seljuk army, and in 1258 the Abbasid caliphate was overthrown.
     • The Abbasid dynasty had been in decline for many years; much of their army consisted of slaves
       – Mamluks, whose loyalty was questionable.
     • The original cohesion of the Islamic world had broken down owing to its size, by 1200.
     • The different Muslim sects caused disputes and wars between the Muslim states.

     Candidates should also deal with “to what extent” by analysing Mongol fighting methods and
     leadership briefly, but the key focus should be on the conditions in the Islamic world.
                                                   –9–                N11/3/HISTI/HP3/ENG/TZ0/XX/M


10.   To what extent, and with what results, was Central Asia devastated by the Mongols under the
      leadership of Timur-I-Lang (Tamerlane)?

      Timur-I-Lang was born in 1336, his military leadership of the Mongols was established by about
      1370, and he died on the way to attack China in 1405.

      He overran large areas of Central Asia, Russia, Iran, Iraq and India; apart from “resting” in
      Samarkand between 1396–1398, his life was with his army, attacking, devastating and treating
      those who resisted him with the utmost cruelty. His conquests included land routes from China to
      Europe, and sea routes from India to the Persian Gulf. He was able to collect tolls and taxes, and to
      some extent kept these routes safe.

      Islamic empires were disintegrating; they had suffered a large fall in population from plague, which
      led to economic and agricultural decline, but Timur-I-Lang was attracted by their riches and became
      a collector of art and crafts and rich materials and clothes. He did not found a cohesive empire, and
      frequently had to recapture lands because he did not install a cohesive administration. He did not
      call himself the ruler, partly because Central Asia demanded a direct descendant of Genghis Khan.
      Timur-I-Lang therefore installed Kabulshah as the titular ruler of his conquests.

      Although Timur-I-Lang’s army beat the Ottoman army of Bayazit in 1402, because of his failure to
      establish an empire, he paved the way for the Ottoman Empire. The Abbasid Empire had been
      defeated, but Islamic rule, although diminished, still held some power on its fringes in Africa with
      the Mamluks, and in Spain.

      If only extent or results are discussed, mark out of a maximum of [12 marks].

11.   Compare and contrast the religious, cultural and economic activities of Christians and
      Muslims in Spain during the period you have studied.

      During the eighth century the Muslims conquered most of Spain. The Muslim dynasties that
      occupied Spain were the Umayyads, from 756 to 1031, the Almoravids, from 1061 to 1147, and the
      Almohads, from 1147 to 1269. Meanwhile Christian Spain, by this time a fusion of Romanic and
      Visigothic people and influence, split into different small kingdoms such as León-Castile, Aragon
      and Navarre. By the middle of the thirteenth century, all that remained of the Islamic territory was
      Granada. It took the union of Aragon and Castile to defeat Granada, in 1492. Thus this question
      could cover a wide time span, and religion, culture and the economy changed and fluctuated.
      Candidates may try to cover a wide period, or concentrate on a smaller one. Mark what is in front
      of you sympathetically, as this is a very complex area.

      Religion:
      For comparison: religion was important to both, and religious buildings were erected and rituals
      were developed. When an area changed from being Muslim to being Christian or vice versa, a
      cathedral or mosque was adapted for its new master.

      For contrast: Christians were, by the time of the Arab conquest, members of the orthodox Catholic
      Church, with allegiance to Rome. Muslims were part of the Islamic world, but in 925 had their own
      caliph. Muslims were usually more tolerant to non-Muslims, and received more converts. Military
      orders, such as Templars and Hospitallers were used in the reconquest.

      Culture:
      Culture was important for both Christians and Muslims, but candidates will probably find more to
      contrast than to compare. Poetry was written by both, but war epics such as the Song of Roland and
      Poema de mio Cid, contrasted with the gentler Arab poems. Both had their own music. Christian
      influence came from the North and Muslim from the East.

      The centre of Muslim culture was the caliph’s court in Granada, which was surrounded by the Arab
      elite, who were rich and powerful. Here to be found were theologians, lawyers, philosophers and
      scientists but the work of these was copied in Toledo, where a translation academy was founded for
      this work. With the split of the Umayyad caliphate into small kingdoms, intellectual pursuits and
      culture were less prominent. The great mosque in Cordoba was renowned for its many aisles and
      sculptured marble, but it was surpassed by the Alhambra palace in Granada, which was not just a
      palace but a royal city. Its gardens and two royal courtyards surpassed any contemporary Christian
      building of that age.

      Economic activities:
      In agriculture the Muslims were renowned for their irrigation which enabled fruit, rice and sugar
      cane to be grown. Christian Spain concentrated on sheep farming. Industries for the Muslims
      included gold and silver mining, weaving silk and wool, and paper making. Towards the end of the
      period, Christian Spain engaged in ship building, and Barcelona was an important port.

      If only Christian or Muslim activities are discussed, mark out of a maximum of [7 marks].
                                                 – 11 –              N11/3/HISTI/HP3/ENG/TZ0/XX/M

12.   For what reasons, and in what ways, was the relationship between al-Andalus and the Islamic
      East both profitable and difficult?

      Spain was invaded by a Muslim force, mainly consisting of Berbers but led by an Arab leader,
      Tarig, in 711. They were joined by Musa, with a strong Arab force in 712. By 718 they had
      captured the land up to the Cantabrian Mountains, and Musa and Tarig were summoned to
      Damascus to report their success to the caliph. From this time, until the fall of Granada, the last
      Muslim stronghold in al-Andalus, as the Muslims called their territory, (for Christians Spain was
      Hispania), the relations between al-Andalus and the Islamic East was both profitable and difficult.

      For “profitable” some of the following points could be made:
      • although many of the conquered people did become Muslims, conversion was not pushed too
        hard as taxes were higher for non-Muslims;
      • trade between the two was profitable, and new goods and products were exchanged both ways;
      • learning, scholarship, intellectual work, helped both areas through the interchange of scholars;
      • the Islamic presence in the Mediterranean was strengthened.

      For “difficult” some of the following points could be made:
      • problems between Berbers and Arabs, and Arabs and Syrians, in al-Andalus made it difficult for
        a distant authority to control;
      • dissensions in Arabia gradually turned the caliphate into a more secular power, and the reigning
        family was massacred, except for ’Abd al-Rahman I;
      • ‘Abd al-Rahman I fled to al-Andalus, severed the link with Damascus and ruled over an
        independent emirate;
      • revolts against ‘Abd al-Rahman I and his successors were organized from the east;
      • the link with Damascus was broken, but al-Andalus remained Umayyad;
      • in 925 ‘Abd al-Rahman III declared himself caliph.

      Mark as a whole but expect material on both “profitable” and “difficult” for a good mark.

13.   In what ways did the policies of Emperor Frederick II affect his relationship with the
      Church?

      Frederick (1194–1250) was crowned king of the Germans in 1215 and elected Holy Roman
      Emperor in 1220, and remained so until he died, in spite of being excommunicated twice. His reign
      was dominated by a struggle for power with the Papacy, which was caused by his personality and
      religious views, and partly by his inheritance, which was impossibly large and complex, and bound
      to lead to problems with the pope.

      Frederick’s main religious policies were: his 1228–1229 crusade, which by negotiations obtained
      Jerusalem, Nazareth and Bethlehem for the Christians, devolved imperial power on clerical princes
      in Germany, and humiliated Gregory IX by his fighting in Italy. Gregory excommunicated him
      twice. Frederick also quarrelled with Gregory’s successor, Innocent IV, who appealed to Germany
      to revolt.

      Frederick’s position and personality affected Europe, and especially Italy and Germany, with years
      of instability and fighting. His crusade brought some comfort to Christians, but the situation did not
      last. Frederick’s position was declining in face of papal opposition and strength, and this left a
      legacy of uneasy relations between the Church and state.

      There is much material for candidates to use. A key issue was the clash of imperial and papal
      power. Papal power also had a secular element (the pope as an Italian prince). This meant there
      was bound to be a conflict with the Holy Roman Emperor, with his claims to rule in Italy.
      When the holder was a powerful and unusual figure like Frederick, medieval Europe was bound to
      be affected.



14.   “Louis IX was admired by many in varied walks of life; by churchmen for his piety and
      alms-giving; by knights for his courage and zeal for the Crusade; by his subjects for his
      justice.” To what extent do you agree with this statement?

      This quotation gives candidates a structure for their answers, and most will probably agree with it.
      Louis IX was one of the most respected European medieval kings.

      Louis was a pious and religious monarch. He went on two crusades, built the Sainte Chapelle in
      Paris to house relics, instituted the Maundy washing of feet by the king as an act of humility, gave
      much to charities for the poor and lepers, was a friend to the Franciscans, and a canonized saint.

      Louis’ justice was renowned, and personal. After mass he sat under an oak tree and invited
      petitioners to seek his justice. Administratively he used Franciscans and clerks to travel the country
      in support of dispensing the royal justice. He was also asked to arbitrate disputes between the
      barons, and between kings and their subjects.

      His position was helped by the extension by previous French monarchs of the royal demesne, so he
      was able to live and rule from its proceeds.

      Of course by today’s standards there are points to criticize; he persecuted Jews and heretics.

15.   Compare and contrast the challenges to the rule in England of Henry VI and Edward IV.

      Henry VI succeeded to the throne on the death of his father, Henry V. He was king from 1422 to
      1461 and 1470 to 1471. His minority ended in 1437, but he had no military or administrative skills.
      He is also said to have suffered bouts of insanity. He was thus considered a weak king and this
      encouraged feuding among leading magnates. He married Margaret of Anjou in 1445.

      Edward IV (1442–1483) was the son of Richard, Duke of York. He was king from 1461 to 1470,
      and 1471 to 1483. He had both military and administrative skills.

      Ruling England in the fifteenth century presented challenges to both kings, (especially as both had a
      problem with inheritance) with over-mighty subjects, war, and the need for administrative reform.

      For comparison: both had problems because of the nature of their succession; both were removed
      from the throne and exiled; both suffered from over-mighty subjects and were involved in civil war;
      both had financial problems.

      For contrast: Henry suffered bouts of insanity, Edward was strong and healthy; Henry had no
      military skills, Edward was able to fight; Henry was unable to meet the challenge of ruling England,
      Edward had administrative skills, introduced reforms and enforced better law and order. Edward
      was involved with foreign policy, allying with Charles the Bold, Duke of Burgundy.

      If only one king is addressed, mark out of a maximum of [7 marks].

16.   Analyse the role of one individual (excluding Henry VI and Edward IV) in any one medieval
      European crisis between 1300 and 1485.

      This is an open-ended question where candidates must select one medieval European political crisis
      and analyse the role of one individual in it. The History guide mentions succession crises, wars,
      challenges to royal authority. As Henry VI and Edward IV are named in the previous question, they
      cannot be used, but Richard II would be eligible. Other suitable candidates for this question could
      be earlier English kings, Edward II and Richard III, French kings, dukes of Burgundy. Other
      relevant individuals not mentioned in the Guide could include: Richard Neville, Earl of Warwick,
      Piers Gaveston, Roger Mortimer, etc.

      For analysis each crisis should be defined, and its cause, course, conclusion and effects should be
      considered.



17.   In what ways, and to what extent, did the effects of the Black Death differ between town and
      countryside?

      Although medieval European towns were considered to be lacking in sanitation and often crowded,
      the countryside usually suffered more from the plague, especially the Black Death of 1347–1351.
      The reason given is that the plague was caused by fleas that lived on rodents and the ratio of rodents
      to humans was greater in the countryside. Because peasants’ dwellings were farther apart than town
      dwellings, often a colony of rodents would infest one dwelling, whereas this was not the case in
      towns, where houses were close together and rodents had more choice. Also the proximity of
      peasants to animals led to more rats and more fleas. Peasants’ dwellings also had thinner walls and
      were more permeable.

      The after-effects were also more serious for country dwellers with depopulation, land left
      uncultivated, and the demands of labour by land lords increased with the labour shortage. Some
      peasants were able to demand higher wages but pressure on parliament by knights of the shires led
      to the Statute of Labourers, 1451, which prohibited the movement of labourers to obtain higher
      wages. This led to discontent and riots outside Justice Sessions. It has also been cited as a
      contributory cause of the Jacquerie and Peasants’ Revolt.

      Of course plagues did affect the towns; unsanitary conditions, plague carts, pillaged burial areas and
      crowded localities led to many deaths, but urban workers were less affected by famine, and
      occupational problems and changes after 1450. Monasteries and religious institutions in both town
      and countryside were very badly hit, in spite of being more hygienic than most dwellings.

      This is a vast topic, and candidates may take other points of view. Perhaps some will give statistics,
      but it is hoped that the answer will be analytical and not just consist of horrific descriptions. Mark
      as a whole, and credit all relevant material and arguments.

18.   What is meant by “social change” in fourteenth century Europe? Examine its impact on one
      medieval European country.

      Candidates could begin by giving their ideas on the meaning of, and reasons for, fourteenth century
      “social change”. The thirteenth century in Europe saw expansion of population, trade, agriculture,
      and urban development; the fourteenth century could be said to have seen either a consolidation of
      the thirteenth century areas of expansion, or even a decline. It also entered a period of rudimentary
      government centralization, which meant more government regulation of people’s lives. Lordship
      had declined with the commutation of services for money rents, and social classes had to some
      extent changed. It was also a century of plague and war.

      Some of the following points could be used and developed:
      • it was an age of combination, of guilds, and leagues, where people joined together in order to
        survive and/or prosper;
      • some of these were craft guilds, to retain jobs and prevent others joining;
      • trade leagues such as the Hanseatic League, which was European and monopolistic;
      • other towns were admitted from time to time, provided they excluded rivals;
      • leagues of mercenaries, to fight wars on behalf of their state employer;
      • guilds usually worked through the family; a member’s children had right of entry, others did not;
      • labourers tried to form guilds, but mostly failed; also it was almost impossible for a labourer to
        rise because of laws against competition in the labour market;
      • agricultural decline with European famines 1316–1317, and the Black Death;
      • more positive developments included the development of banking, the beginning of large-scale
        capitalist finance, and technological advances – although these had their downside, with
        advanced war techniques and the use of gunpowder;
      • shipbuilding also was revolutionized by the need to mount cannons on board ship; the
        Portuguese Caravel was designed to meet fourteenth century needs.

      No doubt candidates will be able to suggest other reasons for, and examples of, social change. They
      are asked to select one European country for their answer. England, France, a specific Italian City
      State, or Flanders, would all be suitable choices.

19.   Compare and contrast the rule and policies of Mehmet II (1451–1481) and Selim I
      (1512–1520).

      The Ottoman sultan Mehmet II was also known as “the Conqueror”, after his expansionist policy.
      In 1453 he achieved the long-standing Ottoman objective of taking over Constantinople and uniting
      the European and Asian parts of the Ottoman Empire. Continuing campaigns brought farther gains
      in the Balkans, but he failed to capture Rhodes. He was successful in consolidating his control of
      Asia Minor and capturing Oranto in Apulia. He modernized his forces by equipping them with
      firearms and artillery. He was also an organizer and worked out an institution framework for the
      Ottoman Empire.

      Selim I was also a conqueror. He had murdered his brother to secure his succession, in 1513. In
      response to a Safavid-inspired rising in Asia Minor, he defeated a Persian army at Chaldiran. He
      then attacked the Mamluks and conquered Syria and Egypt. He then became the caliph and
      protector of Mecca and Medina.

      Thus both were successful fighters and conquerors. Mehmet was an administrator and Selim
      became caliph.

      If only one ruler is addressed, mark out of a maximum of [7 marks].



20.   Assess the success of the Ottomans, (a) as conquerors, and (b) as rulers.

      The period in the History guide for the Ottoman section is 1281–1566. Candidates need not cover
      the whole period for this question but they must use specific evidence to support their arguments.

      For (a) the following points could be made: the areas that were conquered; the extent of the
      Ottoman Empire; their military forces, tactics, campaigns and conquests. Candidates could analyse
      the relative value of the different conquests, especially Constantinople and Egypt. The special
      treatment and training of Janissaries (infantry), and Sipahis (cavalry) would be relevant, as would
      the military achievements of Suleiman the Magnificent.

      For (b) candidates could consider some of the following: the nature of overall rule of the Ottoman
      Empire; how different conquered states were governed; the treatment of both Ottomans and
      captured people; finance; administration; law; religion; culture. The Ottoman Empire in the period
      1281–1566 reached its peak during the rule of Suleiman the Magnificent (1520–1566), especially
      noted for his lawmaking, administrative measures and magnificent court.

      Do not expect or demand all the above but reward well-supported and balanced answers.

      If only one element is addressed, mark out of a maximum of [12 marks].

21.   In what ways, and with what results, did Renaissance art or architecture affect society and
      government in Italy?

      This is a wide and open-ended question which should give candidates an opportunity to use
      knowledge gained from their study of the Renaissance. The points listed below offer some
      suggestions of what could be appropriate for answers to this question. Most would apply to both art
      and architecture, but some might only be relevant for one or the other. Art includes both painting
      and sculpture. This is a history paper so the historic, rather than the artistic importance, must be the
      main focus.

      •   Background to the Renaissance and to the political situation of Italy.
      •   Importance, rivalry, richness, political impact on the Italian cities as a whole.
      •   Individual participation of certain named cities.
      •   The effect on society and government in Italy of the spread of the Renaissance, in relation to art
          or architecture, to other parts of Europe.
      •   Patronage: individuals, religious institutions, governments.
      •   Finance: did society and governments win or lose?
      •   Prestige: how Italian artists and architects affected society and governments.
      •   Public role of Renaissance art and architecture, especially in churches and public buildings.
      •   Renaissance buildings in Italy: did they cause civic pride?

      Mark as a whole, but expect some balance between “ways” and “results”. Also credit specific focus
      on named cities, buildings, artists, etc. It is expected that more than one city state will be
      mentioned, but a very detailed focus on one city could score well.



22.   “A victim of circumstance and an unfairly maligned [criticized] woman.” To what extent do
      you agree with this judgment of Lucretia Borgia?

      Lucretia Borgia (1480–1519) was the beautiful illegitimate daughter of Pope Alexander VI. She
      was also the sister of Cesare Borgia, and both men used her as a political pawn. To further the
      ambitions of them both she was married three times, firstly to Giovanni Sforza in 1493, which was
      annulled to enable her to marry Alfonso of Aragon in 1500. In 1501 she married Alfonso d’Este,
      who became Duke of Ferrara, which enabled her to participate in a rich and brilliant Renaissance
      court. She was able to pursue her interest in the arts and literature and became a sought after
      patron. She also devoted the rest of her life to her children and charity.

      Lucretia Borgia has been called a poisoner and a murderer, with many lurid stories told about her.
      Candidates should be able to separate the facts from fiction.

23.   For what reasons, and to what extent, was either technological advancement or the demand
      for increased trade responsible for overseas travel and exploration between 1400 and 1550?

      The period 1400 to 1550 was a great period for travel and exploration. Candidates are given the
      choice of assessing the responsibility of either technological advancement or the demand for
      increased trade, for the increase in travel and exploration. The question also asks “to what extent”,
      so candidates can also mention other reasons, but they should first focus on their choice of
      technology or trade, and explore that thoroughly.

      Technology could include: a change and increase in shipbuilding with better and safer ships and
      navigation aids; wider knowledge of the world, its oceans and seas, partly though improvements in
      cartography, with accuracy and better production of maps. More accurate compasses were also
      important.

      Mark as a whole but expect balance between “reasons” and “extent”.



24.   Analyse the importance of either Ibn Battuta or Vasco da Gama.

      Ibn Battuta
      Ibn Battuta (c1304–c1377) was a great Muslim traveller. When he was about twenty-one years old
      he travelled from his native city Tangier through Syria to Mecca. He then went to Baghdad,
      Yemen, east Africa, Oman and the Persian Gulf. He continued to Asia Minor, the Caucasus,
      southern Russia, India and China. He returned to the Maghrib, but then visited al-Andalus and the
      Sahara.

      The importance of his travels is that wherever he went he visited the tombs of famous Muslims
      saints and he sought out Muslim scholars, with whom he could exchange ideas in Arabic. He was
      well-received in royal courts, and often honoured by being appointed to the office of qadi. This
      indicated the prestige of Arabic learning especially religious learning, and the widespread use and
      knowledge of the Arabic language.

      Vasco da Gama
      Vasco da Gama (c1469–1524) was a Portuguese navigator and discoverer. He was the first
      European to find a sea route to India. In 1497 he rounded the Cape of Good Hope and sailed up the
      east coast of Africa and across the Indian Ocean to the Malabar Coast. He returned home in 1499
      with a rich cargo of spices. In 1502 he was sent on a punitive expedition to India as Muslim traders
      had attacked a Portuguese settlement at Calicut. He then sailed on to Cochin and returned with
      another rich cargo of spices. In 1524 he was called from retirement to restore Portuguese authority
      in the East, but died in Cochin.

      His importance is as an explorer, reaching India, and breaking the monopoly of Muslim traders in
      the East. He was also important in the development of the spice trade.
