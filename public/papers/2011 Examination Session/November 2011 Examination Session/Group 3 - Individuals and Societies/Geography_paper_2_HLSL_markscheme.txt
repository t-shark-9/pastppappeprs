Optional Theme A — Freshwater – issues and conflicts

1.   (a)   Referring to the diagram, briefly describe two floodplain management
           strategies.                                                        [2+2 marks]

           The diagram provides evidence for several floodplain management strategies,
           including floodplain zoning; construction and maintenance of dykes; maintenance
           of a floodway to channel flood waters away from settlements or valuable land;
           deliberate “set-aside” of floodplain as an area where no development is permitted;
           flood-proofing of buildings. Award [1 mark] for each valid suggestion for a
           management strategy, and a further [1 mark] in each case for further description
           or development. Some reference to the diagram is essential for the awarding of
           the full [4 marks].

     (b)   Explain how human activities on a floodplain can increase the probability of
           flooding.                                                                    [6 marks]

           Answers could refer to two human activities in detail or several in less detail.
           Human activities might include: urbanization, mechanized farming causing soil
           compaction, deforestation, removal of pastureland for arable farming, construction
           of artificial levees, straightening of the channel, removal of wetlands. A simple
           list with no explanation should not be awarded more than [2 marks].

           A list with some explanation should be credited more than [2 marks] where
           appropriate.

     (c)   “Eutrophication is the most damaging agricultural impact on water quality.”
           Discuss this statement.                                                               [10 marks]

           Answers should describe how eutrophication can be caused by farming and how it
           impacts on water quality. It is expected that answers will examine other impacts
           of agriculture on water quality and compare these with the impact of
           eutrophication. This might include the effects of irrigation such as salinization,
           or the accumulation of toxins/pesticides in water bodies as well as increased water
           sediment content due to soil erosion following intense precipitation or exposure
           to wind.

           To access bands E and F, answers should include a clear evaluation of one or
           more agricultural impacts compared to eutrophication.

           Marks should be allocated according to the markbands.
                                                 –4–               N11/3/GEOGR/BP2/ENG/TZ0/XX/M


2.   (a)   Draw a labelled diagram of a hydrograph.                                              [4 marks]

           The hydrograph must include:
           • Labelled axes showing time and discharge [1 mark].
           • Line graph showing discharge [1 mark].

           Any additional features or labels are worth [1 mark] each, up to a maximum
           of [2 marks]:
           • Labelled rainfall
           • Peak discharge
           • Base flow
           • Lag time
           • Rising or falling limb.

     (b)   Explain how hydrographs are used to forecast floods.                                  [6 marks]

           There are many ways in which hydrographs are useful in forecasting floods.
           Answers could mention prediction of flood height and arrival time downstream
           using a study of lag times and stream response records.
           Hydrographs are also used to predict the return period of floods of different sizes
           through the use of hydrograph records over a long period of time.
           They may also be used to predict the extent of flooding and how long it will last.
           At least two of these should be explained to gain [6 marks].
           A strong account of one may compensate for a weaker account of another.

     (c)   “Dams and reservoirs create as many problems as they solve.” Discuss this
           statement with reference to multi-purpose schemes.                        [10 marks]

           At least one example of a multi-purpose scheme should be named and located.
           Solutions might include: the benefits of power generation, water supply,
           irrigation, transport, flood control, recreation and tourism.

           These should be balanced against potential problems that could include: loss of
           land, displacement of population, loss of water through evaporation, silting,
           seismic problems, cost, diseases such as bilharzia, loss of nutrients due to flood
           control, salinization.

           To access bands E and F, candidates should discuss both solutions and problems
           using at least one actual scheme.

           Marks should be allocated according to the markbands.
                                                   –5–              N11/3/GEOGR/BP2/ENG/TZ0/XX/M


Optional Theme B — Oceans and their coastal margins

3.   (a)   Describe the vertical variations in the salinity shown on the graph.                    [4 marks]

           Rapid decrease down to around 500–800 metres [1 mark]. Increases steadily to
           around 2000 metres [1 mark]. Then stays the same/increases very slightly from
           2000–4500 metres [1 mark].
           Award [1 mark] for quantification e.g. uses the salinity figures, or qualification of
           trends e.g. recognizes changes in the rate of decline.

     (b)   (i)    Explain what is meant by “oceanic conveyor belts”.                               [2 marks]

                  Oceanic conveyor belts, or thermohaline circulations (THCs), refer to part
                  of the large-scale ocean circulation [1 mark].
                  Award [1 mark] for mention of either a cause or a pattern e.g. density
                  gradients or the process of wind driven surface currents.

           (ii)   Suggest two reasons why oceanic conveyor belts are important.                [2+2 marks]

                  Candidates may approach this question from the perspective of human
                  importance and/or system importance.
                  Award [1 mark] for identifying a valid reason and a further [1 mark] for
                  extension or exemplification, up to a maximum of [4 marks].

                  Likely responses include:
                  • Moderation of climates [1 mark], so the thermal growing season for
                     agriculture is extended [1 mark].
                  • Importance because they transfer global heat energy and matter (solids,
                     dissolved substances and gases) from latitude to latitude [1 mark]; if the
                     circulation stopped it would cause significant climate change [1 mark].
                  • Currently the conveyer belts reduce temperature differences between
                     basins [1 mark], therefore linking the earth’s oceans as a single global
                     system [1 mark].
                                             –6–               N11/3/GEOGR/BP2/ENG/TZ0/XX/M


(c)   Discuss the effects of El Niño on some coastal margins.                                 [10 marks]

      Candidates would be expected to briefly explain what is meant by El Niño and
      outline its characteristics. Reference should also be made to specific coastal
      margins.

      Answers which provide support by using examples are likely to access the higher
      markbands. The effects may be physical, causing drought, flooding, coral
      bleaching, depletion of fish stocks or impacts on the food chain. These effects
      may be exacerbated by human activities such as the overfishing of anchovies in
      Peru. Drought may also cause people to take advantage of an opportunity to burn
      forests causing the smoke haze that affected south east Asia in 1997 or resulted in
      the decimation of game animals in coastal southern Africa in 1992. It is possible
      that candidates may suggest an increase in frequency and/or severity of El Niño
      events due to global warming. El Niño may be connected to increased tropical
      storm damage and the damage to sea kelp in California, for example.

      Strong answers will additionally look at positive impacts – the desert bloom in
      Peru, increased rainfall in arid areas and germination of plants, for example, in the
      Panamian rainforests. It is acceptable to use one case study, which can be at any
      scale. Varied approaches are acceptable.

      To access bands E and F, the discussion should explore different perspectives
      e.g. human/physical, positive/negative, short term/long term.

      Marks should be allocated according to the markbands.
                                                   –7–              N11/3/GEOGR/BP2/ENG/TZ0/XX/M


4.   (a)   Using map evidence, describe the effects of deposition in Area A.                      [4 marks]

           The most obvious signs of deposition in Area A are the two beaches [1 mark], one
           on either side of the airport. Each beach is about 1.5 km long [1 mark] and about
           0.25–0.5 km wide [1 mark]. The beach to the east is wider than the beach to the
           west [1 mark]. It is possible that the entire neck of the peninsula (where the
           airport is built) is the depositional feature known as a tombolo [1 mark], joining a
           former island to the mainland. There are also small areas of deposition in
           square 77/23.

           Award [1 mark] for using the term “beach” and an additional [1 mark] for each
           additional point made about them, or for further development of an idea.

           Accept any other valid suggestion about deposition in Area A, provided that there
           is some map evidence to support it.

     (b)   Using map evidence, explain one likely conflict between types of human
           activity in:

           Most conflicts are likely to concern competition for land use.

           (i)    Area A,
                  • Airport/local residents
                  • Airport/agriculture.

           (ii)   Area B.                                                                     [2×3 marks]
                  • Ferry traffic/fishing/recreational boaters (ferry vehicle route shown)
                  • Tourism/local interests/land uses
                  • Lifeboat station/prevention of other developments in the area.

                  Award up to [3 marks] for each conflict that uses map evidence (names or
                  grid references), is well explained and shows how two land uses are
                  incompatible.
                                           –8–                N11/3/GEOGR/BP2/ENG/TZ0/XX/M


(c)   Examine the sources and impacts of waste disposal in oceans.                      [10 marks]

      Sources may include:
      • Agriculture in the form of pesticides and fertilizers
      • Industrial waste, especially heavy metals (e.g. Minimata mercury poisoning in
        Japan)
      • Raw sewage from urban/residential developments
      • Radioactive waste from power stations or the impacts of warm water as a
        by-product
      • Disposal of oil waste from tankers
      • Ship wastes including plastics.

      Impacts may include:
      • Eutrophication and algal blooms from fertilizers
      • Bleaching of reefs from increased temperatures
      • Damage to marine life from heavy metals or radioactive waste
      • Changes to water clarity and turbidity from shipping and industry
      • The impacts of oil waste on marine life and the littoral zone may also be
        considered.

      To access bands E and F, answers should examine at least two sources and
      impacts, though do not always expect a balance.

      Marks should be allocated according to the markbands.

Optional Theme C — Extreme environments

5.   (a)   (i)     Name the landform in the background of the photograph.                          [1 mark]

                   Barchan dune or sand dunes or erg (also accept sand sea) [1 mark].

           (ii)    State two processes of wind transport found in areas such as this.              [2 marks]

                   Responses should identify two of the following processes: suspension,
                   saltation, rolling/traction of sediments.

           (iii)   State the direction from which the wind normally blows.                         [1 mark]

                   East.

     (b)   Explain the occurrence of flash floods in areas like the one shown in the
           photograph.                                                               [6 marks]

           Rainfall intensity [1 mark] exceeds infiltration capacity [1 mark] generating
           surface runoff/overland flow/flooding [1 mark].

           Award additional marks for extra detail of the processes and/or the factors
           promoting them in an arid environment e.g. summer convection rainfall;
           unvegetated desert surfaces thus less interception and infiltration; concentrations
           of water in wadis, gullies or channels; presence of desert crusts and other barriers
           to infiltration.

     (c)   “The opportunities for tourism outweigh the challenges.”              Discuss this
           statement with reference to one extreme environment.                                   [10 marks]

           Answers should examine both opportunities and challenges for tourism in either
           “cold and high altitude environments” or “hot, arid environments”.

           In desert regions the opportunities may focus on scenery (dunes, salt flats, canyon
           lands), indigenous culture and outdoor pursuits, for example.

           Challenges may include extremes of temperature, accessibility, water shortages
           and a lack of resources to sustain tourism.

           In cold or high altitude regions opportunities may focus on skiing and other
           outdoor activities, scenery and the indigenous people who inhabit such regions.
           The challenges may include remoteness, power supply, access and the mitigation
           of natural hazards such as landslides and avalanches.

           While examples are not a specific requirement of the question, those answers that
           provide supporting examples are likely to access the higher markbands. At least
           two opportunities and challenges should be given for the chosen environment but
           the marks need not be allocated equally. For band E and above a clear conclusion
           is expected.

           Marks should be allocated according to the markbands.
                                                 – 10 –            N11/3/GEOGR/BP2/ENG/TZ0/XX/M


6.   (a)   (i)    Define glacial environment.                                                    [2 marks]

                  Definitions may include any two of the following, [1 mark] each:
                  • Area covered with snow and ice
                  • Permanent/long term basis
                  • Area where glacial processes are operating
                  • Different scales include ice sheet, ice caps, glaciers.

           (ii)   Define periglacial environment.                                                [2 marks]

                  Definitions may include any of the following, up to a maximum of
                  [2 marks]:
                  • A region with widespread permafrost (permanently frozen) [1 mark].
                  • Without ice cover or an area on the edge of areas permanently covered by
                     ice/glaciers [1 mark].
                  • Distinctive periglacial processes and/or landforms [1 mark].
                  • May have categories – continuous, discontinuous, sporadic [1 mark].

     (b)   Explain how and why glaciers retreat.                                             [3+3 marks]

           Glaciers retreat when the ablation of ice [1 mark] exceeds [1 mark] the
           accumulation of snow and ice [1 mark].

           Possible reasons include: climate change, which may be attributed to natural or
           human causes; volcanic activity; changes in the tilt or orbit of the earth; sunspot
           activity; cosmic rays and changes in the position of the land masses (tectonics).

           Award [1 mark] for each point made up to a maximum of [3 marks].
           A list of points with no elaboration should only receive [1 mark].

           Other valid reasons may be cited.
                                            – 11 –            N11/3/GEOGR/BP2/ENG/TZ0/XX/M


(c)   “Periglacial areas offer more opportunities for human activity than glacial
      areas.” Discuss this statement.                                             [10 marks]

      Periglacial areas, due to the lack of permanent ice, may offer opportunities for the
      extraction of minerals, and this is arguably being accelerated by climate change.
      They also offer opportunities for indigenous people (Inuit) who may herd reindeer
      in response to the seasonal climatic regime of freezing and thawing. Glacial areas
      also have opportunities. The opportunities may include tourism, outdoor pursuits,
      areas of outstanding natural beauty which are designated as parks, reserves of
      water and the generation of HEP.

      Some candidates may choose to explore the net opportunities of each environment
      (looking at how opportunities outweigh challenges). This approach is equally
      valid.

      Challenges may include the possibility of glacial surges, avalanches, landslides,
      road instability and flooding from glacial melt. While examples are not a specific
      requirement of the question, those answers that provide supporting examples are
      likely to access the higher markbands. Responses including explicit discussion of
      the statement are likely to be credited at bands E/F. It is likely that most
      responses will conclude by disagreeing with the statement but this is by no means
      the only possible conclusion. All responses should be judged strictly on their own
      merits.

      Marks should be allocated according to the markbands.

Optional Theme D — Hazards and disasters – risk assessment and response

7.   (a)   Identify two of the hazards shown and explain your choice.                       [2+2 marks]

           A – earthquake – quakes last for seconds/minutes and affect a small area.
           B – accept: either volcano – lasts for days to months; ash can affect a wide area
                        or hurricane/typhoon/cyclone – lasts for days – affects a wide area.
           C – drought – lasts for months/years – affects a very large area.
           Accept any other valid examples and explanations. The selection of a hazard not
           specifically named in the syllabus is likely to be self-limiting and requires no
           special action on the part of the examiner.
           Allow [1+1 marks] for identification of the hazards and [1+1 marks] for
           justifications.

     (b)   Analyse the global distribution of one of the hazards you identified in
           part (a).                                                               [6 marks]

           The chosen hazard should be clearly stated. A global scale must be used in the
           analysis. Award [2 marks] for the description of the global pattern of the hazard
           and [4 marks] for the explanation of the distribution, with reasons for any
           variations in the pattern.

     (c)   Using examples, evaluate the success of adjustment and response strategies
           for a named hazard type.                                                   [10 marks]

           The named hazard should be clearly stated. Relevant adjustment strategies may
           include modifying the hazard or changing the loss potential through building
           design, warning systems or land-use planning. In addition, adjustments to the loss
           may be included in terms of spreading losses, planning for loss or simply bearing
           the loss. Not all of these need be included in a good answer. Response strategies
           could include short-term rescue, shelter and aid, medium-term restoration of
           infrastructure and long-term reconstruction and rehabilitation.

           The strongest answers will refer to examples of strategies used before and after
           actual hazard events. Answers that do not use examples or that simply describe
           relevant strategies should not move above band D. To access bands E and F, at
           least one adjustment and one response strategy should be evaluated.

           Marks should be allocated according to the markbands.

8.   (a)   Outline the methods used to describe the magnitude (strength) of two
           hazard types.                                                      [2+2 marks]

           The most likely types selected will be earthquakes (Richter or Mercalli scale),
           volcanoes (VEI scale) and hurricanes/cyclones/typhoons (Saffir-Simpson scale).
           In each case allow [1 mark] for naming the relevant scale and [1 mark] for a brief
           description. Responses that refer to hazards not in the syllabus, such as tornadoes,
           but that outline the relevant scale, should be credited.

     (b)   Suggest three reasons why some people continue to live in places with a
           known hazard risk.                                                    [3×2 marks]

           Award [1 mark] for each reason stated (e.g. soil quality, poverty, lack of
           knowledge, historical inertia) and [1 mark] for an extended explanation or detail
           of the hazard risk.

     (c)   “Economic factors and not physical factors determine the severity of the
           impacts of hurricanes (typhoons, cyclones).” Discuss this statement using
           examples.                                                                 [10 marks]

           A number of approaches are possible but most answers will refer to the
           contrasting effects of hurricanes on countries with contrasting levels of
           development. It is important that the answer refers to physical factors such as the
           strength of the hurricane, the size of the storm surge or the landscape of the area
           affected, as well as economic factors that may determine levels of preparation and
           protection, warning systems, evacuation, aid and recovery responses.

           The strongest answers that access bands E and F should focus on at least two
           hurricane events and balance the relative importance of these factors in assessing
           the severity of the impact in terms of loss of life, environmental damage and loss
           of property (economic cost).

           Answers that simply describe the impacts, or just describe physical and economic
           factors without discussing their relative importance, should not move above
           band D.

           Similarly, answers that do not refer to examples should not be able to access
           bands E and F.

           Marks should be allocated according to the markbands.

Optional Theme E — Leisure, sport and tourism

9.   (a)   Describe the pattern of birth places in 1990 and how it has changed by 2010. [2+2 marks]

           In 1990, the focus is UK and Europe [1 mark] with an additional [1 mark] for
           quantification, clarification or elaboration.
           There is a wider geographical distribution in 2010 than in 1990 [1 mark].
           Award [1 mark] for quantification, clarification or elaboration e.g. North America
           had no players in 1990 but now has several.

           Answers that attempt to list specific changes rather than describing patterns
           should be limited to [2 marks].

     (b)   Suggest three possible reasons why the sphere of influence of this league’s
           supporters has grown in size since 1990.                                  [3×2 marks]

           The answer requires three separate, valid reasons. Possible answers include:
           • Growth in popularity
           • Increased advertising and marketing in new areas
           • Increased exposure in different media
           • Increased wealth and development allow for growth of new markets
           • Impact of globalization
           • Impact of global competitions sparking interest
           • Greater population mobility.

           Each valid reason should be credited [1 mark] with an additional [1 mark] for
           saying how the factor has altered the sphere of influence.

(c)   “Local people do not benefit from hosting an international sporting event.”
      Discuss this statement.                                                     [10 marks]

      Reasons to agree with the statement include:
      • Organization of events is usually done at national or international level
        therefore some leakage can occur. Multinational investment and sponsorship
        prevents the needs of local people being met.
      • Likely increase in local problems – traffic, house prices etc.
      • Effects are short term and interest in local issues wanes after event.

      Reasons to disagree with the statement include:
      • Legacy of investment in infrastructure and amenities for use by the community
      • Employment provided
      • Inward investment
      • Requirements for sustainable development are more likely to be met.

      While examples are not a specific requirement of the question, those answers that
      provide supporting examples are likely to access the higher markbands.

      To access bands E and F, responses should present a balanced discussion that
      consider both reasons to agree and disagree with the statement and may realize
      that some benefits are not always clear cut and have a temporal aspect – short
      term/long term.

      Marks should be allocated according to the markbands.

10.   (a)   Describe the changes in international tourist arrivals shown in the graph.    [4 marks]

            Overall, the numbers have fallen over time [1 mark].

            There is some growth until July 2008, [1 mark] then figures decline sharply
            [1 mark].

            Award additional marks for any of the following:
            • Some attempt at quantification
            • Noting that highest growth is in February 2008
            • Noting that April 2008 is an anomaly with greatly reduced growth
            • Biggest decrease is in March 2009, or other valid points.

      (b)   Explain three reasons why international tourist arrivals can change in one
            named rural or urban location.                                           [3×2 marks]

            Possible reasons for a decrease include:
            • Security concerns
            • Rise of alternative attractions
            • Stagnation or decline phase of Butler’s model
            • Decline in investment
            • Environmental decline or hazard
            • Pandemics
            • Adverse exchange rates.

            Possible reasons for an increase include:
            • Media
            • New facilities
            • New investment
            • Government policies
            • Loss of alternate destinations
            • Favourable exchange rates.

            [1 mark] should be awarded for each basic reason stated and [1 mark] for
            additional explanation, clarification or elaboration.

(c)   “Most recreational and sports facilities in urban areas are located near the
      city centre.” Discuss this statement.                                        [10 marks]

      There are many possible approaches to this question and the candidate’s argument
      and conclusion are likely to depend on the examples chosen for discussion.

      In many cities, facilities for recreational activities (such as swimming pools and
      gyms for fitness training, for example) tend to be well developed in the
      city centre.

      Facilities for spectator sports may depend on the age of the stadium.
      Older stadiums tend to be nearer the city centre (and therefore often experience
      traffic problems) than newer stadiums, which tend to be built on larger, less
      expensive sites, situated near the edge of the city, and close to inter-city or
      international communication links.

      Participatory sports facilities such as tennis courts, golf courses and sports fields
      tend to reflect the distribution of residential areas, and are often absent from
      industrial or commercial zones.

      It is not necessary to discuss the complete range of recreational and sports
      facilities, provided that enough variety is considered for some realistic
      conclusions to be reached.

      It is expected that answers reaching bands E and F will offer supporting evidence
      and/or exemplification before arriving at a clear conclusion to the question.

      Marks should be allocated according to the markbands.

Optional Theme F — The geography of food and health

11.   (a)   (i)    State one other indicator besides infection rates which could be used to
                   map the health of people in this city.                                         [1 mark]

                   Award [1 mark] for any valid indicator that might produce a spatial pattern.
                   Possible answers include the number of people per doctor (or per
                   clinic/hospital) in each zone; life expectancy or infant mortality rate in
                   different districts. Accept other valid responses.

            (ii)   Referring to the map, describe the pattern of this disease in the city.        [3 marks]

                   This disease is concentrated in the north-eastern sector of the city
                   (Gajrawadi, Fatepura, City and Panigate) [1 mark]. Rates are low in the
                   west of the city (Belbaug, Subhanpura and Sayajigunj) [1 mark]. Some
                   responses may also identify the mid-range concentration forming a north-
                   south belt (Raopura, Shiyabaug and Sindhvaimata Road). Award up to
                   [2 marks] for the recognition of the general pattern with [1 mark] reserved
                   for specific reference to the map.

      (b)   Explain three possible reasons, one environmental, one social and one
            economic, for this pattern.                                         [3×2 marks]

            Examples of possible reasons include:
            Environmental: high rate areas may be at lower altitude, where water collects, or
            may be on unstable ground where water pipes frequently rupture, contaminating
            the water supply.
            Social: people living in overcrowded conditions may be more likely to share
            contaminated water sources and catch the disease; different ethnic groups may
            have differing views about drinking untreated water.
            Economic: people living in high-rate areas may be less affluent, and therefore
            unable to afford preventative measures such as water purification or vaccination,
            and may have to work even during an epidemic, increasing their chances of
            catching the disease.

            Award [1 mark] for each valid reason, and a further [1 mark] in each case for any
            valid development or detail.

(c)   “Poverty is the main cause of food insecurity.” Discuss this statement.                [10 marks]

      Answers are expected to consider both sides of this question. Poverty may cause
      or exacerbate food insecurity because families in poverty may be unable to afford
      food even though supplies are (physically) available. Poverty makes it unlikely
      that families can retain a reserve of food to tide them over bad times, or guarantee
      them seeds for planting the following year. On the other hand, food insecurity
      may also be caused by natural hazards, such as droughts, reducing food
      availability, or by earthquakes and hurricanes disrupting food supply chains and
      normal distribution channels. Food insecurity may also result from wars,
      conflicts, and from external forces such as the actions of NGOs and effects of
      government subsidies.

      While it is likely that most responses will conclude by agreeing with the
      statement, this is by no means the only possible conclusion. All responses should
      be judged strictly on their own merits.

      Responses that discuss both sides of the question and arrive at a conclusion in line
      with the evidence selected are likely to be credited at bands E/F.

      Marks should be allocated according to the markbands.

12.   (a)   (i)    State the year when the index of total food production was greatest.             [1 mark]

                   Accept either 1996 or 1997 [1 mark].

            (ii)   State the value of the food index per person in 1970.                            [1 mark]

                   Accept any answer in range 140–150 inclusive [1 mark].

      (b)   Describe the trend in total food production shown on the graph.                         [2 marks]

            Total food production is rising [1 mark] with another [1 mark] for quantification
            or recognition of any anomaly.

      (c)   Suggest reasons for the trends in total food production and in food
            production per person from 1962 to 2010.                            [6 marks]

            Award [1 mark] for a brief description of each valid reason, and a further
            [1 mark] for developing it by means of example, explanation or detail. Both total
            food production and food production per person must be covered, though not
            necessarily in equal depth for the awarding of the full [6 marks].

            Possible reasons for the increase in total food production include: a greater area of
            land under cultivation due to land improvement (drainage, irrigation) or land
            clearance; higher crop yields due to better agricultural techniques; the application
            of fertilizers, biotechnology or improved seeds; higher productivity due to
            effective pest control measures or application of improved technology.
            The main reason for the decline in food production per person is an increase in
            population, which in turn may be due to either natural increase or in-migration.

            Some answers may refer to the anomalies. This is also acceptable, but reasons for
            anomalies such as natural hazards, wars and plagues, should not receive more
            than [2 marks] out of the total [6 marks] available.

(d)   Examine the geographic connections between food availability and health.               [10 marks]

      There are many links between food availability and health. Health is generally
      better in areas of higher food availability: vitamin and calorie-deficiency diseases
      would be less likely; immune systems would be more robust; recovery from
      disease faster. On the other hand, too much food being available can lead to other
      health issues related to being overweight or obese. Greater food availability is
      often linked to economic development. Assuming this link is made explicit,
      responses may legitimately include reference to related aspects such as improved
      medical care, vaccinations and preventative measures.

      Some responses may subdivide food availability into different categories, such as
      economic food availability and physical food availability. However, this is not
      necessary for the awarding of full marks.

      To reach bands E and F, responses should look at health issues in relation to
      shortage and excess food availability.

      Marks should be allocated according to the markbands.

Optional Theme G — Urban environments

13.   (a)   Describe the pattern of deprivation shown on the map.                                     [3 marks]

            Points made for [1 mark] each could include:
            The two largest areas of “most deprived” (category 5) is south of Eastside and
            Grandview, stretching as far as the north arm of the Fraser River. The northern
            part of this area (Eastside) borders the CBD. The largest areas of “least deprived”
            (category 1) are Westend, Kitsilano and Shaughnessey. Parts of North
            Vancouver, Edmonds and Richmond also stand out as having relatively little
            deprivation (category 2). In general, despite exceptions, areas towards the edge of
            the city tend to be less deprived than areas in the centre of the map.

            Award [1 mark] for each valid point. Some place names must be included for the
            awarding of the full [3 marks].

      (b)   Explain how and why the pattern of deprivation might differ for a city in a
            low income country.                                                       [2+5 marks]

            Responses are expected to compare patterns of deprivation found in a city that is
            less developed than Vancouver, Canada. Accept any reasonable interpretation,
            including NICs.

            Responses should clearly include an explanation of how the pattern would differ
            for a maximum of [2 marks]. The most likely responses include:
            • Least deprived areas are more likely to be found in central areas, and more
               deprived areas nearer the urban fringe (reversal) [1 mark].
            • Transport lines could lead to the formation of linear belts of deprivation
               [1 mark].
            • It may be less easy to identify a pattern – more likely to respond to local factors
               than comply to a pattern e.g. slums also in / around CBD [1 mark].

            Candidates are expected to offer at least two developed explanations for the
            differences identified, up to a maximum of [3 marks] for any one idea, although a
            wider range of shorter explanations is also acceptable. Reasons why the pattern
            may differ include:
            • Centripetal forces attract population to the city in contrast to the centrifugal
               forces in most cities in rich countries – levels of deprivation are therefore likely
               to be higher.
            • Land available for housing development by growing population is found at
               urban fringe (where claims to ownership may not have been formally
               expressed).
            • Poor transport infrastructure means land close to the commercial centre is
               valued highly by high-income groups meaning that less deprivation is found
               there.
            • Lack of planning and governance leads to a more informal and pragmatic
               approach to development, making it harder to identify overall patterns.

            An annotated sketch map may substitute for text.

(c)   Evaluate one or more sustainable strategies designed to improve life in urban
      areas.                                                                        [10 marks]

      The sustainable strategy chosen is likely to be one that addresses either a social
      issue (housing quality), environmental issue (air, water, land resources) or overall
      city growth (and in-migration) – in ways that seek to maintain and improve the
      quality of life for current and future urban dwellers.

      Responses should go beyond mere description of a management strategy.
      Answers should provide effective evaluation, addressing both positive and
      negative aspects of the strategy, the problems encountered and some conclusion
      on the success of the scheme. Answers that do all of this will access bands E/F.

      Answers that evaluate an urban management strategy that is not explicitly
      sustainable (does not mention future generations or ecological footprints etc.)
      should be limited to band D.

14.   (a)   Identify two possible additional inputs and two possible additional outputs for
            the linear system.                                                              [4 marks]

            Inputs: water, land, timber, food. [1 mark] for each. Do not credit “resources”.

            Outputs: sewage / water waste, water pollution, industrial waste. [1 mark] for
            each. Do not credit “waste”.

            Accept other valid suggestions.

      (b)   Explain why the circular system has a reduced urban ecological footprint.           [6 marks]

            Credit understanding of “urban ecological footprint”, defined as the amount of
            land required [1 mark] to provide the resources the city needs [1 mark] and to
            dispose of waste produced by residents and businesses of the urban area [1 mark].

            Specific ways of achieving this include:
            • Circular system has reduced inputs and outputs, thus requiring less land to
              provide resources and to dispose of or mitigate waste products.
            • Less energy is required to transport resources and waste materials.
            • Increased recycling allows for reduction in both inputs and outputs.

            There may be other valid responses.

(c)   Examine the dominant population movements and their consequences for
      one or more urban areas.                                             [10 marks]

      Dominant population movements are likely to be either centrifugal or centripetal.
      These have a range of impacts on land use patterns and social, economic and
      environmental conditions in cities.

      Centrifugal (moving out): suburbanization and counter-urbanization may cause
      increased urban sprawl and consumption of surrounding fertile land, increased
      journey times and therefore traffic congestion and associated pollution. The
      associated spiral of decline in central urban areas may be discussed – lack of
      investment in the physical environment including housing stock, loss of retail
      activity to meet customer location, in-migration of minority groups, increased
      unemployment and crime.

      Centripetal (movement into the city and re-urbanization): caused by the “gravity”
      of the city. Consequences include rapidly increasing population and therefore
      demands for housing, services and resources including water. Housing needs met
      by unplanned settlement and overcrowding of existing housing stock. Pressure on
      services such as water, health, refuse disposal and education increases, leading to
      significant unmet demand. Despite these factors, migrants may experience
      increased opportunity and standard of living leading to permanence.

      Responses could either focus on only one movement and its consequences or
      could contrast movements in different locations. Answers should refer to at least
      one specific example.

      Responses that describe the dominant movement(s) and discuss a range of
      associated consequences are likely to reach bands E/F.
