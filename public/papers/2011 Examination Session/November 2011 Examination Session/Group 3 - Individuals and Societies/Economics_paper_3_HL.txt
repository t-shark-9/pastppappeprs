                                                         Taxes on cigarettes

           Lawmakers in the state of West Virginia in the United States are proposing an increase in the
            state tax on cigarettes from US$0.55 to US$1.20 per pack.

           One justification for the increase in the cigarette tax is that cigarettes are a demerit good.
            Smoking can cause premature deaths, and it leads to negative externalities in the form of
            additional health care costs and health hazards for non-smokers. It is estimated that the tax
            increase may prevent 6600 smoking-related deaths, and stop 13 200 children from becoming
            smokers. Some anti-smoking groups claim that increasing cigarette taxes is the most effective
            smoking prevention measure.

           Other groups claim that the largest impact on smoking prevention is made by anti-smoking
            advertising on television and by programmes to help smokers quit. Cigarettes tend to have a
            lower price elasticity of demand (PED) than most other goods and services. Each 10 % increase
            in the price of cigarettes results in a 6.5 % drop in youth smoking, a 2 % drop in adult smoking,
            and a 4 % total drop. This means that the increase in the tax may not contribute significantly to
            smoking prevention, although it does generate large increases in tax revenues for the government.
            It is expected that the proposed increase in the cigarette tax will more than double annual
            cigarette tax revenues.

           Also, the effectiveness of the tax as a smoking prevention measure may be lessened by the
            availability of cheaper cigarettes in states that are close to West Virginia that have lower
            cigarette taxes, such as Kentucky.

           It is further argued that indirect taxes such as those on cigarettes are regressive taxes,
            and impact more strongly on lower income people. Since lower income people also tend to
            smoke more, they are even more strongly hit by the cigarette tax.

                                            Anti-monopoly legislation in China

            In August 2008, the Chinese government passed an anti-monopoly law. As China is
             a transition economy, many foreign economists welcomed this law on the grounds that
             it might encourage China’s transition to a free market economy.

            This law is being applied in the area of acquisitions (or the purchase) of one firm
             by another, the objective being to prevent the establishment of very large firms that would
             limit competition. In the six months since the law was passed, the commerce ministry had
             decided on 25 such cases. All were approved except one: the commerce ministry rejected
             Coca-Cola’s application to buy Huiyuan, China’s largest juice company.

            Coca-Cola offered to buy Huiyuan at a price (US$2.4 billion) estimated to be three times
             the Chinese firm’s value. This purchase would have represented a type of foreign direct
             investment (FDI) in which a foreign firm acquires control of a domestic firm. Coca-Cola
             already holds about half the Chinese market for carbonated drinks, but the juice market is
             far less dominated by a single large firm. If the purchase had gone ahead, Coca-Cola together
             with Huiyuan would control just over 20 % of the juice market.

            The rejection of the acquisition came as a surprise to many who expected the deal
             to go through. Coca-Cola had offered a very high price, and it has made major investments
             in China, making it one of the most attractive buyers of local firms. Many economists
             wondered if this was a government attempt to prevent a popular local brand from falling into
             foreign ownership.

            The Chinese authorities argue that the rejection of the acquisition was based on possible
             negative impacts on domestic competition. The acquisition would have concentrated
             too much power in one firm. Coca-Cola’s brand name would make it difficult for new
             firms to enter the juice market because of brand loyalty that acts as a barrier to entry.
             Coca-Cola’s economies of scale and dominant position in the market would hurt small
             competitors and prevent entry of new firms, while consumers would face higher prices and
             less choice as a result of Coca-Cola’s monopoly power.

                                                  The Brazilian economy

           In the final quarter of 2008, the Brazilian economy went into recession, although this
            did not last long. This was partly due to Brazil’s ability to follow an expansionary
            fiscal policy, it was also due to the central bank’s policy of lower interest rates. In the past,
            Brazil used to raise interest rates in times of recession in order to avoid capital flight.

           Positive economic growth has resumed, and the economic expansion is leading economists to
            expect the central bank to raise interest rates again.

           At the same time, the real (Brazil’s currency) has strengthened, contributing to a widening
            current account deficit, and leading to complaints from exporters and local manufacturers.
            There are expectations that the government may try to manage the exchange rate
            in order to avoid a further appreciation of the real. On the other hand, a strong real
            provides the benefits of lower inflation and cheaper imported capital goods.

                       Thai farmers and the Thailand-China free trade agreement (FTA)

           In 2003, Thailand and China entered into a free trade agreement (FTA) on farm products,
            in which they agreed to eliminate all tariffs for 188 types of fruits and vegetables.

           According to non-governmental organizations (NGOs), farmers’ groups and academics,
            Thai farmers have been negatively affected by the FTA. Many farmers lost their only
            source of income because they could no longer compete with cheaper Chinese imports.
            For example, whereas Thai production costs for garlic average 21 baht (Thai currency)
            per kilogram, Chinese garlic costs only 10 baht. As a result, Thai production of garlic fell.

           While the government had promised compensation to garlic farmers, the compensation
            actually paid was very small compared to the losses of the garlic farmers. Many had
            difficulties switching to other crops, because the soil and weather conditions of garlic-growing
            areas were not so suited to other crops. Many small farmers went out of business, while the
            benefits of the FTA went to large commercial farmers who were better able to compete with
            cheaper imports.

           Garlic is an important ingredient in Thai cuisine. Consumers and health groups complain
            that Thai garlic has a better taste and more medicinal properties than Chinese garlic.
            Yet Thai garlic is now more difficult to find and consumers, as a result, have less choice.
            There is also concern about safety standards, as some Chinese farm products have high
            levels of pesticide residues.

           Recently, farmers’ protests led the government to promise a minimum price on garlic to
            support local production.

           Supporters of the FTA argue that this is important in order to allow countries to specialize
            in production according to their comparative advantage. Free trade, they claim, allows
            consumers to obtain higher quality goods at lower prices, and allows overall output
            to increase. Some negative consequences for less competitive producers are inevitable.
            For this reason, the government should provide support and training for those who
            are affected, including efforts to improve agricultural practices that are consistent with
            sustainable development.

5.       Study the extract and data below and answer the questions that follow.


                                 As trade slows, China rethinks its growth strategy

           Ships are leaving Chinese ports half empty. In the Guangdong province, many factories are
            shutting down without paying employees.

           This is the effect of millions of Americans cutting down on their spending. Chinese
            exports decreased by 9.6 % in one month. A drastic decrease in export revenues is
            a major problem in a country that has relied for many years on exports to pursue its
            growth and economic development goals.

           For the Chinese economy to rely more on domestic demand instead of export demand
            is not easy. Chinese families are forced to save a lot and do not spend much on consumer goods
            and services. They need to save a lot to be able to meet any medical emergencies and to help
            them in retirement as the government does not currently provide the general population with
            health care insurance and pensions.

           To prevent a further increase in unemployment the Chinese government is forced to help
            increase the exports of low-skill, labour-intensive industries such as textiles. “China will resort
            to export subsidies to help the export of labour-intensive industries,” the minister of industry
            and information technology said. Increased subsidies by China have the potential to create
            trade difficulties with the United States (US), particularly regarding textiles, only weeks before
            American quotas on the import of Chinese clothing are about to expire.
