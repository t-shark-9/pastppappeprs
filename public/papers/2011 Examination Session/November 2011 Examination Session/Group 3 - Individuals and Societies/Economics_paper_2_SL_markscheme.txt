                       time.
                       (An alternative may be – economic growth is usually measured as

(b)   Using an appropriate diagram, explain the type of unemployment that a
      “weak” economy and reduced investment are expected to create
      (paragraph ).                                                                 [4 marks]

       1   Identification of appropriate theory                                          1–2
           For drawing a correctly labelled AD/AS diagram illustrating
           cyclical/demand deficient unemployment or providing an explanation
           that a weak economy and reduced investment imply lower aggregate
           demand and decrease the demand for labour.

       2   Correct application of appropriate theory                                     3–4
           For drawing a correctly labelled AD/AS diagram illustrating
           cyclical/demand deficient unemployment and providing an explanation
           that a weak economy and reduced investment imply lower aggregate
           demand and decrease the demand for labour.

      Candidates who incorrectly label diagrams can be rewarded with a maximum of
      [3 marks].

      For AD/AS, the vertical axis may be price level, average price level, or
      inflation. The horizontal axis may be output, national output, real national
      output, national income (Y), or GDP. Any appropriate abbreviations, such as
      APL, CPI, RNO, or RNY are allowable. A title is not necessary.

      Candidates may draw a labour market diagram showing a wage above the
      equilibrium wage and explaining that at this wage, the supply of labour
      exceeds the demand for labour. If correctly labelled, this should be fully
      rewarded.

(c)   Using an appropriate diagram, explain how a stronger than expected
      exchange rate might affect aggregate demand in New Zealand
      (paragraph ).                                                                 [4 marks]

       1   Identification of appropriate theory                                          1–2
           For drawing a correctly labelled AD/AS diagram illustrating a shift of
           AD to the left or for explaining that a stronger exchange rate implies
           more expensive exports and cheaper imports and thus eventually a
           decrease in net exports (a component of AD) for New Zealand.

       2   Correct application of appropriate theory                                     3–4
           For drawing a correctly labelled AD/AS diagram illustrating a shift of
           AD to the left and for explaining that a stronger exchange rate implies
           more expensive exports and cheaper imports and thus eventually a

(d)   Using information from the text/data and your knowledge of economics,
      evaluate the likely effects of “the large decline in the official interest rate”
      together with the fiscal stimulus on the New Zealand economy
      (paragraph ).                                                                     [8 marks]

      Responses may include:
      • lower interest rates imply easier or looser monetary policy aiming at
        increasing aggregate demand and thus reflating an economy in recession
      • lower interest rates are expected to increase spending by households on
        durables (such as cars and appliances)
      • lower interest rates may not result in anticipated increases in household
        consumption if households use lower interest repayments to increase
        mortgage repayments
      • lower interest rates are expected to boost the housing market
      • lower interest rates are expected to increase spending on capital goods by
        firms (paragraph )
      • lower interest rates are expected to lower (depreciate) the New Zealand
        dollar making exports cheaper abroad and imports less attractive and thus
        increasing net exports (paragraphs  and )
      • fiscal stimulus includes increased levels of government spending and/or
        lower taxes (paragraph )
      • an increase in growth affects AD directly
      • lower taxes affect AD indirectly (increased disposable income / after tax
        profits)
      • low business sentiment (paragraph ) suggests that firms are not very
        optimistic so any increase in disposable income is perhaps not expected to
        be spent and firms may thus not decide to expand their capacity
      • it will take some time for economic activity to return to healthy levels, due
        to lags and low consumer and/or investor confidence (paragraph )
      • only in 2010 is growth in New Zealand to become (barely) positive
        (figure 1).

      Effective evaluation may be to:
      • consider short-term versus long-term consequences
      • examine the impact on different stakeholders
      • discuss advantages and disadvantages
      • prioritize the arguments.

      Examiners should be aware that candidates may take a different approach
      which if appropriate, should be rewarded.

      rewarded beyond level 2.

                         An explanation that they are the costs imposed on third parties when a

        negative externalities caused by river pollution in Viotia.                        [8 marks]

        Responses may include:
        • an explanation of indirect taxation as a solution
        • a diagram to illustrate the indirect tax
        • the revenue raised by the tax could be used to pay for cleaning the river
        • indirect taxation would force manufacturers to consider the pollution costs
          they create (paragraph )
        • an explanation of the difficulties involved in measuring the correct size of
          the necessary tax (paragraph )

(d)   Using information from the text/data and your knowledge of economics,
      evaluate China’s export-oriented growth and development strategy.                [8 marks]

      Responses may include:
      • an explanation of export-oriented growth
      • an explanation of development
      • through export-oriented growth China has been able to pursue its growth
        and economic development goals (paragraph )
      • China’s Human Development Index (HDI) has improved dramatically since
        1975 from 0.530 to 0.772 in 2007, (although this may not be due to the
        export-oriented strategy)
      • China’s level of absolute poverty, as measured by the number of people
        living on less than US$1.25 a day has fallen dramatically (Figure 1)
        (although this may not be due to the export-oriented strategy)
      • possible implications for the population of the increase in the value of HDI
        in terms of health care, education and purchasing power
      • realization that the value of HDI may be limited as it is an average value
      • growth and development may be experienced in some areas (urban and
        industrial centres), but not necessarily in rural areas
      • discussion of possible shortcomings of export-oriented growth as a
        development strategy noting that it does not automatically imply
        development and it makes a country dependent on overseas demand:
        and vulnerable to a drastic decrease in export revenues (paragraph )
      • opportunity cost of government subsidies to export industries
      • the development strategy followed by China seems to have left most of the
        population still needing health care, even as absolute poverty fell
        (paragraph ), (Figure 1)
      • export-led growth may generate negative externalities and threaten
        sustainability
      • low wages could be a requirement for export-oriented growth, but there may
        be complaints of exploitation of the labour force and demands for
        protectionism in other countries
      • export led growth can come at the expense of a trading partner, causing
        political problems.

      Effective evaluation may be to:
      • consider short-term versus long-term consequences
      • examine the impact on different stakeholders
      • discuss advantages and disadvantages
      • prioritize the arguments.

(d)   Using information from the text/data and your knowledge of economics,
      evaluate the impact of a falling oil price in Nigeria’s economy.                   [8 marks]

      Responses may include
      • an explanation that Nigeria’s high dependence on production and exports
        of oil have made it extremely vulnerable to a fall in the price of oil
        (paragraph )
      • when the price of oil falls, there are many consequences such as:
        – deterioration in the terms of trade (paragraph )
        – the need to increase exports for a given volume of imports
            (paragraph )
        – reduced export revenues
        – reduced possibilities to finance investments
        – reduced ability to import needed inputs for production
        – depreciation of the currency with impacts on the domestic economy,
            e.g. inflationary pressures as Nigeria heavily depends on support for both
            consumption and production (paragraph )
        – possibility of speculation that worsens the currency depreciation
            (paragraph )
        – reduced growth and development prospects and increasing poverty
        – increasing balance of payments problems
        – possible increasing social unrest
      • an explanation that falls in the price of oil lead to significant drops in
        government revenues, since the government is dependent on oil for 80 % of
        its revenues, making it far more difficult to pursue growth development
        objectives (investments in social services and infrastructure) (paragraph )
      • oil price fluctuations also create uncertainties for private investment and
        consumption, which affect macroeconomic stability, as well as growth and
        development prospects (paragraph )
      • benefits to Nigeria of a falling oil price:
        – reduced externalities (paragraph )
        – reallocates resources and encourages diversification, e.g. expansion of
            the agriculture sector (paragraph )
        – falling currency reduces the price of exports (paragraph ).

      Effective evaluation may be to:
      • consider short-term versus long-term consequences
      • examine the impact on different stakeholders
      • discuss advantages and disadvantages
      • prioritize the arguments.

      Examiners should be aware that candidates may take a different approach
      which if appropriate, should be rewarded.
