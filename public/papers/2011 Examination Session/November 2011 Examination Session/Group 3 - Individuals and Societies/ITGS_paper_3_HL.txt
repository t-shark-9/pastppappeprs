1.    Describe two multimedia features that could be included on Carmen’s web site.          [4 marks]


2.    (a)   Explain how SSL (Secure Socket Layer) and encryption (line 58) are used to
            ensure that confidential data can be sent across the Internet when a customer
            purchases a product from the Foto Creativa web site.                             [6 marks]

      (b)   Sergio has recommended to Carmen that she use open source software instead
            of a commercial web content management system (Web CMS) to develop
            the web site. Analyse the possible consequences of this recommendation
            (lines 60–61, 98).                                                               [8 marks]

      Use information from the case study and give examples of techniques used by the
      companies that you have investigated.                                                 [12 marks]
