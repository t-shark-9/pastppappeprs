                       The idea that the good has a bad effect on society.

                   2   Precise definition                                                            2
                       An explanation that it is a good considered to be harmful
                       to people that would be over-provided by the market and so
                       over-consumed or a good whose consumption creates negative
                       externalities, or a good whose consumption creates costs for third
                       parties, not involved in the purchase or sale of the product.

           (ii)   regressive taxes (paragraph ).                                               [2 marks]

                       An explanation that:
                        they are taxes where marginal tax rates are below average tax rates,
                         or
                        they are taxes where as incomes increases, the tax rate (or fraction
                         of income paid as tax), decreases, or
                        they are taxes which have a greater impact on low income groups
                         because they spend a larger proportion of their income on the
                         consumption of this good/service.

(b)   Calculate the price elasticity of demand (PED) for cigarettes for youths
      and for adults (paragraph ), and explain the significance of the PED
      figures you have calculated.                                                        [4 marks]

            For providing correct calculations of the two PEDs (0.65 for youths
            and 0.2 for adults), or for explaining that the demand for cigarettes is
            inelastic in the case of both youths and adults.

       2    Correct application of appropriate theory                                         3–4
            For providing correct calculations of the two PEDs (0.65 for youths
            and 0.2 for adults), and for explaining that the demand for cigarettes is
            inelastic in the case of both youths and adults.

      For full marks, there needs to be some explanation of “the significance of the
      figures”, such as:
       the difference in the values, i.e. that demand by adults is more inelastic than
         demand by youths, or
       the PED for adults might lower than that for youth, given that the price as a
         fraction of income is lower for adults, or
       the demand for cigarettes is inelastic because of the fact that cigarettes are
         an addictive product.

(c)   Using an appropriate diagram, show how the incidence of tax on cigarettes
      is likely to be shared between producers and consumers of cigarettes.              [4 marks]

       1    Identification of appropriate theory                                             1–2
            For drawing a correctly labelled demand and supply diagram with a
            relatively steep demand curve a shift of the supply curve due to the tax,
            showing the share of the tax paid by firms and the relatively larger share
            paid by consumers, or for an explanation that since demand for cigarettes
            is price inelastic, consumers face a relatively larger tax incidence
            compared to producers.

       2    Correct application of appropriate theory                                        3–4
            For drawing a correctly labelled demand and supply diagram with a
            relatively steep demand curve a shift of the supply curve due to the tax,
            showing the share of the tax paid by firms and the relatively larger share
            paid by consumers, and for an explanation that since demand for
            cigarettes is price inelastic, consumers face a relatively larger tax
            incidence compared to producers.

      Candidates who do not attempt to identify that the incidence of tax is shared
      can be rewarded with a maximum of [2 marks]. It is not sufficient to simply
      show a shift of the supply curve.

      The tax incidence may be shown as either a vertical distance or a shaded area.

      (Attention must be paid to the accuracy of either a vertical distance or shaded
       area. The incidence must be shown in relation to the new price/quantity, not
       the original equilibrium price/quantity.)

      Candidates who incorrectly label diagrams can be rewarded with a maximum of
      [3 marks].

      The use of P and Q on the axes is sufficient for a demand and supply diagram.
      A title is not necessary.

      There may be different diagrams and/or labelling used to show the above,
      and any appropriate diagram and/or labelling may be fully rewarded.

(d)   Using information from the text/data and your knowledge of economics,
      evaluate the policy of increasing the tax on cigarettes as a measure to
      reduce the negative externalities caused by smoking.                              [8 marks]

      Responses may include:
       a definition of negative externalities
       an explanation of negative externalities
       a diagram showing negative externalities
       an explanation of the negative externalities caused by smoking
        (paragraph )
       use of negative externalities diagram to show how increases in the cigarette
        tax could help reduce these negative externalities
       use of a diagram to show the revenue gained by the state government
       an explanation that tax revenues may be used to finance other measures to
        reduce smoking such as anti-smoking campaigns
       explanations of why the cigarette tax could be ineffective, or only partially
        effective, in reducing the negative externalities, such as:
        – the overall inelastic demand for cigarettes (PED = 0.4) means a relatively
           low responsiveness of consumers to higher cigarette prices due to the tax,
           so that quantity demanded – will fall by a proportionately smaller amount
           (although such a large tax moves the price farther up the demand curve,
           making demand less inelastic)
        – the availability of cheaper cigarettes in nearby states means that
           consumers can buy them there (paragraph ) even though this will
           involve higher transport costs
        – the emergence of parallel markets
       a disadvantage of higher cigarette taxes is that they are regressive, raising
        issues of fairness, since lower income people (who also tend to smoke more)
        would be harder hit by the tax increases (paragraph )
       the imposition of such a large tax (US$0.55 – US$1.20 per pack)
        (paragraph ) may be politically unacceptable
       taxes alone are argued to be an ineffective way to reduce cigarette smoking
        (paragraph )
       level of effectiveness for different types of consumers, poor versus rich;
        youths versus adults
       anti-smoking campaigns on television and programmes to help smokers quit
        (paragraph ) as alternatives or additions to tax increase
       taxation may hurt employment in West Virginia while benefiting that of
        Kentucky.

      Effective evaluation may be to:
       consider short-term versus long-term consequences
       examine the impact on different stakeholders
       discuss advantages and disadvantages
       prioritize the arguments.

        Examiners should be aware that candidates may take a different approach
        which if appropriate, should be rewarded.

        If there is no direct reference to the text/data, then candidates may not be
        rewarded beyond level 2.

                       The idea that it is an economy where there is very little government
                       intervention.

                   2   Precise definition                                                           2
                       An explanation that it is an economy where resources are allocated by
                       demand and supply, or where the means of production are privately
                       held by individuals and firms, or where demand and supply determine
                       how much to produce, how to produce, and for whom to produce.

                       Candidates who confuse this with free-trade, or the absence of
                       protectionist policies should be given [0 marks].

                       An explanation that it is a market structure where:
                        there is only one firm in the industry, or
                        a single firm dominates the market.

            For drawing a correctly labelled diagram of the long-run average total
            cost curve, or for explaining that as a firm grows in size, it may achieve
            economies of scale leading to lower average costs, thus enabling it to sell
            output at a lower price than its smaller competitors and thus “hurt small
            competitors”.

       2    Correct application of appropriate theory                                           3–4
            For drawing a correctly labelled diagram of the long-run average total
            cost curve, and for explaining that as a firm grows in size, it may achieve
            economies of scale leading to lower average costs, thus enabling it to sell
            output at a lower price than its smaller competitors and thus “hurt small
            competitors”.

      Candidates are not expected to include an “envelope curve” with SRAC curves
      to justify their answer.

      An alternative approach would be to illustrate economies of scale with falling
      SRAC curves. If correctly explained, this may be rewarded.

      Candidates who incorrectly label diagrams can be rewarded with a maximum of
      [3 marks].

      The vertical axis should be cost or Average Cost. The horizontal axis should be
      output or quantity or quantity/time. A title is not necessary.

      N.B. For full marks there should be some indication of an increase in output
      and a fall in cost on the diagram – e.g. 2 output levels and 2 cost levels, with an
      arrow indicating the change. The curve(s) must be labelled.

(c)   Using an appropriate diagram, explain how Coca-Cola’s “dominant

       1    Identification of appropriate theory                                            1–2
            For drawing a correctly labelled diagram showing profit maximization by
            a firm making supernormal (abnormal) profits or for explaining that a
            firm in a dominant position is able to make supernormal (abnormal)
            profits in the long run because of either the barriers to entry it has or
            economies of scale which allow it to keep costs low, or its price setting
            power.

       2    Correct application of appropriate theory                                       3–4
            For drawing a correctly labelled diagram showing profit maximization by
            a firm making supernormal (abnormal) profits and for explaining that a
            firm in a dominant position is able to make supernormal (abnormal)
            profits in the long run because of either the barriers to entry it has or
            economies of scale which allow it to keep costs low, or its price setting
            power.

      For full marks, there must be some explanation of the ability to earn abnormal
      profits in the long run. The reasons suggested above are the main examples,
      but others might be possible.

      Candidates who incorrectly label diagrams or incorrectly shade the area of
      abnormal profits can be rewarded with a maximum of [3 marks]. For full
      marks, the MC must cross AC at the minimum of AC.

      Price and quantity are sufficient for full marks. A title is not necessary.

(d)   Using information from the text/data and your knowledge of economics,
      evaluate China’s commerce ministry’s decision to reject Coca-Cola’s
      application to buy Huiyuan.                                                     [8 marks]

      Responses may include:
       an explanation that the anti-monopoly legislation could support China’s
        transition to a market economy by encouraging competition
       the acquisition would have resulted in a 20 % market share of Coca-Cola in
        the juice sector, which does not seem to suggest a dominant or monopoly
        position in the juice industry (and is much smaller than its share in the
        carbonated drinks sector, of about 50 %) (paragraph )
       by rejecting the Coca-Cola offer, China lost a number of potential benefits
        of FDI, such as:
        – inflows of foreign exchange
        – increased technical and managerial know-how
        – possibilities of increasing local investments by Coca-Cola that would
           have benefited the local economy
        – lower prices to consumers due to economies of scale
        – multiplier effect of investment
        – perceived image by other foreign investors
       possible costs of allowing the acquisition could include:

              (or full employment GDP), or for explaining that expansionary fiscal
              policy involves increases in government spending and/or decreases in

      For full marks, the diagram must show that the economy is initially operating
      below potential output. This may be by using a vertical LRAS with an SRAS
      curve or a Keynesian AS curve, and indicating an equilibrium to the left of
      potential output. The explanation should refer to the increase in output, but
      candidates are not required to use the term “recession” in the explanation.

      For AD/AS, the vertical axis may be price level, average price level or general
      price level. The horizontal axis may be output, real output, national output,
      real national output, national income, or GDP. Abbreviations of the labels are
      acceptable. A title is not necessary.

(d)   Using information from the text/data and your knowledge of economics,
      evaluate the effect on the Brazilian economy of a decision to raise interest
      rates (paragraph ).                                                                 [8 marks]

      Responses may include:
       an explanation that when a central bank raises interest rates, this involves a
        contractionary monetary policy, intended to lower AD or to slow down the
        rate of growth of AD in order to prevent the economy from overheating by
        discouraging borrowing by firms and consumers
       a correctly labelled AD/AS diagram change in AD
       higher interest rates may attract foreign financial capital, thus increasing the
        value of the real (paragraph )
       a correctly labelled diagram to show an appreciation of the real.

      Possible disadvantages of the decision:
       lower AD could reduce economic growth (reference to growth in Figure 1)
       lower AD may increase the rate of unemployment, which in 2008 was quite
        high at 8 % (figures forecast for 2009–2010)
       an appreciation of the real makes domestic producers and exporters less
        competitive (paragraph )
       an appreciation of the real may worsen the existing current account deficit,
        by encouraging imports and discouraging exports (paragraph )
       the government may have to resort to managing the real in order to try to
        counteract the effects of higher interest rates, i.e. sell real in the foreign
        exchange market, which would exert a downward pressure on its value
        (paragraph )
       investment expenditure consequences, cue to higher interest rates
       time lags of impact of raising interest rates.

      Possible advantages of the decision:
       lower growth of AD may lower the rate of inflation, which although not
        particularly high (at 4 %), and though lower than in the past couple of years,
        is higher than the average rate of inflation in the OECD
       a stronger real would be beneficial in bringing down the rate of inflation, as
        well as offering cheaper imported capital goods (paragraph ) (but the
        government may try to manage the exchange rate…) (paragraph ))
       cheaper imported capital goods may benefit industry and encourage
        economic growth, possibly counteracting the effects of higher interest rates
        on real GDP.

      Effective evaluation may be to:
       consider short-term versus long-term consequences
       examine the impact on different stakeholders
       discuss advantages and disadvantages
       prioritize the arguments.

           economic growth
        – lower prices for consumers (paragraph ) leading to higher standards of
           living
        – possible greater variety for consumers through more varied imports of
           fruit and vegetables
        – increases in agricultural output produced resulting in greater farmers’
           income may break poverty cycles and promotes economic development
        – increases in Thai exports and greater export revenues which are positive
           for economic growth
        – increases in investment, contributing to economic growth
        – benefits of exploiting comparative and absolute advantage to achieve
           growth
        – increases in employment in those fruit and vegetable sectors that
           experience increases in exports
       a consideration of the potential costs for Thailand’s growth and
        development due to the FTA with China, such as:
        – tariff cuts in Thailand will cause less efficient producers to close down
           due to the increased competition from China (paragraph ) worsening
           living standards
        – tariff cuts have different impacts on small and large producers, with large
           commercial producers that have achieved economies of scale benefiting
           from the FTA due to the possibility of increased exports to China, while
           the smaller producers go out of business
        – any benefits of economics growth might not be fairly distributed amongst
           the population (income distribution issues), questioning the “trickle
           down” assumption)
        – structural unemployment (as in the case of garlic farmers who cannot
           easily switch to other crops) (paragraph ) limiting economic
           development

           – increased poverty among small farmers (paragraph )
           – income distribution may worsen, depending on the government response
           – economic growth may be reduced at least over the short term, if the
             negative impacts of increased Chinese imports and limited exports by
             small producers are very strong
           – consumer choice in the case of some products may be reduced (as in the
             case of garlic)
           – safety standards may be perceived to be compromised
           – less tariff revenue for the government, which might cut into finances for
             education and health, thus limiting development

           Effective evaluation can only be carried out if candidates specifically link
           the points made to the concepts of economic growth and development.

        Effective evaluation may be to:
         consider short-term versus long-term consequences
         examine the impact on different stakeholders
         discuss advantages and disadvantages
         prioritize the arguments.

        Examiners should be aware that candidates may take a different approach
        which if appropriate, should be rewarded.

        If there is no direct reference to the text/data, then candidates may not be
        rewarded beyond level 2.

            clothing will increase and the price of clothing will fall or for explaining
            that removing a quota will result in an increase in imports and thus an
            increase in supply so that there will be a lower price.

            clothing will increase and the price of clothing will fall and for
            explaining that removing a quota will result in an increase in imports and
            thus an increase in supply so that there will be a lower price.

      There are a number of diagrams which may be used to indicate a removal of a
      quota, including a simple demand and supply diagram showing an increase in
      supply by the amount of the (removed) quota). Candidates who do not identify
      the (removed) quota in the diagram may not achieve full marks.

      Candidates who incorrectly label diagrams can be rewarded with a maximum of
      [3 marks].

      The use of P and Q on the axes is sufficient. A title is not necessary.

(d)   Using information from the text/data and your knowledge of economics,
      evaluate China’s export-oriented growth and development strategy.                [8 marks]

      Responses may include:
       an explanation of export-oriented growth
       an explanation of development
       through export-oriented growth China has been able to pursue its growth
        and economic development goals (paragraph )
       China’s Human Development Index (HDI) has improved dramatically since
        1975 from 0.530 to 0.772 in 2007 (although this may not be due to the
        export-oriented strategy)
       China’s level of absolute poverty, as measured by the number of people
        living on less than US$1.25 a day has fallen dramatically (Figure 1)
        (although this may not be due to the export-oriented strategy)
       possible implications for the population of the increase in the value of HDI
        in terms of health care, education and purchasing power
       realization that the value of HDI may be limited as it is an average value
       growth and development may be experienced in some areas (urban and
        industrial centres), but not necessarily in rural areas
       discussion of possible shortcomings of export-oriented growth as a
        development strategy noting that it does not automatically imply
        development and it makes a country dependent on overseas demand:
        and vulnerable to a drastic decrease in export revenues (paragraph )
       opportunity cost of government subsidies to export industries
       the development strategy followed by China seems to have left most of the
        population still needing health care, even as absolute poverty fell
        (paragraph ), (Figure 1)
       export-led growth may generate negative externalities and threaten
        sustainability
       low wages could be a requirement for export-oriented growth, but there may
        be complaints of exploitation of the labour force and demands for
        protectionism in other countries
       export led growth can come at the expense of a trading partner, causing
        political problems.

      Effective evaluation may be to:
       consider short-term versus long-term consequences
       examine the impact on different stakeholders
       discuss advantages and disadvantages
       prioritize the arguments.
