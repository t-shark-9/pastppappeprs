These notes are not intended to replace the published criteria but to supplement them in some instances.

These notes are intended to define the top mark of the scale in this examination. The phrase,
“a good answer”, is intended to refer to scripts that are likely to be placed in the 9 to 10 band of
descriptors. Scripts should be marked proportionately lower to the degree to which they fail to
meet these requirements.

In each case, good answers will meet most, though not necessarily all, of the following
requirements.


1.    You suspect one of your good friends of stealing from a local shop. You have tried to warn
      your friend, but s/he will not listen. Before the police take action, you think you should
      write a letter to the school counsellor about your friend’s problem. Write the letter.

      Written interaction – semi-formal to formal – letter

      A good answer
      • will contain elements of a formal letter: addresses, date, appropriate salutations, etc.
      • will adopt a serious tone and a semi-formal register, possibly with some informality
      • will clearly state the purpose of the letter
      • will describe the writer’s relationship with and concern for the friend
      • may describe the circumstances of the theft/s
      • may suggest how the counsellor might approach the situation with the student; this should
        be rewarded
      • may give mitigating circumstances explaining the friend’s actions; this should be rewarded.


2.    You have been asked to write an article for a youth travel magazine in which you advise
      tourists on how to best visit your home town or city on foot. Be sure to describe places of
      interest. Write the article.

      Description/factual – semi-formal – guidelines/article

      A good answer
      • will adopt a tone of enthusiasm
      • will have a title
      • will use a semi-formal register with some informality suitable for a youth travel magazine
      • will include more than one place of interest – a maximum mark of 6 for Criterion C should
        be awarded if the candidate mentions only one place
      • will indicate clearly that this is a walk about the city or town
      • may give instructions regarding distance and directions
      • may mention places of interest to young people; this should be rewarded
      • may include historical facts; this should be rewarded.

3.   It has come to your attention that many of your fellow students are damaging school property.
     As the president of the Student Council, you have been asked to give a speech to the school,
     outlining this problem and why it needs to be stopped. Write your speech.

     Argument – semi-formal – text of a speech

     A good answer
     • will adopt a semi-formal register with flashes of informality when appropriate
     • will cover both aspects: the problem and why it needs to be stopped. If only one part is
       mentioned, a maximum mark of 6 for Criterion C should be awarded
     • will address the audience and keep contact with them throughout the speech
     • may suggest what might have caused this damage
     • may ensure that the audience is aware of the cost of repairs; this should be rewarded.


4.   You have noticed that the police are digging up the garden of the house next door. You have
     decided to watch the progress and to write about it in your diary or blog. Write your
     diary entry or blog.

     Imaginative narration/reflection – informal – diary entry/blog

     A good answer
     • will explain clearly what occurs
     • will be reflective
     • will describe the context of the situation
     • will adopt an informal register appropriate for a diary entry/blog
     • may express a feeling of personal excitement at the incident
     • may describe progress over time and therefore be more than one entry; this should
       be rewarded
     • may include an interview with the police; this should be rewarded.

     N.B. A blog is a type of website, usually written by an individual with regular entries of
          commentary, descriptions of events, or other material. Entries are often displayed in
          reverse chronological order, although this would not be expected in an examination
          response. Many blogs provide commentary or news on a particular subject; others
          function as more personal online diaries. The personal blog, an ongoing diary or
          commentary by an individual, is the most common. It often becomes more than a way
          just to communicate: it becomes a way to reflect on life. Unlike a diary entry, it may
          contain explanatory words or phrases. One way of contrasting the two forms is that a
          “diary” is narrative and private personal reflection; a “blog” is narrative and public
          personal reflection.
