Write an essay on one of the following. You must base your answer on the cultural options or literary
options you have studied in class. References to other subjects or literary works are permissible but should
not form the main body of your answer.

Language and culture

1.    Having bilingual parents is not enough to make a person truly bilingual and bicultural. Discuss how
      one becomes bilingual and/or bicultural in the light of your study of language and culture.


2.    English is not a language but a variety of languages. Discuss this statement referring to what your
      study of the option has taught you about the way English is used in different countries, by people of
      different backgrounds, ages, cultures or social classes.



Media and culture

3.    If freedom of the press is a basic right, does this mean that the mass media are free to print or say what
      they want? Discuss with reference to your study of the option.


4.    In what ways can the mass media influence our political opinions?



Future issues

5.    To have a future, we need to get closer to Nature. What do you understand by this statement in the
      light of your study of future issues?



Global issues

6.    Is there any reason to be sceptical about the benefits of globalization? Discuss with reference to your
      study of this option.



Social issues

7.    In the light of your study of this option, what do you see as the main causes of social conflict or unrest
      in a society you are familiar with? What solutions do you recommend for dealing with them?
