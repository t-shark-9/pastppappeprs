     ft      Marks that can be awarded as follow through from previous results in the question.

2    Method of Marking

     (a)     All marking must be done in scoris using the mathematical studies annotations and in
             accordance with the current document for guidance in e-marking Mathematical Studies SL.
             It is essential that you read this document before you start marking.

     (b)     If a question part is completely correct use the number tick annotations to award full marks.
             If a part is completely wrong use the A0 annotation, otherwise full annotations must be shown.

     (c)     Working crossed out by the candidate should not be awarded any marks.

     (d)     Where candidates have written two solutions to a question, only the first solution should be marked.

     (e)     If correct working results in a correct answer but then further working is developed, full marks may
             not always be awarded. Full marks will be awarded if the candidate shows correct working leading to
             the correct answer. See also section 4(c).

Example:     Calculate the gradient of the line passing through the points (5, 3) and (0, 9) .

3   Follow-through (ft) Marks

    Errors made at any step of a solution affect all working that follows. To limit the severity of the penalty,
    follow through (ft) marks can be awarded. Markschemes will indicate where it is appropriate to apply
    follow through in a question with ‘(ft)’.

    (a)    Follow through applies only from one part of a question to a subsequent part of the question.
           Follow through does not apply within the same part.

    (b)    If an answer resulting from follow through is extremely unrealistic (e.g. negative distances or
           incorrect by large order of magnitude) then the final A mark should not be awarded.

    (c)    If a question is transformed by an error into a different, much simpler question then follow through
           may not apply.

    (d)    To award follow through marks for a question part, there must be working present for that part.
           An isolated follow through answer, without working is regarded as incorrect and receives no marks
           even if it is approximately correct.

    (e)    The exception to the above would be in a question which is testing the candidate’s use of the GDC,
           where working will not be expected. The markscheme will clearly indicate where this applies.

    (f)    Inadvertent use of radians will be penalised the first time it occurs. The markscheme will give clear
           instructions to ensure that only one mark per paper can be lost for the use of radians.

Example:   Finding angles and lengths using trigonometry

4   Using the Markscheme

    (a)    A marks are dependent on the preceding M mark being awarded, it is not possible to
           award (M0)(A1). Once an (M0) has been awarded, all subsequent A marks are lost in that part of
           the question, even if calculations are performed correctly, until the next M mark.
           The only exception to this will be for an answer where the accuracy is specified in the question – see
           section 5.

    (b)    A marks are dependent on the R mark being awarded, it is not possible to award (A1)(R0). Hence the
           (A1) cannot be awarded for an answer which is correct when no reason or the wrong reason is given.

    (c)    In paper 2 candidates are expected to demonstrate their ability to communicate mathematics using
           appropriate working. Answers which are correct but not supported by adequate working will
           not always receive full marks, these unsupported answers are designated G in the mark scheme as an
           alternative to the full marks. Example (M1)(A1)(A1)(G2).

Example:   Using trigonometry to calculate an angle in a triangle.

     substitutions.
                                                (ii)   A = 22.0                                (G2)
                                                Note: G marks are used only if no working has been shown
                                                and the answer is correct.
            A = 22.0 (22.0243…) (A1)(G2)

    (d)    Alternative methods may not always be included. Thus, if an answer is wrong then the working must
           be carefully analysed in order that marks are awarded for a different method consistent with the
           markscheme.
           Where alternative methods for complete questions are included in the markscheme, they are indicated
           by ‘OR’ etc.
                                                                                               sinθ
    (e)    Unless the question specifies otherwise, accept equivalent forms. For example:           for tan θ .
                                                                                               cosθ
           On the markscheme, these equivalent numerical or algebraic forms will sometimes be written in
           brackets after the required answer.
           Where numerical answers are required as the final answer to a part of a question in the markscheme,
           the scheme will show, in order:
           the 3 significant figure answer worked through from full calculator display;
           the exact value (for example 3 if applicable);
           the full calculator display in the form 2.83163… as in the example above.
           Where answers are given to 3 significant figures and are then used in subsequent parts of the question
           leading to a different 3 significant figure answer, these solutions will also be given.

(f)   As this is an international examination, all valid alternative forms of notation should be accepted.
      Some examples of these are:

      Decimal points: 1.7; 1’7; 1 ⋅ 7 ; 1,7 .

      Different descriptions of an interval: 3 < x < 5; (3, 5); ] 3, 5 [ .

      Different forms of notation for set properties (e.g. complement): A′ ; A ; Ac ; U − A ;( A ;U \ A.
      Different forms of logic notation:      ¬ p ; p′ ; p ; p ; ~ p.
                                              p ⇒ q; p→q; q ⇐ p.

(g)   Discretionary marks: There will be very rare occasions where the markscheme does not cover the
      work seen. In such cases the annotation DM should be used to indicate where an examiner has used
      discretion. Discretion should be used sparingly and if there is doubt and exception should be raised
      through scoris to the team leader.
                                                     –7–                N11/5/MATSD/SP2/ENG/TZ0/XX/M

As from Nov 11 there will be no whole paper penalty marks for accuracy AP, financial accuracy FP and
units UP. Instead these skills will be assessed in particular questions and the marks applied according to the
rules given in sections 5, 6 and 7 below.

5     Accuracy of Answers

     Unless otherwise stated in the question, all numerical answers should be given exactly or correct to 3
     significant figures.

      1.    If the candidate’s unrounded answer is seen and would round to the required 3 sf answer, then award
            (A1) and ignore subsequent rounding.
      Note: The unrounded answer may appear in either the working box or on the final answer line.

      2.    If the candidate’s unrounded answer is not seen then award (A1) if the answer given is correctly
            rounded to 2 or more significant figures, otherwise (A0).

      3.    If a correct 2 sf answer is used in subsequent parts, then working must be shown for further marks to
            be awarded. (This treatment is the same as for following through from an incorrect answer.)

      These 3 points (see numbers in superscript) have been summarised in the table below and illustrated in the
      examples following.

                                                      If candidates final answer is given…

    Ratios of π and answers taking the form of square roots of integers or any rational power of an integer
                2
    (e.g. 13, 2 3 , 4 5 ,) may be accepted as exact answers. All other powers (e.g. of non-integers) and values
    of transcendental functions such as sine and cosine must be evaluated.

    If the level of accuracy is specified in the question, a mark will be allocated for giving the answer to
    the required accuracy. In all such cases the final mark is not awarded if the rounding does not follow the
    instructions given in the question. A mark for specified accuracy can be regarded as a (ft) mark regardless of
    an immediately preceding (M0).

6   Level of accuracy in finance questions

    The accuracy level required for answers will be specified in all questions involving money. This will usually
    be either whole units or two decimal places. The first answer not given to the specified level of accuracy
    will not be awarded the final A mark. The markscheme will give clear instructions to ensure that only
    one mark per paper can be lost for incorrect accuracy in a financial question.

Example:   A financial question demands accuracy correct to 2dp.

7   Units in answers

    There will be specific questions for which the units are required and this will be indicated clearly
    in the markscheme. The first correct answer with no units or incorrect units will not be awarded the
    final A mark. The markscheme will give clear instructions to ensure that only one mark per paper can be
    lost for lack of units or incorrect units.
    The units are considered only when the numerical answer is awarded (A1) under the accuracy rules given
    in Section 5.
