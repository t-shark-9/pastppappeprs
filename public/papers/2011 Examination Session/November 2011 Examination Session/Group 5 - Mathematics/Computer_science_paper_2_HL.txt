Answer all the questions.

1.    Consider the following class.

      class Animal
      {
        public int animalID;
        public String animalSpecies;
        ...
      }

      Using this class, an object can be created for each individual animal.   The object
      contains an identifier for the animal and identifies what species the animal is.

      Linked lists are to be used to hold groups of  Animal objects.  

      (a)     Construct a code modification to the  Animal class that allows  Animal objects
              to be linked together in a list.                                                        [1 mark]

      (b)     Describe, with the aid of a diagram, how objects of the  Animal class can be
              used to construct a  linked list of  Animal objects.  The first object in the list is
              pointed to by  animalList.                                                              [3 marks]

      The class  Zoo, shown below, maintains an inventory of the animals in a zoo.  
      The linked list  animalList contains one  Animal object for each animal in the zoo.  
      The zoo has six species of animals and the species’ names are contained in the
      array  allSpecies.

      public class Zoo
      {
        // instance variables
        private Animal animalList; // points to first element of linked list
        private String[] allSpecies = {"elephant", "penguin", "tiger",
                                       "porcupine", "kangaroo", "llama"};
        private Animal[] speciesList = new Animal[6];
            // constructor for objects of class Zoo
            public Zoo()
            {
              // animalList is initialized with Animal objects
              // one object for each animal in the zoo
              // speciesList is initialized with each element set to null
            }
            public int getSpeciesIndex()
            {
              // lines of code missing
            }
            public void divideAnimals()
            {
              // lines of code missing
            }
            int speciesCount(String species)
            {
              // lines of code missing
            }
      }
                                                                (This question continues on the following page)

(Question 1 continued)

      (c)   Construct the method  getSpeciesIndex() that, when passed the name of
            a species, will return the index of the element in  allSpecies which contains
            that name.                                                                          [4 marks]

      The  Animal objects in  animalList are to be divided amongst separate linked lists,
      one list for each species.  The first object in each of these separate lists (or  null
      if the list is empty) is held in an array that corresponds to the  allSpecies array,
      as shown below.

                  0         1                  2             3           4              5
  allSpecies "elephant" "penguin"           "tiger"     "porcupine" "kangaroo"       "llama"

                   0          1                 2             3            4            5
  speciesList animalID=1 animalID=3           null       animalID=2      null      animalID=5

                animalID=4       null                    animalID=7                animalID=6

                   null                                    null                       null


      (d)   Assuming that the  Animal objects have already been divided into the linked
            lists in the array  speciesList, construct the  speciesCount() method that
            finds the linked list corresponding to the species named in the argument and
            returns the total number of animals found in that list.   You may use the
            getSpeciesIndex() method.                                                           [4 marks]

      (e)   Construct the method  divideAnimals() that divides the objects in the list
            animalList into the separate linked lists in  speciesLists corresponding to
            the different species in  allSpecies.  You may use the  getSpeciesIndex()
            method.                                                                             [8 marks]




8811-7012                                                                                       Turn over
                                                   –4–                 N11/5/COMSC/HP2/ENG/TZ0/XX

2.    Scientists are monitoring the fish population in a river.   They have installed an
      automated system that counts how many fish swim past a sensor every hour.  
      The system sends an automatic text message to the lab containing the hour and the
      number of fish counted during the previous hour.   The received text messages are
      processed by a computer program running in the lab.

      Example of message:
      06, 523

      The above message was sent at 06:00.   In the previous hour 523 fish swam past
      the sensor.

      The received data is processed by the class  FishCounts, partially shown below.  
      The counts are stored in an array named  counts.   The data received for the hour
      starting at 00:00 is stored in  counts[0], the data for the hour starting at 01:00 is
      stored in  counts[1] etc.

      class FishCounts
      {
        public int[] counts = new int[24];

            public FishCounts()
            {
              for (int i = 0; i < 24; i = i + 1)
              {
                 this.counts[i] = –1;
              }
            }

            public void fillMissingCounts()
            {
              // lines of code missing
            }

            public FishStats findTopTwo()
            {
              // lines of code missing
            }
      }

      However, not all text messages are received.  In these cases the data is represented by
      setting the corresponding element of  counts[] to a negative value.

      (a)     Explain why the class  FishCounts  contains a method called  FishCounts()
              and what the method accomplishes.                                                 [3 marks]




                                                           (This question continues on the following page)



8811-7012
                                                   –5–                N11/5/COMSC/HP2/ENG/TZ0/XX

(Question 2 continued)

      The data is processed at the end of each day.   When the count for a given hour
      is missing, it can be estimated as the average of the count from the previous hour and
      the following hour.

      (b)   Construct the method  fillMissingCounts() that is run at the end of the day
            and replaces any negative values in  counts[] with the average of the previous
            value and the following value.  You may assume that the first and last values of
            counts[] are not negative and that there are no two consecutive hours where
            data is missing.                                                                    [4 marks]

      The data in  counts[] is to be analysed and the results put into an object of the
      FishStats class.

      class FishStats
      {
        public int max;              // the maximum count
        public int maxIndex;         // the index at which the maximum count occurs
        public int min;              // the minimum count
        public int minIndex;         // the index at which the minimum count occurs
        public int max2;             // the second largest count
        public int mean;             // the average count
        ...
      }

      (c)   Using an example, explain why representing all of the variables as  int could
            lead to inaccuracies in the mean.                                                   [3 marks]

      (d)   In the  FishCounts class, construct a method  findTopTwo() which finds the
            largest two values in  counts[], creates a new  FishStats object and updates
            max,  maxIndex,  max2  and  mean before returning it.  Note that  max2 may be
            the same as  max, if the maximum count occurred in two or more hours.              [10 marks]

                                                     –6–                 N11/5/COMSC/HP2/ENG/TZ0/XX

3.    A refugee camp was set up by a relief organization after a large-scale disaster.  
      The camp maintains a file called  refugees containing a list of the names, ages,
      gender and former addresses of the refugees who are living there.  When relatives
      contact the camp seeking a particular person, the  refugees  file is searched for records
      matching the person’s name.

      (a)   Define the term  record.                                                              [2 marks]

      (b)   One method of organizing the  refugees file could be with the use of a
            partial-index.

            (i)    Explain the steps needed to construct a partial-index to make searching the
                   file more efficient.                                                           [3 marks]

            (ii)   Describe the process of searching the file using the partial-index.            [2 marks]

      The number of refugees in the camp is continually changing as new refugees arrive
      and others are reunited with their families.

      (c)   Explain why a partial-index is not the best choice of file organization for
            this application.                                                                     [3 marks]

      The refugee camp is one of a number of refugee camps run by a relief organization
      in the disaster area.  At its headquarters, the relief organization has decided to use
      a master file which maintains an updated list of the refugees in all of the camps.  
      Each camp sends a transaction file to the headquarters on a regular basis.

      (d)   Suggest how the  key field for the transaction files would be created.                [3 marks]

      (e)   Describe the content and organization of the files sent by the camps.                 [2 marks]

      (f)   Describe the process by which the master file of refugees is updated.                 [5 marks]

4.    This question requires the use of the case study.

      (a)   Each component system in Heathrow Terminal 5 (T5) was tested before the
            terminal was opened to the public.  A variety of testing methods were used.

            (i)    Define the term  parallel running.                                             [2 marks]

            (ii)   Explain why simulations were used in testing the new baggage handling
                   system.                                                                        [4 marks]

            (iii) Identify two factors that should be considered when selecting a
                  testing method.                                                                 [2 marks]

      (b)   Ground services in T5 include a fleet of electric carts that help disabled
            passengers to move between different parts of the airport.   Each cart has an
            onboard computer that connects with the airport computer system to indicate its
            location and to receive instructions.

            (i)    Outline a suitable method of data communication between carts and the
                   airport system.                                                                [2 marks]

            (ii)   Describe two potential problems that could arise from this method of
                   implementation.                                                                [4 marks]

            (iii) Describe two ways in which the data communication between the carts
                  and the airport computer system could be made secure.                           [4 marks]

      (c)   Air traffic controllers continue to resist efforts to replace the current method of
            paper strips for each flight.

            (i)    With specific reference to the case study, identify two features of the
                   paper strips method that air traffic controllers like.                         [2 marks]

            (ii)   Suggest a way in which a computer-based system could provide the two
                   features you identified in part (i).                                           [4 marks]

            (iii) Discuss whether the safety concerns associated with replacing the
                  paper strips method with a computer-based system can be overcome.               [6 marks]

(Question 4 continued)

      (d)   A major problem in airports is the length of queues at check-in and at
            passport control.   The airport management is investigating possible solutions
            to resolve the problem.

            (i)    State two ways to uniquely identify a person in the airport.              [2 marks]

            (ii)   Discuss how technology can be used to manage the queues at check-in
                   more effectively.                                                         [4 marks]

            (iii) Describe two privacy or ethical concerns that might be raised by the
                  method(s) you discussed in part (ii), above.                               [4 marks]
