Please start each question on a new page. Full marks are not necessarily awarded for a correct answer
with no working. Answers must be supported by working and/or explanations. In particular, solutions
found from a graphic display calculator should be supported by suitable working, e.g. if graphs are used to
find a solution, you should sketch these as part of your answer. Where an answer is incorrect, some marks
may be given for a correct method, provided this is shown by written working. You are therefore advised
to show all working.

      (a)   Use the Euclidean algorithm to find gcd (752 , 352) .                                   [4 marks]

      (b)   A farmer spends £8128 buying cows of two different breeds, A and B,
            for her farm. A cow of breed A costs £752 and a cow of breed B costs £352.

		          (i)    Set up a diophantine equation to show this.

		          (ii)   Using your working from part (a), find the general solution to this equation.

		          (iii) Hence find the number of cows of each breed bought by the farmer.                [10 marks]

      Anna is playing with some cars and divides them into three sets of equal size.
      However, when she tries to divide them into five sets of equal size, there are four
      left over. Given that she has fewer than 50 cars, what are the possible numbers of cars
      she can have?

      A version of Fermat’s little theorem states that when p is prime, a is a positive
      integer and a and p are relatively prime, then a p−1 ≡ 1(mod p ) .

      (a)   Use the above result to show that if p is prime then a p ≡ a (mod p ) , where a is
            any positive integer.                                                                [4 marks]
