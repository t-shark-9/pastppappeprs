10.   A program accesses a text file on disk. To edit the text the user of the program enters
      data using a keyboard. The program then amends the text which was read from the file,
      writes the updated file back to disk and produces a printed report of all amendments
      made to the text file.

      (a)   Construct a systems flowchart representing this process.                            [4 marks]
