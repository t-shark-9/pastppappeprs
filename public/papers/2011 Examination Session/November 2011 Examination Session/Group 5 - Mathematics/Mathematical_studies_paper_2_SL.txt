Please start each question on a new page. You are advised to show all working, where possible.
Where an answer is incorrect, some marks may be given for a correct method, provided this is shown
by written working. Solutions found from a graphic display calculator should be supported by suitable
working, e.g. if graphs are used to find a solution, you should sketch these as part of your answer.
