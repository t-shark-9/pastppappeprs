Questions 36–40 relate to the following case study. Please read the case study carefully and answer
the questions.

Solar panels are increasingly used to harness the energy of the sun and make buildings more sustainable.
The solar panel shown in Figure 16 is made up of 36 solar cells. The solar cells (see Figure 17) are
permanently joined together by heat fusing. They are then covered with a sheet of laminated anti-reflective
glass which is sealed to a support frame.
