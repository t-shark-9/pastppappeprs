Mark Allocation

Candidates are required to answer questions from ONE of the Options [1  30 marks].
Maximum total = [30 marks]

1.    A markscheme often has more marking points than the total allows. This is intentional. Do not
      award more than the maximum marks allowed for part of a question.

2.    Each marking point has a separate line and the end is shown by means of a semicolon (;).

3.    An alternative answer or wording is indicated in the markscheme by a slash (/). Either wording can
      be accepted.

4.    Words in brackets ( ) in the markscheme are not necessary to gain the mark.

5.    Words that are underlined are essential for the mark.

6.    The order of marking points does not have to be as in the markscheme, unless stated otherwise.

7.    If the candidate’s answer has the same “meaning” or can be clearly interpreted as being of
      equivalent significance, detail and validity as that in the markscheme then award the mark.
      Where this point is considered to be particularly relevant in a question it is emphasized by
      OWTTE (or words to that effect).

8.    Remember that many candidates are writing in a second language. Effective communication is
      more important than grammatical accuracy.

9.    Occasionally, a part of a question may require an answer that is required for subsequent
      marking points. If an error is made in the first marking point then it should be penalized. However,
      if the incorrect answer is used correctly in subsequent marking points then follow through marks
      should be awarded. When marking, indicate this by adding ECF (error carried forward) on
      the script.

10.   Do not penalize candidates for errors in units or significant figures, unless it is specifically referred
      to in the markscheme.

          90%;                                                                                      [1]

    (b)   Award [2] for outlining one reason why the shape of the distribution curve would
          change depending on the user population it represents.
          this is a model representing a specific user group;
          the shape of the curve would change depending on the make-up of the user group;           [2]

    (c)   Award [1] for each point in an explanation of the relevance of the shaded area of
          the graph to the work of the designers.

          1st–5th and 95th–99th are extremes in the population;
          therefore, can be uneconomical for volume production;

          they represent niche markets;

          the temperature in the office may be constant but an individual may perceive the
          environment as too hot or too cold;
          e.g. whether their work requires them to be static or dynamic / the type of clothes
          they are wearing / whether their desk is near a sunny window/door/heat emitting
          machine / the amount of people in the office / the type of heat source /
          their metabolism;                                                                     [2 max]

          people with limited hand movement and [1] for a brief explanation.
          shape of the pen;
          means that less pressure is applied to the hand/finger muscles / shape means that
          the pen or the arms of the pen grips the hand to prevent slippage;                        [2]

    (b)   Award [1] for each point in an outline of one advantage relating to human factors
          of designing the Ergo-sof pen in Figure E2 with a soft rubber finish.
          grip;
          the rubber is non-slip and so adheres to the skin;                                    [2 max]

E4. Award [1] for stating one advantage of using an appearance prototype at the design
    development stage and [1] for a brief explanation [2 max].
    easy for non-design experts to see what the product will look like;
    good feedback on the aesthetics of the product can be gained;

     the product can be compared to similar products;
     to gain feedback on whether it is better than/not as good as the competition;

     feedback is gained at an early stage;
     to inform the continuing design process;

E5. Award [1] for each distinct point in a suitable comparison of two human factor
    considerations [3 max] for each consideration [6 max].
    home office can be configured to suit anthropometric data of the individual user;
    a commercial office would need to be suitable for a range of people;
    with different body measurements;

     legislation;
     does not apply to the home office;
     but does apply to a commercial office;
     such as the amount of light/headroom etc.;

     commercial office is used by people for different tasks;
     some people are static (work at a computer) others are dynamic (move around);
     different people’s perception of comfort levels in relation to psychological factors
     (heat, light etc.);

     health and safety;
     the arrangement of furniture/fixtures needs to take into account the requirements of the
     different tasks/safety issues;
     in the home office, people will work around their own mess;                                [6 max]

E6. Award [1] for each distinct point in a suitable discussion of how human factor data
    relating to clearance, reach and comfort can be used in the design of an aircraft cabin
    [3 max] for each consideration [9 max].
    Reach:
    overhead lockers need to be accessible to the majority of users;
    so the 5th percentile would be used to decide the height;
    meaning that 95% of the user population would be able to reach the lockers;

     Comfort:
     the size of the seats needs to be suitable for people in the 5th–95th percentile range for
     seat width;
     and the shape of the seats needs to aid comfort/give back support;
     adjustability, most aircraft seats allow limited adjustability (rake);

     Clearance:
     the arrangement of seats needs to ensure that there is sufficient clearance for legs when
     users are seated in the aircraft;
     aircraft use different leg space for different seat class (economy, business class);
     in economy class, the leg space is designed for people in the 75th percentile;

     clearance for height of users;
     so they do not hit their heads on the overhead luggage compartments when getting in
     and out of their seats;
     passengers could sue the airline if they bang their heads on the lockers;

     sufficient clearance in the aisles for cabin crew and trolleys;
     the trolley needs to move down the aisle without disturbing passengers;
     there is a direct relationship between the width of the trolley and the width of the aisle;   [9 max]
