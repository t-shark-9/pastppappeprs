Subject Details: Physics HL Paper 3 Markscheme
Mark Allocation

Candidates are required to answer questions from TWO of the Options [2 % 30 marks].
Maximum total = [60 marks].

1.    A markscheme often has more marking points than the total allows. This is intentional. Do not award
      more than the maximum marks allowed for part of a question.

2.    Each marking point has a separate line and the end is signified by means of a semicolon (;).

3.    An alternative answer or wording is indicated in the markscheme by a slash (/). Either wording can
      be accepted.

4.    Words in brackets ( ) in the markscheme are not necessary to gain the mark.

5.    Words that are underlined are essential for the mark.
                     U          U




6.    The order of marking points does not have to be as in the markscheme, unless stated otherwise.

7.    If the candidate’s answer has the same “meaning” or can be clearly interpreted as being of
      equivalent significance, detail and validity as that in the markscheme then award the mark.
      Where this point is considered to be particularly relevant in a question it is emphasized by
      writing OWTTE (or words to that effect).

8.    Remember that many candidates are writing in a second language. Effective communication is
      more important than grammatical accuracy.

9.    Occasionally, a part of a question may require an answer that is required for subsequent
      marking points. If an error is made in the first marking point then it should be penalized.
      However, if the incorrect answer is used correctly in subsequent marking points then
      follow through marks should be awarded. Indicate this with ECF (error carried forward).

10.   Only consider units at the end of a calculation. Unless directed otherwise in the markscheme,
      unit errors should only be penalized once in the paper. Indicate this by writing –1(U) at the
      first point it occurs and U on the cover sheet.

11.   Significant digits should only be considered in the final answer. Deduct 1 mark in the paper for
      an error of 2 or more digits unless directed otherwise in the markscheme.

                                         e.g. if the answer is 1.63:
                                                      2      reject
                                                    1.6      accept
                                                   1.63      accept
                                                  1.631      accept
                                                1.6314       reject

      Indicate the mark deduction by writing –1(SD) at the first point it occurs and SD on the cover sheet.

                   since in the circuit V+ = 0 then V− = 0 ;
                   because of the very high input resistance no current will flow into the
                   amplifier at V− input so P remains at 0 V / OWTTE;                                     [4]

      (b)   look for these main points:
            (when the thermistor is cold) the variable resistor is used to set the potential at the
            inverting input (to some fixed value less than the potential at P);
            the output of the amplifier is saturated at –15 V and so the LED is unlit;
            as the thermistor warms up its resistance decreases;
            the potential at P will increase until at a particular temperature, the potential at P
            is just greater than the potential at the inverting input;
            the output now goes high (saturates) to +15 V and the LED will light;                     [4 max]

G4. (a)   fringes arise as a result of interference between light reflected from top and
          bottom plates;
          there is a phase difference of π at bottom reflection;
          hence constructive interference when 2d = ( n + 12 ) λ and destructive when 2d = nλ ;       [3]

    (b)   the fringe separation would decrease;
          the distance between the points/places/positions where the light is in phase or

H1. (a)    (i)    (a reference frame) in which Newton’s first law holds true/that is not
                  accelerating/that is moving with constant velocity;                                   [1]

           (ii)   the speed of light in a vacuum/free space is the same for all inertial observers;     [1]

     (b)   Look for these main points:
           signal from switch travels at same speed c to each lamp;
           but during signal transfer C1 moves closer to/C2 moves away from source of signal;
           since speed of light is independent of speed of source, signal reaches C1 before C2
           /C2 after C1;
           according to Vladamir C1 registers arrival of signal before C2/C2 registers arrival of
           signal after C1;                                                                             [4]

           (ii)   Natasha
                  since proper length is defined as the length of the object measured by the
                  observer at rest with respect to the object;                                          [1]

     (d)   (i)    Look for an argument along these lines:
                  on the return of the travelling twin according to the twin on Earth the
                  travelling twin will have aged very little compared to himself/herself;
                  however, since time dilation is symmetric it could be the twin on Earth who
                  has done the least aging;
                  experiment suggests that it is the travelling twin who ages the least;                [3]

           (ii)   because of the accelerations undergone by the travelling twin the situation is
                  not symmetric / travelling twin is not in the same inertial frame of reference/
                  changes inertial frame of reference;                                                  [1]

           reaching Earth;

           showing that the half-life is dilated / to the muons the distance travelled is contracted;   [3]

H3. (a)   Look for an argument along these lines:
          the speed of light is independent of speed of source;
          because of the direction of acceleration;
          to Kim it will appear as if L1 is moving away from her;
          light from L1 will therefore be Doppler shifted toward the red end of the spectrum;       [3 max]
          or
          accelerating spaceship is equivalent to being at rest in a gravitational field / OWTTE;
          photons leaving the source therefore gain potential energy and lose kinetic energy;
          since E = hf ;
          Kim will measure a lower frequency;

    (b)   according to the equivalence principle the accelerating spaceship is equivalent to a
          frame of reference at rest in a (uniform) gravitational field / can be regarded as
          being at rest on the surface of a planet/large mass / OWTTE;
          if light is red shifted from L1 then this implies period of the light source is longer
          therefore time is slower / OWTTE;                                                             [2]

      (b)   the ear responds to differences in intensity rather than total intensity;
            each time the intensity is doubled the loudness will be heard to increase by the
            same amount;
            the response of the ear to intensity is therefore logarithmic;                         [3]

I2.   (a)   an electric field applied along the axis of a piezoelectric crystal causes the crystal
            to expand or contract;
            a high frequency alternating E field will cause the crystal to oscillate at the
            frequency of the applied field;
            the oscillations are transferred to the surrounding air producing ultrasound;                      [3]

      (b)   no contrast between heart and surroundings as X-rays will not be absorbed by the
            heart;
            ultrasound will be reflected/transmitted by different amounts by the slightly
            differing densities and depths of the heart tissue;                                                [2]

      (d)   acoustic impedance of skin is very much greater than that of air so nearly all
            incident ultrasound is reflected at air/skin boundary;
            gel has same acoustic impedance as skin so nearly all ultrasound will be
            transmitted through the skin;                                                                      [2]

      (e)   high frequency ultrasound gives better resolution;
            but is subject to more attenuation;
            the further the distance the ultrasound travels the more it is attenuated;
            the deeper an organ therefore the lower the frequency used in order to minimize
            attenuation / a compromise has to be made between resolution and attenuation;                      [4]

      (b)   the higher quality factor of α means that the same absorbed dose of α as γ;
            has a much more damaging effect than that of γ;
            on the same volume of tissue;

            (iii) the neutron quark structure is udd and the proton uud;
                  a d quark in the neutron changes to a u quark by emitting a W boson;                    [2]



J2.   (a)   the frequency of rotation (of the particles) does not depend on the path that they
            follow;
            the frequency of the alternating potential applied across the gap is made to be the
            same as the frequency of rotation;
            each time the particles cross the gap they will be accelerated;
            provided that the direction of the electric field is in the correct direction / OWTTE;        [4]

      (b)   angular speed = 2π f ;
            linear speed = 2π fr = 2π× 108 × 0.34 = 2.135 × 108 m s –1 ;

J3.   (a)   the (presently accepted) theory that describes the electromagnetic and weak
            interactions of quarks and leptons / the electromagnetic, weak interactions of
            quarks and electrons and the strong interaction of baryons;                              [1]

                   W+;
                   any other two correct;
                   and other two correct;                                                            [3]

      (c)   (i)    the scattering of high energy leptons from the particles in the interior of the
                   proton / OWTTE;                                                                   [1]

            (ii)   it is possible to measure the total momentum carried by the quarks inside the
                   nucleon;
                   this total momentum does not equal the momentum of the nucleons;
                   so neutral objects must be present in the nucleon carrying some of its
                   momentum;                                                                         [3]
