                 AESHIA’S EXCLUSIVE INTERVIEW WITH
                            KARINA PASIAN!
       Our Editor-in-Chief, Aeshia DeVore Branch, recently interviewed
       singer sensation, Karina Pasian. Karina was happy to chat about
       her debut album, First Love and the sacri�ices she had to make to
       create it. Read this amazing interview …

  5    Aeshia: Thank you for joining us today Karina. I know you have a
       busy schedule.
       Karina: Thank you for having me.

       Aeshia: So you just celebrated your 17th birthday on Friday 18 July?
       Karina: Yes.

10     Aeshia: How did you celebrate your birthday?
       Karina: I had a party for my birthday. It was really fun because I wasn’t expecting it.
       I also went to a water park with my friends and family on Saturday.

       Aeshia: You are so talented and admired by so many girls and boys. What, do you think,
       makes them notice you?
15     Karina: I suppose it’s because I can do so many things. I play the piano. I’ve been
       playing it since I was three years old and I’ve been singing since I could talk. I sing
       in seven different languages. I’m �luent in Spanish and I understand Russian. I dance
       as well.

       Aeshia: Tell us about your song, “16 At War”. What was the inspiration behind it?
20     Karina: “16 At War” is a song describing what I see going on around me.
       The song is about how people are too embarrassed to talk about things that are
       going on in their society. It talks about teenagers who are unhappy. I wanted to show
       them that somebody really cares. It’s not even my personal experience. It’s just really
       what I see going on.

25     Aeshia: Can you let our readers know about the sacri�ices you’ve made to get to where
       you are today?
       Karina: Well, there are a lot of people who think that being famous means you get there
       quickly and easily and everything is glamour. The sacri�ices that I have to make are,
       for example, missing school and having to travel a lot, being away from my family at
30     home and not getting time to spend with friends. I have to be at home to practise or
       learn new songs and go to interviews. Those are sacri�ices that I have to make.

       Aeshia: Are there any closing words that you would like to say to our readers?
       Karina: I would like to say … never give up on your dreams. You always have to believe
       in yourself and follow them. You have to always work for everything that you do because
35     hard work and dedication can take you anywhere.

       Aeshia: Thank you for your time and enjoy the rest of your day.

TEXT C

        Welcome to the “In My Own Words” competition
        Everyone has a story to tell. What’s yours?
        Send in your story to enter the In My Own Words competition. The fifteen
        finalists will tell their story on television. Five people will have their story
        published.

  5     Lots of us have made people laugh by telling them something that has happened
        to us. Lots of us have inspired people by telling them how we overcame a difficulty.
        What makes a story special is how you tell it. We want to hear stories from people from
        all sorts of backgrounds. Don’t just tell your story to your friends – tell the nation.

        Getting started … Starting is often the hardest part. Here are some suggestions that
        can make it easier.
 10
        It doesn’t have to be perfect from the start. Everyone has to try things out:
        [ – X – ] comedians tell their jokes in different ways; football managers change
        their teams. Don’t worry, [ – 24 – ], if you need to change your story [ – 25 – ]
        you’ve written it down.

 15     Start with a plan. Think about your story [ – 26 – ] telling it. A plan gives a shape to
        your story and helps you capture your ideas.

        Try talking. If you are discouraged by a blank sheet of paper [ – 27 – ] you use your
        mobile every day why not record your first thoughts onto your voicemail – imagine you
        are phoning a friend and leaving a message about a great idea you’ve had. [ – 28 – ] listen
        to your thoughts and see if they still sound good.

 20     Do you like drawing? Why not draw a picture of what you are thinking about?

        Lists are good – you can write them down by hand or make them on the computer.
        If you write your ideas down, why not put each idea on a small card? You can then move
        the different sections of your writing around until you are happy with the order.

        Try using a photo or something that’s really important to you as a starting point.
 25     Put it in front of you and record or write down your memories and feelings.

        Talk to yourself! Why not ask yourself a series of questions – What was the most
        memorable time of your life? Who and what has surprised you in your life?

        It’s really important to review your work. If you’re a bit nervous about sharing
        your writing, try reading it out loud as this will help you to hear when pieces of text
 30     don’t sound right.

        I hope this advice will help you get started with your story and that you enter
        the competition.

        Good luck!

       Papa Westray has a population of 70 and no secondary school.                  Westray,
 home to more than 600 residents, has 70 pupils at the Junior High School and nine full-time
 teachers. The flight is the shortest scheduled flight in the world. The average flight time is
 96 seconds but with favourable winds the journey can take less than one minute. The record
 is 58 seconds.

       The flight is a popular tourism route for many visitors to Scotland. It is, however,
 essential for the residents who live, work or do business in the Orkneys. The flight will make
 sure that the children who live on Papa Westray can continue to go to school through the
 winter months. The flight will take the pupils until the end of term, on 22 December. After that
 date, their normal ferry service will return.
