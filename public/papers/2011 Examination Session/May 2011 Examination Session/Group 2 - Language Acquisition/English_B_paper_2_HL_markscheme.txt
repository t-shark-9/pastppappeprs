These notes are not intended to replace the published criteria but to supplement them in some instances.

These notes are intended to define the top mark of the scale in this examination. The phrase,
“a good answer”, is intended to refer to scripts which are likely to be placed in the 9 to 10 band
of descriptors. Scripts should be marked proportionately lower to the degree to which they fail to
meet these requirements.

In each case, good answers will meet most, though not necessarily all, of the following requirements.

1.    Write a letter to one of your favourite literary characters in which you tell him/her how
      his/her thoughts and actions have affected your understanding of love. Remember to mention
      the name of the book.

      Written interaction – formal – letter

      A good answer
      • will adopt a formal letter format (address(es), the date, greetings, closing salutation, etc.)
      • will adopt a register appropriate for a letter to the chosen character
      • will focus mainly on how the character’s thoughts and actions affected the writer’s
        perception of love
      • will provide specific examples from the candidate’s experience
      • will mention the literary work in which the character’s thoughts and actions appear.


2.    Young people have a love-hate relationship with TV reality shows. Your teacher has set this
      as the topic of your next essay. Write an essay discussing the positive and negative aspects of
      reality shows.

      Argument/balanced – semi-formal to formal – essay

      A good answer
      • will adopt a semi-formal to formal register; may have limited informal asides
      • may have a title
      • will include formal aspects of an essay (introduction, body and conclusion with supporting
        details and examples)
      • will discuss positive and negative aspects of reality shows; if the candidate focuses entirely
        on either the positive or the negative aspects, the maximum mark for Criterion C should be 6
      • may personalize the topic somewhat; this should be rewarded.
                                               –4–           M11/2/ABENG/HP2/ENG/TZ0/XX/M


3.   As one of your CAS activities, you have decided to organize a summer drama camp for
     IB Diploma students at your school. Write a brochure in which you encourage students to
     join the camp and describe the activities you have planned and their benefits.

     Imaginative/descriptive – semi-formal to informal – brochure

     A good answer
     • will adopt a semi-formal to informal register
     • may incorporate aspects of a brochure: bullets, sub-headings, etc.; this should be rewarded
     • will clearly explain the summer camp’s drama activities
     • will persuasively explain how participation in the event will benefit students
     • may have flashes of humour; this should be rewarded
     • may include an evocative description; this should be rewarded.


4.   A famous person visited your town. As a member of your school’s Journalism Club, you
     interviewed this person and asked about what s/he does to support humanitarian causes.
     Write an article based on this interview to be published in your school magazine.

     Reported spoken interaction – semi-formal to formal – magazine article

     A good answer
     • will have a title and the name of the author
     • will adopt a semi-formal to formal register and style
     • will begin with an appropriate introduction
     • will successfully interpret information from the interview into written form
     • will not be a transcript of an interview; a verbatim transcript should not be awarded more
       than 4 under Criterion B
     • will clearly explain the interviewee’s support of a humanitarian cause
     • may have flashes of humour
     • may incorporate brief quotations from the interview; this should be rewarded under
       Criterion B, especially if skillfully handled.


5.   Your school’s Student Council is looking for a restaurant in which to hold the senior class
     dinner. You have a few restaurants in mind which you think everyone will like. Write a
     review of at least three restaurants to be presented at the next Student Council meeting.

     Analysis and critique – semi-formal to informal – review

     A good answer
     • will adopt a semi-formal to informal register
     • will discuss the services provided by the three restaurants and compare them (quality and
       type of menu, price range, parking, etc.); if the candidate focuses entirely on either one or
       two restaurants, the maximum mark for Criterion C should be 6
     • will mainly concern itself with the appropriateness of the restaurants for the senior school
       dinner (accessibility for the physically challenged students, ethnic options, dress code, etc.)
     • may use a system of ratings, for example, stars; this should be rewarded.

     Note: Candidates will most probably use the form of a journalistic review; those who present
           the required information in the form of a talk/speech should not be penalized.
                                               –5–          M11/2/ABENG/HP2/ENG/TZ0/XX/M


6.   Your parents and the parents of your best friend have agreed that, before you start university,
     you will both take a gap year with all expenses paid. Write an e-mail to your best friend
     suggesting the ways in which the two of you could spend this time.

     Written interaction – informal – e-mail
