Write an essay on one of the following. You must base your answer on the cultural options or literary
options you have studied in class. References to other subjects or literary works are permissible but should
not form the main body of your answer.

Language and culture

1.    We communicate differently (what we say, and how we say it) depending on where we are and who
      we are with. Discuss this statement using examples from your study of this option.


2.    Discuss, with reference to your study of this option, the positive and negative consequences of
      second language immersion.



Media and culture

3.    Journalism tends to focus on the negative. With reference to your study of this option, consider why
      this is and whether it is justified.


4.    Should there be a ban on advertising to children? Discuss this with reference to your study of
      this option.



Future issues

5.    With reference to your study of this option, are we better to prepare for the problems of tomorrow or
      concentrate on the problems of the world today?



Global issues

6.    How can nations best help one another in terms of global aid? Discuss, with reference to one or two
      particular examples in your study of this option.



Social issues

7.    Being “different” (for example, one’s race, class, sexual identity, or physical limitations) can often
      put a person at a social disadvantage. With reference to your study of this option discuss this idea and
      possible solutions to this problem.

      two of the works you have studied.
