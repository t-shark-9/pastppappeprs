General Marking Instructions
Subject Details:               Computer Science SL Paper 1 Markscheme
Mark Allocation

Section A:      Candidates are required to answer all questions. Total 30 marks.
Section B:      Candidates are required to answer all questions. Total 40 marks.
                Maximum total = 70 marks.

General

A markscheme often has more specific points worthy of a mark than the total allows. This is intentional.
Do not award more than the maximum marks allowed for that part of a question.

When deciding upon alternative answers by candidates to those given in the markscheme, consider the
following points:

            Each statement worth one point has a separate line and the end is signified by means of a
             semi-colon (;).

            An alternative answer or wording is indicated in the markscheme by a “/”; either wording can
             be accepted.

            Words in ( … ) in the markscheme are not necessary to gain the mark.

            If the candidate’s answer has the same meaning or can be clearly interpreted as being the
             same as that in the markscheme then award the mark.

            Mark positively. Give candidates credit for what they have achieved and for what they have
             got correct, rather than penalizing them for what they have not achieved or what they have got
             wrong.

            Occasionally, a part of a question may require a calculation whose answer is required for
             subsequent parts. If an error is made in the first part then it should be penalized.

                                              SECTION A                              Total: [30 marks]

1.   Award up to [2 marks max].
     A compiler produces an executable / machine code / object code file whereas an
     interpreter compiles and executes each line of code without saving a compiled copy.

     A compiler does not execute any code until the translation process is complete
     whereas an interpreter executes each line of code as soon as it has translated it.

     A compiler will not run any code until all syntax errors are eliminated whereas an
     interpreter will translate and execute each line of code until it encounters a
     syntax error.                                                                          [2 marks]


2.   Note: The answers in part (a) and part (b) are to be 6-bit numbers. If a student has
           used a different number of bits but has the correct numbers, award [0 marks]
           for part (a) and [1 mark] for follow-through on part (b).

     (a)   010001;                                                                           [1 mark]

     (c)   Award [1 mark] for each block.
           1010 0011                                                                        [2 marks]


3.   (a)   Allocates an appropriate section / amount of memory;
           For each program (currently) running;
           Do not accept answers describing the management of hard drives.                  [2 marks]

     (b)   Deals with passwords / access levels;
           So that only the appropriate person(s) can work with particular files;
           Do not accept answers describing firewall and anti-virus functions.              [2 marks]


4.   Defragmentation software places sections of the same file next to each other;
     To allow for faster access (to that file);
     Do not credit answers which imply that extra space is created.                         [2 marks]


5.   (a)   (double)(11 % 2) / 2 = 1/2 = 0.5 ;                                                [1 mark]

     (b)   To prevent a possible “division by zero” / run-time/execution error / program
           from crashing;                                                                    [1 mark]

     (c)   Award up to [2 marks max].
           Because (otherwise) the operator “/” will perform integer division;
           And return the answer 0;
           And the method has to return a double;
           The cast (double) ensures that (x % y) is of type double;
           So real division is carried out;
                                     –5–             M11/5/COMSC/SP1/ENG/TZ0/XX/M


So the cast / (double) converts the answer to a double;                  [2 marks]

6.   Data could be compressed (before sending);
     Which means less data to send;

     High speed lines / fibre optics / dedicated lines could be used;
     Which allow faster transmission than “traditional lines”;
     In lieu of suggesting a type of high-speed cable, allow good explanations of how
     increased bandwidth means that more bits can sent in a given time interval and
     thus the time required to transmit the file will be reduced.                           [4 marks]


7.   (a)   Possible answers include:
           .jpg/.jpeg, .bmp, .png, .gif, .tif/.tiff, .svg…;                                 [1 mark]

           response, up to [2 marks max]. Possible answers include:

           Do NOT accept any statements suggesting that bitmap files are smaller or
           compressed.

8.   Award marks as follows up to [3 marks max].
     Award [1 mark] for describing the bus network topology;
     Award [1 mark] for describing the star network topology;
     Award [1 mark] for comparing the two topologies;

     Bus topology:    Each computer/server connected to one single bus cable through
                      some connector;
                      Easy to add new machines, but the traffic on the cable reduces the
                      performances;
                      One wire only, hence cheap to implement;
                      High risk of failure (if the cable breaks all the network breaks);
                      High costs of maintenance;
                      Adequate for LAN only;
                      A message is sent on the bus and only the machine with the
                      identical IP address as in the message filters it and accepts it;

     Star topology:   Each machine of the network has a one-to-one connection to a hub
                      in the network;
                      Easy to add new machine to the network;
                      The hub acts as a repeater of the signal, and can send it to long
                      distances;
                      The hub is the only point of failure;
                      Easy to maintain;
                      Adequate for LAN, with possibility of getting out of the LAN
                      through the hub/router;
                      A message is sent directly to the machine, passing through the hub;   [3 marks]

            Effect:
            Strings of odd length (e.g. radar) are treated differently than before;

            Explanation:
            The original code does not check the character in the ‘pivot’ position;
            The modified version checks that for i = j the corresponding character is the same;
            All the other cases are treated similarly because the test i <= j extends the test i < j; [3 marks]
