Please start each question on a new page. You are advised to show all working, where possible. Where an
answer is wrong, some marks may be given for correct method, provided this is shown by written working.
Solutions found from a graphic display calculator should be supported by suitable working, e.g. if graphs
are used to find a solution, you should sketch these as part of your answer.

      Part A

      A university required all Science students to study one language for one year.
      A survey was carried out at the university amongst the 150 Science students.
      These students all studied one of either French, Spanish or Russian. The results of
      the survey are shown below.

      Ludmila decides to use the χ 2 test at the 5 % level of significance to determine
      whether the choice of language is independent of gender.

      (a)   State Ludmila’s null hypothesis.                                                       [1 mark]

      (b)   Write down the number of degrees of freedom.                                           [1 mark]

      (c)   Find the expected frequency for the females studying Spanish.                          [2 marks]

      (d)   Use your graphic display calculator to find the χ 2 test statistic for this data.      [2 marks]

      (e)   State whether Ludmila accepts the null hypothesis. Give a reason for your
            answer.                                                                                [2 marks]
