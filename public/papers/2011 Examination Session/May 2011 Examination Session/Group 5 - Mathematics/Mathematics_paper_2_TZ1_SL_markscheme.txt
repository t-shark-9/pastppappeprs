                                        Instructions to Examiners

Abbreviations

M     Marks awarded for attempting to use a correct Method; working must be seen.

(M)   Marks awarded for Method; may be implied by correct subsequent working.

A     Marks awarded for an Answer or for Accuracy; often dependent on preceding M marks.

(A)   Marks awarded for an Answer or for Accuracy; may be implied by correct subsequent working.

R     Marks awarded for clear Reasoning.

N     Marks awarded for correct answers if no working shown.

AG    Answer given in the question and so no marks are awarded.

Using the markscheme

1     General

      Mark according to scoris instructions and the document “Mathematics SL : Guidance for e-marking
      May 2011”. It is essential that you read this document before you start marking. In particular, please
      note the following.

      Marks must be recorded using the annotation stamps. Please check that you are entering marks for the
      right question.

      • If a part is completely correct, (and gains all the ‘must be seen’ marks), use the ticks with
        numbers to stamp full marks.
      • If a part is completely wrong, stamp A0 by the final answer.
      • If a part gains anything else, it must be recorded using all the annotations.

      All the marks will be added and recorded by scoris.

2     Method and Answer/Accuracy marks

      • Do not automatically award full marks for a correct answer; all working must be checked,
        and marks awarded according to the markscheme.
      • It is generally not possible to award M0 followed by A1, as A mark(s) depend on the preceding
        M mark(s), if any. An exception to this rule is when work for M1 is missing, as opposed to
        incorrect (see point 4).
      • Where M and A marks are noted on the same line, e.g. M1A1, this usually means M1 for an
        attempt to use an appropriate method (e.g. substitution into a formula) and A1 for using the
        correct values.
      • Where there are two or more A marks on the same line, they may be awarded independently; so if
        the first value is incorrect, but the next two are correct, award A0A1A1.
      • Where the markscheme specifies (M2), N3, etc., do not split the marks, unless there is a note.
        Once a correct answer to a question or part-question is seen, ignore further working.
      • M marks are generally awarded for a valid attempt at answering the question. The working here
        does not need to be correct. In particular, where this is not the first M mark awarded, the
        markscheme may use the word “their”, to indicate that even if there are previous errors, the M
        mark may still be awarded. A common example of this is where candidates need to derive an
        equation and then the markscheme says “attempt to solve their equation”; if their equation is
        wrong and as long as it is not simpler than the correct one, then the M mark is awarded.
                                                  –4–            M11/5/MATME/SP2/ENG/TZ1/XX/M


3   N marks
    If no working shown, award N marks for correct answers. In this case, ignore mark breakdown (M, A, R).
    • Do not award a mixture of N and other marks.
    • There may be fewer N marks available than the total of M, A and R marks; this is deliberate as it
      penalizes candidates for not following the instruction to show their working.
    • There may not be a direct relationship between the N marks and the implied marks. There are
      times when all the marks are implied, but the N marks are not the full marks: this indicates that we
      want to see some of the working, without specifying what.
    • For consistency within the markscheme, N marks are noted for every part, even when these match
      the mark breakdown.
    • If a candidate has incorrect working, which somehow results in a correct answer, do not award the
      N marks for this correct answer. However, if the candidate has indicated (usually by crossing out)
      that the working is to be ignored, award the N marks for the correct answer.

4   Implied and must be seen marks
    Implied marks appear in brackets e.g. (M1).
    • Implied marks can only be awarded if correct/appropriate work is seen or implied in subsequent
      working. There are questions where some working is required, but as it is accepted that not
      everyone will write the same steps, all the marks are implied, but the N marks are not the full
      marks for the question. (A correct final answer does not necessarily mean that the implied marks
      are all awarded).
    • Normally the work is seen or implied in the next line.
    • Where there is an (M1) followed by A1 for each correct value, if no working shown, one correct
      value is sufficient evidence to award the (M1).
    Must be seen marks appear without brackets e.g. M1.
    • Must be seen marks can only be awarded if correct/appropriate work is seen.
    • If a must be seen mark is not awarded because work is missing (as opposed to M0 or A0 for
      incorrect work) all subsequent marks may be awarded if appropriate.

5   Follow through marks (only applied after an error is made)
    Follow through (FT) marks are awarded where an incorrect answer from one part of a question is
    used correctly in subsequent part(s) or subpart(s). Usually, to award FT marks, there must be
    working present and not just a final answer based on an incorrect answer to a previous part.
    However, if the only marks awarded in a subpart are for the answer (i.e. there is no working
    expected), then FT marks should be awarded if appropriate.
    • Within a question part, once an error is made, no further A marks can be awarded for work which
      uses the error, but M marks may be awarded if appropriate. (However, as noted above, if an
      A mark is not awarded because work is missing, all subsequent marks may be awarded
      if appropriate).
    • If the question becomes much simpler because of an error then use discretion to award fewer
      FT marks.
    • If the error leads to an inappropriate value (e.g. probability greater than 1, use of r > 1 for the sum
      of an infinite GP, sin θ = 1.5 , non integer value where integer required), do not award the mark(s)
      for the final answer(s).
    • Exceptions to this rule will be explicitly noted on the markscheme.
    • If a candidate makes an error in one part, but gets the correct answer(s) to subsequent part(s),
      award marks as appropriate, unless the question says hence. It is often possible to use a different
      approach in subsequent parts that does not depend on the answer to previous parts.
    • FT and “show that” questions : In a “show that” question, if an error leads to not showing the
      required answer, award FT marks as usual but do not award the final A1.
                                                  –5–            M11/5/MATME/SP2/ENG/TZ1/XX/M


6    Mis-read
     If a candidate incorrectly copies information from the question, this is a mis-read (MR). Apply a MR
     penalty of 1 mark to that question. Award the marks as usual and then stamp MR against the answer.
     Scoris will automatically deduct 1 mark from the question total. A candidate should be penalized only
     once for a particular mis-read. Do not stamp MR again for that question, unless the candidate makes
     another mis-read.
     • If the question becomes much simpler because of the MR, then use discretion to award
       fewer marks.
     • If the MR leads to an inappropriate value (e.g. probability greater than 1, use of r > 1 for the sum
       of an infinite GP, sin θ = 1.5 , non integer value where integer required), do not award the mark(s)
       for the final answer(s).
     • Miscopying of candidates’ own work does not constitute a misread, it is an error.

7    Discretionary marks (d)
     An examiner uses discretion to award a mark on the rare occasions when the markscheme does not
     cover the work seen. The mark should be labelled (d) and a brief note written next to the mark
     explaining this decision.

8    Alternative methods
     Candidates will sometimes use methods other than those in the markscheme. Unless the question
     specifies a method, other correct methods should be marked in line with the markscheme. If in doubt,
     contact your team leader for advice.
     • Alternative methods for complete questions are indicated by METHOD 1, METHOD 2, etc.
     • Alternative solutions for part-questions are indicated by EITHER . . . OR.
     • Where possible, alignment will also be used to assist examiners in identifying where these
       alternatives start and finish.

9    Alternative forms
     Unless the question specifies otherwise, accept equivalent forms.
     • As this is an international examination, accept all alternative forms of notation.
     • In the markscheme, equivalent numerical and algebraic forms will generally be written in
       brackets immediately following the answer.
     • In the markscheme, simplified answers, (which candidates often do not write in examinations),
       will generally appear in brackets. Marks should be awarded for either the form preceding the
       bracket or the form in brackets (if it is seen).

10   Accuracy of Answers
     If the level of accuracy is specified in the question, a mark will be allocated for giving the answer to
     the required accuracy.
     • Rounding errors: only applies to final answers not to intermediate steps.
     • Level of accuracy: when this is not specified in the question the general rule applies to final
       answers: unless otherwise stated in the question all numerical answers must be given exactly or
       correct to three significant figures.
     Candidates should be penalized once only IN THE PAPER for an accuracy error (AP). Award the
     marks as usual then stamp (AP) against the answer. Scoris will automatically deduct 1 mark from the
     paper total. Please see section E in the guidance document which clearly explains, with the use of
     screenshots, how this works in scoris.
                                                    –6–            M11/5/MATME/SP2/ENG/TZ1/XX/M


     • If a final correct answer is incorrectly rounded, apply the AP.
     • If the level of accuracy is not specified in the question, apply the AP for correct final answers not
       given to three significant figures.
     • Intermediate values are sometimes written as 3.24(741). This indicates that using 3.24 (or 3.25)
       is acceptable, but the more accurate value is 3.24741. The digits in brackets are not required for
       the marks. If candidates work with fewer than three significant figures, this could lead to an AP.
     • Do not accept unfinished numerical answers such as 3/0.1 (unless otherwise stated). As a rule,
       numerical answers with more than one part (such as fractions) should be given using integers
       (e.g. 6/8).

     If there is no working shown, and there is an accuracy error (i.e. answers are given to the correct two
     significant figures, or incorrectly rounded but given to three significant figures), apply the AP with the
     N marks for these answers. However, do not accept answers to one significant figure without
     working.


11   Calculators

     A GDC is required for paper 2, but calculators with symbolic manipulation features (e.g. TI-89) are
     not allowed.

     Calculator notation
     The Mathematics SL guide says:
         Students must always use correct mathematical notation, not calculator notation.
     Do not accept final answers written using calculator notation. However, do not penalize the use of
     calculator notation in the working.


12   Style

     The markscheme aims to present answers using good communication, e.g. if the question asks to find
     the value of k, the markscheme will say k = 3 , but the marks will be for the correct value 3 – there is
     usually no need for the “ k = ”. In these cases, it is also usually acceptable to have another variable,
     as long as there is no ambiguity in the question, e.g. if the question asks to find the value of p and of q,
     then the student answer needs to be clear. Generally, the only situation where the full answer is
     required is in a question which asks for equations – in this case the markscheme will say “must be
     an equation”.

     The markscheme often uses words to describe what the marks are for, followed by examples, using the
     e.g. notation. These examples are not exhaustive, and examiners should check what candidates have
     written, to see if they satisfy the description. Where these marks are M marks, the examples may
     include ones using poor notation or incorrect work, to indicate what is acceptable.


13   Crossed out work

     If a candidate has drawn a line through work on their examination script, or in some other way
     crossed out their work, do not award any marks for that work.


14   More than one solution

     Where a candidate offers two or more different answers to the same question, the candidate knows one
     of the answers must be wrong or relatively inferior. This is likely to be an effort by the candidate to
     gain an advantage, hoping that the examiner will give credit for the right answer while the wrong or
     inferior answer is ignored. In such circumstances an examiner should only mark the first
     response unless the candidate indicates otherwise.
