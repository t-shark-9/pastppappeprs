Mark Allocation

Candidates are required to answer ALL questions [20 marks] for question 1, [20 marks] for question 2
and [30 marks] for question 3. Maximum total = [70 marks].

General

A markscheme often has more specific points worthy of a mark than the total allows. This is intentional.
Do not award more than the maximum marks allowed for that part of a question.

When deciding upon alternative answers by candidates to those given in the markscheme, consider the
following points:

          Each statement worth one point has a separate line and the end is signified by means of a
           semi-colon (;).

          An alternative answer or wording is indicated in the markscheme by a “/”; either wording can
           be accepted.

          Words in ( … ) in the markscheme are not necessary to gain the mark.

          If the candidate’s answer has the same meaning or can be clearly interpreted as being the
           same as that in the markscheme then award the mark.

          Mark positively. Give candidates credit for what they have achieved, and for what they have
           got correct, rather than penalizing them for what they have not achieved or what they have got
           wrong.

          Occasionally, a part of a question may require a calculation whose answer is required for
           subsequent parts. If an error is made in the first part then it should be penalized.

                  // global declaration of cityArray
                  public String mostPopCity(City[] cityArray)
                  {
                    City temp;
                    temp = cityArray[0];

                  Example answer 2 (using local variables):
                  public String mostPopCity(City[] cityArray)
                  {
                    int max = 0;
                    String name = "";

Question 2 continued

     (f)   Do NOT accept anything that is clearly not a bubble sort.

           Example Answer:
           Starting from position 0 in the cityArray/list;
           And for the whole length of the array/list;
           Objects at consecutive indexes i and i + 1 are compared for their field
           population;
           And if the value of object i is bigger than the value of object i + 1 the two
           objects are swapped;
           Repeat the process as long as there are pairs of objects that need to be swapped;
           The process terminates by performing an extra run when no further swaps are
           needed;

           Also, accept less technical descriptions, the question does not ask for detail or
           a low level algorithm.

           An example is shown below.
           Run through array comparing side-by-side values;
           Swap if needed;
           Thus Bubbling the largest to the end;
           Reduce array by 1;
           Repeat;
           Until only one value left;                                                          [6 marks]

                  which is essential for critical systems;

                  (Wi-Fi) could allow airport / security personnel;
                  To access the network;                                                  [2 marks]

           For example, the baggage system:
           Computerized systems move bags around the airport very quickly;
           Allows passengers to make connections / avoids loss of bags;
           However, if system breaks down there will be chaos;
           As personnel to help will be limited;
