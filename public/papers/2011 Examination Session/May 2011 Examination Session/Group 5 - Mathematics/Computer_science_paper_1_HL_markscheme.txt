General Marking Instructions

Subject Details:               Computer Science HL Paper 1 Markscheme
Mark Allocation

Section A:      Candidates are required to answer all questions. Total 40 marks.
Section B:      Candidates are required to answer all questions. Total 60 marks.
                Maximum total = 100 marks.

General

A markscheme often has more specific points worthy of a mark than the total allows. This is intentional.
Do not award more than the maximum marks allowed for that part of a question.

When deciding upon alternative answers by candidates to those given in the markscheme, consider the
following points:

            Each statement worth one point has a separate line and the end is signified by means of a
             semi-colon (;).

            An alternative answer or wording is indicated in the markscheme by a “/”; either wording can
             be accepted.

            Words in ( … ) in the markscheme are not necessary to gain the mark.

            If the candidate’s answer has the same meaning or can be clearly interpreted as being the
             same as that in the markscheme then award the mark.

            Mark positively. Give candidates credit for what they have achieved and for what they have
             got correct, rather than penalizing them for what they have not achieved or what they have got
             wrong.

            Occasionally, a part of a question may require a calculation whose answer is required for
             subsequent parts. If an error is made in the first part then it should be penalized.

                                              SECTION A                                Total: [40 marks]

1.   Award up to [2 marks max].

     Example answers:
     A compiler produces an executable / machine code / object code file whereas an
     interpreter compiles and executes each line of code without saving a compiled copy.

     A compiler does not execute any code until the translation process is complete
     whereas an interpreter executes each line of code as soon as it has translated it.

     A compiler will not run any code until all syntax errors are eliminated whereas an
     interpreter will translate and execute each line of code until it encounters a
     syntax error.                                                                            [2 marks]

     (c)   Award up to [2 marks max].
           Because (otherwise) the operator “/” will perform integer division;
           And return the answer 0;
           And the method has to return a double;
           The cast (double) ensures that (x % y) is of type double;
           So real division is carried out/better accuracy;
           So the cast / (double) converts the answer to a double;                         [2 marks]

                  Made possible by patient and staff alerts being interactive;
                  Must react immediately to any changes/safety-critical;                        [2 marks]

      (b)   Award marks as follows, up to [4 marks max].
            Award [1–2 marks] if the relative importance of the systems are addressed.
            Award [3–4 marks] if the relative importance of all three of the systems are
            addressed and examples are also given.

            The batch and on-line would cause inconvenience but would not be critical;
            Could perhaps be routed through other systems;
            Or suspended until system is back on-line;
            Real-time system would be critical;
            Could cause patient deaths;
            Therefore must have immediate back-up system;                                       [4 marks]

      (c)   The precision / accuracy will be increased;
            (But) the range will be decreased;                                                  [2 marks]

19.   (a)   Award up to [2 marks max].
            Standard protocols are rules/procedures;
            Governing the transmission of data;
            That allow data to be correctly received;                                            [2 marks]

      (b)   Award [1 mark] for each difference, up to [2 marks max].
            Data security
            Deals with preventing the data being intercepted by a third party (or equivalent);
            Ensures that the people who must have access to data are the only ones who
            can have access to it;
            Whilst
            Data integrity is concerned with the data not being altered during transmission;
            Making sure that the data is complete and not corrupted;                             [2 marks]

      (c)   (i)    Award up to [2 marks max].
                   Data is not sent as one unit / all together;
                   But is divided / sent in separate packets;
                   Each packet is formatted, addressed and routed;
                   Packets sent (possibly) by different routes;
                   Making the complete message more difficult to intercept;                      [2 marks]

            (ii)   Individual packets can be sent by different routes;
                   So if one route is down, others can be used;                                  [2 marks]

      (d)   As each packet contains control data / packet sequence number;
            Receiving computer can combine packets in correct order;                             [2 marks]
