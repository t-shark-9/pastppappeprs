            type of processing.

18.   Fixed-point binary numbers can be used to represent fractions. Consider a fixed-point
      representation that uses 8 bits in total, 6 bits for the integer part and 2 bits for the
      fraction part.

            described above.                                                                        [1 mark]

      (c)   Describe the effects of increasing the number of bits in the fraction part (the total
            number of bits remains at 8).                                                           [2 marks]

      (d)   Convert to decimal the floating-point binary number 010011  0100, if 6 bits are
            allocated to the mantissa and 4 bits to the exponent.                                   [2 marks]

      (e)   Convert the decimal number 2 14 to a normalized floating-point binary number,
            if 6 bits are allocated to the mantissa and 4 bits to the exponent.                     [3 marks]
