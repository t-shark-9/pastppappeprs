Please start each question on a new page. Full marks are not necessarily awarded for a correct answer with
no working. Answers must be supported by working and/or explanations. In particular, solutions found
from a graphic display calculator should be supported by suitable working, e.g. if graphs are used to find
a solution, you should sketch these as part of your answer. Where an answer is incorrect, some marks may
be given for a correct method, provided this is shown by written working. You are therefore advised to show
all working.

      The weights of the oranges produced by a farm may be assumed to be normally
      distributed with mean 205 grams and standard deviation 10 grams.

      (a)   Find the probability that a randomly chosen orange weighs more than 200 grams.      [2 marks]

      (b)   Five of these oranges are selected at random to be put into a bag. Find the
            probability that the combined weight of the five oranges is less than 1 kilogram.   [4 marks]

      (c)   The farm also produces lemons whose weights may be assumed to be normally
            distributed with mean 75 grams and standard deviation 3 grams. Find the
            probability that the weight of a randomly chosen orange is more than three times
            the weight of a randomly chosen lemon.                                              [5 marks]

      The discrete random variable X has the distribution Geo ( p ) . The value of p is
      believed to be 0.3. In order to test this belief a random sample of 100 values of X
      was obtained, with the following results.

      (b)   Carry out a χ 2 -test at the 5 % significance level and, giving a reason,
            state your conclusion.                                                              [9 marks]

      Ten friends try a diet which is claimed to reduce weight. They each weigh themselves
      before starting the diet, and after a month on the diet, with the following results.

       Weight after (kg)  66.2 67.4 70.4 65.9 55.2 69.2 71.4 59.9 68.2 58.9

      (a)   Determine unbiased estimates of the mean and variance of the loss in weight
            achieved over the month by people using this diet.                                    [5 marks]

      (b)   (i)    State suitable hypotheses for testing whether or not this diet causes a mean
                   loss in weight.

		          (ii)   Determine the value of a suitable statistic for testing your hypotheses.

		          (iii) Find the 1 % critical value for your statistic and state your conclusion.       [6 marks]

      (c)   One of the friends calculates a confidence interval for the mean loss in weight
            obtained by people using this diet for a month and he obtains [0.26 , 3.36] .
            Find the confidence level of this interval.                                           [6 marks]

      The random variable X has a Poisson distribution with unknown mean µ . It is
      required to test the hypotheses

                                    H 0 : µ = 3 against H1 : µ ≠ 3 .

      Let S denote the sum of 10 randomly chosen values of X . The critical region is
      defined as ( S ≤ 22) ∪ ( S ≥ 38) .

      (a)   Calculate the significance level of the test.                                         [5 marks]

      (b)   Given that the value of µ is actually 2.5, determine the probability of a
            Type II error.                                                                        [5 marks]
