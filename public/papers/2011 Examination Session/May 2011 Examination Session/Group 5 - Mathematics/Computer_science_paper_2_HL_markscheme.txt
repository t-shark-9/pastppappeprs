General Marking Instructions
Subject Details:             Computer Science HL Paper 2 Markscheme
Mark Allocation

Candidates are required to answer ALL questions [20 marks] for question 1, [20 marks] for question 2,
[20 marks] for question 3 and [40 marks] for question 4. Maximum total = [100 marks].

General

A markscheme often has more specific points worthy of a mark than the total allows. This is intentional.
Do not award more than the maximum marks allowed for that part of a question.

When deciding upon alternative answers by candidates to those given in the markscheme, consider the
following points:

          Each statement worth one point has a separate line and the end is signified by means of a
           semi-colon (;).

          An alternative answer or wording is indicated in the markscheme by a “/”; either wording can
           be accepted.

          Words in ( … ) in the markscheme are not necessary to gain the mark.

          If the candidate’s answer has the same meaning or can be clearly interpreted as being the
           same as that in the markscheme then award the mark.

          Mark positively. Give candidates credit for what they have achieved, and for what they have
           got correct, rather than penalising them for what they have not achieved or what they have got
           wrong.

          Occasionally, a part of a question may require a calculation whose answer is required for
           subsequent parts. If an error is made in the first part then it should be penalized.

1.   (a)   Award up to [3 marks max].
           Encapsulation;
           Data hiding;
           This data cannot be (directly) changed / accessed outside of this class (as the
           data is “private”);
           As data can only be changed via the transformer methods / viewed using the
           accessor methods;
           Thus preventing accidental alteration of data;
           Creates abstraction of the object;
           Enhances security / protects the integrity of the data;                             [3 marks]
     (b)   Award marks as follows up to [3 marks max].
           Award [1 mark] for signature line with 2 parameters;

           Of Seat objects;
           With 4 rows and 10 columns / 4 ×10 / 10 × 4 ;
           Also, award [3 marks] for code that sufficiently shows the above, such as
           Seat[][] seatArray = new Seat[4][10]; .                                             [3 marks]
     (d)   Award marks as follows up to [5 marks max].
           Award [1 mark] for initializing and incrementing the counter;
           Award [1 mark] for correct nested loops;

           used (do not allow if (seatArray[x][y] == null);
           Award [1 mark] for returning the counter;
           Example answer:
           public int seatsRemaining()
           {
             int count = 0;

Question 1 continued

     (e)   Award marks as follows up to [4 marks max].
           Award [1 mark] for initializing the reply / returning “no seats” message;
           Award [1 mark] for correct loop;
           Award [2 marks] for correct comparison for both window seats, award only
           [1 mark] if accessor is not used;
           Award [1 mark] for returning the seat name;

           Note: For parts (d) and (e) only penalise once if the accessor methods are omitted.

           Example answer:
           public String freeWindowSeat()
           {
             String reply = "No Seats Remaining";
             for (int x = 0; x < 10; x = x + 1)
             {
               if (seatArray[x][0].getPassengerName() == null)
               {
                  return seatArray[x][0].getSeatName();
               }
               if (seatArray[x][3].getPassengerName() == null)
               {
                  return seatArray[x][3].getSeatName();
               }
             }
             return reply;
           }

           Full marks can also be gained using a nested loop.                                    [4 marks]

     (f)   Award up to [2 marks max].
           A three-dimensional array could be used;
           Assuming both levels held the same number of seats;
           With the third dimension representing the level;
           Accept code such as Seat[][][] seatArray = new Seat[4][10][2];
           for [2 marks].

           Making the array larger e.g. the number of columns could be increased;
           To allow for the extra seats in the upper deck;

           A second array could be used;
           Especially for the upper deck;

           For any theoretically possible but improbable structure award [1 mark].               [2 marks]

                                                                                       Total: [20 marks]

           Award [1 mark] for pointers between nodes (don’t accept plain lines);
           Award [1 mark] for correct position of first (or equivalent) and null (or
           equivalent);

                                                                                               [2 marks]

     (b)   Award marks as follows if the student’s meaning is clear either through the
           description or through the diagrams, up to [2 marks max].
           Award [1 mark] if the correct position is found;
           Award [1 mark] if the previous node’s next pointer is changed to point to the
           new node;
           Award [1 mark] if the new node’s next pointer points to the next node;

           Note: The pointers must be explicitly referred to in the description or clearly
           shown on the diagram.




                                                                                               [2 marks]

     (c)   Award marks either for an explanation or by showing the code.
           The constructor is called;
           The data “Xiao”, 1920, null is passed to the constructor;

           Node newNode = new Node(Xiao, 1920, null);                                          [2 marks]

Question 2 continued

     (e)   Award marks as follows up to [8 marks max].
           Award [1 mark] for use of temp variable (or equivalent);
           Award [1 mark] for use of previous variable (or equivalent);
           Award [2 marks] for each of the two elements in the loop (as shown below);
           Award [1 mark] for changing the value of temp to allow for traversal;
           Award [1 mark] for creation of a new node (with any pointer value);
           Award [1 mark] for identifying that there is more than one scenario (empty list /
           not empty list / first node etc.) and attempting to address them;
           Award [2 mark] for correctly placing new node for all scenarios and [1 mark]
           for successfully placing new node for just 1 of the scenarios;

           Example answer 1:
           public void addNode(String name, int year)
           {
             Node temp = first;
             Node previous = null;

               while (temp != null && temp.yearOfBirth < year) // or <=
               {
                 previous = temp;
                 temp = temp.next;
               }

               Node newNode = new Node(name, year, temp); //create new node

               if (previous == null) // if newNode becomes the first node
                                     // or empty list
               {
                 first = newNode;
               }
               else // otherwise
               {
                 previous.next = newNode;
               }
           }

           Notes:
           • Remember that we are testing the logic and not specifically the syntax.
           • The year comparison can be correctly placed within the loop.
           • There are alternatives to the previous variable
             (e.g. using temp.next != null where temp is equivalent to previous).



                                                                                               continued …

Question 2 continued

           Example answer2:
           public void addNode(String name, int year)
           {
           if (first == null) // empty list
           {

     (f)   (i)    BigO for removal is O(1);
                  Because the correct node is always pointed to by first / at the start of
                  the list / the method is independent of the number of nodes / has 1
                  assignment only;                                                             [2 marks]

           (ii)   BigO for addition is O(n);
                  Because the list might have to be traversed to the end / have to pass each
                  of the nodes currently in the list / number of comparisons is proportional
                  to the number of nodes;                                                      [2 marks]

3.   (a)   (i)    Award up to [2 marks max].
                  Award [1 mark] for the idea of going through the file in order / each
                  record in turn until the (correct) record is found;
                  Award [1 mark] for any further point from the list below:
                  Starting with the first record on the file;
                  The search item / ID number is searched for / compared;
                  Continues until the end of file (if record not found);
                  Or the end file is reached;                                                [2 marks]

           (ii)   Award up to [2 marks max].
                  Because the file is very large;
                  The search process could be slow;
                  With O(n) efficiency;
                  As records have to be inspected in the order they are stored;
                  So might have to inspect many records;                                     [2 marks]

     (b)   (i)    Award up to [4 marks max].
                  A calculation is performed / hash key produced;
                  On the key field / ID number;
                  Which gives/leads to/identifies the address of the record on the disk;
                  Access is direct / O(1);
                  Example of hash algorithm;
                  Describes use of hash table;
                  Possible collisions have to be taken care of;
                  Records would have to be of equal length;                                  [4 marks]

           (ii)   Must generate all of the record addresses in the file;
                  Should be fast (to calculate);
                  Should minimise collisions / accept no collisions;                         [3 marks]

     (c)   (i)    Award up to [2 marks max].
                  If you could hash the surname this would generate different
                  addresses/hashes;
                  Than those generated by the ID number;
                  Two hash tables would be needed;
                  Cannot hash for two different fields;                                      [2 marks]

           (ii)   Award up to [3 marks max].
                  Two indexes would be created;
                  One for the ID and one for the surname;
                  (User) can choose which index to use;
                  Each index would contain an entry for every search item/full index;
                  A search of the (appropriate) index would provide the memory location

           Award [1 mark] for a conclusion / summary / opinion;

           For example, the baggage system – there will be others (but only credit those
           systems that operate within an airport).
           Computerized systems move bags around the airport very quickly;
           Allows passengers to make connections / avoids loss of bags;
           However, if system breaks down there will be chaos;
           As personnel to help will be limited;
