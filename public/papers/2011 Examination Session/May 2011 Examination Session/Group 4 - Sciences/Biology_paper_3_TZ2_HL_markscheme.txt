General Marking Instructions

Subject Details:             Biology HL Paper 3 Markscheme
Mark Allocation

Candidates are required to answer questions from TWO of the Options [2  20 marks].
Maximum total = [40 marks]

1.   A markscheme often has more marking points than the total allows. This is intentional. Do not award
     more than the maximum marks allowed for part of a question.

2.   Each marking point has a separate line and the end is signified by means of a semicolon (;).

3.   An alternative answer or wording is indicated in the markscheme by a slash (/). Either wording can
     be accepted.

4.   Words in brackets ( ) in the markscheme are not necessary to gain the mark.

5.   Words that are underlined are essential for the mark.

6.   The order of marking points does not have to be as in the markscheme, unless stated otherwise.

7.   If the candidate’s answer has the same “meaning” or can be clearly interpreted as being of
     equivalent significance, detail and validity as that in the markscheme then award the mark.
     Where this point is considered to be particularly relevant in a question it is emphasized by
     writing OWTTE (or words to that effect).

8.   Occasionally, a part of a question may require an answer that is required for subsequent
     marking points. If an error is made in the first marking point then it should be penalized.

9.   Only consider units at the end of a calculation.
