1.    Follow the markscheme provided, award only whole marks and mark only in RED.

2.    Where a mark is awarded, a tick/check () must be placed in the text at the precise point where it
      becomes clear that the candidate deserves the mark. One tick to be shown for each mark awarded.

3.    Sometimes, careful consideration is required to decide whether or not to award a mark. In these cases
      write a brief annotation to explain your decision. You are encouraged to write comments where it
      helps clarity, especially for moderation and re-marking. It should be remembered that the script may
      be returned to the candidate.

4.    Unexplained symbols or personal codes/notations are unacceptable.

5.    Record marks in the right-hand margin against each mark allocation shown in square brackets e.g. [2].
      The total mark for a question must equal the number of ticks for the question.

6.    Do not circle sub-totals. Circle the total mark for the question in the right-hand margin at the end of
      the question.

7.    Where an answer to a part question is worth no marks, put a zero in the right-hand margin next to the
      square bracket.

8.    Where work is submitted on additional sheets the marks awarded should be shown as ticks and a note
      made on both the additional sheet and in the right-hand margin of the corresponding question part in
      the body of the script.

9.    For each Option: Add the totals for each question in the Option and write it in the Examiner column
                       on the cover sheet.
      Total:           Add the marks awarded and enter this in the box marked TOTAL in the
                       Examiner column on the cover sheet.

10.   After entering the marks on the cover sheet check your addition to ensure that you have not made an
      error. Check also that you have transferred the marks correctly to the cover sheet. All scripts are
      checked and a note of all clerical errors will be given in feedback to examiners.

11.   If an answer extends over more than one page and no marks have been awarded on a section draw a
      diagonal line through that section to indicate that it has been marked.

12.   If a candidate has attempted more than the required number of questions within a paper or section of
      a paper, mark all the answers and use the marks of those answers that have the highest mark, even if
      the candidate has indicated the question(s) to be marked on the cover sheet.

13.   Mark positively. Give candidates credit for what they have achieved and for what they have
      got correct, rather than penalizing them for what they have got wrong. A mark should not be
      awarded where there is contradiction within an answer. Make a comment to this effect in the left
      hand margin.

Subject Details: Design Technology HL Paper 3 Markscheme
Mark Allocation

Candidates are required to answer questions from ONE of the Options [1 × 40 marks].
Maximum total = [40 marks]

1.    A markscheme often has more marking points than the total allows. This is intentional. Do not
      award more than the maximum marks allowed for part of a question.

2.    Each marking point has a separate line and the end is signified by means of a semicolon (;).

3.    An alternative answer or wording is indicated in the markscheme by a slash (/) – either wording
      can be accepted.

4.    Words in brackets (   ) in the markscheme are not necessary to gain the mark.

5.    Words that are underlined are essential for the mark.

6.    The order of marking points does not have to be as in the markscheme, unless stated otherwise.

7.    If the candidate’s answer has the same “meaning” or can be clearly interpreted as being of
      equivalent significance, detail and validity as that in the markscheme then award the mark.
      Where this point is considered to be particularly relevant in a question it is emphasized by
      writing OWTTE (or words to that effect).

8.    Remember that many candidates are writing in a second language. Effective communication is
      more important than grammatical accuracy.

9.    Occasionally, a part of a question may require an answer that is required for subsequent
      marking points. If an error is made in the first marking point then it should be penalized.
      However, if the incorrect answer is used correctly in subsequent marking points then follow
      through marks should be awarded. Indicate this with ECF (error carried forward).

10.   Only consider units at the end of a calculation. Unless directed otherwise in the markscheme,
      unit errors should only be penalized once in the paper. Indicate this by writing –1(U) at the first
      point it occurs and U on the cover page.

11.   Do not penalize candidates for errors in significant figures unless it is specifically referred to in
      the markscheme.

A5. (a)   Award [1] for each of two distinct correct points in a description of
          undernourishment [2 max].
          chronic food insecurity;
          food insufficient to meet basic energy requirements/provision of essential
          nutrients on continuing basis;

A6. (a)   Award [1] for each of three distinct correct points in an explanation of the
          principles underpinning genetic modification of crops such as Golden Rice
          [3 max].
          genetic material/DNA from one species is isolated, often from a gene library;
          it is inserted into the genome of another species using a vehicle, e.g. a plasmid,
          a virus or a gene gun for the transfer;
          selection of the GMO that has been appropriately modified from those that
          have not;                                                                          [3 max]

(b)   Award [1] for each of three distinct correct points in an explanation of one ethical
      issue underpinning public concerns about the safety of genetically modified foods,
      e.g. Golden Rice [3 max].
      perceived safety issues;
      there are concerns that not enough is known about the potential risks of
      GM crops;
      health risks e.g. allergies, etc.;

      ecological concerns;
      accidental cross-pollination with traditional crops;
      contamination of natural gene pool;

      economic concerns;
      GM crops are subject to intellectual property law;
      this makes them more expensive and may put them out of reach of the people who
      need them;

      farmers traditionally save their seed to sow the following year;
      if this was done with GM seed then seed developers would not profit from
      their work;
      thus GM seed is subject to licensing making it expensive;

      there are concerns that we should not be modifying genes at all;
      it’s playing God/unnatural;
      it’s wrong to mix genes from different organisms;

      agriculture is already too technological;
      genetic engineering will only make it worse;
      there are better ways to improve resistance and reduce chemicals on the land;

      labelling measures are inadequate;
      people do not know whether they are getting GM foods or not;
      they therefore cannot freely make a choice;
      particularly important for religious and vegetarian groups who would object to
      genes from some species;                                                       [3 max]

A7. Award [1] for each of three distinct points in an explanation of each of three reasons for
    the increased incidence of food allergies and food intolerance in developed countries
    [3 max] for each factor [9 max].
    better diagnosis of food intolerance;
    provides better data on food intolerance;
    although still may be underestimating extent of food intolerance;

     people eat a wider range of foods than they may have done previously;
     travel, the media, availability of different foods has increased;
     foods introduced later in life may cause more problems than those introduced early
     in life;

     increased use of food additives/more exposure to environmental chemicals;
     trigger allergic reactions;
     results in increased food allergies/intolerance;

     increased sanitation;
     results in removal of helpful bacteria from environment and gut;
     probiotic bacteria, e.g. from probiotic yogurt, may improve food/lactose tolerance;

     genetics;
     allergies handed down from generation to generation;
     creates an on-going problem;

     increase in manufacture of processed foods;
     with traces/ingredients of trigger foods;
     e.g. nuts/dairy;                                                                            [9 max]

E4. Award [1] for each of three distinct correct points in an explanation of each of two
    physiological human factors issues in relation to the Forest chair [3 max] per factor,
    [6 max].
    comfort;
    metal provides a hard surface to the chair;
    this may make the chair uncomfortable when sitting for a long time;

     the chair may feel very hot/cold depending on the weather conditions;
     metal is a very good conductor of heat;
     this may make the chair feel uncomfortable when first sitting down;

     safety;
     the holes could snag clothing;
     or pinch the skin/become finger traps for children;

     ease-of-use for elderly/infirm people;
     the sides of the chair are made from thin metal;
     this does not provide much support for hands when a user is pushing him/herself out of
     the chair;

     shape;
     the chair is designed to support the back/hips;
     but may not be suitable for very large people to fit in it;                              [6 max]



E5. (a)    Award [1] for each point in an outline of one way in which the use of digital
           humans can contribute to the tests [2 max].
           digital humans can be used in a simulation of the car crash;

     (b)   Award [1] for each point in an outline of one limitation of using digital humans
           for the tests [2 max].
           people react differently in car crash situations;
           depending upon a range of psychological/physiological factors;

           it is difficult to simulate precisely how people will react in a car crash;
           thus data may not be reliable;                                                     [2 max]

     (c)   Award [1] for each point in an outline of one way in which digital humans can

E6. (a)   Award [1] for each of three distinct correct points in an explanation of one human
          factors issue in relation to the design of a railway carriage for a wheelchair user
          [3 max].
          access;
          there is usually a gap between the platform and the carriage;
          wheelchair users would need a ramp/lift/helper;

          circulation space within the carriage;
          so the wheelchair user can manoeuvre the wheelchair;
          to locate the wheelchair in a safe position;

          safety;
          emergency controls/sensors;
          at a height suitable for wheelchair users to reach;

    (b)   Award [1] for each of three distinct correct points in an explanation of one
          limitation of relying on information from the Internet for the purchase of a new
          wheelchair [3 max].
          the Internet focuses on marketing information;
          the information is provided by companies selling the product;
          information will probably focus on advantages and may not identify
          any disadvantages;

          there is an abundance of information about products;
          this could lead to confusion/information overload;
          this may not help the consumer to find what they want;

          consumers may misinterpret/misunderstand the information;
          they may then purchase the wrong type of product;
          this may not suit their needs;

          lack of personal dialogue with a sales person;
          may limit the opportunity to discuss the consumer’s needs;
          a purchase may not be made/a wrong purchase may be made;                              [3 max]

E7. Award [1] for each of three distinct correct points in each of three safety issues
    concerning the use of the grill [3 max] for each advantage [9 max].
    height of the grill;
    may not be at eye level for all users;
    some users may have to stand on tip-toe to see if food cooked;
    accidents more likely to happen;

     eye-level means that the face and eyes are at the same height as the grill;
     hot fat may spit out from the grill;
     could hit eyes/face and cause injury;

     with the grill at eye-level;
     smoke from the grill could get into the eyes;
     this may cause an accident;

     to use the grill pan;
     users have to hold the grill at head height;
     this puts strain on the arm;

     grill pan handle;
     could get hot as near the heat source;
     so burn the skin of the user;

     pulling the grill pan from the grill with hot grilled food;
     puts strain on muscles;
     could cause an accident;                                                             [9 max]
