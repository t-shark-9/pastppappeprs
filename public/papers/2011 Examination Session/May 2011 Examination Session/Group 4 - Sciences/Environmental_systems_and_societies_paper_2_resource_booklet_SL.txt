     Biosphere reserves were created by the United Nations as part of Agenda 21 following
     the Rio Declaration in 1992. There were 531 biosphere reserves in 105 countries in 2008.
     The Kristianstads Vattenrike Biosphere Reserve was protected in 2005. It is 1225 km2 in size
     and is a wetland area with a large number of endangered species of birds, amphibians and fish.
     There are 29 000 people living permanently in the Kristianstads Vattenrike Biosphere Reserve and
     they are predominantly employed in farming. It is visited by 100 000 tourists each year.

     While the conservation of individual species such as threatened amphibians is important to
     the managers of the biosphere reserve, the primary focus is on preserving landscapes and
     ecosystems through collaboration with local farmers who tend the hay fields, pastures and
     sandy grasslands.

        •   in winter (November–February), hibernates in deep burrows which toad digs with feet
        •   range: 500 m from freshwater
        •   eggs laid in shallow water
        •   optimal development temperature for eggs: 15 °C
        •   diet: omnivorous
        •   threats include: traffic, predation, eutrophication, ultraviolet (UV) radiation, loss of habitat
