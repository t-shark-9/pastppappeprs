General Marking Instructions
Subject Details:             Biology SL Paper 3 Markscheme
Mark Allocation

Candidates are required to answer questions from TWO of the Options [2  18 marks].
Maximum total = [36 marks].

1.   A markscheme often has more marking points than the total allows. This is intentional. Do not award
     more than the maximum marks allowed for part of a question.

2.   Each marking point has a separate line and the end is signified by means of a semicolon (;).

3.   An alternative answer or wording is indicated in the markscheme by a slash (/). Either wording can
     be accepted.

4.   Words in brackets ( ) in the markscheme are not necessary to gain the mark.

5.   Words that are underlined are essential for the mark.

6.   The order of marking points does not have to be as in the markscheme, unless stated otherwise.

7.   If the candidate’s answer has the same “meaning” or can be clearly interpreted as being of
     equivalent significance, detail and validity as that in the markscheme then award the mark.
     Where this point is considered to be particularly relevant in a question it is emphasized by
     writing OWTTE (or words to that effect).

8.   Occasionally, a part of a question may require an answer that is required for subsequent
     marking points. If an error is made in the first marking point then it should be penalized.

9.   Only consider units at the end of a calculation.

            decomposition of organic matter releases ammonia into water;

    (b)   animal distribution is related to abiotic and biotic (niche) requirements;
          temperature must be within viable range based upon the adaptations of the animal;
          water must be available in species-specific quantities (Gila lizards require less
          water than elephants);
          breeding sites are required for maintenance of the species;
          food supply must be of the right kind for the species (e.g. nuts for squirrels and
          leaves for rabbits);
          territory is required for some species for breeding/feeding;
          dissolved oxygen affects aquatic species as some organisms can tolerate low
          levels of oxygen;
          salinity effects distribution as some species are more sensitive than others to salt;
          other appropriate answers with justification are acceptable;                               [3 max]
