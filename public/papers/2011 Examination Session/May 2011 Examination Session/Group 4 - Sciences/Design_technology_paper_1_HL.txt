Questions 37–40 relate to the following case study.   Please read the case study carefully and answer
the questions.

CASE STUDY

Figure 6 shows a set of plastic cutlery (knife, fork and spoon) designed by Julia Carlson and marketed
under the title of “Greenware”.  The cutlery is made from biodegradable plastic derived from soy bean.  
Biodegradable means that the plastic is able to be broken down by the activities of living organisms and
is therefore unlikely to persist in the environment at the end of its life cycle.  However, the cutlery is not
designed to be disposable and the handle mould for each piece is the same.
