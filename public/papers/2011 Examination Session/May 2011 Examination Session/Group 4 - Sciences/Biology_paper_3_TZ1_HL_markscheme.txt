    General Marking Instructions
Subject Details:                 Biology HL Paper 3 Markscheme
    Mark Allocation

    Candidates are required to answer questions from TWO of the Options [2  20 marks].
    Maximum total = [40 marks]

    1.   A markscheme often has more marking points than the total allows. This is intentional. Do not award
         more than the maximum marks allowed for part of a question.

    2.   Each marking point has a separate line and the end is signified by means of a semicolon (;).

    3.   An alternative answer or wording is indicated in the markscheme by a slash (/). Either wording can
         be accepted.

    4.   Words in brackets ( ) in the markscheme are not necessary to gain the mark.

    5.   Words that are underlined are essential for the mark.

    6.   The order of marking points does not have to be as in the markscheme, unless stated otherwise.

    7.   If the candidate’s answer has the same “meaning” or can be clearly interpreted as being of
         equivalent significance, detail and validity as that in the markscheme then award the mark.
         Where this point is considered to be particularly relevant in a question it is emphasized by
         writing OWTTE (or words to that effect).

    8.   Occasionally, a part of a question may require an answer that is required for subsequent
         marking points. If an error is made in the first marking point then it should be penalized.

    9.   Only consider units at the end of a calculation.

Option D — Evolution

D1. (a)   Highest probability: 0.58 (Allow answers from 0.57–0.59)
          Lowest probability: 0.25 (Allow answers from 0.24–0.26)                                    [1]
          Both required for the mark.

    (b)   different varieties from same lake / I                                                     [1]

    (c)   individuals are more likely to breed if they are the same variety / individuals of
          different varieties have a low probability of breeding;
          the probability of breeding between individuals of the same variety shows a large
          range of values / narrow range if of different variety;
          the probability of breeding between any two individuals is always less than
          0.6/correct numerical value;                                                          [2 max]

    (d)   data provides (strong) evidence for reproductive isolation between the varieties in
          each lake;
          different sizes/feeding habits/habitat (shore versus open water) seem to contribute
          (strongly) to low breeding probability;
          this could lead to speciation/formation of separate species in each lake;
          same varieties from different lakes do not show strong reproductive isolation /
          geographical isolation is a weak factor in speciation / no evidence of allopatric
          speciation;
          sympatric speciation seems to be taking place because different varieties from the
          same lake have a low probability of breeding;                                         [3 max]

     weaker evidence that cilia/flagella evolved from attached bacteria/spirochetes;             [6 max]

    if blood plasma too concentrated, ADH released;
    kidney produces a small volume of hypertonic urine / reabsorption of water in collecting
    ducts;
    if plasma too dilute, ADH level of blood drops;
    kidney produces a large volume of hypotonic urine / little water reabsorbed from
    collecting ducts;
    controlled by negative feedback;                                                           [6 max]
