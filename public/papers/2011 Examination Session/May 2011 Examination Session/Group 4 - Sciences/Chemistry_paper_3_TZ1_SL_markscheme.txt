General Marking Instructions
Subject Details:                     Chemistry SL Paper 3 Markscheme
Mark Allocation

Candidates are required to answer questions from TWO of the options [2  20 marks]. Maximum total = [40 marks].

1.    A markscheme often has more marking points than the total allows. This is intentional. Do not award more
      than the maximum marks allowed for part of a question.

2.    Each marking point has a separate line and the end is signified by means of a semicolon (;).

3.    An alternative answer or wording is indicated in the markscheme by a slash (/) - either wording can be
      accepted.

4.    Words in brackets (   ) in the markscheme are not necessary to gain the mark.

5.    Words that are underlined are essential for the mark.

6.    The order of marking points does not have to be as in the markscheme, unless stated otherwise.

7.    If the candidate’s answer has the same “meaning” or can be clearly interpreted as being of equivalent
      significance, detail and validity as that in the markscheme then award the mark. Where this point is
      considered to be particularly relevant in a question it is emphasized by writing OWTTE (or words to that
      effect).

8.    Occasionally, a part of a question may require an answer that is required for subsequent marking points.
      If an error is made in the first marking point then it should be penalized.

9.    Only consider units at the end of a calculation.

10.   Significant digits should only be considered in the final answer. Deduct 1 mark in the paper for an error
      of 2 or more digits unless directed otherwise in the markscheme.

                                              e.g. if the answer is 1.63:
                                                      2        reject
                                                      1.6      accept
                                                      1.63     accept
                                                      1.631    accept
                                                      1.6314 reject

11.   If a question specifically asks for the name of a substance, do not award a mark for a correct formula,
      similarly, if the formula is specifically asked for, do not award a mark for a correct name.

12.   If a question asks for an equation for a reaction, a balanced symbol equation is usually expected, do not
      award a mark for a word equation or an unbalanced equation unless directed otherwise in the markscheme.

13.   Ignore missing or incorrect state symbols in an equation unless directed otherwise in the markscheme.
