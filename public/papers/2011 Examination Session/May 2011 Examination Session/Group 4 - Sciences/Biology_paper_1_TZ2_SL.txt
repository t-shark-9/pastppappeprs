Questions 25 and 26 refer to the following information.

Rhesus factor is an antigen present on the surface of red blood cells of Rhesus positive individuals.
Rhesus positive (Rh+ ) is dominant to Rhesus negative (Rh– ). A mother with Rhesus negative blood gives
birth to a baby with Rhesus positive blood and there are concerns that subsequent pregnancies will trigger
an immune response.

25.   What are the genotypes of the mother and her first baby?

                Genotype of mother           Genotype of first baby

      D.               Rh+ Rh–                       Rh+ Rh+




26.   What is a possible explanation for why subsequent pregnancies could trigger an immune response?

      A.    Exposure to the Rh+ antigen in the first pregnancy triggered the development of antibodies
            that could attack the blood of a future Rh+ baby.

      B.    Exposure to the Rh+ antigen in the first pregnancy triggered the development of specific
            phagocytes that could attack the blood of a future Rh+ baby.

      C.    The mother has developed passive immunity to the Rh+ factor.

      D.    The mother’s immune system has been weakened by pregnancy.
