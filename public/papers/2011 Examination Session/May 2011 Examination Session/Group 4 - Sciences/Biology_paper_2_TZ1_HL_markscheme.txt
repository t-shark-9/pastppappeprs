General Marking Instructions

Subject Details:          Biology HL Paper 2 Markscheme

Mark Allocation

Candidates are required to answer ALL questions in Section A [32 marks] and TWO questions in
Section B [2  20 marks]. Maximum total = [72 marks]

1.   A markscheme often has more marking points than the total allows. This is intentional. Do not award
     more than the maximum marks allowed for part of a question.

2.   Each marking point has a separate line and the end is signified by means of a semicolon (;).

3.   An alternative answer or wording is indicated in the markscheme by a slash (/). Either wording can
     be accepted.

4.   Words in brackets ( ) in the markscheme are not necessary to gain the mark.

5.   Words that are underlined are essential for the mark.

6.   The order of marking points does not have to be as in the markscheme, unless stated otherwise.

7.   If the candidate’s answer has the same “meaning” or can be clearly interpreted as being of
     equivalent significance, detail and validity as that in the markscheme then award the mark.
     Where this point is considered to be particularly relevant in a question it is emphasized by
     writing OWTTE (or words to that effect).

8.   Occasionally, a part of a question may require an answer that is required for subsequent
     marking points. If an error is made in the first marking point then it should be penalized.

9.   Only consider units at the end of a correct calculation.

Section B
Extended response questions – quality of construction

      Extended response questions for HL P2 carry a mark total of [20]. Of these marks, [18] are
       awarded for content and [2] for the quality of construction of the answer.

      Two aspects are considered:
           expression of relevant ideas with clarity
           structure of the answers.

      [1] quality mark is to be awarded when the candidate satisfies EACH of the following criteria.
       Thus [2] quality marks are awarded when a candidate satisfies BOTH criteria.

     Clarity of expression:
     The candidate has made a serious and full attempt to answer all parts of the question and the
     answers are expressed clearly enough to be understood with little or no re-reading.

     Structure of answer:
     The candidate has linked relevant ideas to form a logical sequence within at least two parts of the
     same question (e.g. within part a and within part b, or within part a and within part c etc. but not
     between part a and part b or between part a and part c etc.).

                  levels of each pollutant are much higher concentrations in urban areas;

     (c)   (i)    unlikely to be the cause because differences in pH are small                        [1]

           (ii)   yes because higher growth in areas where there is higher pollution;
                  might not be cause / correlation rather than cause and effect;
                  pollutant might have stimulated growth / acted as fertilizer in urban areas;
                  (no because) pollutant did not negatively affect growth (as more pollution in
                  urban areas/area with higher growth);                                           [2 max]

           exposure;
           ozone exposure is lower in urban areas/other reference to graph on page 6;
           ozone is toxic/damages plants impacts photosynthesis;
           (hypothesis is) higher growth rates (in urban areas) are due to lower ozone
           exposure;
           (hypothesis is) both factors/ozone and air pollution may have played a role in
           growth differences;                                                                    [3 max]
