General Marking Instructions

Subject Details: Physics SL Paper 2 Markscheme
Mark Allocation

Candidates are required to answer ALL questions in Section A [25 marks] and ONE question in
Section B [25 marks]. Maximum total = [50 marks]

1.    A markscheme often has more marking points than the total allows. This is intentional. Do not award
      more than the maximum marks allowed for part of a question.

2.    Each marking point has a separate line and the end is signified by means of a semicolon (;).

3.    An alternative answer or wording is indicated in the markscheme by a slash (/). Either wording can
      be accepted.

4.    Words in brackets ( ) in the markscheme are not necessary to gain the mark.

5.    Words that are underlined are essential for the mark.

6.    The order of marking points does not have to be as in the markscheme, unless stated otherwise.

7.    If the candidate’s answer has the same “meaning” or can be clearly interpreted as being of
      equivalent significance, detail and validity as that in the markscheme then award the mark.
      Where this point is considered to be particularly relevant in a question it is emphasized by
      writing OWTTE (or words to that effect).

8.    Occasionally, a part of a question may require an answer that is required for subsequent
      marking points. If an error is made in the first marking point then it should be penalized.

9.    Only consider units at the end of a correct calculation.

10.   Significant digits should only be considered in the final answer. Deduct 1 mark in the paper for
      an error of 2 or more digits unless directed otherwise in the markscheme.

                                         e.g. if the answer is 1.63:
                                                       2     reject
                                                     1.6     accept
                                                   1.63      accept
                                                  1.631      accept

                R(= mg − ma = 0.50 × 9.81 − 0.50 × 4) ≈ 3 N;                                        [2]

          (iv) the acceleration is decreasing;
               and so R is greater;
                 or
                 air resistance forces increase with speed;
                 since speed at 5.0 s is greater so is resistance force;                            [2]

Part 2       Nuclear physics

             nucleus / the energy released when a nucleus is assembled;                     [1]

      (ii)   binding energy of plutonium is 7.6 × 239 = 1816 ≈ 1800 MeV
             (known in (ii))
             binding energy of products is 8.6 × 91 + 8.2 × 146= 1980 ≈ 2000 MeV;
             energy released is ( 2000 − 1800 ) =200 MeV;                                   [2]

(c)   the electric force is repulsive/tends to split the nucleus;
      the electric force acts on protons, the strong nuclear force acts on nucleons;
      the nuclear force is attractive/binds the nucleons;
      but the electric force is long range whereas the nuclear force is short range;
      so adding more neutrons (compared to protons) contributes to binding and does not
      add to tendency to split the nucleus / a proton repels every other proton (in the
      nucleus) so extra neutrons are needed for binding;                                [4 max]

(c)   (i)     the Earth radiates radiation in the infrared region of the spectrum;
              the greenhouse gases have energy level differences (in their molecular energy
              levels) corresponding to infrared energies;
              and so the infrared photons are absorbed;
              or
              the Earth radiates photons of infrared frequency;
              the greenhouse gas molecules oscillate/vibrate with frequencies in the infrared
              region;
              and so because of resonance the photons are absorbed;                             [3]

      (ii)    most incoming radiation consists of photons in the visible/ultraviolet region /
              photons of much shorter wavelength than those radiated by the Earth / photons
              of different wavelength of that radiated by Earth;
              and so these cannot be absorbed;                                                  [2]
