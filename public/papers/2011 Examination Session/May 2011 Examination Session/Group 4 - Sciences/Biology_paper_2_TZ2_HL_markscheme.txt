General Marking Instructions
Subject Details:          Biology HL Paper 2 Markscheme

Mark Allocation

Candidates are required to answer ALL questions in Section A [32 marks] and TWO questions in
Section B [2  20 marks]. Maximum total = [72 marks]

1.   A markscheme often has more marking points than the total allows. This is intentional. Do not award
     more than the maximum marks allowed for part of a question.

2.   Each marking point has a separate line and the end is signified by means of a semicolon (;).

3.   An alternative answer or wording is indicated in the markscheme by a slash (/). Either wording can
     be accepted.

4.   Words in brackets ( ) in the markscheme are not necessary to gain the mark.

5.   Words that are underlined are essential for the mark.

6.   The order of marking points does not have to be as in the markscheme, unless stated otherwise.

7.   If the candidate’s answer has the same “meaning” or can be clearly interpreted as being of
     equivalent significance, detail and validity as that in the markscheme then award the mark.
     Where this point is considered to be particularly relevant in a question it is emphasized by
     writing OWTTE (or words to that effect).

8.   Occasionally, a part of a question may require an answer that is required for subsequent
     marking points. If an error is made in the first marking point then it should be penalized.

9.   Only consider units at the end of a correct calculation.

Extended response questions - quality of construction

      Extended response questions for HL P2 carry a mark total of [20]. Of these marks, [18] are
       awarded for content and [2] for the quality of construction of the answer.

      Two aspects are considered:
           expression of relevant ideas with clarity
           structure of the answers.

      [1] quality mark is to be awarded when the candidate satisfies EACH of the following criteria.
       Thus [2] quality marks are awarded when a candidate satisfies BOTH criteria.

     Clarity of expression:
        The candidate has made a serious and full attempt to answer all parts of the question and the
        answers are expressed clearly enough to be understood with little or no re-reading.

     Structure of answer:
        The candidate has linked relevant ideas to form a logical sequence within at least two parts
        of the same question (e.g. within part a and within part b, or within part a and within part c
        etc. but not between part a and part b or between part a and part c etc.).

           (sickle-cell anemia) due to a base substitution (mutation);
           changes the code on the DNA;

           which (in turn) leads to a change in translation / change in polypeptide chain/
           protein;
           (the tRNA) adds the wrong amino acid to the polypeptide chain;
           glutamic acid replaced by valine;
           produces abnormal hemoglobin;
           causing abnormal red blood cell/erythrocyte shape / sickle shape;
           which lowers the ability to transport oxygen;
           sickle-cell allele is codominant;
           homozygote/HbS HbS have sickle cell anemia/is lethal / heterozygote/HbS HbA has
           the sickle trait/is carrier (and is more resistant to malaria);                       [8 max]

8.   (a)   heat causes vasodilation of arterioles;
           blood closer to surface so heat loss from skin;
           heat causes sweating (from sweat glands);
           evaporation of sweat leads to cooling;
           cold causes vasoconstriction of arterioles;
           less blood at surface so less heat loss from skin;
           cold leads to less sweating/evaporation of water from skin / hair becomes erect and
           traps air/goose bumps appear;
           temperature receptors in skin transmit impulses to the hypothalamus;                [5 max]

     (b)   level of progesterone falls before birth;
           oxytocin secreted;
           from pituitary;
           this stimulates contractions of uterus;
           uterine contraction/stretching of cervix/vagina stimulates secretion of (more) oxytocin;
           form of positive feedback;                                                                 [4 max]

     (c)   vaccine is a modified/weakened/attenuated form of a pathogen / contains antigens
           from pathogens;
           vaccine injected/ingested/introduced to patient;
           pathogen/antigens stimulates specific immune response called primary/initial
           responses;
           antigens stimulate macrophages/lymphocytes/T-cells;
           which stimulate cloning of B-cells/plasma cells;
           including development of memory (B-)cells;
           that produce specific antibodies;
           (upon second exposure) production of antibodies is much faster;
           higher level of antibody production / person has immunity;
           called secondary response;
           labelled graph showing curve with higher slope/peak for secondary response than
           primary response;
           may need booster shot to maintain immunity;
