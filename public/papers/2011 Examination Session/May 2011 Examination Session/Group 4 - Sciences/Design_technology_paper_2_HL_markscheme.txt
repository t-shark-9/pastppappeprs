1.    Follow the markscheme provided, award only whole marks and mark only in RED.

2.    Where a mark is awarded, a tick/check () must be placed in the text at the precise point where it
      becomes clear that the candidate deserves the mark. One tick to be shown for each mark awarded.

3.    Sometimes, careful consideration is required to decide whether or not to award a mark. In these
      cases write a brief annotation to explain your decision. You are encouraged to write comments
      where it helps clarity, especially for moderation and re-marking. It should be remembered that the
      script may be returned to the candidate.

4.    Unexplained symbols or personal codes/notations are unacceptable.

5.    Record marks in the right-hand margin. For Section A this should be against each mark allocation
      shown in square brackets e.g. [2]. The total mark for a question must equal the number of ticks for
      the question.

6.    Do not circle sub-totals. Circle the total mark for the question in the right-hand margin at the end
      of the question.

7.    Where an answer to a part question is worth no marks, put a zero in the right-hand margin next to
      the square bracket.

8.    Where work is submitted on additional sheets the marks awarded should be shown as ticks and
      a note made on both the additional sheet and in the right-hand margin of the corresponding question
      part in the body of the script to transfer these marks to that question part in the script.

9.    Section A: Add together the total for each question and write it in the Examiner column on the
      cover sheet.
      Section B: Insert the total for each question in the Examiner column on the cover sheet.
      Total:       Add up the marks awarded and enter this in the box marked TOTAL in the
      Examiner column on the cover sheet.

10.   After entering the marks on the cover sheet check your addition to ensure that you have not made an
      error. Check also that you have transferred the marks correctly to the cover sheet. All scripts are
      checked and a note of all clerical errors will be given in feedback to examiners.

11.   If an answer extends over more than one page and no marks have been awarded on a section draw a
      diagonal line through that section to indicate that it has been marked.

12.   If a candidate has attempted more than the required number of questions within a paper or section
      of a paper, mark all the answers and use the marks of those answers that have the highest mark,
      even if the candidate has indicated the question(s) to be marked on the cover sheet.

13.   A mark should not be awarded where there is contradiction within an answer. Make a comment to
      this effect in the left-hand margin.

Subject Details:                           Design Technology HL Paper 2 Markscheme
Mark Allocation

Candidates are required to answer ALL questions in Section A (total 40 marks) ONE question in
Section B [20 marks]. Maximum total = 60 marks.

1.    A markscheme often has more marking points than the total allows. This is intentional. Do not
      award more than the maximum marks allowed for part of a question.

2.    Each marking point has a separate line and the end is signified by means of a semicolon (;).

3.    An alternative answer or wording is indicated in the markscheme by a slash (/) – either wording can
      be accepted.

4.    Words in brackets (   ) in the markscheme are not necessary to gain the mark.

5.    Words that are underlined are essential for the mark.

6.    The order of marking points does not have to be as in the markscheme, unless stated otherwise.

7.    If the candidate’s answer has the same “meaning” or can be clearly interpreted as being of
      equivalent significance, detail and validity as that in the markscheme then award the mark.
      Where this point is considered to be particularly relevant in a question it is emphasized by
      writing OWTTE (or words to that effect).

8.    Remember that many candidates are writing in a second language. Effective communication is
      more important than grammatical accuracy.

9.    Occasionally, a part of a question may require an answer that is required for subsequent
      marking points. If an error is made in the first marking point then it should be penalized.
      However, if the incorrect answer is used correctly in subsequent marking points then follow
      through marks should be awarded. Indicate this with ECF (error carried forward).

10.   Only consider units at the end of a calculation. Unless directed otherwise in the mark scheme,
      unit errors should only be penalized once in the paper. Indicate this by writing –1(U) at the first
      point it occurs and U on the cover page.

11.   Do not penalise candidates for errors in significant figures, unless it is specifically referred to in
      the markscheme.

                  to enable a more comfortable ride over uneven ground;                            [2 max]

     (b)   (i)    Award [1] for each point in a brief explanation of why the Segway®
                  Personal Transporter does not produce carbon dioxide emissions during
                  use but is quoted as creating 0.704 kg of CO2 per recharge, i.e. per 20 km
                  [2 max].
                  electricity production includes burning of coal and other fossil fuels;
                  thus electricity usage by the Segway® involves carbon dioxide production;            [2]

           (ii)   Award [1] for each of three distinct correct points in an explanation of how
                  the designers have met three potentially conflicting aspects of the
                  specification for the Tandem Sling Chair: security; aesthetics; ease of
                  maintenance [3 max] per aspect [9 max].
                  security:
                  easy for security people to inspect chair system;
                  difficult to conceal any bombs or other terrorist devices in the chair and
                  would be easily spotted;
                  they would fall through the hole at the back;

                  aesthetics:
                  minimalist design/contemporary style;
                  black upholstery and metallic frame looks sophisticated;
                  look good individually and as a chair system in the airport;

                  neutral colours;
                  will not clash with other colours;
                  in the airport environment;

                  ease of maintenance:
                  upholstery is made of tough material;

                  high set-up costs;
                  both solar/wind energy require expensive systems for energy generation and
                  exploitation;

                  unreliable supply/lack of continuity of supply;

       solar power is harnessed by the photovoltaic panel [3 max].
       light falls on panel which contains photosensitive material (silicon);
       electrons are excited by the light energy;
       flow of electrons through circuits powers electrical products;

       panel contains photosensitive material;
       which absorbs energy from light;

(b)   (i)    Award [1] for each point in an outline of one reason why thermal
             conductivity is an important consideration in the design of the building
             envelope [2 max].
             thermal conductivity is a measure of how well a material conducts heat;
             heat/gain loss is an important consideration in the design of a building;         [2]

      (ii)   Award [1] for each of two distinct correct points in a description of how a
             designer can modify the heat lost or gained through the building envelope
             [2 max].
             by selecting materials with different U values;
             the designer can determine the heat loss or gain through the building
             envelope;                                                                         [2]

(c)   (i)    Award [1] for each point in an outline of one reason why an active solar
             water heating system might be installed alongside the photovoltaic system
             shown in Figure 14 and [1] for a brief explanation [2 max].
             electrical water heating consumes a large amount of energy;
             the solar power system may need to be very large to supply sufficient
             energy;

             active solar water systems are very efficient;
             this would reduce the requirements on the photovoltaic system;                [2 max]

           (ii)   Award [1] for each distinct correct point in an explanation of each of three
                  ways in which buildings can be designed to reduce energy consumption
                  [3 max] per way [9 max].
                  elongation of the east-west axis of the building;
                  this maximizes the area of the building exposed to the Sun during the day;
                  this can maximize heat and light gain in a building and so reduce energy
                  consumption;

                  position the interior spaces requiring the most heat and light towards
                  the Sun;
                  some areas do not require heating, e.g. storage areas;
                  putting these on the sides of the building away from the Sun reduces
                  energy consumption;

                  use of thermal mass;
                  this can heat up during the day when the Sun shines;
                  it can release its heat in the night to reduce the need for space heating;

                  appropriate ventilation;
                  achieves appropriate air change requisite for comfort;
                  can reduce need for air conditioning;

                  window placement;
                  can ensure appropriate heat gain/loss from the building;
                  use of natural lighting instead of artificial lighting during the day reduces
                  energy consumption;

                  landscaping;
                  can be used to shade the building in summer;
                  deciduous trees lose their leaves and can allow the Sun to shine on the
                  building in the winter and increase solar heat gain reducing energy
                  consumption for space heating;

                  roof overhangs;
                  shade south facing windows in high summer;
                  reduce solar heat gain and therefore need for cooling/air conditioning;

                  use materials with low thermal conductivity;
                  which will help to insulate the building;
                  and prevent heat loss;                                                          [9 max]

(b)   (i)    Award [1] for each of two distinct correct points in a description of how
             design costs would contribute to the final cost of the Alessi Anna G
             corkscrew [2 max].
             design costs are part of the fixed costs;
             they have to be recovered before there is any return on the investment;              [2]

      (ii)   Award [1] for each of two distinct correct points in a description of how the
             concept of break-even relates to the production of the Alessi Anna G
             corkscrew
             [2 max].
             manufacturer decides how many corkscrews will be produced to cover the
             fixed costs;
             a proportion of the fixed cost is included in the price of each corkscrew, no
             profit until fixed costs are covered;                                                [2]

             Alessandro Mendini has managed to balance form with function in the
             design of the Alessi Anna G corkscrew [2 max].
             the wings of the corkscrew are like the arms of a girl;
             the tab to wind the worm into the cork is like the head;

             the form of the corkscrew is based on the shape of a girl/female;
             the corkscrew functions like a conventional corkscrew/double winged
             lever design;                                                                    [2 max]

(ii)   Award [1] for each of three distinct correct points in a discussion of how
       consumers might use product image, performance and durability at different
       stages in the product lifecycle to evaluate the Alessi Anna G corkscrew
       [3 max] per stage [9 max].
       product image:
       particularly important before purchase of the corkscrew when shopping
       around;
       the Alessi Anna G corkscrew is an extremely attractive aesthetically
       pleasing item and in much demand;
       the consumer is likely to balance product price against product image to
       evaluate value for money;

       performance:
       this is particularly important at the point of purchase and immediately
       afterwards;
       the product must perform well to be identified as good value for money and
       for the consumer to be satisfied;
       if the consumer is disappointed early on then he/she is likely to return the
       corkscrew to the retailer and demand his/her money back;

       durability:
       the durability will determine how long the corkscrew will last;
       if the durability is low then the consumer will be disappointed;
       high durability will mean that the corkscrew is good for long-term use;        [9 max]
