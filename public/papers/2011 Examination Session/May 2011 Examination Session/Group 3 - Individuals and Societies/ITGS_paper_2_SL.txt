Answer all parts of the question.

                               Area of impact: Business and employment

1.    Kiva is a company that lends money to small businesses in the developing world. Details of each
      business are displayed on the Kiva web site. New businesses wanting loans can sign up, at no cost,
      and individuals who wish to lend money can register as lenders. Lenders can search the Kiva
      database and choose a new business from countries such as Kenya and Vietnam.

      Lenders transfer money to the Kiva web site in the form of a loan using PayPal or a credit card.
      Lenders may lend as little as US$25 so a loan is usually shared by many lenders. The loan is
      complete when the total of individual lenders’ loans equals the sum required by the business owner.
      Provided the business is successful the business owner gradually repays each loan.

      Regular electronic feedback is provided to the lenders on the status of their loans and the success
      of the business. Lenders can also log in to the web site at any time and check current and past loans.
      Download speeds vary and are often slow in developing countries. Lenders find information about
      the progress of each loan useful and it makes them feel valued. This often encourages further loans.

		          (i)    Identify the key field in the RECEIVER_OF_LOAN table.                          [1 mark]

		          (ii)   Identify the data type for         the   field     Phone_Number    in   the
                   RECEIVER_OF_LOAN table.                                                        [1 mark]

      (b)   The database administrator wishes to produce an alphabetical list of lenders from
            France who have contributed at least US$50 after 01/01/2001.

            Describe the query that produces the list specified above.                            [4 marks]

      (c)   The field Business_Description should not be included in the LOANS table
            because this would lead to data redundancy.

            Explain why this could lead to inaccuracies in the database.                          [4 marks]

      (d)   “Kiva provides a data-rich, transparent lending platform. We are constantly
            working to make the system more transparent to show how money flows
            throughout the entire cycle, and what effect it has on the people and institutions
            that lend, borrow and manage it along the way.”

                                                            SECTION B

Answer two questions.

                                                      Area of impact: Education

2.    Universities are taking advantage of the increased availability of mobile devices such as personal
      digital assistants (PDAs), including cell (mobile) phones, to provide access to video and audio files of
      material covered in lectures. These files may be podcasts1 and vidcasts2 which are accessed securely
      from the university server.

      Many students, such as Amy who is an international athlete, are unable to attend a number of their
      lectures due to other commitments. These students, like Amy, are taking advantage of the opportunity
      to access the material covered in lectures to keep up with their studies.

      However, there are other students who are taking advantage of this technology to socialize and
      earn money at part-time work, knowing that the lectures they miss are available through the
      university network.

            podcast: refers to an audio-only file
      2
            vidcast: refers to a podcast with video




      (a)       Identify two file formats that can be used for podcasts or vidcasts on PDAs.            [2 marks]

      (b)       Describe the steps for producing a podcast file.                                        [4 marks]

      (c)       Explain two possible educational uses for podcasts or vidcasts other than
                providing access to lecture material.                                                   [4 marks]

      (d)       Many universities around the world are also making their lectures publicly
                available through online podcast and vidcast hosting services. The lectures
                cover a wide range of topics, opening up new opportunities for lecturing
                and learning.

                To what extent could stakeholders, other than students enrolled in the
                university courses, be affected by the public availability of university lectures as
                podcasts and vidcasts?                                                                 [10 marks]

3.    A social games company, PlayFish, announced that its users installed 100 million copies of its new
      social games in the first 18 months since the company began.

      One of their social games is called Pet Society. When you join as a member you are able to contact
      other members, called “friends”, and contact their cartoon pets. You are only allowed to visit
      a “friend’s” pet once a day, where you earn 30 virtual coins. Items can be bought for “friends” and
      pets which can cost thousands of coins. It takes weeks of playing in order to buy these items.
      Therefore the aim of the game is to acquire as many “friends” as possible.

      Recently one player, Chui, had more than 4400 “friends”. Through playing Pet Society she is online
      for more than 8 hours each day. Because of her vast “friend” network, Chui is the most popular
      member in Pet Society.

      Social games are normally free. They provide the opportunity for users to communicate with each
      other online and play collaboratively to achieve the goals in the game. Users play the games in their
      web browsers through social networking web sites such as Facebook.

      According to gaming experts, the emphasis on online interaction between “friends” has expanded
      the popularity of social games far beyond both video games on desktop computers and online games.
      Moreover, social games appeal to an entirely new, non-gaming, audience.

      (a)   Identify two reasons why a social networking web site such as Facebook would
            provide access to free online social games through its web site.                                  [2 marks]

      (b)   Pet Society downloads cookies on to your computer. Describe two possible
            ways that games companies could use cookies.                                                      [4 marks]

4.    2020 Vision is a firm of opticians in the UK (United Kingdom) that conducts eye examinations and
      prescribes glasses and contact lenses. During an eye examination they take digital photographs of
      customers’ retinas using a 6 megapixel camera and store them on their computer system. By comparing
      them with previously stored photographs, the opticians can see if there have been any changes which
      may indicate eye disease. The images are converted to JPG format and placed in a secure area
      on their web site. Customers can log in and see their photographs as well as their prescriptions at
      any time.

      Up until now UK medical institutions and services such as 2020 Vision store their patient medical
      records in different IT systems. The UK government has already spent billions of pounds of taxpayers’
      money on an IT medical records system which is supposed to provide medical professionals with
      access to all patients’ records from any computer connected to the government system. The project
      had problems from the start and it looks as if it will never be satisfactorily completed. It has been
      suggested that a better solution would be to allow another established Internet company, MedSystems,
      to store UK patients’ medical records using technology that is already available.


                                                                    (This question continues on the following page)

(Question 4 continued)

      (a)   Define the term pixel.                                                               [2 marks]

      (b)   Describe two steps that would need to be taken for a patient’s 2020 Vision images
            to be made available in MedSystems’s medical records.                                [4 marks]

      (c)   Explain why images of the retina need to be converted to JPG format before
            being displayed on the 2020 Vision web site.                                         [4 marks]

      (d)   The UK government has to decide whether to:
            • continue to fund the current IT medical records system in an attempt to get
              it working
            • abandon this development and outsource a similar records system to a third
              party such as MedSystems.

            Evaluate both of these strategies.                                                  [10 marks]

5.    A government bureau of meteorology collects data from weather stations. This data is imported into
      a database and displayed on a web site.

      On the web site (Diagram 1) it is possible for a user to select a particular weather station, e.g. 23090,
      and display data such as temperature, rainfall and other weather conditions, and to choose daily or
      monthly statistics.

      This data is also used for climatic modelling and is used by companies who need additional analysis
      of the information provided. This data is stored in the form of spreadsheets.

      When station 23090 is selected the screen displays a snapshot of data from Adelaide Hyde Park
      (Diagram 2). Collection began in 1977 and continues to the present day.

      (d)   Many companies create their own spreadsheets so they can use the data from
            the government bureau of meteorology web site in order to assist in their
            decision-making. Results are often limited due to poor design, maintenance or
            control of these spreadsheets.

6.    In some countries all vehicles are taxed annually. However, before the tax can be paid, the owner
      needs valid insurance and a current safety certificate. A tax sticker is then issued and must be displayed
      in the vehicle.

      In the month before the vehicle tax must be paid, the owner receives a renewal letter that has
      a 16-digit unique identification number that must be used when paying the tax. In order to make
      the payment, the owner has to go to a post office with the vehicle insurance and other relevant
      documents as well as the vehicle tax renewal letter.

      The UK (United Kingdom) government has introduced an online system so that the vehicle owner can
      make the payment of the vehicle tax online.

      When the vehicle owner accesses the web page, they are asked to enter the 16-digit identification
      number. At various points in the process the vehicle owner is asked for additional relevant information
      that must also be entered.

      During the renewal process the government system accesses a database to find out whether the vehicle
      owner has valid insurance and also checks that the vehicle has a current safety certificate. If at any
      point the vehicle owner gives an incorrect, invalid or unexpected response that they cannot correct,
      then they will not be able to complete the process.

      At the end of the process the vehicle tax payment is authorized and a new tax sticker is sent by post
      to the vehicle owner.

      The UK government is considering extending this online scheme to include other types of payment
      such as property tax.


      (a)   Identify two reasons why the UK government is encouraging people to pay their
            vehicle tax online.                                                                      [2 marks]

      (b)   When paying the vehicle tax online, the URL of the vehicle tax web site uses the
            protocol HTTPS. Describe the difference between HTTP and HTTPS.                          [4 marks]

      (c)   Explain how the UK vehicle tax database system could make use of private key/
            public key encryption in order to safeguard an owner’s data.                             [4 marks]

(Question 6 continued)

      (d)   The UK government has access to a range of other databases such as:
            • vehicle registration database
            • income tax database
            • police records
            • cell (mobile) phone records
            • credit card records
            • Internet service provider (ISP) records of web sites visited.

            Data matching techniques allow the government to collate information from
            numerous sources and build up a comprehensive picture of an individual.
            Civil liberty groups are concerned about the amount of information that
            governments hold, the amount of access they have to other databases and how
            they use it.

            With reference to specific examples, to what extent are the concerns of the civil
            liberty groups justified?                                                           [10 marks]
