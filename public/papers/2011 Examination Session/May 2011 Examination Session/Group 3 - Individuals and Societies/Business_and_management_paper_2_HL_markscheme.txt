                  Just-in-time stock control is a stock control method where a business
                  (such as Strider Retail orders goods/stock for sale only after an order has
                  been made by customers to avoid tying up working capital.

       [1 to 2 marks]
       The answer is largely inaccurate. The candidate shows only a superficial
       understanding of the FIFO/LIFO stock valuation method for [1 mark].
       Award [2 marks] if there are two mistakes, or the table is poorly presented.

       [3 to 4 marks]
       Allow for up to one mistake for [3 marks] where the table is well presented.
       Award up to [3 marks] if the final stock value is not presented/calculated.
       For a correct answer which is well presented award [4 marks]. Opening
       stock must be included for full marks.

       Apply Own Figure Rule (OFR).

(ii)   Comment on the implications for Strider Retail of using LIFO as a
       method of valuing its stock.                                      [3 marks]

       Closing stock value under LIFO is higher than for FIFO although this is not
       surprising given the falling costs of purchasing new plasma televisions.
       Under LIFO, Strider Retail is left with the older and more expensive stock
       of plasma televisions.

       A higher closing stock figure under LIFO will imply a lower cost of sales
       and a higher final gross profit calculation. Higher level of profit will result
       in higher taxes for Strider Retail.

       Other implications for Strider Retail, however, are that with LIFO they will
       be left with stocks of older plasma televisions and as a result the value of
       closing stock will be higher than the actual realizable value given the rapid
       changes in technology. Strider Retail may be forced to sell these plasma
       televisions at discounted prices and may make losses next year.


       [1 mark] for a relevant theoretical answer without any references to the
       figures and to Strider Retail. Or [1 mark] for only one point such as the
       value of closing stock under LIFO will be higher than for FIFO.

       [2 marks] for two distinct implications for Strider Retail such as the
       difference in closing stock under LIFO and the subsequent effect on gross
       profit.

       [3 marks] for three distinct comments/implications to include the above two
       and the fact that Strider Retail may have to sell its stock of plasma
       television at discounted prices as product life cycle’s shorten.

       Please note: some of the candidates may give a generic textbook response
       on the closing stock, level of profit, taxes etc. Normally under FIFO
       “gross profit is higher” but not for Strider Retail. If the candidate does not
       recognize the different scenario, no credit should be given.

(iii) Briefly explain one advantage and one disadvantage for Strider Retail of
      using the just-in-case stock control method for plasma televisions.      [4 marks]

    The information from the stimulus implies that with seasonal factors now
    becoming less of a priority for customers, Strider Retail may need to move
    to a just-in-case stock control method.

    Advantages could include the following:
    • satisfy customer demand more quickly as the customers do not have to
      wait for the plasma television to arrive
    • avoid missing out on potential increase in sales if they used just-in-time.
      Strider Retail can become more responsive to customers’ needs and
      demands
    • may act as a point of differentiation from its competitors who may run
      out of stock of plasma televisions if they continue to use just-in-time
    • purchasing economies of scale can be gained if a large quantity of plasma
      televisions are bought.

    Disadvantages could include the following:
    • given the rapid changes in technology and the consequent shorter life
      cycle of the plasma televisions, Strider Retail will need to order stocks of
      new plasma televisions carefully otherwise Strider Retail may be left
      with a large stock of obsolete and unsold products
    • just-in-case will tie up valuable working capital in current assets which
      may also be difficult to liquidate, if economic times or trading conditions
      become more difficult
    • employees’ motivation might decrease as the delegation and
      responsibilities of ordering stock when needed will be taken away.


    Mark as 2+2.

    Award [1 mark] for a relevant and correct advantage/disadvantage
    identified and [1 mark] for a relevant and correct brief explanation and
    application to Strider Retail or to its product (television).

    Please note: Just mentioning the name of the organization cannot be
    considered as application.

    Accept a reference to plasma televisions as a form of application.

    If there is no relevant application to the stimulus material award up to a
    maximum of [3 marks].

(c)   Analyse the impact of a shorter product life cycle for plasma televisions on
      Strider Retail’s cash flow.                                                  [6 marks]

      The rapid change in technology and the increase in availability of new and
      updated models of plasma televisions may have impacted both positively and
      negatively on the cash flow of retailers such as Strider Retail.

      Negative impacts could include the following:
      • The pressure is on Strider Retail to sell plasma televisions faster given that new
        models or versions will appear more quickly than previously. This may lead to
        smaller profit margins as well as cash inflow as indicated in the stimulus
        material Strider Retail will have to reduce prices to force higher volumes to be
        sold. This could lead to a problem of over-trading for Strider Retail.
      • Due to a shorter life cycle Strider Retail will have to update stock more often
        even if the older models have not been sold. Thus increasing the need to
        increase the cash out flow.
      • Given the above, Strider Retail will have to analyse carefully its supply chain
        to ensure supplies when demand is strong without holding excessive stock.
      • Strider Retail may have to offer credit terms in addition to cash as a
        promotional tool, which may also lead to less cash coming into the business.

      Positive impacts could include the following:
      • A new competitive position / advantage could be established on price and this
        may lead to an increase in cash flow, “if” other companies offer only
        just-in-time stocks.
      • Deep discounting, especially if the market is becoming more price elastic, may
        lead to further increases in revenue.
      • If Strider Retail moves to a just-in-case stock control method, an improvement
        of the cash flow may be seen due to lower prices negotiated from buying
        in bulk.

      Accept any other relevant analysis.


      For one relevant issue that is one-sided, with no analysis award up to a maximum

2.   (a)   Define the following terms:

           (i)    research and development                                                       [2 marks]

                  Research and development is discovering new knowledge about products,
                  processes and services (research), and then applying that knowledge to
                  create new and improved products, processes, and services that fulfil market
                  needs (development).


                  Candidates are not expected to word their definition exactly as above.

                  Award [1 mark] for a basic definition that conveys partial knowledge and
                  understanding (e.g. for defining only research or development).

                  Award [2 marks] for a full, clear definition that conveys knowledge and
                  understanding similar to the answer above.

                  For only a relevant: example or application to the stimulus award [1 mark].

           (ii)   snowballing.                                                                   [2 marks]

                  Snowballing is a method of primary market research based on gathering
                  data from pre-selected small samples of influential customers, who will then
                  network with other like-minded individual customers. These influential
                  customers will then inform the company of other like-minded customers
                  who could be useful in the market research process.


                  Candidates are not expected to word their definition exactly as above.

                  Award [1 mark] for a basic definition that conveys partial knowledge and
                  understanding.

                  Award [2 marks] for a full, clear definition that conveys knowledge and
                  understanding similar to the answer above.

                  For only a relevant: example or application to the stimulus award [1 mark].

(b)   Briefly explain one advantage and one disadvantage for Esperanto of only
      conducting primary market research.                                      [4 marks]

      The advantages of using primary market research are linked principally to the fact
      that the UniTran is a new innovative product and thus there will be no secondary
      data available.

      By using a snowballing research method, Esperanto will be able to get quick
      informed feedback on the product as used by professionals in their field. The link
      with the NGO (Medicine Sans Frontiers) may also give rise to some early
      marketing and promotional opportunities.
      • Primary market research of snowballing can save Esperanto money by
         forgoing a large pre-launch run of UniTran to test the device. Moreover,
         expert opinion will be given.
      • Esperanto can tailor the research to its specific need.
      • Only Esperanto will have the ownership of and access to the information
         gathered. This is very important given the nature of such an innovative
         product.
      • Accept any other relevant advantage.

      Disadvantages of using primary market research are linked to the problems of a
      small sample chosen for the snowballing exercise.

      The sample chosen will be biased and thus will the information given to
      Esperanto be useful especially given that:
      • The respondents chosen for the research may not have had to pay for the device
        and one notes its high initial cost.
      • Will the snowballing exercise take too long and be too expensive to organize?
        Some of the respondents may be difficult to reach for quick survey feedback.
      • Accept any other relevant disadvantage linked to the snowballing exercise
        “or” to primary market research in general.


      Mark as 2+2.

      Award [1 mark] for a relevant and correct advantage/disadvantage identified
      and [1 mark] for a relevant and correct explanation, up to a maximum of
      [2 marks].

      If a candidate does not contextualize their answer or simply writes that the
      primary research will be accurate but costly then award only [1 mark] as this
      answer is not developed.

      If there is no relevant application to the stimulus material award up to a maximum
      of [3 marks].

(c)   (i)   On the lined paper provided for your answer, construct a fully labelled
            network diagram to represent the sequence of activities in the table.
            Show the earliest starting time (EST) and the latest finishing time
            (LFT) for each activity and the critical path.                                     [6 marks]




                  = Critical path
                                                            EST
              EST = Earliest starting time         Number          = Activity node
              LFT = Latest finishing time                   LFT



            Critical path: A    B    D     F     G      H    I

            Duration 24 weeks


            [1 to 2 marks]
            There is some evidence of understanding the model and some attempt at
            construction and ESTs and LFTs are shown. For [1 mark] there is minimal
            understanding but the diagram bears no resemblance to the markscheme.
            For [2 marks] there are more than two errors.

            [3 to 4 marks]
            The network is constructed, but may not be well drawn and may not be
            entirely accurately presented. For [3 marks] there are two errors, the critical
            path may not be identified and a key may not be present. The ESTs and
            LFTs are largely correct but some errors (up to two) may be included for
            [4 marks].

            [5 to 6 marks]
            For [5 marks] there is one error or the critical path is not identified or a key
            is not present. For [6 marks] the network is accurately constructed and well
            presented. The critical path is identified and a key is provided. The ESTs
            and LFTs are correct.

            Do not penalize a response more than once for errors that are carried
            forward.

(ii)   Calculate the total float on the network diagram and comment on its
       implications for New World (show all your working).                 [3 marks]

       Please allow Own Figure Rule (OFR) if the candidate has calculated the
       floats based on incorrect figures on the diagram in part (i).

       LFT of an activity – Duration – EST of the activity
       At node 3 for activity C: EST of C = 4.
       At node 4 for activity E: LFT of C = 10.
       Duration of C = 5.

       Hence total float = LFT of C – EST of C – duration of C = 10 – 4 – 5 = 1
       week.

       E also has a float of 1 day   14 – 4 – 9 = 1 week

       All the other activities on the critical path have 0 float (no need for
       calculation).

       Either activity C or E can be delayed by 1 week (if the preceding activity
       starts on time) but if activity C is delayed by 1 week and so is E then the
       whole network will be delayed by 1 further week.

       Implications for New World could include:
       • Activity C can be delayed by 1 week without impacting on the critical
         path and the project can still be completed in 24 weeks.
       • If a delay occurs on any of the activities on the critical path that have 0
         total float, the management can transfer resources from either C or E to
         those activities, provided a delay in any of the activities will not exceed
         1 week.
       • If activity C or E is completed within 5 weeks, then labour could be
         transferred to other tasks for the float week to ensure other tasks on the
         critical path are completed on time.


       Award [1 mark] for correct calculation of the total float with working
       shown of either C or E.

       Award [2 marks] for two correct implications identified.

      (iii) Briefly outline one benefit to New World from constructing the network
            diagram.                                                               [2 marks]

           The network diagram will allow New World to:
           • see a visual display – the diagram clearly illustrates and hence makes it
             easier to follow the type/nature of the activities, the order of activities
             and the dependency between some activities so that the marketing and
             product launch can be completed
           • see those activities, which are critical and must be completed without
             delaying the marketing and product launch
           • identify float time on the network so that resources can be transferred
             from non-critical activities to critical activities with no overall impact on
             the duration.


           For [1 mark] the benefit is accurate but is generic and makes no mention
           of New World being able to complete the marketing and product launch
           on time.

           For [2 marks] the benefit is accurate and relevant to New World’s marketing
           and product launch.

(d)   Analyse New World’s suggestion to use short distribution channels for the
      UniTran.                                                                  [6 marks]

      Arguments in support of the idea of a short channel such as direct marketing, the
      use of specialized retailers or agents for distribution of this new technological
      product could include:
      • It is a technical product which will require additional support such as guidance
         on use and other after-sales services.
      • Esperanto will be able to better control the quality of the service and
         distribution as well as being closer to its customers. Feedback can be collected
         more easily about the product features, suggestions etc. In short, the preferred
         method of primary research can be more easily carried out by Esperanto.
      • A short channel would be appropriate for ease of communication with the
         manufacturer in case of product failure or technical queries.
      • A short channel could be cheaper and some price reductions might be possible
         to make the UniTran more affordable.
      • Logistical difficulties or breaks in the supply chain may be more difficult to
         handle if the product is sold in longer channels.

      However:
      • If sales do exceed targets and the product can be sold into a global market,
        then short channels may be inappropriate.
      • Given Esperanto’s desire to see the product as “global”, longer channels may
        be required in international markets, for example the use of local agents or
        other intermediaries like wholesalers and retailers of electronic goods.
      • Longer channels may allow economies of scale. As product familiarity grows
        and the target market are no longer the early adopter and innovators, a more
        mass market distributor can be used. Larger retail stores will be able to offer
        wider distribution and lower prices, increasing retail volumes further.

The candidates are expected to refer to the nature of the product – innovative, new
and unique. They are also expected to specify and explain with the use of some
relevant examples the nature of short and long distribution channels to reach the

                                              SECTION B

3.   (a)   Define the following terms:

           (i)    profit                                                                          [2 marks]

                  Profit is calculated by subtracting total costs from total sales revenue
                  earned. Profit can be defined as the reward for successful risk-taking in
                  business. It is a reward for the entrepreneurs.

                  For [2 marks] the candidates are expected to refer to what is profit and what
                  it is for – “the meaning of profit” and how it is calculated.


                  Candidates are not expected to word their definition exactly as above.

                  Award [1 mark] for a basic definition that conveys partial knowledge and
                  understanding. For example if a candidate writes only that profit is total
                  revenue – total costs.

                  Award [2 marks] for a full, clear definition that conveys knowledge and
                  understanding similar to the answer above.

                  For only a relevant: example or application to the stimulus award [1 mark].

           (ii)   takeover.                                                                       [2 marks]

                  A takeover is a form of business integration where one company decides to
                  purchase a controlling interest in another company. Controlling 51 % of
                  shares allows for the control of the taken over company. A takeover may be
                  hostile if the company taken over (target) does not wish to be owned.


                  If a candidate writes only “a takeover is when a company buys or purchases
                  another company” then award [1 mark].

                  Note: For the IB syllabus, we assume that mergers are voluntary agreements
                  to join together and that takeovers are involuntary i.e. they are different.
                  Please note in some countries a merger and a takeover are defined as the
                  same thing and candidates should not be penalized for using the word
                  merger.

                  Candidates are not expected to word their definition exactly as above.

                  If a candidate writes only “a takeover is when a company takes over another
                  company”, give [0 marks].

                  Award [1 mark] for a basic definition that conveys partial knowledge and
                  understanding.

(b)   (i)    Briefly explain two benefits of brand loyalty to Lego.                         [4 marks]

             • Brand loyalty creates price inelastic customers. Customers could
               possibly be charged higher prices than rival toy brick manufacturers due
               to brand loyalty.
             • Information from the stimulus material that Lego has enjoyed brand
               loyalty and trust at a time of recession, which has allowed sales to grow.
               Customers did not switch to other brands.
             • Brand loyalty may lead to an increase in the value of the company
               beyond the accounting value of its assets. It adds to the value of its
               intangible assets. It is said in the stimulus material that Lego created
               intangible assets due to brand loyalty. This would increase the purchase
               price of the company and could deter possible takeover advances from
               companies such as Mattel.
             • Possible savings in promotional costs as the brand is well-known by
               parents and children.
             • Accept any other relevant benefit linked to brand loyalty.


             Mark as 2+2.

             Award [1 mark] for each relevant and correct benefit identified and
             [1 mark] for a brief explanation.

             If there is no relevant application to the stimulus material award up to a
             maximum of [3 marks].

             For 2009 = 18.91 % to 2 d.p.


             Award [1 mark] for each correct calculation which must be a percentage

(c)   Analyse two possible reasons why Mattel would have tried to takeover Lego.           [6 marks]

      Possible reasons for the takeover attempt could include:
      • Clearly as a global brand, Lego would be an attractive target for takeover.
        The brand loyalty gained could be considerable.
      • There could be a number of economies of scale gained through distribution
        channels, purchasing of supplies and in marketing.
      • Mattel’s management might have assumed that the dissatisfied stakeholders
        which must includes some of the family shareholders, might be willing to sell
        their shares given the losses in 2004 and the unsuccessful diversification.
      • It would allow Mattel to spread risks as an American company enabling a
        number of managerial synergies with a family business based in Europe.
        Mattel could also find it easier to enter into some new geographical markets.

      However:
      • Possible culture clashes between the two companies. Lego is a family run
        business and Mattel is a large American toy manufacturer. There could also be
        time lags/delays in the takeover process.
      • The family members were unlikely to sell their shares and would have liked to
        protect the family ownership of Lego.
      • Given the considerable goodwill of Lego would the purchase price of Lego be
        too high for Mattel to afford?
      • Mattel would also have to absorb the losses which Lego had made from their
        ill-fated diversification into new markets.

(d)   Given the changes in the external environment, discuss whether Lego has
      changed its objectives towards achieving larger profits.                [9 marks]

      As a global brand does Lego perceive that they are immune to the changes in the
      external environment?

      Lego has retained the same ownership structure since 1932, which assumes that
      objectives have been consistent, however, the external environment will have
      changed and there will be many more competitors in the toys/games market.

      From the stimulus material there seems to be some mixed messages as to what
      Lego’s current objectives towards achieving larger profits might be and how
      the external environment has impacted on their decision-making process.
      The question is open-ended to allow a number of suitable appropriate responses.

      It is stated that maximizing profit has not been a focus for Lego. However, there
      is evidence from the stimulus material that the company is trying to position itself
      in new markets with existing products, or diversifying, which may suggest a
      deliberate action/response taken to move towards achieving larger profits given
      changes in some elements of the external environment such as the increased use
      of computer games. One might argue that Lego devised a strategy to take
      advantage of some social and technological factors and used these factors as
      opportunity to achieve profit.

      If not aiming for larger profits why the move into the Internet and the production
      of a film? These could be perceived as non-core activities and another indication
      that the company is aiming to achieve larger profits given a changing external
      environment.

      Ironically, however, the large profit was influenced by the recession of 2008–9
      as Lego customers looking for value for money returned to trusted brands.
      One might argue that Lego has not changed its objective and decided to maximize
      its profit. Lego benefited for some economic opportunities in the external
      environment.

      However, the word “achieving large profit” might indicate that Lego indeed
      changed its objectives regarding profit maximization.

      Given that Lego is family-owned and globally successful, does Lego need to
      pursue significant larger profit opportunities?

4.   (a)   Define the following terms:

           (i)   price elasticity                                                                [2 marks]

                 Price elasticity of demand/supply measures the responsiveness of
                 customers’ demand for and supply of a product to changes in the price of
                 the product. It is calculated by dividing the percentage change in quantity
                 demanded/supplied by the percentage change in the price of the product.

             A shareholder is an individual who by purchasing shares in a company
             obtains part ownership. Share ownership may give the owner a profit
             dividend, and/or a vote at the company’s Annual General Meeting to decide
             on who serves on the Board of Directors.

(b)   Explain two advantages to Enigma of using price discrimination.                      [6 marks]

      Using price discrimination allows Enigma to offer lower prices to those rural
      communities, subsidized by the business community who will pay higher prices.
      The stimulus material indicates how much of a necessity product electricity is to
      all citizens of this cold country in Northern Europe.

      Advantages could include the following:
      • Offering electricity at a subsidized rate will build up significant goodwill
        for Enigma, especially in rural poorer communities. Loyalty is likely to be
        created which will be very beneficial if more competitors enter the market.
        Enigma may also be able to create an ethical image with all the benefits
        associated with such an image.
      • Price discrimination and the resulting higher revenues from the business
        community who is assumed to be more price inelastic than households given
        the need to produce/generate high level of profit. The profit allows Enigma to
        invest in new technology, in order to become more productive in the future and
        guarantee future supplies of electricity.
      • Enigma might fend off the intervention of the government and or any other
        regulatory body and pressure groups.
      • Accept any other relevant advantage.


      Mark as 3+3.

      Award [1 mark] for identifying each appropriate advantage of an organization
      using price discrimination (which may be generic), [1 mark] for an appropriate
      explanation that directly refers to Enigma and [1 mark] for a further development
      of this explanation up to a maximum of [3 marks].

(c)   Using Herzberg’s motivational theory, analyse the motivation of Enigma’s
      senior managers.                                                         [6 marks]

      It is expected that candidates will refer to Herzberg and demonstrate knowledge of
      the two factor theory. Candidates must refer to “motivators” such as those
      prescribed by “job enrichment” (such as personal growth, recognition, etc.) to
      access the top markbands, given that hygiene factors which are present in
      themselves do not motivate.

      Answers should also be in context with respect to senior managers and not
      workers or other stakeholders involved in Enigma in order to access the top
      markbands.

      It is expected that the candidate present and explain the theory either separately or
      throughout their response. The distinction between the two types of factors must
      be made.

      Arguments for senior mangers being motivated:
      • Given the amount of money given as bonuses, one can assume that the hygiene
        factors are met. Moreover, there is no information about lack of facilities,
        problems in working condition and so on in the stimulus material.
      • There is evidence from the stimulus material that some of the key motivators
        suggested by Herzberg’s motivation theory of job enrichment could motivate
        the best university graduates to work at Enigma. The amount of the bonuses
        given also indicated appreciation, fulfilments etc.
      • Senior managers may also feel a great deal of responsibility towards ensuring
        future supplies, which is another feature of the job enrichment theory of
        motivation.
      • The university graduates would eventually become highly-skilled, which
        according to the job enrichment school of thought surrounding personal growth
        is a key motivating force.

      Arguments against senior mangers being motivated:
      • Senior managers may not be motivated according to the “motivators” as the
        stimulus material refers to “million dollar reward packages” available to those
        higher up the hierarchy. If these packages are intended to satisfy hygiene
        needs, then the senior managers may feel that the hygiene factors are being
        provided regardless of whether they are efficient or not – as stated by some of
        the stakeholders. The package may seem excessive and unjust in a country
        where the average annual wage is the lowest in Europe. The hygiene factors
        may actually cause dissatisfaction as the senior managers may feel dissatisfied
        with the excessive package.
      • We must also assume that some senior managers may be demotivated, due to
        the perceived unethical position the company appears to be taking by awarding
        million dollar reward packages during a recession.

      Accept any other relevant analysis.

(d)   Evaluate solutions to two possible stakeholder conflicts present at Enigma.               [9 marks]

      This question is open-ended, inviting candidates to consider a number of
      stakeholder conflicts.
      Candidates are expected to:
      • identify and explain the conflicts
      • provide a solution or solutions for each of the two conflicts indentified
      • and evaluate the solution(s) and provide a judgment.

      Please note: the solution(s) for each conflict should be evaluated for the
      candidates to reach the top markband.

      Pressure groups versus Enigma

      Profits have become too high according to pressure groups. But CEO Bjorn
      Andersson argues that the profits are necessary for Enigma to guarantee electricity
      supply through the cold months. The government may have to insist that Enigma
      reveals details of its operations to pressure groups to ascertain whether the profit
      is too high. One problem is that Enigma does not have any competitors
      (“distributes electricity to over 90 % of households”) so it will be difficult to judge
      what is meant by high. Pressure groups may have looked for international
      comparisons. The Internet has provided greater transparency for pressure groups
      to get information about high profits and make international comparisons.

      Judgment:
      This solution is difficult to resolve given the nature of the service which Enigma
      generates and distributes. Also, funds for further investment are essential. It is
      vital to have this power in such a cold country. Enigma will need to show how it
      uses its profits to guarantee electricity supply. Other methods of price
      discrimination might have to be considered like time of day. Moreover, Enigma
      might have to reduce bonuses especially given the substantial loss in 2010. Such
      action as well as a possible promise of green investment may somewhat satisfy
      the pressure groups.

      Government/shareholders versus Enigma

      A government rescue package would demand that Enigma uses this money for
      ensuring electricity supplies and not for rewarding managers for producing
      significant losses. (Ethical conflict of using public money for private gain.)
      Shareholders are upset that money in the company is being used to reward
      inefficient senior managers.
                                       – 24 –           M11/3/BUSMT/HP2/ENG/TZ0/XX/M


Enigma (Bjorn) could argue that the losses were created by the recession and not
the senior managers and that future supplies of electricity are threatened if it does
not offer “superstar reward packages” to recruit and motivate future senior
managers.

Possible solution(s):
• Enigma to be forced to pay the money back to the government when
   profitability is restored.
• Shareholders to demand greater transparency around what constitutes the
   rewards package. Performance criteria should be established and made
   transparent. A representative from the government might participate in the
   appraisal process.
• Given the monopoly power of Enigma, the government can step up regulations,
   intervention with the organization.
• Some managers to offer to pay back their bonuses. Although this may be
   considered just a “public relations” exercise by the shareholders and not treated
   seriously.
Given the previously high profits the company has earned, Enigma should make
every attempt to pay back the rescue package when the recession is over otherwise
another public relations disaster is likely to happen. This should calm the
shareholders but may anger the pressure groups again if we assume that very high
profits will return.

Business community of electricity versus rural poorer community

A conflict may arise between two stakeholder groups affected by price
discrimination.

This conflict could be resolved by adjusting the current prices charged to the two
customers to reflect more appropriate market conditions, but given the nature of
the product (electricity) and the cold climate, Enigma runs the risk of raising the
anger of the pressure groups at a sensitive time given that Enigma supplies over
90 % of households.

Accept any other relevant conflicts between stakeholders.

There are a number of conflicts here with some being very difficult to reconcile.
Enigma will clearly have to take the ethical stance and pay back the money owing
to the government when profits return. The onus will be on Bjorn Andersson who
will need to prove that these “superstar rewards packages” are really rewarding
superstars.

A solution for a conflict may easily create another between other stakeholders.
Some short-term solutions might create long-term ones.

           stimulus material but there is no judgment/conclusion.

           Candidates cannot reach the [5–7] markband if they give judgment/conclusions
           that are not based on analysis/explanation already given in their answer.

5.   (a)   Define the following terms:

           (i)   corporate culture                                                             [2 marks]

                 Corporate culture refers to the set of values, attitudes, norms and beliefs
                 present in a given organization. Corporate culture determines the working
                 practices of an organization, the structure and the management styles used.

      (ii)   diseconomies of scale.                                                        [2 marks]

             Diseconomies of scale refer to the increase in the average or unit cost of
             production as an organization’s scale of operation grows beyond a certain
             level.


             Candidates are not expected to word their definition exactly as above.

(b)   Explain two reasons for the growth of multinational telecommunications
      companies in Uruguay in the home telephone market since 2005.          [6 marks]

      • New legislation. The Uruguayan home telephone market remained closed until
        2005 when the government passed legislation to allow foreign competition.
        The liberalization of the market enabled multinational telecommunications
        companies such as Allo to enter, compete, and grow in the home telephone
        market segment.
      • Multinational telecommunications companies use Uruguay as a first point of
        entry/penetration to enable a further expansion into much larger South
        American markets. Gaining a foothold in one country might provide the
        multinational telecommunications companies a cultural, operational experience
        that can be transferred to other countries in the region. Moreover, some trade
        barriers may be overcome.
      • A multinational telecommunications company might want to take advantage of
        a current fragmented telecommunication market in Uruguay. Ansell only has
        25 % of the market, hence opportunities exists to establish a significant market
        share in Uruguay especially if (and only if) the quality of the service provided
        by a state owned organization is not of the highest quality.
                                           – 27 –           M11/3/BUSMT/HP2/ENG/TZ0/XX/M


      Some more generic points:
      • Economies of scale. Multinational telecommunications companies such as Allo
        can benefit from economies of scale and fiercely compete against relatively
        small local companies like Ansell, which are generally less efficient and
        struggle to find financial support and update technology. But the real answer is
        the opening of the market which allows the multinational telecommunications
        companies into Uruguay. The point above refers to some incentives/benefits to
        the organization.
      • Research and development. Multinational telecommunications companies such
        as Allo are able to make strong investments in innovation and technology that
        allow them to offer better services and lower prices to potential customers.
        Such investments are generally difficult to be achieved by smaller companies
        like Ansell.
      • Marketing expertise and marketing campaigns.                      Multinational
        telecommunications companies such as Allo can benefit from marketing
        expertise. As they operate globally, they have vast experience and know how
        to better commercialize telecommunication services. They are also able to
        make strong advertising and marketing campaigns that are not financially
        accessible to small scale operators such as Ansell.
      • Accept any other relevant reason.

      Accept any other relevant explanation.


      Candidates may use one reason that is directly applicable to Uruguay and another
      more generic one to achieve full marks.

      Mark as 3+3.

      Award [1 mark] for identifying one appropriate reason for the growth,
      [1 mark] for an appropriate explanation that applies to the stimulus and [1 mark]
      for a further development of the explanation up to a maximum of [3 marks].

(c)   Analyse the consequences of clashes in leadership styles if Ansell and Ronaldo
      merge (first option).                                                          [6 marks]

      Clashes occur when two merging companies find dissimilarities in their corporate
      cultures. The resulting ambiguity can possibly change the nature, orientation and
      character of one or both of the merger partners.

      Due to its autocratic leadership style, Ansell is likely to concentrate
      decision-making on managers, with low levels of delegation and minimal
      employee consultation. Autocratic leadership styles are generally unsuccessful
      when employees are independent and highly-skilled. Clashes with Ronaldo’s
      different leadership style could cause staff confusion, dissatisfaction, and
      difficulty to adapt to the new situation could lead to lower productivity levels
      diseconomies of scale – as stated in the stimulus and increased staff turnover.
      Subsequently, the merge will be unsuccessful and both companies will be unlikely
      to reap the financial and marketing benefits from this option.
                                            – 28 –           M11/3/BUSMT/HP2/ENG/TZ0/XX/M


      On the other hand, one may argue that:
      Ansell and Ronaldo’s merger and its inherent clashes will inevitably lead to an
      adaptation process of their leadership styles. Perhaps some management of
      change strategies may ease the integration. The closer the companies are in their
      cultures, the less painful the process will be.

      Moreover, perhaps the merger could be a defensive one and save both companies
      from further financial problems. The financial and marketing benefits may
      outweigh the clashes in leadership styles. Employees may accept the nature of the
      autocratic style given the current problems. If and when the financial situation
      improves, perhaps the leadership style should evolve.

(d)   Discuss the second and third options available to Ansell.                             [9 marks]

      As a second option, Ansell can form a joint venture with the Italian multinational
      telecommunications company Pronto. It is an external growth strategy which
      should enable quick growth. Due to its experience in the global market, Pronto
      could enable Ansell to better operate its services in the home telephone segment
      currently dominated by Allo. It can be seen as a defensive move against the
      market leader – a market follower or even a market challenger strategy. Ansell
      could benefit from Pronto’s technological upgrade and support to increase its
      market share.

      In return, Ansell will share its knowledge and understanding of the local market
      with Pronto that they could use as a platform to explore market potentialities in
      other countries in the region. The joint venture can provide Ansell with a stepping
      stone for further expansion. Ownership will not be lost and a synergy can be
      created between the two companies of the venture.

      However, Pronto’s venture with Ansell seems to be a very short-term deal;
      a one year commitment may not give Ansell enough time to compete effectively
      against the market leader Allo. Some disagreement may occur given the possible
      differences in work practices in two companies from different countries.
      A disagreement may arise regarding the sharing of the profit unless all very
      clearly set out.
                                        – 29 –         M11/3/BUSMT/HP2/ENG/TZ0/XX/M


As a third option, Ansell can choose to grow internally. The company is
developing a new service called “Rural-Ansell” to meet the needs of the
rural market segment. This could let Ansell gain a first-mover advantage and
stand out from its rivals. Ansell will then gain a broader customer base and
will keep control and ownership of the company. However, it is likely that this
alternative may take a long time to develop. In the meantime, potential rivals
entering the market due to the new legislation may expand and gain a competitive
advantage. If the first-mover advantage in the rural market segment is not
properly capitalized by Ansell, then Allo or any other competing company may in
turn gain second-mover advantage. In addition, the financial limitations that
Ansell is experiencing are likely to slow down or even threaten the company’s
growth process.

All in all, the two options entail both opportunities and risks for Ansell.
However, given the size of competitors and the increasing competition that the
new legislation will enable, Ansell’s internal growth seems to be a weaker
alternative. A joint venture with the Italian multinational Pronto may seem a
better choice for the relatively small Ansell to compete in the new context.
