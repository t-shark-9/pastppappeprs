These sources and questions relate to the role of the United States in the Suez Crisis of 1956.

SOURCE A                Extract from A History of the Arab–Israeli Conflict by Ian J Bickerton and
                        Carla Klausner, 2007.

During 1956, United States’ policy in the Middle East was to neutralize the Arab–Israeli conflict,
convince Arabs and Israelis to join the West against the Soviets and maintain oil supplies to
the West … But Arab nationalists saw the United States as an ally of the colonial powers and a supporter
of Israel … Egypt’s president Nasser, a nationalist, wanted the removal of Western influence from the
Middle East, to modernize Egypt, to promote pan-Arabism and to eradicate Israel … Eisenhower’s Secretary
of State, Dulles, offered Nasser, in return for concessions, economic aid for military equipment and to build
the Aswan Dam … Nasser, however, would not conform … When Dulles decided not to sell Nasser arms,
Nasser turned to the Soviet Union and purchased arms from Czechoslovakia, and recognized
Communist China. … Dulles withdrew United States’ support for the Aswan Dam. In retaliation,
Nasser nationalized the Suez Canal to use its profits to build the dam.


SOURCE B                Extract from a letter from British prime minister Anthony Eden to Eisenhower on
                        27 July 1956. Taken from The Suez Crisis by Anthony Gorst and Lewis Johnman,
                        1997.

We cannot allow Nasser to seize control of the Canal in defiance of international agreements … If we do,
our influence and yours throughout the Middle East will be destroyed … The Canal is vital to the free world
… the Egyptians’ complete lack of technical qualifications and their behaviour show that they cannot be
trusted to manage it. … We should not be involved in legal quibbles [quarrels] about rights to nationalize
an Egyptian company, or in financial arguments about their capacity to pay the compensation. We should
bring maximum political pressure to bear on Egypt and in the last resort, to use force … the first step must
be for you and us and France to exchange views and align our policies.


SOURCE C                Extract from Eisenhower and the Suez Crisis of 1956 by Cole C Kingseed, 1995.

The nationalization of the Suez Canal threatened many states … the British saw its oil supply and strategic
control of the Middle East endangered … France saw Egypt as a supplier of arms for Algerian rebels; and a
reinforcement of Nasser’s influence over North Africa … Israel was worried about interference with their
shipping rights through the canal and further encouragement of the Palestinian guerrilla campaign …
Without consulting their American ally in advance, the three countries devised and executed a plan to
retaliate against Egypt … The Soviet Union branded Britain, France and Israel as “aggressors” and
threatened to intervene militarily in defense of Egypt … Moscow contacted Washington with a view to
a joint US–Soviet military operation against them. Eisenhower rejected this proposal … Nevertheless,
Eisenhower was furious, and shouted: “Tell them that we’re going to apply sanctions, we’re going
to the United Nations, and we’re going to do everything that there is so we can stop this thing!”

SOURCE D               Extract from president Eisenhower’s address to the nation on 31 October 1956.
                       Taken from The Cold War: A History Through Documents by Edward H Judge and
                       John W Langdon, 1999.

Matters came to a crisis when the Egyptian government seized the Suez Canal … some among our
allies urged a reaction by force. We urged otherwise, and our wish prevailed, through a long succession
of conferences and negotiations … But the direct relations of Egypt with both Israel and France
kept worsening to a point at which they determined that there could be no protection of their vital
interests without resort to force … The United States was not consulted in any way about any phase of
these actions. … these actions were taken in error. We do not accept the use of force for the settlement of
international disputes. To say this is not to minimize our friendship with these nations … But their action
can scarcely be reconciled with the principles of the United Nations to which we have all subscribed …
Yesterday we went to the United Nations with a request that hostilities in the area be brought to a close.
The proposal was vetoed by Great Britain and by France … We intend to bring this matter before the
United Nations General Assembly. There, with no veto operating, the opinion of the world can be brought
to bear in our quest for a just end to this problem.

   Eisenhower is shown as a cowboy with a rope and Khrushchev as an Arab. Both are trying to catch
       a runaway camel labelled “Middle East”. Anthony Eden is on the floor in the background.
