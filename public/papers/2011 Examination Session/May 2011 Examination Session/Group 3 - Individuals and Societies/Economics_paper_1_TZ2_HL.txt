Answer one question. Each question is worth [25 marks].

1.    (a)   Using at least one diagram, explain why a firm in perfect competition
            might only be able to make supernormal (abnormal) profits in the short-run and
            not in the long-run.                                                             [10 marks]

      (b)   Evaluate the view that perfect competition is a more desirable market form
            than oligopoly.                                                                  [15 marks]


2.    (a)   Explain two policies a government might use to redistribute income.              [10 marks]

      (b)   “Measures to promote greater income equality should be a key feature of
            government economic policy.” Evaluate this proposition.                          [15 marks]


3.    (a)   Using the theory of comparative advantage, explain how countries might
            benefit from free trade and specialization.                                      [10 marks]

      (b)   Evaluate the arguments in favour of barriers to international trade.             [15 marks]


4.    (a)   Explain the main features of export-led growth strategies used to achieve
            economic development.                                                            [10 marks]

      (b)   Evaluate the view that economic development in less-developed countries
            (LDCs) can best be achieved through export-led growth strategies rather than
            import substitution.                                                             [15 marks]
