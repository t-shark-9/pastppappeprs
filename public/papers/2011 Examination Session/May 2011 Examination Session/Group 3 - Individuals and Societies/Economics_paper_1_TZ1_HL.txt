Answer one question. Each question is worth [25 marks].

1.    (a)   Using an appropriate diagram, explain how a monopolist might be able to make
            supernormal (abnormal) profits in the short-run, and why these profits might
            continue to be earned in the long-run.                                             [10 marks]

      (b)   Evaluate the view that monopolistic competition is a more economically
            desirable market form than monopoly.                                               [15 marks]


2.    During the global financial crisis of 2008–2009, there was a fall in consumer spending
      in many countries.

      (a)   Explain the factors which might be responsible for causing consumer spending
            to fall.                                                                           [10 marks]

      (b)   Evaluate the possible consequences of falling consumer spending for a
            country’s macroeconomic performance.                                               [15 marks]


3.    (a)   Using the theory of comparative advantage, explain how specialization and
            free trade might lead to welfare gains for developed countries.                    [10 marks]

      (b)   Evaluate the possible impact of globalization on the economies of
            developed countries.                                                               [15 marks]


4.    (a)   Explain the main features of market-led strategies used to achieve economic
            development in less-developed countries (LDCs).                                    [10 marks]

      (b)   Evaluate the view that economic development in less-developed countries
            (LDCs) can best be achieved through market-led strategies rather than
            interventionist strategies.                                                        [15 marks]
