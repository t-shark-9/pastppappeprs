                         a payment received for which no good or service is exchanged
                         a payment made by the government to individuals (for the purpose

           right/increase in supply of food with lower prices and increased output or
           for explaining that a subsidy lowers costs for producers and so causes
           supply to increase, which lowers price and increases output.

       2   Correct application of appropriate theory                                        3–4

           imposed below the market equilibrium price on food items, indicating a
           shortage or for explaining that at the maximum price, demand exceeds
           supply and so excess demand (a shortage) exists.

(d)   Using information from the text/data and your knowledge of economics,
      evaluate the use of price controls to limit the impact of rising food prices
      on consumers.                                                                     [8 marks]

      Responses may include:
        a definition of price controls, including reference to maximum prices which
        are imposed below the existing market equilibrium price.

      Possible advantages of imposing price controls:
        lower prices for consumers for basic foods (paragraph )
        those in poverty will be better able to maintain adequate standards of living
        social unrest may be avoided (paragraph )
        may limit “unreasonable” price increases (paragraph )
        may reduce inflationary expectations
        may slow down the impact on consumers (paragraph )
        distributional benefits with regard to the effect on lower income households’
        real incomes.

      Possible disadvantages of imposing price controls:
        price controls may lead to a shortage of basic foods (paragraph )
        consumers may need to queue to purchase food (paragraph )
        an informal market/parallel market may develop (paragraph )
        when price controls are removed, high inflation may result (paragraphs 
        and )
        may lead to market distortions because price controls discourage domestic
        production (paragraph )
        may lead to neglect of market based solutions to rising prices
        does little to reduce inflation (paragraph )
        the allocation of food may be arbitrary/unfair
        high opportunity cost of hours spent in line (loss of use of productive time)
        loss of revenue for producers
        may increase government expenditure caused by the need to enforce price
        controls.

      Effective evaluation may be to:
         consider short-term versus long-term consequences
         examine the impact on different stakeholders
         discuss advantages and disadvantages
         prioritize the arguments.

      Examiners should be aware that candidates may take a different approach
      which if appropriate, should be rewarded.

      If there is no direct reference to the text/data, then candidates may not be
      rewarded beyond level 2.

      For a business cycle diagram, the vertical axis should represent some sort of
      economic activity and the horizontal axis should be time (there is no necessity
      to use the years from the data). Some candidates may use economic growth on
      the vertical axis, which will make the business cycle move around the
      horizontal axis. A title is not necessary.

           For drawing an AD/AS (or ADL/ASL) diagram showing a shift of AD (or
           ADL) to the left or for explaining that unemployment is demand
           deficient/cyclical because of the falling aggregate demand and the
           resultant fall in the demand for workers.

       2   Correct application of appropriate theory                                         3–4
           For drawing an AD/AS (or ADL/ASL) diagram showing a shift of AD (or
           ADL) to the left and for explaining that unemployment is demand
           deficient/cyclical because of the falling aggregate demand and the
           resultant fall in the demand for workers.

      N.B. Candidates may state that the unemployment may be structural, because
      of the increase in demand for imports, over domestic products, and if this is
      explained well, then this approach should be fully rewarded.

      Candidates who incorrectly label diagrams can receive a maximum of
      [3 marks].

      For AD/AS, the vertical axis may be price level, average price level, or
      inflation. The horizontal axis may be output, real output, national output, real
      national output, national income (Y), or GDP. Any appropriate abbreviations
      such as APL, CPI, RNO, or RNY are allowable. A title is not necessary.

(d)   Using information from the text/data and your knowledge of economics,
      evaluate the likely effectiveness of the German government’s fiscal policies
      designed to boost the economy and reduce unemployment.                           [8 marks]

      Responses may include:
       a definition of fiscal policy
       an AD/AS diagram showing an expansionary fiscal policy.

      Possible strengths of the policy responses by the German government:
        increased government spending should increase aggregate demand
        stimulus spending should increase consumer and business confidence
        (paragraph )
        stimulus payments will reduce tax payments by consumers and businesses
        increased social welfare spending should allow more people in Germany to
        maintain an adequate standard of living
        increased demand for goods and services may require more people to be
        employed and reduce the level of unemployment
        supply side policies leading to an increase in LRAS and a lower natural rate
        of unemployment (paragraph )
        cuts in personal income tax and corporate tax may produce a positive effect
        on AS (paragraph ).

      Possible weaknesses of the policy responses by the German government:
        the government response has been hesitant, slow and not large enough
        to outweigh the impact of the global economic crisis (figures for the first
        stimulus package of 12 billion euros are proportionally small)
        (paragraphs  and )
        many of the measures will not have an impact until 2010 (paragraph )
        increased saving by consumers may reduce the impact of increased
        government spending
        increased demand for goods may be satisfied by using existing stocks of
        produced goods
        the export sector may not be assisted by the spending
        the planned deficit budgets will require increased government borrowing
        which will increase public debt
        the increased government spending may cause a sharp increase in inflation
        when recovery begins in 2010 (paragraph ).

      Effective evaluation may be to:
         consider short-term versus long-term consequences
         examine the impact on different stakeholders

            for explaining that a depreciation would decrease prices of exports and
            increase AD leading to an increase in the price level.

      N.B. Candidates may say that the fall in the exchange rate will make imports
      more expensive, thus shifting the SRAS curve to the left, and increasing prices.
      If the diagram is correct and the explanation is clear, then this approach should
      be fully rewarded.

      Candidates who incorrectly label diagrams can receive a maximum of
      [3 marks].

      For AD/AS, the vertical axis may be price level, average price level, or
      inflation. The horizontal axis may be output, real output, national output, real
      national output, national income (Y), or GDP. Any appropriate abbreviations
      such as APL, CPI, RNO, or RNY are allowable. A title is not necessary.

(d)   Using information from the text/data and your knowledge of economics,
      evaluate the likely effectiveness of the response by the central bank of
      Brazil to the economic crisis facing Brazil.                                   [8 marks]

      Responses may include:
        a definition of interest rate
        a definition of a central bank
        reference to the interest rate cuts
        reference to increase in the money supply
        reference to the significance of table data.

      Possible strengths of the response:
        makes borrowing cheaper
        may increase borrowing, alleviating the tight credit conditions
        (paragraph )
        may increase business investment
        may increase consumer spending
        may increase AD
        policy allows for stimulus when the budget deficit makes fiscal policy
        difficult (Table)
        may increase production and employment, since 2010 estimate for real GDP
        growth is above the estimate for 2009 (Table)
        reduce negative impacts of recession.

      Possible weaknesses of the response:
        lower borrowing costs may not cause increased borrowing
        there are time lags between the decision to lower rates and expansionary
        effects on the economy (paragraph )
        banks may not pass on the reduced interest rates
        existing borrowers may decide to pay off loans more quickly
        may not cause increased consumer spending
        may not cause increased business investment
        interest rates may rise if the government needs to borrow money to finance
        government spending
        inflation may increase – 4.4 % expected in 2009 (Table) – due to the
        exchange rate depreciation and rising import prices
        may cause inflation during a recovery
        cut in interest rate and expected depreciation may not result in increased
        exports due to the global nature of the recession.

      Effective evaluation may be to:
         consider short-term versus long-term consequences
         examine the impact on different stakeholders
         discuss advantages and disadvantages
         prioritize the arguments.

(d)   Using information from the text/data and your knowledge of economics,
      evaluate whether increased protection for the Australian car industry will
      benefit the Australian economy.                                                  [8 marks]

      Responses may include:
        a definition of protection with examples from the text
        an identification of the nature of protectionism for the Australian car
        industry, (tariff, but at a reduced rate; subsidies to producers).

      Possible advantages of increased protection:
        increased demand for Australian produced cars
        increased production of cars in Australia
        increased production of more fuel-efficient cars (paragraph )
        increased employment in the Australian car industry (paragraph )
        increased income for Australian car industry workers (paragraph )
        reduced market failure, if greener cars are produced, whether domestically
        or imported (paragraph )
        Australia remains one of only 15 countries that can design, engineer and
        build a car from scratch (paragraph ).

      Possible disadvantages of increased protection:
        less demand for imported cars if the effects of subsidies were to outweigh
        the effects of the planned cut in tariffs
        lower revenue for car importers if the effects of subsidies were to outweigh
        the effects of the planned cut in tariffs
        the need for government payment of subsidies (paragraph )
        the opportunity cost of providing increased subsidies
        more fuel-efficient cars can be provided more cheaply by producing them
        overseas rather than in Australia (paragraph )
        less efficient allocation of resources
        limits competitive pressures in the Australian car industry (paragraph )
        negative impact on employment and incomes of other industries
        (paragraph ).

                        An explanation that it is any of:
                          the abuse of public office for private gain
                          the abuse of power
                          the dishonest use of power (position).

                   N.B. A weak explanation plus an appropriate example would be acceptable
                   for [2 marks]. Examples might include activities such as bribery, misuse of
                   contract payments, and embezzlement. This is a difficult definition to give
                   in an exact sense, so examiners will need to use their judgment.

                  An explanation that it is any logical circular chain of events starting
                  and ending in any one of the causes of poverty, such as low income,
                  low savings levels, low investment, low growth, low education levels,
                  or poverty itself.

             N.B. A correctly drawn, appropriate, poverty cycle would be sufficient for
             full marks.

      The use of P and Q on the axis is sufficient for a demand and supply diagram.
      A title is not necessary.

            or for explaining that the discovery of new oil deposits increases the
            quantity of factors of production thus increasing potential output.

       2    Correct application of appropriate theory                                         3–4
            For drawing a PPC diagram showing an outward shift of the PPC curve
            and for explaining that the discovery of new oil deposits increases the
            quantity of factors of production thus increasing potential output.

      Candidates who incorrectly label diagrams can receive a maximum of
      [3 marks].

      For a PPC, the axis could be two alternative products, one for each axis,
      e.g. Good A and Good B; or two groups of products, e.g. consumer goods and
      capital goods. A title is not necessary.

      N.B. Candidates may instead use an LRAS diagram, showing a shift to the
      right of the LRAS, and give the same explanation as above. If this is illustrated
      and explained fully, then this approach should be fully rewarded.

      For AD/LRAS, the vertical axis may be price level, average price level, or
      inflation. The horizontal axis may be output, real output, national output, real
      national output, national income (Y) or GDP. Any appropriate abbreviations
      such as APL, CPI, RNO, or RNY are allowable. A title is not necessary.

(d)   Using information from the text/data and your knowledge of economics,
      evaluate the consequences of oil dependency on the growth and
      development of Nigeria.                                                            [8 marks]

      Responses may include:
        a definition of growth
        a definition of development
        an explanation of oil dependency.

      Possible advantages of oil dependency:
        high export revenue from oil (95 % of export revenue) (paragraph )
        employment for 35 000 Nigerians (paragraph )
        the industry generates higher incomes than other industries
        the industry should generate revenue for the government
        the increased government revenue should allow more spending on
        education, health and infrastructure (paragraph )
        the PED of oil is inelastic
        the increased government spending should allow a higher standard of living
        for all Nigerians.

      Possible disadvantages of oil dependency:
        the high dependency on oil (95 % of export revenue) leaves Nigeria very
        exposed to any fluctuations in price and demand for oil (paragraph )
        in a country of 140 million people, the oil industry only employs 35 000
        people (paragraphs  and )
        oil production is relatively capital intensive, so does not provide much extra
        employment
        the dependency on oil has distorted investment decisions and caused neglect
        of other industries (paragraph )
        oil is a depletable resource and may run out
        possibility of negative externalities from drilling, fuel prices, etc.
        dependence on multinational oil companies to provide investment and to run
        the operations.

      Effective evaluation may be to:
         consider short-term versus long-term consequences
         examine the impact on different stakeholders
         discuss advantages and disadvantages
         prioritize the arguments.

      Examiners should be aware that candidates may take a different approach
      which if appropriate, should be rewarded.

      If there is no direct reference to the text/data, then candidates may not be
      rewarded beyond level 2.
