 0:      Answers not meeting the requirements of descriptors should be awarded no marks.
 1–2:    Answers do not meet the demands of the question and show little or no evidence of
         appropriate structure. There is little more than unsupported generalization.
 3–4:    There is little understanding of the question. Historical knowledge is present but the
         detail is insufficient. Historical context or processes are barely understood and there
         are little more than poorly substantiated assertions.
 5–6:   Answers indicate some understanding of the question but historical knowledge is
        limited in quality and quantity. Understanding of historical processes may be present
        but underdeveloped. The question is only partially addressed.
 7–8:   The demands of the question are generally understood. Relevant historical knowledge
        is present but is unevenly applied. Knowledge is narrative or descriptive in nature.
        There may be limited argument that requires further substantiation. Critical
        commentary may be present. An attempt to place events in historical context and show
        an understanding of historical processes has been made. An attempt at a structured
        approach, either chronological or thematic has been made.
 9–11: Answers indicate that the question is understood but not all implications considered.
        Knowledge is largely accurate. Critical commentary may be present. Events are
        generally placed in context, and historical processes, such as comparison and contrast,
        are understood. There is a clear attempt at a structured approach. Focus on AO1, AO2
        and AO4. Responses that simply summarize the views of historians cannot reach the
        top of this markband.
 12–14: Answers are clearly focused on the demands of the question. Relevant, in-depth
        knowledge is applied as evidence, and analysis or critical commentary are used to
        indicate some in-depth understanding, but it is not consistent throughout. Events are
        placed in context and there is sound understanding of historical processes and
        comparison and contrast. Evaluation of different approaches may be used to
        substantiate arguments presented. Synthesis is present but not always consistently
        integrated. Focus on AO3 and AO4.
 15–17: Answers are clearly structured and focused, have full awareness of the demands of the
        question, and if appropriate may challenge it. Accurate and detailed historical
        knowledge is used convincingly to support critical commentary. Historical processes
        such as comparison and contrast, placing events in context and evaluating different
        interpretations are used appropriately and effectively. Answers are well-structured and
        balanced and synthesis is well-developed and supported with knowledge and critical
        commentary.
 18–20: Answers are clearly focused with a high degree of the awareness of the question and
        may challenge it successfully. Knowledge is extensive, accurately applied and there
        may be a high level of conceptual ability. Evaluation of different approaches may be
        present as may be understanding of historical processes as well as comparison and
        contrast where relevant. Evaluation is integrated into the answer. The answer is
        well-structured and well-focused. Synthesis is highly developed.

1.   Analyse the reasons for, and the results of, the Investiture crisis (1075–1122).

      The reasons for the Investiture crisis may include, but not be limited to:
        origins in the eleventh century movement for church reform designed to eliminate abuses such
        as simony, clerical marriage and concubinage;
        reformers wished to challenge laymen having control over the appointment of Church officials,
        bishops, etc.;
        a desire to elect the pope without the interference of powerful secular rulers;
        denunciation of the practice in the Holy Roman Empire whereby bishops were invested with
        their symbols of office by the emperor and swore allegiance to him;
        the influence of individuals such as Hildebrand – a determined reformer – later elected pope as
        Gregory VII;
        the determination of the Holy Roman Emperor to appoint all the bishops in order to maintain
        control of church property, revenue and their political support caused conflict;
        the crisis occurred when Gregory VII excommunicated Henry IV over the issue of appointing
        bishops.

     The results of the Investiture crisis may include, but not be limited to:
         civil war in Germany as the nobles revolted against Henry IV after his excommunication;
         established the pope’s ability to interfere in secular government by undermining the power of
         rulers through excommunication and interdict;
         Italy and Germany were subject to continuous conflict – rival popes were created by the
         competing factions;
         the Concordat of Worms (1122) resolved the matter through a compromise on the investiture of
         bishops;
         the reform movement in the Church was encouraged by the crisis – churchmen sought greater
         independence from, and power over, rulers;
         the papacy took a larger role in political affairs.

      This will be a popular question and requires that candidates analyse both reasons for and results
      of. If only one element is addressed, mark out of a maximum of [12 marks].

2.   For what reasons, and with what results, did monastic reform occur after AD900?

     Candidates must explain clearly both the causes and results of monastic reform.        The period
     discussed may extend to the twelfth and thirteenth centuries.

     The causes of monastic reform may include, but not be limited to:
         a reaction to the corruption, moral laxity and breaking of monastic rules that were widespread
         in monasteries by 900;
         monastic rules such as the Benedictine were widely ignored;
         a desire to restore the spirit of asceticism and devotion led to the foundation of the Abbey at
         Cluny in 910 by William the Pious;
         the influence of the abbots of Cluny: Odo and Odile, inspired the reform of many monasteries;
         reform was supported by powerful secular forces such as the Holy Roman emperors;
         a growing impulse to embrace the ascetic life occurred out of a desire for order, salvation and
         moral improvement and an escape from the anarchy and violence of the medieval world;
         the general movement for church reform in this period influenced the monastic orders as well.

     The results of monastic reform could include, but not be limited to:
         founding of new monastic orders such as the Carthusians and Cistercians which practised
         rigorous discipline and moral standards;
         new orders attracted thousands of recruits and set new standards for devotion, morality and
         discipline;
         the Cistercian emphasis on manual labour contributed significantly to the improvement of
         agricultural techniques;
         military orders based on monastic rules such as the Templars and Hospitallers emerged to
         defend pilgrims and the Holy Land;
         monasteries made significant contributions to scholarship, art and culture;
         monastic leaders such as Bernard of Clairvaux became important advisers to the papacy and
         secular rulers – their role in monastic reform gave them enormous moral influence and stature;
         candidates might also point out that the success of monastic reform attracted many people to
         join monasteries who were not truly devoted. In addition, the success of monastic reform made
         the monasteries wealthy as many people gave donations to ensure their salvation. These two
         factors led to the same corruption and laxity that had incited the original reformers in 900.
         The result of monastic reform was ultimately the need for more reform.

     Candidates must address both reasons for, and results of, monastic reform after AD900. If only one
     of the two elements is discussed, mark out of a maximum of [12 marks].

3.   “The Fatimid Empire did not have a significant influence on the Islamic world.” To what
     extent do you agree with this statement?

     This is a broad question which allows candidates to focus on a range of areas in which the Ftaimid
     Empire may have had an influence on the Islamic world.
     The areas in which the Fatimids may have exerted influence include, but are not limited to:
         scholarship/academics: they funded the first Islamic university which continued as a major
         intellectual centre. They advanced Islamic scholarship in science, and particulary astronomy;
         government/administration: Fatimids introduced a merit based system of government
         appointments;
         religion: they practiced tolerance of other faith and sects and did not make extensive efforts to
         convert others to their faith;
         art/architecture: introduced new styles especially in ceramics, new architectural styles
         introduced (al Hakim Mosque).


4.   Why did the Fatimid Empire collapse?

     The collapse of the Fatimid Empire can be seen as a combination of Fatimid errors/weakness and
     the activities of external forces and events.

     The reasons for the collapse of the Fatimid Empire may include, but not be limited to:
         the Fatimids were a conquering regime that controlled large areas of North Africa and the
         Middle East in the tenth to twelfth centuries;
         their power rested on the efficiency of their military and government;
         their collapse began when internal division developed in the army and bureaucracy between
         Berber, Turkish and North African factions;
         internal strife caused the loss of Syria;
         attacks by the Seljuk Turks caused further loss of territory and prestige;
         Caliphs lost power to viziers and generals, which further weakened the regime;
         the Crusades captured Fatimid territory and caused a loss of prestige;
         they were divided by religious schisms: Druze and Assassins;
         they failed to convert the population of their Empire to the Ismaili sect;
         overthrown by Salah al-Din (Saladin) as part of the revival of Sunni Islam against the
         crusading states.

5.   Analyse the methods by which William I established his authority in England.

     This will be a popular question. Candidates must produce a well-structured response demonstrating
     the range of methods and techniques by which William I was able to establish his authority.

     Methods may include, but not be limited to:
        many Anglo-Saxon leaders were eliminated at Hastings;
        Anglo-Saxons were conciliated by the maintenance of their traditional laws;
        William asserted that all the land in the country belonged to him;
        he gave land to those who supported him;
        only Normans were given land and high positions in government;
        built royal fortresses throughout the country to monitor the population and the nobles;
        the rebellion in 1069 was crushed and many leaders executed;
        William established royal control throughout the kingdom by means of the sheriffs;
        the Domesday Book gave him accurate information on the population of England;
        the Church was an agency of the King as he appointed all the bishops/abbots;
        established an effective central administration of justice, taxation and bureaucracy.


6.   For what reasons, and with what results, did Philip II of France engage in a struggle with the
     Angevin dynasty?

     The reasons for Philip’s struggle with the Angevins may include, but not be limited to:
         a general desire to increase the power of the Capetian dynasty in France, which continued a
         process begun by his predecessor;
         fear and resentment at the extensive territory and power of the Angevins in France;
         an obsession with asserting his authority;
         greater confidence in his power due to the improvements in royal administration and improved
         royal revenues;
         personal dislike of Richard I when King of England;
         a belief that the Angevins would be vulnerable due to their internal family quarrels;
         King John’s unpopularity in his French territories and in England made him vulnerable as did
         his poor military skills.

     The results of the struggle may include, but not be limited to:
         he demanded that King John pay him homage and when he failed to do so, seized his lands in
         Normandy, Anjou and Maine;
         defeated King John and his allies in 1214 and seized all his territories except Aquitaine;
         France now dominated the relationship with England for the first time;
         France became a major European power as a result of the expansion of its territories;
         Philip greatly increased the power of the French monarchy both in France and in Europe.

     Candidates must address both reasons for, and results of, Philip’s struggle with the Angevin
     dynasty. If only one element is discussed, mark out of a maximum of [12 marks].
                                                  –8–                M11/3/HISTI/HP3/ENG/TZ0/XX/M

7.   “The principal cause of the collapse of the Crusader States was the strength of the Islamic
     opposition.” To what extent do you agree with this statement?

     This will be a popular question. Candidates must produce an analytical response that addresses the
     reasons for the collapse of the Crusader States. As part of their analysis candidates must address, in
     some form, the issue of increasing Islamic strength.

     The points that may be made to explain the collapse may include, but not be limited to:
         rise of effective Muslim military leaders – Nur al-Din, Salah al-Din (Saladin);
         increased political unity in the Islamic world;
         improvements in Islamic military tactics;
         increases in Islamic religious feeling against non-Muslims;
         greater confidence of the Islamic forces based on a series of successes.

     Reponses may also demonstrate that European problems and weaknesses led to their collapse.
     These may include, but not be limited to:
         divisions within the leadership of the Crusader States;
         lack of military and financial resources;
         lack of support from European states;
         conflict with the other Christian allies, e.g. Byzantine Empire;
         failure of the Third Crusade due to disputes amongst the leaders;
         diversion of crusading resources to Spain and campaigns against heretics in Europe;
         decline of the military orders: Templar, Hospitallers.
                                                 –9–                M11/3/HISTI/HP3/ENG/TZ0/XX/M

8.   Why was the First Crusade a success?

     Candidates must analyse the reasons for the success of the First Crusade and not merely recount the
     events in a narrative style.

     The reasons for the success of the First Crusade may include, but not be limited to:
         the high morale and enthusiasm of the Crusaders based on both religious and material motives;
         the high quality of the leadership;
         the military skill of the European knights;
         the assistance of the Byzantine Empire;
         the weaknesses and divisions of the Islamic world, which limited resistance to the Crusaders.


9.   Explain the reasons for the successful Mongol invasions of the Islamic world.

     The Mongol invasions of the Islamic world were extremely successful. They conquered enormous
     territories and overthrew the Abbasid caliphate.

     The reasons for their success may include, but not be limited to:
         serious weaknesses within, and lack of unity of, the Islamic world;
         the Abbasid caliphate was very weak;
         the Islamic world was divided by war and many rival groups, e.g. Seljuks;
         the Crusades had created internal divisions;
         the tactics and power of the Mongol army were extraordinary;
         their tactics of terror and psychological warfare paralyzed opponents and prevented resistance;
         many subjects of Islamic rulers were not very loyal to their rulers;
         Mongol rule was more attractive than the rule of a number of Islamic rulers.
                                                 – 10 –            M11/3/HISTI/HP3/ENG/TZ0/XX/M

10.   “The Mongols had little permanent impact on the Islamic world.” To what extent do you
      agree with this statement?

      This question requires that the candidates be aware of the areas of the Islamic world in which the
      Mongol invasions might have had an influence. These might include politics and government,
      religion, economics, culture, scholarship and the expansion of the Islamic world. The divisions in
      the Islamic world caused by the Mongol invasions may also be noted.

      Candidates should then comment on the extent to which they feel that the Mongols had a significant
      or permanent impact on the Islamic world in the areas that they have identified.

      Some points to consider may include, but not be limited to:
         Mongols introduced no new religion but were converted to Islam;
         Mongols expanded the Islamic world;
         Mongols destroyed the caliphate at Baghdad and replaced it with a different style of
         government – decentralized power amongst tribal chiefs and military leaders;
         Mongols supported Islamic scholarship and expanded it in a number of areas such as the
         writing of history;
         Mongols continued to use the ulama as important local officials in towns and villages;
         Mongols rebuilt cities, industries and trade and expanded them to trade with China;
         added Chinese influences to Islamic art;
         forced the migration of Turkish populations into Iran and the Middle East;
         inspired the development of the Mamluk dynasty in opposition to the Mongols;
         their influences may be seen as military and economic and did not dramatically change Islam in
         the long term.
                                                  – 11 –              M11/3/HISTI/HP3/ENG/TZ0/XX/M

11.   Why did the Reconquista succeed?

      The Reconquista was a military campaign of the Christian kingdoms against the Islamic rulers of
      Spain that took place over several centuries.

      The success of the Christian Reconquista should be seen as a combination of increasing Christian
      power and confidence and an increasingly divided and weakened Islamic state.

      Candidates should refer to both the increasing Christian strength and the internal weaknesses of the
      Islamic state.

      These could include, but not be limited to:
          the role of the kingdoms of Aragon and Castile and their constant war against Islam;
          the significance of the conquest of Toledo in 1085 as a boost to European morale and a loss to
          Islam;
          the knowledge gained by the Christians from the Islamic world made them stronger;
          the great influx of support for the Reconquista in the twelfth and thirteenth centuries as part of
          the crusading movement led to a tremendous increase in Christian military power and resulted
          in the important victory at Las Navas de Tolosa;
          Islamic internal divisions played a major role in the success of the Reconquista – the period of
          “the Party kings” was a period of serious weakness;
          Islamic Spain divided into factions;
          the failure of the powerful Almoravid and Almohad dynasties to maintain a powerful presence
          in Spain in the twelfth and thirteenth centuries;
          the success of the Reconquista can be based on the inability of Islamic Spain to retain a unified
          government in the face of growing opposition over a long period of time.
                                                  – 12 –             M11/3/HISTI/HP3/ENG/TZ0/XX/M

12.   Assess the significance for Islamic rule in Spain of two of the following: „Abd al-Rahman I;
      “the Party kings”; al-Mut‟amid; the Almohads.

      Candidates should be able to assess the ways in which these individuals affected the status, strength
      and development of Islamic rule in Spain in either a positive or negative fashion.

      „Abd al-Rahman I
         Established Cordoba as the capital of al-Andalus and made it a cultural and intellectual centre;
         Made himself the emir and ruled for 30 years;
         Ended internal strife and unified the Islamic domain by eliminating rival factions;
         Defended al-Andalus from all external and internal threats;
         Began the process of making Cordoba and Spain a sophisticated society where religious
         toleration, scholarship and business flourished;
         Enormous expansion of agriculture, irrigation works and building made al-Andalus a very
         wealthy civilization, far more sophisticated than Europe;
         He established the structure of the society, economy, etc. for the next three centuries;
         The creator of a secure, prosperous, peaceful and sophisticated state.

      “The Party kings”
         They were known as ta’ifas or rulers of factions;
         They emerged after the fall of the Spanish Umayyad caliphate in 1031;
         They were three dozen small states;
         Constant competition with each other in everything from art to warfare;
         Bitter rivalries with each other, which allowed the Christian kingdoms to grow in strength;
         Many paid protection money to the Christian kingdoms which strengthened them;
         Ta’ifas had to raise taxes to pay protection money, which reduced their popularity with their
         citizens;
         The disputes between these states led to the fall of Toledo, a major victory for the Christians;
         The Christian victory led to the invasion of the Almoravids to restore Islamic power;
         They stopped the Christian advance and removed the ta’ifa rulers.
                                           – 13 –              M11/3/HISTI/HP3/ENG/TZ0/XX/M

al-Mut‟amid
    The King of Seville, who invited the Almoravids to come to Spain to repel the Christian
    advance;
    This resulted in the stopping of the Christian advance;
    Al-Mut’amid disliked the Almoravids and tried to save his kingdom by allying with Alfonso of
    Castile;
    This failed and the Almoravids continued their conquests;
    Al-Mut’amid was dispossessed of his kingdom along with other ta’ifa kings;
    Forced to live in poverty in Morocco;
    His demise was a symbol of the end of the cooperative culture in Spain where Christians and
    Muslims had often worked together.

The Almohads
   The Almohads were a North African Berber federation who advocated a different version of
   Islam;
   Their goal was to replace the Almoravids and expand Muslim control in Spain;
   Defeated the Castilians in 1195 and threatened to recover all territory lost to Christians in the
   previous century;
   The Almohads failed to exploit their victory due to ongoing conflict with the Almoravids;
   This allowed the Christians to regroup and recover and receive aid from Europe;
   Almohads divided their forces and withdrew many forces to Africa;
   This allowed the Christians to win the crucial battle at Las Navas de Tolosa, which
   permanently limited Islamic power in Spain and allowed the Christians to recapture many
   cities.

If only one ruler or group is discussed, mark out of a maximum of [12 marks].

13.   For what reasons did parliament emerge in England in the thirteenth century?

      The reasons for the emergence of parliament are found throughout the thirteenth century.

      The reasons may include, but not be limited to:
          an ongoing desire of the nobles to limit the power of the king;
          this resulted in Magna Carta, which imposed a limit on the king’s power insofar as he was
          deemed not to be above the law;
          Henry III accepted the principles of Magna Carta and reinforced the idea that the king’s power
          might be limited;
          parliament emerged most directly from the king’s need for money to fight wars;
          throughout the period, the king’s need for funds provided a vehicle for his subjects to demand
          concessions;
          he asked the barons for financial support – they asked for concession, the process of speaking
          “parler” is the origin of parliament;
          in 1258, barons demanded more concessions in exchange for support: these concessions
          included a commitment to periodic meetings which would include representatives from the
          shires and boroughs; the Provisions of Oxford;
          role of Simon de Montfort as the leader of the group demanding concessions from the king;
          civil war occurred between the king and the barons led by de Montfort;
          de Montfort initiated the calling of representatives from the shires and boroughs which
          admitted the middle class to government;
          the defeat of de Montfort ended the war but the majority of the Provisions of Oxford were
          accepted by the king;
          Edward I continued the practice of summoning the representatives and in 1297 he promised
          concessions in return for support;
          he established the principle that monarchs would not try to raise extra revenue without the
          assent of the “commonality of the realm”.

14.   Assess the extent to which the Holy Roman Emperor Frederick I was successful in fulfilling
      his aims in political, military and religious matters.

      Candidates should state clearly the aims of Frederick I (Barbarossa) when he assumed the title of
      Holy Roman Emperor.

      Candidates must analyse through an examination of his achievements how successful he was in
      achieving his aims.

      The aims of Frederick as Holy Roman Emperor may include, but not be limited to:
          desire to restore a powerful, central authority in Germany, putting an end to anarchy and
          private wars and limiting the independence of the nobles;
          desire to revive the Holy Roman Empire and its domination of Italy;
          he also desired to control the Church in Germany with respect to the appointment of bishops
          and other key officials.

      Candidates should address the extent to which Frederick was successful in reducing the power of
      the nobles, creating and maintaining an effective central administration and putting an end to the
      numerous internal wars and disputes that had plagued Germany.

      The results of his lengthy wars in Italy against the Lombard league could be examined, as well as
      his relationship with the papacy. To what extent was he able to impose his will on the Italian
      states?

      His ability to maintain and extend his control of the German Church should also be examined.

      In addition, other topics may be included such as his campaigns against pagan groups in the East.

15.   “England‟s defeat in the Hundred Years War after 1422 was the result of her own errors and
      weaknesses.” To what extent do you agree with this statement?

      This question asks candidates to produce an analysis of the reasons for the defeat of England in the
      Hundred Years War.

      Responses must address the issue of English errors or weaknesses as well as other reasons that can
      be put forward, such as increased French strength or other historical circumstances.

      Reasons for English defeat may include, but not be limited to:
         the early death of Henry V removed a successful war leader and left a power vacuum in France
         and England;
         the Duke of Bedford, English commander in France, died in 1435 – no replacement of quality;
         the English occupation of Normandy was unpopular with the population – impoverished by
         taxes;
         English territories revolted against their rulers;
         the war was unpopular in England, which led to declining support;
         Henry VI was a weak leader;
         English success had depended on an alliance with French lords e.g. Burgundy;
         the Burgundians deserted the alliance in the 1430s;
         the execution of Joan of Arc created a martyr for the French;
         English success had depended on French weakness and division. This began to change under
         Charles VII;
         the siege of Orleans (1429) gave the French confidence and prestige;
         Joan of Arc revived French monarchy and military spirit;
         the French instituted military reforms – professional standing army;
         Charles VII was a popular monarch and used the superior French resources to build an army.

16.   For what reasons, and with what results, did the Wars of the Roses occur?

      The causes of the Wars of the Roses may be seen as both long-term and short-term in nature.

      They may include, but not be limited to:
         disputes over the royal succession beginning in the late fourteenth century (Richard II);
         the seizure of the throne by the Lancastrian Henry IV;
         Henry VI’s weakness as a ruler and lack of an heir brought the succession into doubt, led to the
         Yorkist claim;
         many local magnates, interest groups chose sides in the dynastic struggle to further their own
         interests;
         a weak monarchy would be in the interest of certain powerful groups;
         other groups wanted to replace Henry VI with a strong monarch to ensure peace and order and
         support modernization and commercial development;
         the seizure of the throne by Edward IV provoked open conflict;
         the loss of the war in France created disillusionment with the Lancastrian leadership and
         encouraged revolt.

      The results of the Wars of the Roses may include, but not be limited to:
          the Plantagenet line was removed and a new dynasty, the Tudors, emerged;
          deaths of nobles during the war weakened their political power and influence as a class;
          new dynasty disarmed the barons and removed their right to raise their own armies;
          the wealthy middle class emerged as new power holders;
          the new monarchy was stronger and more centralized, supported by the wealthy bourgeoisie
          who wished to limit the power of the barons and establish an orderly society;
          the physical destruction during the war was quite limited compared to similar events in other
          countries;
          all English influence in France was lost except for Calais;
          England emerged as an early modern state, rather than a feudal state.

      Candidates must address both causes and results of the Wars of the Roses. If only one element is
      discussed, mark out of a maximum of [12 marks].

17.   “The Black Death was the most important cause of popular insurrections in fourteenth
      century Europe.” To what extent do you agree with this statement?

      This question requires that candidates appreciate the turmoil caused by the Black Death and its role
      in the numerous popular insurrections of the fourteenth century. They should also understand that
      other changes and events were taking place in the fourteenth century which may have contributed to
      these disturbances.

      Candidates will have to reach a decision on the extent to which the results of the Black Death were
      the most crucial.

      Europe in the fourteenth century was affected by a number of factors which contributed to popular
      unrest. These could include, but not be limited to:
          climate change and resulting famine post-1315;
          inflation and increased taxes put a burden on peasants;
          warfare in France impoverished many peasants;
          new agricultural methods such as the enclosure movement and commercial agriculture resulted
          in loss of land by many with resulting unemployment and misery;
          growing social divisions between landowners and peasants;
          the growth of towns encouraged peasants to desert their obligations and seek freedom and
          opportunity elsewhere;
          common people had no outlet to express grievances except through revolts, which occurred in
          France and Flanders from the 1320s onwards.

  The Black Death increased the problems of peasants which, apart from widespread death, included:
  food and labour were in short supply; inflation increased, particularly in food prices; workers in
  villages and towns demanded higher wages; these demands were resisted by governments – Statute of
  Labourers; social institutions such as the Church were discredited; gaps between workers’ demands
  and the owners’ willingness to pay; workers knew they were more valuable due to labour shortage.

18.   Assess the significance of the Black Death for the medieval Church.

      Candidates should determine how seriously the Black Death affected the medieval Church. Short
      and long-term effects may be considered.

      These could include, but not be limited to:
          widespread death in religious communities of monks and nuns reduced their numbers;
          many priests, especially the most dedicated, died trying to aid their parishioners;
          widespread recruitment of new clergy with many unqualified or interested only in financial
          reward;
          new clergy prone to corruption which diminished the Church’s reputation and led to calls for
          reform;
          reform/heretical movements such as the Lollards emerged in the post-plague era;
          decline of scholarship and use of Latin declined, many teachers died;
          Church lost credibility in the eyes of the population as it failed to protect population against the
          punishment from God;
          witchcraft, devil-worship and hedonism became more common as the population rejected
          Church teachings or lost faith;
          Church suffered from the general discontent in society which resulted in a number of popular
          insurrections against the traditional social and political order;
          this decline led to greater demands for church reform, leading to more challenges to the Church
          in the next two centuries.

19.   “The Ottoman conquest of Egypt and Syria did not cause significant changes in those
      societies.” To what extent do you agree with this statement?

      Candidates must produce an analysis of the extent to which the Ottoman conquest introduced
      significant changes in Egypt and Syria.

      Areas to consider may include, but not be limited to:
          Ottoman government was of a limited nature designed to maintain peace and collect taxes;
          local notables and officials in Egypt and Syria remained in place and continued to exert
          considerable influence in the military, towns, guilds and the economy;
          religious establishments remained under local control – the ulama were local officials as were
          the principal religious leaders;
          Ottomans were not able to control the rural tribes of Bedouin;
          religious changes were introduced by Ottomans, who encouraged celebrations of Sufi saints
          and festivals – this was more influential in Egypt than in Syria;
          Ottoman policy was to exercise military and financial control rather than implement social
          change;
          would not intervene as long as their imperial and financial aims were met.

      Candidates who wish to show that the Ottoman conquest did make significant changes may do so if
      they have adequate evidence to support their position.


20.   Account for the success of the Ottomans as military conquerors.

      The success of the Ottomans may be understood by an examination of their strengths and the
      weaknesses of their opponents particularly the Byzantine Empire, as well as the states of the
      Balkans and Middle East.

      The reasons for Ottoman success may include, but not be limited to:
          the weakness of the Byzantine Empire after invasions by the West and Tamerlane (Timur);
          Tamerlane aided the Ottomans by undermining the Byzantines but not seriously weakening the
          Ottomans who filled the vacuum created by Tamerlane;
          the military organization of the Ottomans – large well-trained armies that adopted the latest
          technologies and techniques;
          the revenues and population gained from their conquests in the Balkans added significantly to
          their military and strategic position;
          their rule in the Balkans attracted support for them as it was less onerous financially than
          previous governments;
          Ottomans had a number of accomplished military leaders confident in their abilities,
          e.g. Mehmet II;
          the inability of the West to create a unified defence against them;
          Constantinople was weakly defended and received little help from the West;
          the conquest of Constantinople was an enormous blow to the confidence of opponents and a
          large boost to the Ottomans in physical terms as well as prestige;
          the Middle East succumbed very quickly to Ottoman power which replaced the disunited
          regimes there.

21.   Why did the Renaissance originate in Italy?

      This question requires that candidates not only discuss the reasons for the Renaissance but that they
      do it with specific reference to why Italy was the point of origin.

      The reasons for the origins of the Renaissance in Italy may include, but not be limited to:
          political structure of Italy: urban, republican states in competition created a dynamic
          environment in all areas of human activity;
          progressive social and commercial classes looking for new ideas, products and knowledge;
          dynamic nature of urban ideas producing new ideas and approaches;
          the wealth of the Italian city states supporting arts, architecture, new ideas in literature, etc.;
          the expansion of the traditions of humanism of the twelfth century renaissance to include
          rationalism and scepticism. This created a new view of man as a competent, logical individual
          capable of controlling and understanding the world;
          changing the view of man in relation to traditional religious teaching;
          the Church had become wealthy and worldly;
          the classical connection in Italy to the ideas of Rome provided a link to the humanism of the
          past;
          the scholarly work of the Italian universities in science and medicine thus creating a new idea
          about man and his capabilities;
          the influx of ideas, individuals from the Byzantine Empire;
          contact with the Islamic world and the academic and philosophical information gained from it;
          the sophistication of the Italian cities due to their great wealth from trade, banking and as a
          crossroads between East and West;
          overall a more secular approach to life, more confident, rational, scientific view of the world;
          celebration of the abilities of man which was supported by the enormous wealth of the Italian
          states.

22.   Assess the significance for Renaissance society or government of two of the following:
      Machiavelli; Lorenzo de Medici; Julius II; the Sforza family.

      Candidates must select two of the above and explain the nature and importance of their
      contributions to the Renaissance period.

      These contributions may involve intellectual, artistic, political, philosophical or commercial
      developments. The patronage and support of artists is crucial in some cases as is the development
      of government, the pursuit of knowledge and development of ideas of civic responsibility.

      Some contributions may be seen as showing less attractive aspects of the period: corruption,
      warfare, violence, excessive indulgence and cynicism.

      Responses must be well-structured and contain relevant content.

      If only one individual/family is addressed, mark out of a maximum of [12 marks].


23.   Assess the role of religion as a cause of the European exploration movements.

      There are numerous reasons for the European exploration movements. Candidates must assess the
      extent to which they feel religion or religious fervour was the most important factor.

      The reasons for European exploration may include, but not be limited to:
          religious motives: desire to convert people in new lands; continue the Crusades against Islam;
          contact Christian kingdoms in Africa that some people believed to exist;
          commercial reasons: searching for gold, spices and other luxury products from the East;
          the Ottoman conquest of Byzantium threatened to close trade routes to the East – new ones had
          to be opened;
          improvements in ship design, navigational instruments and maps made exploration more
          possible;
          patronage of influential leaders such as Henry the Navigator inspired the movement;
          ambitious individuals such as Columbus and Cabot set out to seek personal fortunes and
          influence;
          European countries saw exploration as a way to increase their wealth and strategic power
          versus rivals;
          stories of the East by individuals such as Marco Polo inspired others to seek these territories.

24.   Analyse the impact on the Islamic world of the new European exploration movements.

      The impact of the new European exploration movements may include, but not be limited to:
          Islam lost its monopoly on the trade in oriental products; the commercial balance of power was
          shifting to the Europeans as they brought in supplies by ship;
          Europeans were carrying their attacks on Islam to new areas: Africa and Asia;
          Christian settlements and outposts were established in Asia and Africa – outflanked and limited
          spread of Islam;
          the wealth gained from exploration increased the power of the European states in their struggle
          against Islam in the Mediterranean;
          Europeans were expanding their knowledge of the world and surpassing the Islamic scholars in
          a number of areas.
