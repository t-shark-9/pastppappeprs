Answer one question. Each question is worth [25 marks].

1.    (a)   Explain the distinction between public goods and merit goods and why these
            goods are examples of market failure.                                            [10 marks]

      (b)   “The operation of the free market is always the best way to allocate scarce
            resources.” Evaluate this statement.                                             [15 marks]


2.    (a)   Using appropriate diagrams, explain how an increase in government spending
            could affect both aggregate demand and aggregate supply in an economy.           [10 marks]

      (b)   “The lower the level of government spending, the better.” Evaluate this view.    [15 marks]


3.    (a)   Explain the main reasons why international trade takes place.                    [10 marks]

      (b)   Evaluate the consequences of a deterioration of the terms of trade for a
            country’s balance of payments on current account and for its domestic economy.   [15 marks]


4.    (a)   Explain the main features of export-led growth strategies used to achieve
            economic development.                                                            [10 marks]

      (b)   Evaluate the view that economic development in less-developed countries
            (LDCs) can best be achieved through export-led growth strategies rather than
            import substitution.                                                             [15 marks]
