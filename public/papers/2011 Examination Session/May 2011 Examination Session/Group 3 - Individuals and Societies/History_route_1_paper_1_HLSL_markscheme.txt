                                           SECTION A

Prescribed subject 1         The origins and rise of Islam c500–661

These questions relate to the “Rightly Guided Caliph” Abu Bakr.

1.   (a)   What, according to Source B, were the motives for the apostasy of
           the Bedouin?                                                                    [3 marks]

           •   Many tribes had never formally adopted Islam;
           •   Their contract with Mohammad was of a personal nature and ended with his death;
           •   They had no part in the election of his successor;
           •   Their nomadic instincts caused them to reject the control of Medina;
           •   They were injured by having to pay tribute and submit to systematic worship.

     Award [1 mark] for each relevant point up to a maximum of [3 marks].


     (b)   What is the message conveyed to the Muslim community by
           Abu Bakr in Source E?                                                           [2 marks]

           • He is a humble person who is seeking their advice and support;
           • He announces his principle, “truth is loyalty”;
           • He declares his commitment to defending the weak against the strong and therefore
             justice and equality;
           • There is a strong indication of the traditional tribal concept of shura reflected in the
             limitations of his power.

     Award [1 mark] for each valid point up to [2 marks].

     Do not enter half marks or + and – but compensate between (a) and (b) if necessary for a
     final mark out of [5 marks].
                                             –4–             M11/3/HISTI/BP1/ENG/TZ0/XX/M



2.   Compare and contrast the views expressed in Sources B and C on
     Abu Bakr’s leadership.                                                            [6 marks]

     For “compare”
     • Both sources indicate that he restored unity in Arabia;
     • Both sources mention his victories over the Bedouins / apostates “Musailimi and Banu
       Hanifa” in Source B and “the breakaway tribes” in Source C;
     • Both documents refer to the results of his wars;
     • Both confirm his establishment of Islam in Arabia.

     For “contrast”
     • Source B shows that he appointed military commanders, whereas Source C implies that he
       was the military leader;
     • Source C refers to his power being limited, this is not mentioned in Source B;
     • Source C shows that he expanded Islam by both war and conversion, whereas Source B
       only mentions war;
     • Source C shows that he fought the Byzantines outside Arabia which is not mentioned in
       Source B;
     • Source B refers to personal qualities – “cool and vigorous leader” – whereas Source C does
       not discuss personal qualities.

     Do not expect all of the above and credit other relevant material. If only one source is
     discussed award a maximum of [2 marks]. If the two sources are discussed separately award
     [3 marks] or with excellent linkage [4–5 marks]. For maximum [6 marks] expect a detailed
     running comparison/contrast.

3.   With reference to their origin and purpose, assess the value and
     limitations of Source A and Source D for historians studying the caliphate
     of Abu Bakr.                                                                           [6 marks]

     Source A
     Origin:        An extract from a text by Bernard Lewis, a well-known historian of the
                    Middle East.

     Purpose:       To examine the leadership crisis that emerged after the death of Muhammad
                    and to explain how it was resolved.

     Value:         The author is an acknowledged expert in the field. It is an analysis of events
                    written long after the events had taken place.

     Limitations:   This is a secondary source which may reflect the author’s point of view
                    and therefore runs the risk of being subjective. The extract offers a definite
                    interpretation about the leadership crisis upon Muhammad’s death that some
                    Muslims would find difficult to accept. In addition, the book is not specifically
                    focused on the caliphate of Abu Bakr or the leadership crisis.

     Source D
     Origin:        This is an extract from a text about Muhammad and Islam written by
                    M H Balyuzi.

     Purpose:       The purpose of the extract is to explain the reasons why ‘Ali did not succeed
                    Muhammad as the leader of Islam.

     Value:         It is an academic text which presents an analysis of the reasons for the
                    exclusion of ‘Ali from the leadership of Islam.

     Limitations:   It is a secondary text which may reflect the personal view of the author who is
                    an Iranian and most likely a Shi’ite. The extract offers a different interpretation
                    that is sympathetic to ‘Ali’s rights to the Caliphate.

     Do not expect all the above. Ideally there will be a balance between the two sources, and
     each one can be marked out of [3 marks], but allow a [4/2 marks] split. If only one source is
     assessed, mark out of [4 marks]. For a maximum of [6 marks], candidates must refer to both
     origin and purpose, and value and limitations.

4.   Using the sources and your own knowledge, analyse the statement that
     “The reign of Abu Bakr was a great success.”                                     [8 marks]

     Source material that could be used:
     Source A
     • Abu Bakr is referred to as a resolute man;
     • His leadership began the institution of the Caliphate;
     • He had the support of some of the leading members of the Muslim community at the time
       of crisis.

     Source B
     • He is referred to as a cool and vigorous leader;
     • He crushed the rebels and established the authority of the Caliphate;
     • He overcame the challenge posed by the revolt of the Bedouins.

     Source C
     • He defeated external threats – Byzantines;
     • He re-established the Madinan regime;
     • He ensured the repatriation of the rebellious tribes to the Muslim polity and converted
       additional tribes to Islam;
     • His success strengthened the Caliphate as an institution;
     • He fostered unity among the various groupings in Arabia.

     His weakness or lack of success would include:
     • He failed to end the disruption of trade;
     • His power was limited, not absolute.

     Source D
     • Abu Bakr was chosen as a prominent, well-tested and experienced man to lead
       the Muslims;
     • His rule did not end the controversy over the succession;
     • He overruled the role of the Prophet’s family in the leadership of the Muslim state,
       particularly that of ‘Ali.

     Source E
     • He established clear principles and goals as a ruler;
     • He supported ideas of justice and equality.

     Own knowledge:
     • Abu Bakr’s appointment as Caliph following Mohammad’s death was supported by the
       most respected men in the umma.
     • The choice of Abu Bakr as Caliph presented many advantages: his close relation to the
       Prophet, his belonging to a relatively modest clan, his knowledge of genealogy, his mild
       and generous character, etc.
     • The Ridda Wars initiated by Abu Bakr not only re-established the unity of Arabia under
       one political and religious leadership, but were the impetus for the raids in Iraq, which
       eventually led to the fall of the Persian Empire during the caliphate of ‘Umar.
                                        –7–            M11/3/HISTI/BP1/ENG/TZ0/XX/M


 • The defeat inflicted on the Byzantine forces at Ajnadayn, of which Abu Bakr learned on
   his deathbed, paved the way for the Arab conquests of Syria and Egypt, and marked the
   starting point of the eclipse of the Byzantine rule in their provinces.
 • Abu Bakr ruled for only two years; however his rule was a great success, considering that
   he re-established unity of leadership and religion in Arabia through his energetic
   launching of the Ridda Wars, that he initiated the process of the Arab conquests in the
   neighbouring empires of Persia and Byzantium, and that he gave credence to the newly
   born institution of the caliphate.

Do not expect all the above and credit other relevant material. If only source material or
only own knowledge is used, the maximum mark that can be obtained is [5 marks].
For maximum [8 marks], expect argument, synthesis of source material and own knowledge,
as well as references to the sources used.

                                           SECTION B

Prescribed subject 2        The kingdom of Sicily 1130–1302

These questions relate to the struggle between the Hohenstaufen dynasty and its enemies, for
control of the kingdom of Sicily in the thirteenth century.

1.   (a)   Why, according to Source A, did the Hohenstaufen family lose control
           of the kingdom of Sicily?                                                      [3 marks]

            •   The death of Fredrick in 1250;
            •   Manfred was illegitimate, which weakened his claim to be king;
            •   The Papacy was totally opposed to the Hohenstaufen continuing to rule Sicily;
            •   The Papacy made an agreement with Charles of Anjou to remove Manfred;
            •   Charles of Anjou defeated the Hohenstaufen at the battle of Benevento;
            •   The deaths of Manfred, in 1266, and of Conradin, in 1268, ended the Hohenstaufen
                dynasty.

           Award [1 mark] for each valid point made up to [3 marks].


     (b)   What is the message conveyed by Source E about the succession to the
           kingdom of Sicily?                                                   [2 marks]

            •   That Frederick II died in 1250, leaving several male heirs;
            •   That Conrad, the eldest male heir, died in 1254;
            •   That Manfred was the eldest surviving heir after 1254, but was illegitimate;
            •   That both Manfred and Conradin died violently, in 1266 and 1268 respectively;
            •   There was no heir apparent to succeed Conradin which ended the Hohenstaufen’s
                rule.

           Accept other valid interpretations, with [1 mark] for each valid point up to [2 marks].

           Do not enter half marks or + and – but compensate between (a) and (b) if necessary for
           a final mark out of [5 marks].

2.   Compare and contrast the views expressed in Sources A and B about
     Manfred’s reign as King of Sicily.                                               [6 marks]

     For “compare”
     • Both sources mention that Manfred seized power after Conrad’s death in 1254;
     • Both sources refer to the Papacy’s opposition to the Hohenstaufen as kings of Sicily;
     • Both sources mention that Manfred had some success as king;
     • Both sources mention the Papacy’s alliance with Charles of Anjou to overthrow the
       Hohenstaufen;
     • Both sources mention Charles of Anjou’s execution of Conradin in 1268.

     For “contrast”
     • Source A mentions that Manfred was illegitimate, whereas Source B only mentions that
       Conradin had the right to succeed in 1254;
     • Source B mentions that Manfred had new economic initiatives as king, and was accepted
       by other Mediterranean rulers, whereas Source A only refers to his early successes in
       general terms;
     • Source A refers to Manfred seizing power and ruling for 16 years while Source B indicates
       that before he became king, he took refuge at Muslim Lucera in 1254;
     • Both sources mention Charles’s takeover of Sicily, but only Source A mentions the battle
       of Benevento;
     • Source A mentions that Charles of Anjou had qualities and abilities, whereas Source B
       gives more detail about his popularity in Rome, and among poets and soldiers.

     Do not expect all of the above and credit other relevant material. If only one source is
     discussed, award a maximum of [2 marks]. If the two sources are discussed separately award
     [3 marks] or with excellent linkage [4–5 marks]. For a maximum [6 marks] expect a detailed
     running comparison/contrast.

3.   With reference to their origin and purpose, assess the value and limitations
     of Source C and Source D for historians studying the opposition to
     Frederick II, and his heirs, as kings of Sicily.                                      [6 marks]

     Source C
     Origin:        Pope Innocent IV’s Sentence of Deposition against Frederick II in June 1245.

     Purpose:       To encourage the Italian and Sicilian subjects of Frederick II to overthrow him.

     Value:         It is a contemporary statement by Frederick II’s leading enemy, the Pope,
                    showing the degree of his opposition to the Hohenstaufen. It provides the
                    reader with the rationalization which the church chose in undermining the
                    legitimacy of the rule of Frederick II and therefore the original church view on
                    Frederick’s rule.

     Limitations:   The author of the sentence was Frederick II’s bitterest enemy, who was
                    prepared to go to any lengths to remove him and his family from the throne of
                    Sicily. The claims made in the sentence condemn Frederick II, but cannot be
                    supported without other impartial evidence. Thus evidence used is selective
                    and biased to sustain the condemnation of Frederick II by the Pope.

     Source D
     Origin:        The chronicle of William of Puylaurens, written in the late thirteenth century.

     Purpose:       To record events in the second half of the thirteenth century from a French
                    perspective.

     Value:         This is a contemporary account, written by a Frenchman, in the late thirteenth
                    century. It gives the reader an insight into the French opinion of the
                    Hohenstaufen rule.

     Limitations:   As a contemporary French account, the source is biased in favour of
                    Charles of Anjou, the Papacy and other enemies of the Hohenstaufen. It is
                    strongly opposed to Frederick II and his heirs.

     Do not expect all the above. Ideally there will be a balance between the two sources, and
     each one can be marked out of [3 marks], but allow a [4/2 marks] split. If only one source is
     assessed, mark out of [4 marks]. For a maximum [6 marks], candidates must refer to both
     origin and purpose, and value and limitations.

4.    Using the sources and your own knowledge, analyse the statement in
      Source D that Manfred “… did not have the direct right to succeed” as
      King of Sicily.                                                                    [8 marks]

     Source material that could be used:
     Source A:    This source explains how Manfred was the eldest Hohenstaufen heir after
                  1254, but was illegitimate. Once he became king, Manfred had some
                  successes, but the Papacy was not prepared to accept his claim to be king.

     Source B:     This source mentions that Manfred was elected king by the Sicilian barons,
                   and therefore was legitimate in the eyes of contemporaries. Manfred was also
                   accepted as king by other Mediterranean rulers. However, Conradin had a
                   better hereditary claim, because Manfred was illegitimate.

     Source C:     The Pope’s Sentence of Deposition against Frederick II in 1245 could be seen
                   as applying to his successors, Conrad, Manfred and Conradin.

     Source D:     This source takes the perspective of the Papacy and of Charles of Anjou.
                   It supports the deposition of Frederick II, and therefore regards Manfred’s
                   succession as illegitimate. It praises Charles of Anjou as a defender of the
                   Church and regards him as a legitimate successor to the throne of Sicily.

     Source E:     This source illustrates the succession crisis within the Hohenstaufen dynasty.
                   It shows how, after 1254, Manfred was the eldest male heir of Frederick II,
                   but that he was illegitimate.

     Own knowledge:
     From the 1240s Pope Innocent IV, and his successors, were determined to remove the
     Hohenstaufen as kings of Sicily. For enemies of the Hohenstaufen, the papal Sentence of
     Excommunication of 1240, combined with the later Sentence of Deposition of 1245, meant
     that Frederick II and his heirs were no longer the legitimate kings of Sicily. Frederick II’s
     death as a deposed excommunicate stimulated the interest of the French and English ruling
     houses in the Sicilian succession; Charles of Anjou and Richard of Cornwall were both
     considered as possible replacements for the Hohenstaufen.

     The deaths of Frederick II’s sons Henry (1253) and Conrad (1254) left only two male heirs:
     his illegitimate son Manfred, and his legitimate grandson, Conradin. The Sicilian barons’
     acceptance of Manfred as king suggests that they had faith in his abilities, and belief in the
     need for an adult ruler at this time of crisis, regardless of his illegitimate birth. (They had
     made a similar decision in 1190 when they proclaimed the illegitimate Tancred as king
     instead of Constance.) However, the papacy moved quickly to exploit the issue of Manfred’s
     illegitimacy, and in 1255 Alexander IV declared him to be excommunicated on the pretext of
     his alleged role in the murder of a baron.

     Manfred had several achievements to justify his record as king, including the successful
     establishment of the port of Manfredonia, and a marriage to Helena, the daughter of the
     dictator of Epirus in the Adriatic. Further evidence of acceptance of his rule came in 1262,
     when his daughter Constance was married to Peter, heir to the kingdom of Aragon.

Ultimately, Manfred was destroyed due to the machinations of the French popes, Urban IV
and Clement IV, and the ambitions of Charles of Anjou, brother of Louis IX of France, to
become King of Sicily. Pope Clement and Charles of Anjou also raised massive loans to fund
the invasion of Sicily in 1265–1266.

Do not expect all of the above, and credit other relevant material. If only source material or
only own knowledge is used, the maximum mark that can be obtained is [5 marks]. For a
maximum [8 marks], expect argument, synthesis of source material and own knowledge,
as well as references to the sources used.
