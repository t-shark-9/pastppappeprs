1.       (a)   Using an appropriate diagram, explain how a monopolist might be able to
               make supernormal (abnormal) profits in the short-run, and why these
               profits might continue to be earned in the long-run.                         [10 marks]

               Answers should include:
                 a definition of a monopolist
                 a definition of supernormal (abnormal) profits
                 an explanation of supernormal (abnormal) profit in terms of average
                 revenue (AR) being greater than average cost (AC) or total revenue (TR)
                 being greater than total cost (TC)
                 an explanation of long-run supernormal (abnormal) profit in terms of the
                 existence of barriers to entry
                 a standard monopoly diagram showing profit maximization.

               Answers may include:
                 a distinction between the short-run and long-run in microeconomics
                 an explanation of the various barriers to entry
                 an explanation that a monopolist might make use of price discrimination
                 and the ability to do research and development to prevent the market
                 becoming contestable in the long-run
                 a comparison with perfect competition.

             an explanation of “consumer spending” in the context of aggregate demand
             and some of the factors which may cause it to fall such as:
             – a fall in disposable incomes
             – a change in the distribution of income
             – the wealth effect e.g. of falling property and share values
             – an increase in unemployment or the threat of unemployment
             – less availability of credit
             – an increase in the cost of credit

           Two or three factors explained fully or more factors explained in less detail
           would be sufficient for full marks.

        the impact of greater financial capital inflows and outflows
        the impact of greater mobility of labour
        globalization and the transfer of knowledge and technology
        the impact on allocative, productive and long-run efficiency.

      Effective evaluation may be to:
         consider short-term versus long-term consequences
         examine the impact on different stakeholders
         discuss advantages and disadvantages
         prioritize the arguments.

      Examiners should be aware that candidates may take a different approach
      which if appropriate, should be rewarded.

4.   (a)   Explain the main features of market-led strategies used to achieve
           economic development in less-developed countries (LDCs).                  [10 marks]

           Answers should include:
             a definition of economic development
             a definition of less-developed countries (LDCs)
             an explanation of market-led strategies such as:
             – trade liberalization/low levels of protectionism
             – an emphasis on private enterprise rather than state intervention
             – a floating exchange rate
             – encouragement of FDI
             – privatization
             – use of supply-side policies
             – flexible labour markets.

           Answers may include references to recent/current examples of market-led
           strategies.

(b)   Evaluate the view that economic development in less-developed countries
      (LDCs) can best be achieved through market-led strategies rather than
      interventionist strategies.                                                          [15 marks]

      Answers may include:
        an explanation of interventionist strategies, e.g. in terms of the state playing
        an active role in the management of the economy, economic planning,
        protectionism exchange controls, nationalization
        use of PPC diagrams to illustrate development
        the advantages of market-led strategies, e.g. in terms of more efficient
        resource allocation along the lines of comparative advantage, benefits of
        MNCs, benefits of free trade, flexible labour and capital markets, greater
        consumer choice, a reduction in government budget deficits
        the disadvantages of market-led strategies, e.g. in terms of market failure,
        increased likelihood of structural unemployment, problems of MNCs,
        problems of structural adjustment programmes, greater wealth and income
        inequality, problems of capital outflows, the greater vulnerability of
        countries to international economic crises
        the advantages of interventionist strategies, e.g. in terms of greater diversity
        of economic activity, supply-side improvements as a result of investment in
        health care and education and training, protectionism allowing industry a
        breathing space to grow, a more equal distribution of income and wealth,
        less inequality between rural and urban sectors, higher levels of employment
        the disadvantages of interventionist strategies, e.g. in terms of possible
        growth of the public sector and government spending, inability to benefit
        from the gains from free trade, inefficient resource allocation, growth of
        inefficient monopolies, drawbacks of planning
        after consideration of market-led and interventionist strategies, factors
        favourable to development regardless of strategy may be suggested,
        e.g. absence of corruption.

      N.B. This question, as the markscheme indicates, is particularly broad, so a
      very wide range of answers is possible. Only some of the above points can be
      expected within the time allowed.

      Effective evaluation may be to:
         consider short-term versus long-term consequences
         examine the impact on different stakeholders
         discuss advantages and disadvantages
         prioritize the arguments.
