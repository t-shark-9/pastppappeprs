                                              SECTION A

1.   (a)   (i)    Define the term batch production.                                              [2 marks]

                  In batch production, items are produced in consignments and undergo a
                  stage of the production process together. The whole consignment is then
                  moved on to the next stage of production and another task is performed.


                  Candidates are not expected to word their definition exactly as above.

                  Award [1 mark] for a basic definition that conveys partial knowledge and
                  understanding.

                  Award [2 marks] for a full, clear definition that conveys knowledge and
                  understanding similar to the answer above.

                  For only a relevant: example or application to the stimulus award [1 mark].

           (ii)   Identify two fixed costs for Informatic.                                       [2 marks]

                  For Informatic fixed costs could include:
                  • rent of the premises
                  • insurance of machinery
                  • salary for managers
                  • accept any other relevant fixed cost for Informatic.

                  If a candidate refers to “cost of workers” or “workers’ salaries,” the
                  candidate must make clear that the employees referred to are (a) salaried
                  (not earning wages) and (b) “permanent” (short of some financial or other
                  disaster). In other words, if the candidate says workers’ salaries / cost of
                  workers, the presumption is that these costs are variable (not fixed) unless
                  the candidate fully and clearly explains that they are fixed.

                  Also, distribution costs, unless otherwise appropriately explained, are
                  variable, not fixed.


                  Award [1 mark] for each correct and relevant fixed cost identified up to a
                  maximum of [2 marks].

(b)   For Informatic:

      (i)    calculate the break-even quantity in units (show all your working).           [2 marks]

             Fixed Costs = $100 000

             To calculate contribution we need variable costs per unit.         They are
             equivalent to 80 % of sales price = $800.

             Contribution per unit = sales price – variable cost per unit
                                   = $1000 – $800 = $200

                                       fixed costs      $100 000
                     =
             Break-even point                 = = 500 units
                                  contribution per unit   $200

             If a candidate who has shown working provides a correct procedure
             (thus, demonstrates an understanding of the underlying concepts) but has
             made an error in calculation.

             [2 marks]
             Candidate provides the correct answer with working.

      (ii)   calculate the margin of safety in units (show all your working).              [2 marks]

             Margin of safety = current level of output – break-even level
                              = 4000 – 500 = 3500 units

(iii) calculate the net profit if 4000 computers are sold (show all
      your working).                                                [2 marks]

    Variable costs   4000 computers at $800 per computer         –3 200 000
    Fixed costs                                                    –100 000

    Net profit = $700 000

    Method 2
    Net profit = margin of safety × contribution
               = 3500 units × $200
               = $700 000

     Award marks as follows:

     [1 mark] for each appropriately labelled axis – maximum of [2 marks].

     [1 mark] for an accurately drawn and labelled total revenue curve.

     [1 mark] for an accurately drawn and labelled total costs curve.

     [1 mark] for the identification of the break-even level of output.

     Award [0 marks] if a candidate produces a table, and award no more than
     [3 marks] if the chart is not neat, not drawn with a straight-edge, or is not to scale.

     Ideally, the candidate will draw an arrow pointing to the break-even point and
     label the arrow. However, accept as an “appropriately labelled” break-even point
     a vertical line from the x-axis to the break-even point provided that the line is
     labelled “break-even point”.

(c)   Examine the effectiveness of the new distribution channel for Informatic.              [5 marks]

      Currently Informatic is using local independent distributors to distribute 90 % of
      its annual sales. We must assume that the new channel is intended to reduce
      selling prices (by eliminating distributors’ fees) by selling directly to customers.

      Benefits include but are not limited to:
      • cost savings, with an increase in profit margins per computer sold
      • if variable costs are reduced, contribution will increase, reducing the
        break-even level of computer sales and increasing profits (if the number of
        units sold remains the same)
      • additional profits generated could be used to pay for the training of staff taking
        the telephone orders
      • if selling prices are reduced, additional volumes of computer sales will be
        generated, perhaps further reducing the break-even level of output.

      However:
      • a lack of experience in selling through this channel and also not being able to
        take advantage of the local knowledge of the Pakistani distributors
      • given that orders will be taken by telephone, additional staff training will be
        required to process those orders
      • the new system may not be able to cope with increased orders
      • the new telephone system may not be entirely reliable.

      Accept any other relevant examination.


      If the response is a one-sided generally relevant approach with no examination,
      award a maximum of [3 marks].

      If there is no mention of the cost savings, award a maximum of [3 marks].

      Marks should be allocated according to the markbands on page 3.

2.   (a)   Define the following terms:

           (i)    variable costs                                                                  [2 marks]

                  Variable costs refer to those costs that change according to the
                  quantity/output of the business.


                  Candidates are not expected to word their definition exactly as above.

                  Award [1 mark] for a basic definition that conveys partial knowledge and
                  understanding.

                  Award [2 marks] for a full, clear definition that conveys knowledge and
                  understanding similar to the answer above.

                  For only a relevant: example or application to the stimulus award [1 mark].

           (ii)   retrenchment.                                                                   [2 marks]

                  Retrenchment is the permanent dismissal of an employee or employees in
                  order to reduce the workforce to lower costs or to address declining profits.


                  Candidates are not expected to word their definition exactly as above.

                  “Retrenchment” and “redundancy” are not synonyms. A business can make
                  a position redundant but not let the employee go (the employee must be
                  reassigned). Retrenchment involves the permanent separation of employees
                  from a business in order to reduce the workforce to lower costs or to address

(iii) Comment on your results from part (ii), using information from the
      stimulus material.                                                 [3 marks]

     The ROCE is a performance ratio that measures the company’s efficiency in
     the use of its resources to generate profit. The results for BA show that the
     company has made a loss of 15.21 % on its assets (or on the capital
     employed).

     The NPM is the result of dividing a company’s net profit before taxes and
     interest by its sales revenue. It reflects the company’s ability to manage its
     costs and make profits out of its sales. The NPM shows that for every $
     worth in sales, the company has made on average a 2.42 % of net loss.
     Both ratios are suggesting a negative financial performance for BA.

     There are several factors that could explain BA’s negative financial
     performance. Possible reasons could be found in a falling demand of
     business travellers, who represent BA’s most important market segment,
     increased borrowing costs due to the global financial crisis, and increasing
     aviation fuel costs, which are essential operating costs for an airline
     company.


     Award [1 mark] for a comment on each ratio (ROCE and NPM) that
     demonstrates some understanding of their purpose up to [2 marks]. Award
     an additional [1 mark] if the candidate comments that the performance is
     negative (apply Own Figure Rule (OFR)) or, implying an understanding that
     the performance is negative, and offers possible reasons or explanation.

(c)   Examine the impact of not awarding pay increases and managerial fringe
      payments for BA.                                                       [5 marks]

      The impact could include the following:
      • If workers are not given a pay increase, BA will save on labour costs, which
        represent an important percentage of total operating expenses of the company.
        However, such a measure could result in bitter conflict with workers and
        unions. It could also harm workers’ motivation and rapport with the company,
        which may be already eroded due to the 2500 jobs that the company has
        retrenched.
      • Managerial costs would be reduced as managers will not receive fringe
        payments. However, this could affect managers’ motivation and lead to a
        swing of highly skilled personnel to other companies offering better working
        prospects.
      • Although these two measures may result in important cost reductions they
        could lead to job dissatisfaction and de-motivation among staff and therefore
        negatively affect productivity. The quality of the services provided by the
        airline may in turn suffer. This may also in turn affect passenger satisfaction
        upon flights.

      If the response is a one-sided relevant approach with no examination award a
      maximum of [3 marks]. If only one impact is examined, award a maximum of
      [3 marks].

           A pressure group is an external stakeholder that through direct lobbying or by
           raising awareness of key issues hopes to influence decision-makers.

     (b)   (i)   Calculate the payback period of Cinegames.                                     [2 marks]

                 Cost of Cinegames refurbishment US$280 000.

                 Income from year 1 = US$64 000
                 Income from year 2 = US$88 000

                 Total income = US$152 000

(ii)   Calculate the average rate of return (ARR) of Cinegames in the first
       five years of its operation.                                         [2 marks]

       (all figures in US$000s)

       Total revenue from Cinegames over five years = 64 + 88 + 142 + 124 + 88
                                                    = 506

       Profit from Cinegames = 506 – 280 = 226

                          226
       Average profit =       = 45.2 per year
                           5

       The candidate provides the correct answer. Working not required.

(iii) Comment briefly on your results from parts (i) and (ii).                     [2 marks]

       • The conversion of a movie theatre to a Cinegames experience would be a
         good investment.
       • The payback period for Cinegames is just almost 3 years assuming the
         revenue earned from the experience is even through the 5 years of
         forecasts. The ARR is 16.14 %.

       Accept any other relevant comment.


       For [1 mark] candidates only comment on the suitability of the investment
       and for [2 marks] candidates justify their comment by referring to both
       payback and ARR. Apply Own Figure Rule (OFR).

(c)   Analyse the usefulness of market segmentation to BLC.                         [5 marks]

      The stimulus highlights that market segmentation may be useful to BLC as it
      would allow them to target their marketing effort.

      From the stimulus, market segmentation allows BLC to:
      • Target the young 18–30 year-old male segment when designing promotional
         activities when the experience is launched. There could also be pricing
         opportunities here.
      • Allow them to cater for families by identifying a product mix which could
         satisfy the individual needs of parents, sons and daughters. Again by
         segmenting the market in this way it allows BLC to use different pricing
         strategies.

      Limitations for market segmentation for BLC could potentially include:
      • Neglect of other market segments (such as seniors or independent cinema
        lovers), allowing competitors to get ahead of BLC or even attracting
        competitors to the new niche.
      • Increased marketing costs if BLC were to target too many markets.

     (d)   Discuss whether BLC should open a second Cinegames experience.                        [7 marks]

           The financial success of the first Cinegames experience was beyond BLC’s
           expectations. It also offered the possibility of an enlarged product mix to satisfy
           the two key market segments (explained in part (c)). For those two reasons, the
           decision to open a second Cinegames experience seems fully justified.

           However, BLC must take into account the concerns of the pressure group and the
           impact of the success of the first experience on the local infrastructure. If a
           second theatre is converted, ensuing social costs may grow, alienating BLC and
           leading to losses in goodwill. Besides the costs of converting a theatre into a
           second Cinegames experience may be difficult to recoup, especially if the
           pressure group begins a campaign and audience numbers begin to fall.

           BLC may have to convince the local community that they are keen to avoid any
           more bad publicity and contribute to schemes such as extended car parking to
           convince the community that they take their social responsibilities seriously.

(b)   Explain two non-financial rewards that Dome Hospital could use to encourage
      Ghanaian nurses to stay in Ghana.                                           [6 marks]

      Non-financial rewards could include:
      • opportunities for promotion leading to responsibility
      • opportunities for job enlargement to gain additional experience in other areas
        of the health industry
      • other possible non-financial rewards could be linked to empowerment and
        teamwork
      • accept any other relevant non-financial reward.

      Accept any other relevant explanation.

      as one reward a generic non-financial reward that does not realistically fit the
      organization (a hospital), award a maximum of [1 mark] for that reward.
      “Flexi-time” is not fully realistic for most nurses at a hospital.

(c)   Analyse the likely benefits for Dome Hospital of Afua’s support.                       [5 marks]

      “Afua will probably offer Dome Hospital advice and guidance on recruitment
      and retention, but not direct funding.”

      Afua could provide:
      • Information and secondary data about successful recruitment schemes in other
         countries.
      • Guidance about potential sources of additional finance from other NGOs.
      • Improved media awareness of the problems of increased international labour
         mobility affecting Ghanaian hospitals.

      Limitations:
      • There is no evidence of financial resources in order to help finance the
        recruitment strategy.
      • It may not be realistic to expect international law to be changed by one
        NGO alone.
      • A more concerted effort with other NGOs will help, but Dome Hospital’s need
        is immediate. Clearly patient care could suffer if there are any further delays in
        recruitment.

     (d)   Discuss the advantages and disadvantages of Dome Hospital’s recruitment
           strategy.                                                               [7 marks]

           The new recruitment strategy may benefit Dome Hospital by:
           • Attracting the best nurses back to Ghana, encouraged by the job enrichment
             opportunities, leading to motivational and productivity gains for
             Dome Hospital.
           • These nurses may also bring back to Ghana new ideas from their overseas
             experiences.

           However:
           • Costs of flights home and moving expenses will need to be paid even before
             the non-financial rewards and job enrichment schemes are accounted for.
           • Resources will need to be diverted to the recruitment events and web site to
             monitor the cost-effectiveness of the strategy. This will also take time.
           • The recruitment package may not work, given the global labour mobility

5.   (a)   Outline what a marketing audit is.                                                  [2 marks]

           A marketing audit provides a company with the opportunity to evaluate its current
           marketing strategy. This is a valuable tool to help with planning possible
           adjustments to the marketing mix.


           Award [1 mark] for a basic outline that conveys partial knowledge and
           understanding.

           Award [2 marks] for a full, clear answer that conveys knowledge and
           understanding.

(b)   Explain two flexible working practices that would allow an accounting
      business, such as CMP, to offer an increased range of accounting services
      (Option 1).                                                               [6 marks]

      Possible flexible working practices include:
      • Flexitime working – especially important given that CMP’s customers are
        small businesses and may be so busy that CMP is forced to offer its services
        during out of office hours and at weekends. Staffing at CMP will need to be
        flexible enough to accommodate these working patterns.
      • Teleworking. Given the above and the desire for CMP to offer new accounting
        software services such as installation, some of CMP’s staff may need to use
        ICT to a greater extent and perhaps work remotely to provide after sales
        support to potential new clients.
      • Hiring part-time employees with special technical knowledge in software
        installation and support.
      • Accept any other flexible working practice.

      If a candidate names as one flexible working practice a generic flexible working
      practice that does not realistically fit the business, award a maximum of [1 mark]
      for that practice.

      Accept any other relevant explanation.


      Mark as 3+3.

      For each relevant change to CMP’s working practices identified, award [1 mark].
      Award [2 marks] for partial, appropriate explanations, and [3 marks] for
      thorough, appropriate explanations. Award a maximum of [6 marks].

(c)   Analyse the appropriateness of an autocratic leadership style for CMP.                [5 marks]

      CMP is a small accounting business employing three people with Carl firmly in
      control. The advantages of narrow spans of control, increasing productivity and
      consistent service leading to considerable goodwill are documented in the
      stimulus. The Theory X environment has served Carl well.

      However, if CMP wishes to offer more services to its clients, some
      empowerment/delegation to allow greater teamwork/participation will be
      required. This point is particularly relevant if CMP has to change work practices
      and as a result more democratic or more likely paternalistic leadership styles will
      be need to be adopted.

      Accept any other relevant analysis.


      If the response is a one-sided relevant approach with no analysis, award a
      maximum of [3 marks].

      Marks should be allocated according to the markbands on page 3.

(d)   Discuss the two options (Option 1 and Option 2) put forward by Carl to
      replace lost revenue.                                                  [7 marks]

      Carl is considering two options to replace lost revenue at his accounting business:
      Option 1 is to offer accounting software installation and support and build a
      customer base through internal growth generated largely through above the line
      promotion. Option 2 is to merge with AS, a business already engaged in
      accounting software installation and support.

      There are advantages and disadvantages to both options. For Option 1, the benefit
      is that Carl will retain full ownership of his accounting business, which gives him
      full control over decision-making and profits. On the other hand, developing new
      income streams in-house can be complicated. It requires investment of capital to
      acquire the necessary tools and programs to offer the new services as well as time
      to learn them and how to sell them. The promotion strategies necessary to sell the
      new services will be expensive, and there is no guarantee that the promotion
      efforts will be successful.

      Option 2 also has advantages, because AS is already operating in accounting
      software installation and support, it will immediately bring new revenue to CMP.
      Because overheads at the combined business will be lower, the profitability of the
      new revenue stream will have a greater impact than it otherwise might.
      In addition, Matt Auth brings expertise to the business in the area of accounting
      software and support, freeing Carl to continue to focus on CMP’s business,
      traditional accounting services. The opportunities for “cross selling” to CMP’s
      and AS’s customers may offer an opportunity to see the generation of new sales
      quickly (beyond the mere increase in revenue that will come from merging the
      two businesses).

      The major disadvantage of a merger is that both Carl and Matt will lose some
      control of their businesses. From Carl’s point of view, because he will own 55 %
      of the new company, he will be the majority owner and his decisions would
      be final. However, as a practical matter, given that AS’s employees respond well
      to Matt, Carl will have to consider Matt’s views. In addition to issues of
      decision-making, Carl will also have to share profits of the business with Matt,
      according to the dividend payout rate and their respective ownership of the shares.


      Please note that “culture clash” is NOT in the SL syllabus. Candidates may
      address this issue and it be considered a legitimate part of their response for the
      receipt of marks. However, a candidate cannot be penalized for NOT addressing
      culture clash in merging leadership styles.

      Accept any other relevant discussion.

      If the response is a one-sided relevant approach with no discussion, award a
      maximum of [4 marks]. If only one option is discussed, award a maximum of
      [4 marks].

      Marks should be allocated according to the markbands on page 4.
