Answer three questions.

                               Area of impact: Business and employment

1.    Kiva is a company that lends money to small businesses in the developing world. Details of each
      business are displayed on the Kiva web site. New businesses wanting loans can sign up, at no cost,
      and individuals who wish to lend money can register as lenders. Lenders can search the Kiva
      database and choose a new business from countries such as Kenya and Vietnam.

      Lenders transfer money to the Kiva web site in the form of a loan using PayPal or a credit card.
      Lenders may lend as little as US$25 so a loan is usually shared by many lenders. The loan is
      complete when the total of individual lenders’ loans equals the sum required by the business owner.
      Provided the business is successful the business owner gradually repays each loan.

      Regular electronic feedback is provided to the lenders on the status of their loans and the success
      of the business. Lenders can also log in to the web site at any time and check current and past loans.
      Download speeds vary and are often slow in developing countries. Lenders find information about
      the progress of each loan useful and it makes them feel valued. This often encourages further loans.

(Question 1 continued)

      (a)   The information about loans is stored in a relational database such as the one
            illustrated below.

		          (i)    Identify the key field in the RECEIVER_OF_LOAN table.                              [1 mark]

		          (ii)   Identify the data type for            the    field     Phone_Number    in   the
                   RECEIVER_OF_LOAN table.                                                            [1 mark]

      (b)   The database administrator wishes to produce an alphabetical list of lenders from
            France who have contributed at least US$50 after 01/01/2001.

            Describe the query that produces the list specified above.                                [4 marks]

      (c)   The field Business_Description should not be included in the LOANS table
            because this would lead to data redundancy.

            Explain why this could lead to inaccuracies in the database.                              [4 marks]

      (d)   “Kiva provides a data-rich, transparent lending platform. We are constantly
            working to make the system more transparent to show how money flows
            throughout the entire cycle, and what effect it has on the people and institutions
            that lend, borrow and manage it along the way.”

		          Discuss what online services the Kiva web site could provide for effective online
            reporting back to the lenders about the status of the recipient’s business and the
            loan repayments.                                                                         [10 marks]

2.    The exercise watch is a device which detects physiological parameters (e.g. heart rate,
      body temperature), concerned with an individual’s fitness. These parameters are sampled by sensors
      and stored inside the watch in flash memory. Data can be uploaded to a web site in order to produce
      a visual display of the user’s fitness. Once the memory inside the watch is full, data must be deleted.

      Many people who exercise regularly use a device similar to the exercise watch shown below.
      This acts as a stop watch and includes a timer which allows the user to time laps on a running track.

      This exercise watch comes with a chest strap which communicates with the watch so the user can see
      details of heart rate and calories burned. The heart rate can be recorded every five seconds.

(Question 2 continued)

      Suppliers such as Garmin have training web sites and data can be uploaded once the exercise
      is finished. The results can then be displayed as shown in the example below.




                                   [Source: www.garmin.co.uk. Reproduced with permission]



      (a)   Define the term sensor.                                                                 [2 marks]

      (b)   Describe the steps involved in the transmission of the user’s heart rate data to the
            exercise watch and then to the Garmin web site.                                         [4 marks]

      (c)   Some users have seen unusual/unexpected information displayed on the watch.

            Explain two possible causes of inaccuracies in the data.                                [4 marks]

      (d)   Exercise watches have become very popular for athletes and individuals who
            exercise regularly. Evaluate the features of this technology for the user.             [10 marks]

3.    A government bureau of meteorology collects data from weather stations. This data is imported into
      a database and displayed on a web site.

      On the web site (Diagram 1) it is possible for a user to select a particular weather station, e.g. 23090,
      and display data such as temperature, rainfall and other weather conditions, and to choose daily or
      monthly statistics.

(Question 3 continued)

      This data is also used for climatic modelling and is used by companies who need additional analysis
      of the information provided. This data is stored in the form of spreadsheets.

      When station 23090 is selected the screen displays a snapshot of data from Adelaide Hyde Park
      (Diagram 2). Collection began in 1977 and continues to the present day.

      (a)   Identify two methods of updating a database with data from a spreadsheet.               [2 marks]

      (b)   A spreadsheet will be unreliable if data has been entered incorrectly.

            Describe two ways to prevent the input of invalid data.                                 [4 marks]

      (c)   The output from the spreadsheet (Diagram 2) contains valuable data for users of
            the web site. Compare two different ways a user may choose to save copies of
            this data to a personal computer (PC).                                                  [4 marks]

      (d)   Many companies create their own spreadsheets so they can use the data from
            the government bureau of meteorology web site in order to assist in their
            decision-making. Results are often limited due to poor design, maintenance or
            control of these spreadsheets.

            Discuss the policies that a company can implement to overcome such problems.           [10 marks]

4.    A government is donating money to high (secondary) schools in order to improve students’ access
      to computers. The aim is to ensure that high (secondary) schools use the computers in the best
      possible way. Some schools have already introduced mobile devices, such as personal digital
      assistants (PDAs), netbooks and laptops instead of desktop personal computers (PCs).

      Students may buy a laptop through the school which has applications pre-installed and is configured
      to access the school network. The school also allows students to bring in their own private laptops.

      Below is a diagram of part of a school network.

      (a)   Identify two steps that must be taken in order for students to be able to log in to
            the school network shown in the diagram above.                                                  [2 marks]

      (b)   Describe the role of the uninterruptible power supply (UPS) and the role of the
            firewall shown in the diagram above.                                                            [4 marks]

      (c)   Explain why a school may decide to spend their money on training and network
            infrastructure before purchasing more hardware and software.                                    [4 marks]

      (d)   In certain schools, students are able to purchase their own laptops which can be
            brought into school and configured to access the school network. Evaluate the
            school’s decision to allow this to happen.                                                     [10 marks]
