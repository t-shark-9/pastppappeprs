1.    (a)   What, according to Source A, were the problems facing Gorbachev as
            a result of his policies of glasnost (openness) and perestroika
            (restructuring)?                                                                [3 marks]

            • Restructuring weakened the Communist Party, which was Gorbachev’s source of
              strength;
            • People demanded higher standards of confidence and honesty and it did not become
              possible to have openness and centralized control at the same time;
            • Deputies made use of television (glasnost) for their own ends, which were not
              necessarily the same as those of Gorbachev.

     Award [1 mark] for each relevant point up to a maximum of [3 marks].

     (b)    What is the message conveyed by Source E?                                       [2 marks]

            • The policy is new (shown as a baby);
            • The baby is difficult to control for Gorbachev. This is shown by the sticking plaster
              on his face, and the fact that the baby is beating him; it can be anticipated that it may
              cause even more problems for Gorbachev when it is grown up;
            • The baby is holding a flag “Democracy, Freedom” which conveys the idea that
              Glasnost will bring further demands for these ideals;
            • Gorbachev is wearing shoes with the communist symbol on them while the baby
              demands for democracy and freedom. This may be interpreted as illustrating the
              tension between continuity and change the policies will produce.

     Award [1 mark] for each valid point up to a maximum of [2 marks].

Do not enter half marks or + and – but compensate between (a) and (b) if necessary for a final
mark out of [5 marks].
                                             –4–        M11/3/HISTX/BP1/ENG/TZ0/XX/S3/M




2.   Compare and contrast the views expressed in Sources A and B about
     Gorbachev’s policies of glasnost and perestroika and their consequences for
     the Soviet Union.                                                                 [6 marks]

     For “compare”
     • Both sources imply weakening/decline of the Communist Party as a result of Gorbachev’s
       policies;
     • Both sources mention that actions are becoming more difficult to control;
     • Both sources imply tension between a party-controlled centralized regime and democracy;
     • Both sources view perestroika as starting from above.

     For “contrast”
     • While Source A assesses the role of Gorbachev’s reforms in weakening the USSR, Source
       B attributes greater responsibility to the role played by Yeltsin in burying the USSR;
     • Source A mentions criticism from the people; Source B mentions opposition from the old
       guard of the party;
     • Source B refers to the ending of Soviet mastery in Eastern Europe; Source A does not refer
       to the foreign relations of the USSR.

     Do not demand all of the above. If only one source is discussed award a maximum
     of [2 marks]. If the two sources are discussed separately award [3 marks] or with
     excellent linkage [4–5 marks]. For maximum [6 marks] expect a detailed running
     comparison/contrast.

3.   With reference to their origin and purpose, assess the value and limitations
     of Source C and Source D for historians studying Gorbachev’s policies of
     glasnost and perestroika.                                                           [6 marks]

     Source C
     Origin:        Memoirs written by Mikhail Gorbachev, former leader of the Soviet Union and
                    proposer of glasnost and perestroika, published in London in 1995.

     Purpose:       To put Gorbachev’s version on record and possibly to justify and explain his
                    policies to Western and Russian audiences.

     Value:         Published in London, so it is probably uncensored; it has the benefit of
                    hindsight and of the opening of some of the Soviet records; it is written by the
                    architect of glasnost and perestroika, the leader of the Soviet Union.

     Limitations:   Gorbachev is attempting to explain and justify his policies; his memoirs may
                    lack objectivity.

     Source D
     Origin:        This article was written in March 1989 for an academic journal by a US
                    academic with expertise in Political Science.

     Purpose:       To evaluate events in the Soviet Union as they occurred.

     Value:         This is a contemporary source, which shows academic US views/thinking/
                    understanding of events in the Soviet Union as they unfold. The academic
                    background of the author.

     Limitations:   This source represents a view of an ongoing situation that is constantly
                    changing and its accuracy will depend upon the intelligence available at the
                    time and the skill of the writer in interpreting it.

     Do not expect all of the above and allow other valid points. Ideally there will be a
     balance between the two sources, and each one can be marked out of [3 marks], but allow
     a [4/2 marks] split. If only one source is assessed mark out of [4 marks]. For a maximum of
     [6 marks] candidates must refer to both origin and purpose, and value and limitations.

4.   Using the sources and your own knowledge, analyse the contribution
     made by the policies of glasnost and perestroika to the collapse of the
     Soviet Union.                                                                       [8 marks]

     Source material
     Source A:     Gorbachev’s policies of glasnost/perestroika weakened the Communist Party
                   which started to lose control; glasnost exposed leaders for what they were. A
                   party-controlled regime and democracy were incompatible, leading to
                   instability.

     Source B:       The old guard were resistant to Gorbachev’s policy of perestroika, while
                     others gave it impetus, therefore creating tension; the reform changed to
                     revolution; the role played by Yeltsin is briefly mentioned.

     Source C:       Gorbachev claims that the populace had expected him to provide prosperity
                     through restructuring, but this did not happen, therefore resulting in possible
                     dissatisfaction.

     Source D:       This source mentions economic problems that existed in the USSR which
                     called for the application of perestroika. Glasnost, a concession that
                     Gorbachev had to make to get the workers’ behind perestroika, brought
                     consequences that contribute to explain the eventual collapse of the USSR.
                     Dissent began to manifest itself in the Soviet Union as well as a growing
                     awareness of the need for a transformation of the political structure.

     Source E:       This source shows that Gorbachev is no longer in complete control as
                     glasnost [openness] gains momentum. It indicates that as glasnost moves
                     more towards democracy/freedom, the more it damages Gorbachev and the
                     old regime.

     Own knowledge
     Own knowledge could include: glasnost and perestroika unleashed demands for more political
     freedom, for example the demands to democratise the election of members to all state organisms
     and the demands for the legalisation of trade unions. Such demands quickly became voiced by
     the media which, with more freedom to report, also focused on the severe social and economic
     problems previously denied by the Soviet government such as poor housing/alcoholism/
     absenteeism. Detail on the economic problems brought about by policies such as the failure to
     increase output; the rise in wages which led to an increase in demand, shortage of basic goods
     and a rise in prices (which reached near 10% per annum by 1989); the strikes and
     demonstrations which began to take place such as the coalminers´ strikes in Siberia and Ukraine
     in 1989; additional relevant details on the effects of the tensions between reformers and
     conservatives and on Gorbachev’ problems to satisfy everyone; a development of the role
     played by Yeltsin up to 1989; his disagreements with Gorbachev over the pace of reforms and
     their impact; the 1989 demonstrations after Yeltsin and other reformers failed to be elected to
     the Soviet Supreme; the rise of parties opposed to communism. Glasnost and Perestroika
     encouraged the republics forming the USSR to demand for greater independence from Moscow
                                         –7–        M11/3/HISTX/BP1/ENG/TZ0/XX/S3/M


and more power for their respective parliaments (e.g. the Baltic States). The reforms also
contributed to the rise of nationalism and conflicts such as Nagorno- Karabakh between
Armenia and Azerbaijan breaking out in 1988 and leading to demands for separation from the
USSR; the growth of independence movements in the Baltic States, particularly after
Gorbachev’s decision to the publicise the secret terms of the Nazi Soviet Pact of 1939.
Do not penalise candidates if, in an attempt to explain how some events contributed to the
collapse of the USSR, they go beyond 1989 but do not demand specific knowledge after 1989.

Do not expect all of the above, and credit other relevant material. If only source material or
only own knowledge is used, the maximum mark that can be obtained is [5 marks].
For a maximum of [8 marks] expect argument, synthesis of source material and
own knowledge, as well as references to the sources used.
