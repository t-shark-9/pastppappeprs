1.       Using at least one diagram, explain why governments may need to intervene to encourage
         participation in vaccination programmes during a threatened influenza epidemic.

         Candidates may include:
           an explanation that vaccines are a merit good and this is an example of market failure
           an explanation of market failure
           an explanation of positive externalities of consumption
           a diagram showing marginal private benefit being less than marginal social benefit – vaccines
           would be underprovided by the market mechanism
           the benefits of vaccines being given for influenza – both private and social
           suggestions of how the government may intervene, e.g. subsidies or awareness campaigns to
           increase demand
           the explanation of how governments may intervene provides two more possibilities to use
           diagrams:
              a diagram showing a vertical shift of the MPB curve towards the MSB curve due to
              government awareness campaigns to encourage consumption of the vaccine
              a diagram showing a vertical downward shift of the MPC determined by a subsidy to increase
              supply of the vaccine at a lower price.
              N.B. In either case the shift would be determined by the size of the positive externality.

         Candidates who incorrectly label diagrams cannot be rewarded with full marks.

         Examiners should be aware that candidates may take a different approach which if appropriate,
         should be rewarded.

3.       A government decides to introduce a major increase in its spending programmes.
         Explain how this may lead to “crowding out” effects.

         Candidates may include:
           a definition of “crowding out”
           an explanation of financial “crowding out”; i.e. that by running a budget deficit government
           increases demand for loanable funds, leading to increased interest rates and thus reduced
           private investment and private consumption
           an explanation of physical (resource) “crowding out”; i.e. that increased government
           spending reallocates factors of production away from the private and towards the
           public sector, particularly when the economy is at or near full employment
           an explanation of “crowding out” in terms of it being a criticism of the use of Keynesian demand
           management economics by neo-classical or monetarist economists
           a diagram showing the demand for, and supply of, loanable funds with increased demand leading
           to raised interest rates
           an AD/AS diagram showing the impact of government spending on AD and the subsequent
           decline due to “crowding out”.

           a definition of equilibrium unemployment or unemployment
           types of equilibrium unemployment or unemployment
