                                               SECTION A

Answer one question from this section.

1.    Strider Retail

      Strider Retail is a chain of shops that import and sell electrical appliances, including plasma (screen)
      televisions. The sale of plasma televisions is seasonal, in particular when major sporting events are
      being held. Plasma televisions are expensive. Research has indicated that with improvements in
      technology the cost of importing new models has fallen significantly. Strider Retail expects this to
      continue into the future.

      The following information shows Strider Retail’s purchases and sales of plasma televisions over a
      six month period from July 2010 to December 2010.

      Opening stock of plasma televisions on 1 July 2010: 150 @ US$900.

       Month (2010) Stock purchased          Stock sold
                         (units)               (units)
       July                                      120
       August        100 @ US$900                 90
       September      75 @ US$850                 75
       October        60 @ US$825                 40
       November       75 @ US$800                100
       December      100 @ US$800                120

      Strider Retail has conducted additional secondary research, which reveals that the product life
      cycle for electrical appliances, such as plasma televisions, is getting shorter with new models being
      produced every three months. This research has suggested that Strider Retail may have to reduce its
      selling prices much more often.

      With so many sporting events being shown on television, the seasonal factors in determining the
      sales of plasma televisions are becoming less important. Strider Retail’s marketing manager thinks
      that Strider Retail should move to a just-in-case stock control method, rather than the current
      just-in-time stock control method.



                                                            (This question continues on the following page)

2.    Esperanto

      After having successfully produced a number of new technological products and conducted
      considerable research and development in the consumer goods market, Esperanto was finally ready
      to launch the UniTran. The UniTran is the world’s first communication device, which can instantly
      translate spoken English, French or Spanish into over 121 different languages.

      Initial customer feedback before the marketing and product launch has been very positive,
      despite the very high price of the device (US$2400). Primary market research was conducted by
      Esperanto using a quota sample of communication experts, international journalists and language
      teachers. In addition, doctors and rescue workers from the non-governmental organization (NGO)
      Medicine Sans Frontiers1 were given samples of the UniTran to test and give feedback to Esperanto
      as part of a snowballing market research exercise.

      Esperanto felt that a product of such importance needed a suitable campaign to target a number of
      other niche market2 segments. A marketing agency, New World, was used to help plan and coordinate
      the marketing and product launch for 1 January 2011. Esperanto’s chief executive officer (CEO)
      agreed the following sequence of activities with New World’s marketing team:

          Activity                   Estimated
                                  duration (weeks)
          A                              2
          B (must follow A)              2
          C (must follow B)              5
          D (must follow B)              7
          E (must follow C)              4
          F (must follow D)              3
          G (must follow E and F)        3
          H (must follow G)              2
          I (must follow H)              5

      If early sales of UniTran were disappointing, New World was keen to make a quick adjustment to
      the marketing mix. Given the initial feedback on the UniTran, New World’s perception was that
      the product required a very short channel of distribution. Esperanto felt the opposite. It was
      confident that the UniTran had the potential to become a global product and would require much
      longer channels.

Answer two questions from this section.

3.    Lego

      Since 1932 the Christiansen family has owned and managed Lego, the toy brick maker from
      Denmark. The toy brick was twice voted “Toy of the 20th Century”. Lego’s success has been
      based on providing a quality product and a strong recognizable global brand. Consistent company
      objectives have not included maximizing profit. Due to these factors, Lego has built up considerable
      goodwill and other intangible assets such as brand loyalty.

      Lego’s financial results from 2004 were a shock to their stakeholders. A move into diversified
      markets such as clothing, theme parks and watches had resulted in significant losses. A number of
      rumours began to circulate that Mattel, an American toy manufacturer, would try to takeover the
      struggling European company. However, by 2009, the company had achieved large profits.

       Net profit/loss before interest and tax  –332        380
       Sales revenue                            1513       2010

      Lego spokesperson, Charlotte Simonsen, admitted that the company had made some mistakes by
      moving into diversified markets. She also highlighted other changes in the external environment with
      social trends suggesting that consumer tastes are moving towards computer games. Using technology,
      Lego has now created a 3D web site where customers can design their own toys and then order the
      bricks to build it. A computer-generated Lego film could also be released in 2012.

      Charlotte also believes that Lego’s successful return to achieving large profits was due to the
      economic downturn (recession) of 2008–9. She argues that “during difficult economic times,
      parents return to trusted global brands for durable quality and familiar toys for their children”.

4.    Enigma

      Enigma is a large company, which generates and distributes electricity to over 90 % of households
      in a cold country in Northern Europe. From September to March, daily temperatures are below zero.
      The average annual wage is the lowest in Europe.

      Using price discrimination to generate substantial profits, Enigma charges the business community
      higher rates than it charges rural poorer communities. Enigma has calculated that the price elasticity
      of demand for electricity is such that demand is very unresponsive to price changes. However,
      by early 2009, some pressure groups felt that Enigma’s revenue and profits had become too high.
      Enigma’s chief executive officer (CEO), Bjorn Andersson, defended the high revenue and profits.
      He argued that they were necessary for Enigma to guarantee electricity supply throughout the
      cold months.

      However, by the end of 2010 Enigma made a substantial loss due to the economic downturn
      (recession). As a result, the country’s government organized a “rescue package”* to guarantee
      electricity supply. At the annual general meeting held in 2011, Enigma’s financial accounts
      revealed that senior managers had been awarded substantial performance related payments,
      despite the significant losses. Most shareholders believed that the rescue package was used to
      reward inefficient senior managers. They argued that it was unethical for Enigma to use public
      money in this way, especially during the economic downturn (recession).

      Bjorn did not agree. He argued that despite the economic downturn (recession), Enigma had to
      reward its senior managers as other electricity companies do; he said that “superstar talent
      requires superstar reward packages”. To ensure that there will be a future generation of
      highly-skilled senior managers, Bjorn claimed that he had only one option: to offer million
      dollar reward packages. This practice would also help to recruit and motivate the best university
      graduates to work for Enigma, who could then be trained through job enrichment schemes to
      become the next generation of senior managers.

      (b)       Explain two advantages to Enigma of using price discrimination.                                           [6 marks]

5.    Ansell

      Ansell is a state-owned telecommunications company in Uruguay, South America. It has a
      25 % market share of the home telephone market and has experienced slow growth in revenue over
      the last 10 years.

      In 2005, the Uruguayan government passed legislation to allow foreign companies to enter the
      home telephone market. Immediately, Allo, a French multinational telecommunications company,
      spent large amounts of money setting up a network, as selling in Uruguay was seen as a way of
      entering the South American home telephone market. Allo soon became the market leader and
      its market share doubled that of Ansell. Ansell missed out on opportunities to compete and earn
      substantial profits due to limited finance, inappropriate technology and an autocratic leadership style.

      The Uruguayan government is now passing further legislation to enable even more competition in
      the home telephone market. Ansell has three options.
      • The first option for Ansell is to merge with Ronaldo, a telecommunications company based
         in Brazil. Ronaldo has a different leadership style to that of Ansell and is also struggling financially.
         The financial and marketing benefits from the merger could be considerable for both companies.
         However, Ansell realizes that the corporate culture of the two companies are very different, which
         may lead to potential diseconomies of scale. Furthermore, a number of redundancies would be
         inevitable.
      • A second option is to form a joint venture with the Italian multinational telecommunications
         company Pronto. Consequently, Ansell could benefit from Pronto’s up-to-date technology,
         knowledge and global experience in the home telephone market to compete against Allo.
         In return, Pronto would be able to research potential opportunities to enter into the South
         American home telephone market. Unfortunately, Pronto can only commit to the joint venture
         for one year, which may not give Ansell enough time to compete effectively with Allo.
      • As a third option, Ansell could increase its customer base by expanding its services to the
         rural areas of the country, where Allo and other competitors are not currently operating.
         Ansell is developing a new service called “Rural-Ansell” to cater for the needs of this promising
         market segment. However, the company’s limited finance may compromise this alternative.

		          (i)    corporate culture                                                                   [2 marks]

		          (ii)   diseconomies of scale.                                                              [2 marks]

      (b)   Explain two reasons for the growth of multinational telecommunications
