Examiners should be aware that in some cases, candidates may take a different approach, which if
appropriate should be rewarded. If in doubt check with your Team Leader.

In the case of an “identify” question read all answers and mark positively up to the maximum marks.
Disregard incorrect answers. In the case of a “describe” question, which asks for a certain number of
facts e.g. “describe two kinds”, mark the first two correct answers. This could include two descriptions,
one description and one identification, or two identifications. In the case of an “explain” question,
which asks for a specified number of explanations e.g. “explain two reasons”, mark the first two
correct answers. This could include two full explanations, one explanation, one partial explanation, etc.


1.   (a)   (i)    The percentage marks in column C are calculated by the spreadsheet
                  using a formula. Identify the formula used in cell C4.                        [1 mark]

           (ii)   Identify the type of formatting that has been applied to the formulae in
                  the range (C4:C9).                                                            [1 mark]

     (b)   The grades in cells D4 to D9 are produced automatically by the spreadsheet.
           Describe how the spreadsheet has been set up in order to generate
           these grades.                                                               [4 marks]

           Answers may include:
            get the mark
            look it up somewhere or ref to lookup (vlookup) or as part of an if function
            location of lookup values (reference to (A12:B19) or (A13:B19) or clear
             reference to the correct values in an if function)
             N.B. The marks can be part of the if function or alternatively referenced to the
             appropriate cells in the lookup table.
            compare (mark with lookup values) (this can be expressed using an operator
             such as ≤)
            get/insert grade.

(c)   The teacher uses a macro to plot a chart showing these results. Explain why
      macros are a useful way to generate output such as charts from
      a spreadsheet.                                                              [4 marks]

      Answers may include:
       output is standardized
       chart or other output is produced automatically
       no need to remember commands
       no need to remember formats/chart types used
       can incorporate annotations automatically
       can edit macros to publish the chart in a word processed document
       the job can be given to someone else
       fewer mouse clicks/key strokes/idea of saving time or effort/improved efficiency/
        useful for repetitive tasks
       macros can be edited/fine tuned.

      There is no need to explicitly mention charts in the response.

      [1 mark]
      A limited response that indicates very little understanding of the topic.

      [2–3 marks]

      the lower end of the band. The candidate shows awareness of macros as a means
      of automation.

           identify these two particular errors.                                       [4 marks]

           Answers may include:
            today’s date is generated by (operating) system/look up today’s date in system
             clock/calendar
            allowable date in the future is stored
            checks date entered against allowable date / today’s date
            date must not be beyond a specific date / in the future.

           Award [1 mark] for any of the above points up to a maximum of [2 marks].

           Answers may include:
            checks currency entered/selected

           Award [1 mark] for any of the above points up to a maximum of [2 marks].

     (b)   Identify the steps that a “brute force” attack could use to try out all the
           possible passwords to a computer system.                                    [4 marks]

           Basic marking plan – look for the following ideas about a brute force attack:
            start point identified
            a systematic approach/repetition/try alternatives
            end point (repeat until found or locked out).

           Additional mark points for more detail:
            check that a password is present
            start with a first letter / lower case / upper case
            match against all possible first letters
            add in a second letter
            match against all possible combinations.

           N.B. Reward other possible step by step approaches, if they are systematic.
           Reject random approaches. Reject manual approaches.

           Award [1 mark] for any of the above points up to a maximum of [4 marks].

(c)   Trojan horses and keystroke loggers (often called keyloggers) can be used
      by hackers to intercept passwords when bank customers access their
      accounts online. Explain two methods a bank can use to prevent customers’
      passwords from being intercepted in these ways.                           [4 marks]

      Answers may include:
       never require a complete password (i.e. only require random parts of a password)
       use drop-down boxes to capture parts of passwords
       do not require passwords to be typed in (e.g. select with a mouse from a
        screen-based keyboard) – this avoids their capture by keystroke loggers
       one time passwords
       guidance from bank (however supplied)
       biometric authentication
       encryption – only if it is clear that it is between the keyboard and the computer
       reject https encryption
       reject second level authentication.

      N.B. Answers must relate to prevention of keylogging, not general security
      measures.

      Award [1 mark] for identifying each method up to a maximum of [2 marks].
      Award an additional [1 mark] for the description of each method up to a
      maximum of an additional [2 marks].
