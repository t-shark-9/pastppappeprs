Answer one question. The answer must refer to theoretical perspectives in anthropology and their
application to specific and clearly identified ethnographic illustrations. Each question is worth [20 marks].


1.    Examine the role of agency in the work of one anthropologist.


2.    How does one of the following help us to understand interaction between groups or societies?

      •     materialist perspective
      •     diachronic perspective
      •     conflict-centred perspective
      •     particularistic perspective


3.    Evaluate a structure-centred school of thought.


4.    Why do some anthropologists adopt a synchronic approach?


5.    Compare and contrast the work of two anthropologists with reference to one of the following:

      • idealist perspective
      • universalistic perspective
      • cohesion-centred perspective.
