                                                SECTION A

Answer one question from this section.

1.    Informatic

      Informatic manufactures computers and is based in Sri Lanka. Informatic uses a method of
      batch production and manufactures batches of computers according to customer specifications
      such as computer speed and screen size. Production workers are paid by the hour but receive a
      lower than average wage for Sri Lanka. To compensate they are offered long-term job security and
      other non-financial rewards.

      Informatic exports 4000 computers a year to Pakistan using local independent distributors who
      have knowledge of the local market as well as experience in delivering and installing computers.
      90 % of Informatic’s sales are organized through such distribution channels. Because using local
      independent distributors increases the final price of the computer to the customer, senior managers
      have decided to offer customers in Pakistan the opportunity to purchase computers directly from
      Informatic. Customers have to telephone orders to Informatic in Sri Lanka from Pakistan because
      e-commerce sales are not available.

      The following are Informatic’s expense and sales price figures:
      • fixed costs of $100 000 per year
      • variable costs of 80 % of the sales price
      • sales price of $1000 per computer.


      (a)   (i)    Define the term batch production.                                             [2 marks]

		          (ii)   Identify two fixed costs for Informatic.                                      [2 marks]

      (b)   For Informatic:

            (i)    calculate the break-even quantity in units (show all your working).           [2 marks]

		          (ii)   calculate the margin of safety in units (show all your working).              [2 marks]

		          (iii) calculate the net profit if 4000 computers are sold (show all your working).   [2 marks]

		          (iv) prepare a fully labelled break-even chart.                                      [5 marks]

      (c)   Examine the effectiveness of the new distribution channel for Informatic.            [5 marks]

2.    British Airways (BA)

      British Airways (BA) went from a record profit in 2008 to its biggest ever loss in 2009. Sales revenue
      dropped by 8 % from US$9863 million. The company identified three factors for this change:
      • firstly, there was a fall in demand for its most important market segment: the business traveller
      • secondly, the global banking crisis resulted in a dramatic increase in BA’s cost of borrowing
      • finally, the aviation fuel bills, which make up the largest percentage of variable costs for BA,
         rose by 13 %.

      To address its financial problems, BA executives decided on several cost reduction methods.
      They will not award any pay increases. Managers will not receive any fringe payments.
      Furthermore, the airline imposed a retrenchment of 2500 jobs, resulting in a monthly labour cost
      saving of US$180 million. Unions* have already complained about these cost reduction measures,
      and several workers and managers have also expressed their dissatisfaction. BA announced that it
      would be reducing the number of flights, and orders for five new planes have been cancelled.

      There is, however, one piece of good news for BA passengers; the company announced that there will
      be no ticket price increases. “Demand has become so fragile that any increase in ticket prices would
      damage our sales revenue.” The airline is now being forced into offering special deals; a position that
      was unthinkable only two years ago.

                                                        SECTION B

Answer two questions from this section.

3.    Barreiro Leisure Complex (BLC)

      Barreiro Leisure Complex (BLC) owns many cinemas and ticket sales to the cinemas have
      historically been BLC’s main source of revenue. However, the current economic recession has
      affected demand patterns for many leisure activities, including cinema attendances. BLC’s
      management decided to broaden its product range by creating the ultimate community gaming
      experience. At a cost of US$280 000, BLC converted one of its small movie theatres into a large
      Wi-Fi (wireless) gaming area with 50 computer screens to allow BLC to offer “Cinegames”.
      Cinegames transforms individual game play into group play. The area also includes special effects
      such as fog, black light, flashing green lasers, high-definition digital projectors and vibrating seats.

      BLC produced the following figures:

      Cost of investment to convert one theatre to a Cinegames experience: US$280 000.

       End of year        Estimated
                           revenue
                          (US$000s)
             1                64
             2                88
             3               142
             4               124
             5                88

      Market research revealed that a key market segment for the Cinegames experience was the male
      18–30 year-old age group. The research also showed that leisure companies will need to offer a
      more varied product mix, not only to include different movies but also a range of products to cater
      for families. It was predicted that parents could go to watch a traditional movie while sons go to
      Cinegames and daughters go to other attractions.

      Initial results of the launch of Cinegames were beyond BLC’s expectations. On the weekends
      crowding and traffic congestion was building up around the complex, putting pressure on local
      infrastructure. Despite increasing prices, BLC found that the Cinegames experience was starting
      to increase the attendances at some of its screenings for traditional movies watched by families.
      BLC started to consider the possibilities of transforming a second theatre into an additional
      Cinegames experience. However, a local community pressure group argued that BLC’s decision to
      convert one of its theatres was starting to impact considerably on the local environment.

4.    Dome Hospital in Ghana

      Today, 13 000 nurses who were trained in sub-Saharan African countries such as Ghana work
      in Australia, the United Kingdom (UK), Canada and the United States (US). Recently, the
      UK has saved millions of US$ in the cost of training UK nurses by recruiting Ghanaian ones.
      The government of Ghana, however, had spent a similar amount in training the same nurses who
      now work in the UK.

      The migration of nurses is driven by workforce shortages in countries such as the US and the UK.
      Given these demographic changes, Dome Hospital in Ghana is experiencing severe difficulty in
      recruiting locally trained nurses.

      Recruitment agencies in Ghana have tried a number of different methods to encourage Ghanaian
      nurses to come back home. They have used recruitment events and have set up a web site to attract
      nurses to fill vacancies. They also offer improved pay and working conditions, a free flight home
      and payment of moving expenses. Dome Hospital is considering the introduction of job enrichment
      schemes to increase non-financial motivation.

      Dome Hospital has conducted primary research with Ghanaian nurses working in the UK and has
      discovered that they have encountered a lack of opportunities for experience and promotion.

      Dome Hospital has been approached by Afua, a non-governmental organization (NGO), which
      is concerned about Ghanaian hospitals’ ability to retain nurses. Afua is determined to help and
      is calling for changes in international law to reduce the mobility of nurses from developing to
      developed countries. Afua will probably offer Dome Hospital advice and guidance on recruitment
      and retention, but not direct funding. Afua, however, has considerable knowledge of other NGOs
      with financial resources.

      (b)   Explain two non-financial rewards that Dome Hospital could use to encourage
            Ghanaian nurses to stay in Ghana.                                                                     [6 marks]

5.    CMP

      CMP offers financial accounting services to over 300 small businesses and is managed by
      Carl Mason. CMP employs three full-time accountants. The span of control is narrow; Carl has
      an autocratic leadership style. CMP has a productive working environment and a good reputation
      for its accurate accounting service.

      In the current recession, 10 of CMP’s small business customers are closing down each month.
      CMP is losing revenue. Following a marketing audit and to replace this lost revenue, Carl is
      considering expanding CMP’s services to include accounting software installation and support
      (Option 1). As work patterns of an accounting business such as CMP fit poorly with the
      new services, CMP would have to change to more flexible working practices. Also, to make the
      market aware that CMP will offer these new services, Carl believes that CMP must consider use of
      above the line promotional methods, such as advertising in the business section of a daily national
      newspaper or having a billboard and a radio commercial. These promotional methods are expensive.
      An effective promotional strategy would probably cost at least US$10 000 every six months.
      However, Carl knows that above the line promotional campaigns are not always successful.

      Another idea to replace lost revenue is to merge CMP with Accounting Solutions (AS), a company
      already operating in accounting software installation and support (Option 2). AS is a private limited
      company wholly owned by Matt Auth. If the merger went ahead, AS would operate out of CMP’s
      current office space, reducing overheads of the combined businesses. Also, the new (combined)
      business could sell traditional accounting services to AS’s existing customers and accounting
      software installation and support services to CMP’s existing customers. AS already follows
      flexible work practices. Matt has a laissez-faire leadership style, to which his employees respond
      well. Carl and Matt are discussing combining the two businesses. Carl would own 55 % and
      Matt 45 % of the new business.


      (a)   Outline what a marketing audit is.                                                   [2 marks]

      (b)   Explain two flexible working practices that would allow an accounting business,
            such as CMP, to offer an increased range of accounting services (Option 1).          [6 marks]

      (c)   Analyse the appropriateness of an autocratic leadership style for CMP.               [5 marks]

      (d)   Discuss the two options (Option 1 and Option 2) put forward by Carl to replace
            lost revenue.                                                                        [7 marks]
