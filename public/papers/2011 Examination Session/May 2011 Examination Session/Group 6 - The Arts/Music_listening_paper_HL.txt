Either

1.    Symphony No. 41 in C Major, K. 551 “Jupiter” by W A Mozart
      In movement four (“Molto Allegro”) locate the principle themes found in the
      exposition and discuss Mozart’s treatment of these themes in either the development
      (bar/measure 158–224) or the coda (bar/measure 356–end).                            [20 marks]

      Demonstrate the rhythmic sophistication found in Copland’s El Salón México by

      11–27 (bar/measure 103–267).                                                        [20 marks]
