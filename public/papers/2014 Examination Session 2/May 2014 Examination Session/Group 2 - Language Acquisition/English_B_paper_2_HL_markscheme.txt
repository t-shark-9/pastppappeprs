These marking notes give additional information for marking paper 2. When marking both
sections, keep in mind that neither subject specific knowledge nor candidates’ personal opinions, as
such, should be assessed, although Criterion B marks may be influenced by how successfully
knowledge or opinions are handled in the message.

These notes are intended to define the top mark of the scale in this examination. The phrase,
“a good answer”, is intended to refer to scripts which are likely to be placed in the 9 to 10 band
(5 for criterion C) of descriptors. Scripts should be marked proportionately lower to the degree to
which they fail to meet these requirements.

In each case, good answers will meet most, though not necessarily all, of the following requirements.

Word count

At HL, students are required to write a minimum of 250 words in Section A and 150 words in
Section B. Failure to write the minimum number of words will result in a [1 mark] penalty under
criterion A. There is no penalty for exceeding 400 words in Section A or 250 words in Section B:
the whole text should be taken into consideration in the award of marks.

Criterion A – Language

A good answer will have very few language gaps, if any, and slips or flaws very rarely affect
meaning.


 Language
 Not all errors have the same importance, and examiners should bear this in mind. Some errors
 affect the communication of meaning significantly, and others do not. Also, some errors indicate a
 fundamental lack of command of the language, while others may simply indicate a moment of
 forgetfulness.
 SLIPS – mistakes at all levels of difficulty, but erratic and occasional – eg the candidate normally
 forms past tenses well, but occasionally forgets “-ed”
 FLAWS – errors occur more regularly, particularly in certain structures – eg past tenses are
 formed correctly quite often, but are not really reliable, and there may be basic confusions
 (eg past simple versus present perfect)
 GAPS – some structures are rarely correct, or simply don’t appear – eg the past tenses are needed,
 but do not appear.

                                              SECTION A

1.      Cultural diversity

        You recently read a blog in which the writer claimed that all sectors of the population of
        a country should celebrate the same festivals. Write a blog entry in response in which
        you state your opinion on the matter.

        A good answer:

        Criterion B – Message
        • will concentrate on the value of a society celebrating the same festivals, rather than
          discussing culture in general; responses that are too general should be marked down under
          “relevance”. “Sectors of the population groups” may be interpreted quite widely, eg by
          age-groups, not just by cultural groups
        • will explain the opinion clearly, whether this is for, or against, or making a balanced
          assessment
        • will provide effective support for the argument/s or comments put forward
        • will use paragraphing and cohesive devices which structure the development of ideas
          effectively
        • may also refer to the ideas provided in the original blog
        • may also make effective use of personal experience.

        Criterion C – Format
        • will adopt a semi-formal to informal register
        • will have an engaging title
        • will include personal reflection
        • will show awareness of the reader, eg through direct address, a lively and interesting style,
          an invitation for comments.
	  

       N.B. Some limited use of textese (eg 4 for four/for and u for you) and/or emoticons is
       permissible.

2.   Customs and traditions

     Your school hosted a Culture Day in which students from different cultures celebrated
     their customs, cultural practices and/or traditions. Write a review of the event to be
     published in your school newspaper.

     A good answer:

     Criterion B – Message
     • will include a fairly detailed description of the event
     • will give details of how the event celebrated customs, cultural practices and/or traditions,
       whether through reference to details of the event’s organisation or reference to specific
       cultural elements displayed; responses that are too general should be marked down under
       “relevance”
     • will refer to more than one custom, cultural practice, or tradition, which may be from one
       or more cultures. If the script fails to cover more than one custom, cultural practice or
       tradition, it may achieve the 5–6 band if the ideas that are developed are reasonably
       “coherent” with supporting details that are “mostly appropriate”
     • will provide the reviewer’s opinion, including some form of evaluation of the event
     • will use paragraphing and cohesive devices which structure the development of ideas
       effectively.

     Criterion C – Format
     • will adopt a consistent register (informal, semi-formal or formal)
     • will have a relevant title
     • will use a lively, direct style aimed to interest and entertain the readers
     • will have an engaging introduction and a clear conclusion
     • may have sub-headings.
                                               –6–           M14/2/ABENG/HP2/ENG/TZ0/XX/M


3.   Health

     Many teenagers in your community feel insecure about the way they look. Write an
     article to be published in a youth magazine in which you outline the reasons why
     teenagers have those insecurities and suggest solutions.

     A good answer:

     Criterion B – Message
     • will concentrate on insecurity about appearance, rather than on insecurity in general;
       responses that are too general should be marked down under “relevance”
     • will outline the reasons why teenagers feel insecure about the way they look
     • will suggest solutions to help with insecurities about appearance
     • will cover both aspects of the question: the reasons and the solutions. If the script fails to
       cover one of the requirements, it may achieve the 5–6 band if the ideas that are developed
       are reasonably “coherent” with supporting details that are “mostly appropriate”
     • will support the argument with illustrations, eg relevant examples or personal experience
     • will use paragraphing and cohesive devices which structure the development of ideas
       effectively.

     Criterion C – Format
     • will adopt a semi-formal to formal register
     • will address the target teenage audience sensitively
     • will have a relevant headline/title
     • will have a distinct introduction, development and conclusion
     • may use other format features, eg name of the author, subheadings, quotes.

4.    Leisure

      A friend of yours has emailed you a link to an interview with a sports figure who argued
      that sports should not be played for leisure. Write an email to your friend in which you
      express your views on the subject.

      A good answer:

      Criterion B – Message
      • will concentrate on the idea of playing sports for leisure, not sports in general (in the sense
        of professional sports, or always ‘playing to win’); responses that are too general should be
        marked down under “relevance”
      • will explain the opinion clearly, whether this is for, or against, or making a balanced
        assessment
      • will explain the viewpoint with arguments and supporting details
      • will use paragraphing and cohesive devices which structure the development of ideas
        effectively
      • may also refer to the original interview; particularly for either agreement or for rebuttal
        purposes
      • may also use personal experience to reinforce the point of view.

      Criterion C – Format
      • will adopt an informal register
      • will adopt a lively, engaging style, perhaps with some ‘youth-speak’, eg “I’m good”,
        “Can’t wait”
      • will maintain a clear sense of address to a specific person	  
      • will have opening and closing salutations
      • may use the layout of an email (sender’s and recipient’s email addresses), but this is not
        essential.

     N.B. Some limited use of textese (eg 4 for four/for and u for you) and/or emoticons is
     permissible.
                                               –8–          M14/2/ABENG/HP2/ENG/TZ0/XX/M


5.   Science and technology

     You are participating in a class debate on the motion: “Science experiments should not
     involve the use of animals”. Write the text of your opening speech either agreeing or
     disagreeing with this motion.

     A good answer:

     Criterion B – Message
     • will concentrate on science experiments on animals, rather than on cruelty to animals in
        general; responses that are too general should be marked down under “relevance”
     • will make absolutely clear the writer’s viewpoint, of either agreement or disagreement with
       the motion. If the script fails to take a clear position, it may achieve the 5–6 band only if
       the ideas that are developed are “coherent” with supporting details that are “mostly
       appropriate”
     • will have a coherent and convincing argument, eg by relating general moral principles with
       specific practical consequences.
     • will use paragraphing and cohesive devices which structure the development of ideas
       effectively
     • may also devote some space to the opposing viewpoint for rebuttal purposes
     • may also make effective use of personal experience.

     Criterion C – Format
     • will adopt a semi-formal to formal register, perhaps with flashes of informality
     • will adopt an appropriately serious tone
     • will include speech rhetoric eg rhetorical questions, repetition
     • will address the audience and keep contact with them throughout (eg use of “we” and
       “you” etc.)
     • will set out to catch the audience’s attention at the beginning, and leave a clear impression
       at the end.
                                               –9–           M14/2/ABENG/HP2/ENG/TZ0/XX/M



                                           SECTION B

6.   Personal response

     “The news isn’t there to tell you what happened. It’s there to tell you what it wants you
     to hear or what it thinks you want to hear.”

                           Source: Joss Whedon, Astonishing X-Men, Vol. 2: Dangerous (2007)
     A good answer:

     Criterion B – Argument
     • will address at least two of the main ideas in the stimulus text: the news rarely provides the
       audience with the truth / news organisations (or other) decide a point of view to impose on
       the audience / they provide us with what they think we prefer; scripts which do not address
       these ideas should be marked down under “relevance”
     • will make the candidate’s viewpoint clear: the candidate may write a balanced argument or
       a polemic, adopt an analytic approach, etc
     • will provide coherent, clearly explained and supported reasons for the candidate’s
       viewpoint/s
     • may personalize the issue by providing brief examples drawn from the candidate’s own
       experience
     • may adopt unexpected or unconventional approaches (eg argument presented within an
       invented or fictional context) provided that there is a link to the key ideas in the stimulus.
