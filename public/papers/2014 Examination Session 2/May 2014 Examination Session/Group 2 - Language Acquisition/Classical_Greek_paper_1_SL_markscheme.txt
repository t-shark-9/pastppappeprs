Each word is assigned 0 or 1 or 2 points. Those worth 1 or 2 points indicate this value immediately
following the word, while those with zero points have no numerical indication.

A 1-point word (for example, an adverb or conjunction) needs only a correct translation to get the point.
For a 2-point word, if the translation persuades you that the candidate understands the meaning of the
word, one point is awarded; if the candidate persuades you that the grammar of the word is understood,
then the second point is awarded.

When two words are joined by “_” they are to be treated as one word. A two-word phrase worth
two points includes one point for vocabulary and one point for grammar. The vocabulary point is
awarded only if both words are translated correctly in context; a vocabulary error in either or
both words results in no points for vocabulary. The grammar point is awarded if the phrase’s grammar
is understood correctly.

The maximum number of points is 70.
