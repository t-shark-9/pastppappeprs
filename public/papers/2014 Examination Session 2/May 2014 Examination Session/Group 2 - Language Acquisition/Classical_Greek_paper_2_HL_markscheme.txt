Genre: Epic

1.   (a)   Award [1 mark] each up to [2 marks] for any of the following: he feels safe and comfortable
           now; the Phaeacians have already recognised his heroic status, therefore they will be more
           likely to believe him; the normal rules of hospitality demand for a guest to be questioned only
           after being welcomed and given food. Any other reasons on their merits.

     (b)   Award [1 mark] each up to [3 marks] for any of: ἐυδείελον (clear, distinct); χθαµαλὴ (low or
           close to land); πανυπερτάτη (high, highest); πρὸς ζόφον (facing darkness); τρηχεῖ᾽ (rugged);
           there are many islands around (ἀµφὶ δὲ νῆσοι πολλαί); has a wooded mountain
           (ὄρος…εἰνοσίφυλλον).

     (c)   Calypso lives in caves (ἐν σπέσσι γλαφυροῖσι) [1 mark]; Circe in a palace/large halls
           (ἐν µεγάροισιν) [1 mark]. Other points on their merits.

     (d)   Award [3 marks] for a correct answer, or for an answer with no more than one minor error
           (tense, number, etc); [2 marks] for answers with two or three minor errors or one major error;
           [1 mark] for answers with two major errors (or the equivalent). Otherwise, award no mark.


2.   (a)   Mark only for length of syllables. Award [1 mark] per line if all correct; no mark otherwise.

     (b)   Award [1 mark] each up to [2 marks] for any characteristic such as his strength (µεγάλην
           ἐπιειµένον ἀλκήν) and wildness (ἄγριον); not being part of a civilised community (οὔτε δίκας
           ἐὺ εἰδότα οὔτε θέµιστας).

     (c)   The wine is highly valued as a divine substance, of which men can make the right (as here) or
           wrong (as in other passages of the Odyssey) use. It differentiates civilised beings from brutes
           (such as the Cyclops in the following episode). Accept a range of substantiated answers,
           awarding up to [6 marks] for stylistic remarks or any detail such as:
           • insistence on “sweetness” (ἡδέος, ἡδὺν, ἡδεῖα)
           • it is a valuable gift (ἀγλαὰ δῶρα)
           • comparable to gold (χρυσοῦ … τάλαντα) and silver (κρητῆρα πανάργυρον)
           • related to the divine (θεῖον ποτόν, given by the priest of Apollo)
           • given as a gift after protection was granted out of reverence (περισχόµεθ᾽, ἁζόµενοι)
           • elaborate description of the donor (Μάρων, Εὐάνθεος υἱός κτλ.)
           • it is powerful (ἀκηράσιον), to be mixed with an unusually high proportion of water (ἀνὰ
              εἴκοσι µέτρα).

           Award up to [2 marks] for the coherence and clarity of the argument ([2 marks] if very
           coherent and well-argued; [1 mark] if coherent and well-argued; no marks if incoherent and
           poorly argued or if no details from the text are given).

Genre: Historiography

3.   (a)   Planks were laid upon the cables [1 mark]; they were then covered with brushwood and earth
           [1 mark]; finally, a fence was set up on either side [1 mark].

     (b)   At early spring [1 mark], after completion of the bridges and the Athos channel [1 mark].

     (c)   Priests (of Mazda/Zoroaster) [1 mark]; their responsibilities include performance of
           rites/sacrifices [1 mark] and interpretation of dreams [1 mark]. Do not accept vague
           references to “magic”.

     (d)   Award [1 mark] each up to [2 marks] for any of the following: the eclipse indicates the
           destruction of the Greek cities (Ἕλλησι προδεικνύει ὁ θεὸς ἔκλειψιν τῶν πολίων); the sun
           represents the Greeks (ἥλιον εἶναι Ἑλλήνων προδέκτορα); the moon represents the Persians
           (σελήνην δὲ σφέων).


4.   (a)   Award [1 mark] each up to [2 marks] for any correct detail such as: Spartan king (from 515
           to 491); opposer of Cleomenes; deposed by Leotychidas; friendly towards the Persians, fled to
           the court of Darius; supported Xerxes’s succession to Darius.

     (b)   The usage according to which Spartan kings [1 mark] were allowed double portions [1 mark]
           at feasts.

     (c)   Accept a range of substantiated answers, awarding up to [6 marks] for stylistic remarks or
           details such as:
           • a bold speech, uttered with confidence (γελάσας)
           • direct speech
           • Ionian dialect (Δηµάρητε, ἐφθέγξαο, στρατιῇ, ὦν, etc)
           • hypothetical character of Demaratus’s assertion (ὀρθοῖτ᾽ ἂν ὁ λόγος)
           • contrary to what is reasonable (παντὶ τῷ οἰκότι)
           • figures of repetition (ἀντιτάσσεσθαι, ἀντάξιος, ἀντάξιον)
           • it is not likely that each Greek soldier would be able to fight against ten Persians (πρὸς
              ἄνδρας δέκα µάχεσθαι)
           • therefore Greek claims might be a boast (µάτην κόµπος ὁ λόγος)
           • tricolon (χίλιοι ἢ καὶ µύριοι ἢ καὶ πεντακισµύριοι)
           • exaggeration of numbers (five million Persians would include all the followers, at least).
           • juxtaposition between Persian rule and Greek democracy (seen as a weak point).

           Award up to [2 marks] for the coherence and clarity of the argument ([2 marks] if very
           coherent and well-argued; [1 mark] if coherent and well-argued; no marks if incoherent and
           poorly argued or if no details from the text are given).
                                                  –5–               M14/2/GREEK/HP2/ENG/TZ0/XX/M


Genre: Tragedy

5.   (a)   Award [1 mark] each up to [3 marks] for phrases such as: τί δῆτα τοὐµὸν οὐ λύω στόµα
           (1060); εἰ δὴ κακός γε φαίνοµαι δοκῶ τε σοί (1071); εἴθε φθέγµα γηρύσαισθέ µοι καὶ
           µαρτυρήσαιτ᾽(1074–1075).

     (b)   “Piety”, for not violating his oath [1 mark]; “pride”, “arrogance”, for refusing to defend
           himself before his father [1 mark].

     (c)   Award [3 marks] for a correct answer, or for an answer with no more than one minor error
           (tense, number, etc); [2 marks] for answers with two or three minor errors or one major error;
           [1 mark] for answers with two major errors (or the equivalent). Otherwise, award no mark.

     (d)   The moral degradation of Hyppolitus, culpable, in Theseus’s eyes, of assaulting Phaedra
           [1 mark]; the evils/misfortunes Hyppolitus has to suffer [1 mark].


6.   (a)   Mark only for length of syllables. Award [1 mark] per line if all correct; no mark otherwise.

     (b)   At the Mysteries [1 mark] of Eleusis [1 mark]. Accept also Athens or any other correct
           answer relating to that context.

     (c)   Throughout the extract love is seen as an obscure illness, on which it is the nurse’s duty to
           shed light through a process of active enquiry. The extract is an example of dramatic irony
           since the audience already knows the true reason of Phaedra’s ill-being. Award up to
           [6 marks] for stylistic remarks or details such as:
           • love is never explicitly mentioned as a possible cause: instead, it is an illness (νόσος) to be
              treated by doctors (ἰατροῖς)
           • Phaedra’s condition might be due to ἄτης (line 276), bewilderment sent by the gods
           • Phaedra’s condition is unclear (ἄσηµα), lit. “without significance”; it cannot even be
              judged from signs (τεκµαίρεται)
           • nurse’s efforts to question her, make her speak (ἐλέγχουσ᾽)
           • Phaedra’s refusal to speak (ἐννέπειν, σιγᾷ, κοὔ φησιν) or reveal her condition (κρύπτει)
           • in contrast, her condition must be brought forth, uttered, etc (πυθέσθαι καὶ κλύειν, ἔφυ,
              µηνυθῇ)
           • Contrast between diseases that can or cannot be mentioned (ἀπορρήτων … ἔκφορός).
           • Also accept well-argued references to the nurse’s love for Phaedra.

           Award up to [2 marks] for the coherence and clarity of the argument ([2 marks] if very
           coherent and well-argued; [1 mark] if coherent and well-argued; no marks if incoherent and
           poorly argued or if no details from the text are given).
                                                  –6–             M14/2/GREEK/HP2/ENG/TZ0/XX/M


Genre: Comedy

7.   (a)   Award [1 mark] each up to [2 marks] for remarks such as: his humble origins (reflected in his
           father’s name); his living in the countryside; the careless way he kicks at the door.

     (b)   Mark only for length of syllables. Award [1 mark] per line if all correct; no mark otherwise.

     (c)   Award [1 mark] each up to [3 marks] for remarks such as: thoughts are like living creatures,
           which can be miscarried (ἐξήµβλωκας); they are secret knowledge (µυστήρια), to which only
           initiates are admitted (οὐ θέµις πλὴν τοῖς µαθηταῖσιν λέγειν); they are dealt with cleverness
           (δεξιώτατα) and subtleness of mind (τῆς λεπτότητος τῶν φρενῶν). Do not award marks if no
           reference to the Greek is made.

     (d)   Wax is melted [1 mark]; a mould (a Persian slipper) is taken of the flea’s feet [1 mark]; the
           distance is measured by means of these moulds [1 mark].


8.   (a)   Music (which included literacy, study of poets and traditional music forms) was imparted by a
           specialised teacher; youths from the same district attended the same school; did not indulge in
           melodies twisting like the ones of the contemporary cithara-singer Phrynis, etc [1 mark].
           Physical training was carried out in specific places under the guidance of a gymnastic-master
           (reference to sand and παιδοτρίβου); curious people would watch the training; perhaps
           motivated by sexual attraction, etc [1 mark].

     (b)   While sitting, to cover their thigh (so as not to exhibit anything indecent to those outside)
           [1 mark]; after rising, to sweep the sand (so as not to leave an impression of their body for
           their lovers) [1 mark].

     (c)   The whole of Just Argument’s discourse is an example of traditional speech, aimed at
           showing how ancient education’s aim was to instil in the youths the traditional values of the
           polis and make them good citizens, in sharp contrast with the new (dialectical) teaching of the
           sophists. Award up to [6 marks] for stylistic remarks or details such as:
           • orderly exposition of arguments (πρῶτον µὲν … εἶτα)
           • juxtaposition in behaviour of youth: orderly behaviour of the ancient (with relevant
              examples) juxtaposed to the ribaldry (βωµολοχεύσαιτ᾽) of present times
           • contrast with new songs (enhanced by assonance): κάµψειέν τινα καµπήν …
              δυσκολοκάµπτους, “make sudden … intricate … turns (of the voice)”
           • imagery of down on quinces (refered to the privy parts): δρόσος καὶ χνοῦς ὥσπερ µήλοισιν
           • effeminate voices (µαλακὴν … φωνὴν)
           • negative prescriptions reinforced by anaphora of οὐδ᾽ (lines 979–983).

           Award up to [2 marks] for the coherence and clarity of the argument ([2 marks] if very
           coherent and well-argued; [1 mark] if coherent and well-argued; no marks if incoherent and
           poorly argued or if no details from the text are given).
                                                  –7–              M14/2/GREEK/HP2/ENG/TZ0/XX/M


Genre: Philosophy

9.    (a)   This could be to disobey the god [1 mark]; talking about virtue (or examining himself and the
            others) is the greatest good [1 mark]; such a life is not worth living [1 mark].

      (b)   Award [3 marks] for a correct answer, or for an answer with no more than one minor error
            (tense, number, etc); [2 marks] for answers with two or three minor errors or one major error;
            [1 mark] for answers with two major errors (or the equivalent). Otherwise, award no mark.

      (c)   Accept a wide range of relevant answers, awarding [1 mark] each up to [2 marks] for any
            such as: the right penalty would be to be maintained in the Prytaneum (which is a reward
            rather than a penalty); one mina could be regarded by the judges as a sum outrageously low,
            especially if compared to the death penalty proposed by the accusers; he makes clear how he
            only puts forward the thirty minas penalty at his friends’ insistence.

      (d)   Award [1 mark] each up to [2 marks] for examples such as: πεῖσαί τινας ὑµῶν
            (convince/persuade you); τῷ θεῷ ἀπειθεῖν (disobey the god); οὐ πείσεσθέ µοι (you will not
            believe me); πείθειν (convince/persuade).


10.   (a)   They spoke persuasively (or similar translation of πιθανῶς) [1 mark]; but said nothing true
            (“nothing” is required) [1 mark].

      (b)   There is a fundamental contrast between: one who speaks the truth, but without a plan and
            with random words [1 mark]; and one who speaks in fine sentences and embellishes his
            speeches with words and phrases [1 mark].

      (c)   The extract sets forth from the very start of Socrates’s defence fundamental concepts such as
            the nature of the greatest good, the moral obligations of the just man, the difference between
            plausibility and truth, the nature of rhetoric. Award up to [6 marks] for remarks or details
            such as:
            • questioning the truth of the charges at the very beginning (ἐψεύσαντο … ἐξαπατηθῆτε)
            • logical structures of the argument: any logical connectors, eg εἰ µὲν γὰρ … ὁµολογοίην ἂν
            • juxtaposition πιθανῶς ἔλεγον … ἀληθές
            • repetition (polyptoton) such as µὴ αἰσχυνθῆναι … ἀναισχυντότατον, δεινός (with shift in
               meaning)
            • concessio (ὁµολογοίην ἂν ἔγωγε)
            • juxtaposition of different meanings of rhetoric (cf. question b above)
            • remark on own advanced age (τῇδε τῇ ἡλικίᾳ): compare to other expedients commonly
               used by defendants.

            Award up to [2 marks] for the coherence and clarity of the argument ([2 marks] if very
            coherent and well-argued; [1 mark] if coherent and well-argued; no marks if incoherent and
            poorly argued or if no details from the text are given).
