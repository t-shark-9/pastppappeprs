Subject Details: Physics HL Paper 3 Markscheme
Mark Allocation

Candidates are required to answer questions from TWO of the Options [2 % 30 marks].
Maximum total = [60 marks].

1.    A markscheme often has more marking points than the total allows. This is intentional.

2.    Each marking point has a separate line and the end is shown by means of a semicolon (;).

3.    An alternative answer or wording is indicated in the markscheme by a slash (/). Either wording can
      be accepted.

4.    Words in brackets ( ) in the markscheme are not necessary to gain the mark.

5.    Words that are underlined are essential for the mark.

6.    The order of marking points does not have to be as in the markscheme, unless stated otherwise.

7.    If the candidate’s answer has the same “meaning” or can be clearly interpreted as being of
      equivalent significance, detail and validity as that in the markscheme then award the mark.
      Where this point is considered to be particularly relevant in a question it is emphasized by
      OWTTE (or words to that effect).

8.    Remember that many candidates are writing in a second language. Effective communication is
      more important than grammatical accuracy.

9.    Occasionally, a part of a question may require an answer that is required for subsequent
      marking points. If an error is made in the first marking point then it should be penalized. However, if
      the incorrect answer is used correctly in subsequent marking points then follow through marks
      should be awarded when marking. Indicate this by adding ECF (error carried forward) on the script.

10.   Do not penalize candidates for errors in units or significant figures, unless it is specifically referred
      to in the markscheme.

             (ii)   the gravitational force that tends to collapse the star is balanced by a force

3.   (a)   electromagnetic radiation in the microwave region;
           black body radiation (at a temperature of about 3 K);
           (almost) isotropic/uniform radiation;
           radiation that fills the universe/exists everywhere/has no obvious point of origin;    [2 max]

     (b)   CMB radiation was a prediction of the Big Bang model;
           CMB “temperature” is consistent with a universe that has cooled from an initial
           hot state;
           CMB wavelength is consistent with a universe that has expanded from an initial
           hot, dense state;
           CMB isotropy/uniformity is consistent with its origin in the very early universe;      [2 max]

           higher luminosity;                                   essential)

           with luminosity in the main sequence;                                                      [2]
           Ignore irrelevant statements that L = σ AT 4 .
           Allow second marking point even if only mass is discussed.

     (b)   Achernar has greater luminosity/temperature and so fuses hydrogen at a
           (disproportionately) higher rate than the Sun / OWTTE;
           so it will run out of hydrogen/move to red giant region in less time than the Sun /
           OWTTE;                                                                                     [2]

                  Allow 2.5 M  to 3M  as O–V limit.

           (ii)   detection of EM radiation from pulsars/stars that pulsate / stars whose
                  intensity varies rapidly / OWTTE;                                                   [1]

5.   (a)    the galaxy is moving away from the Earth and so the wavelength is Doppler/Red
            shifted;                                                                             [1]
            or
            the universe is expanding and so the space between galaxies is stretched/increases
            and this means that the wavelength of the received light will also be
            stretched/increased;
            Do not accept answers such as “the galaxy is red-shifted”.

           (ii)   period of signal wave is 1.0 (µs);

17.   (a)   it is impossible to distinguish gravitational effects from effects of acceleration/
            inertial effects;
            a frame of reference accelerating in (outer space) is equivalent to a frame at rest in
            a gravitational field;
            a frame of reference in free fall in a g-field is equivalent to a frame moving at
            constant velocity in outer space;                                                        [1 max]
            Make careful use of OWTTE in this question.
            Do not accept vague statement such as “gravity and acceleration are the same”.

      (b)   (i)    the box is equivalent to an inertial frame of reference (far from any masses);
                   so f C = f 0 ;                                                                        [2]

            (ii)   the energy of a photon is hf P ;
                   light loses energy as it rises;
                   so f P < f 0 ;                                                                        [3]

                   or
                   P’s frame of reference is equivalent to a frame accelerating upwards (far
                   from any masses);
                   P moves away from the emitted light / the “space” between P and original
                   source increases;
                   so (by the Doppler effect) f P < f 0 ;

      (c)   the mass of the Sun bends the spacetime around it;
            particles follow paths of least length/geodesics (when no forces act on them);
            paths of least length/geodesics are curves in the bent spacetime;                        [2 max]

            leaving behind the small excess of particles over antiparticles that existed in the
            very early universe;                                                                   [3 max]
