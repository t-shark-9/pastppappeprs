(Option A continued)

3.    OnlyScience publishes several scientific journals. There must be one editor for each journal,
      but an editor can be responsible for more than one journal.

      (a)      Construct the entity-relationship diagram (ERD) for this scenario.                          [3]

      The editor works with a pool of reviewers to review papers submitted for publication.
      Editors may be reviewers for other editors’ journals. Their operations and activities are
      described in a database system that includes the following three tables, which begin as shown.

(Option A, question 3 continued)

      (d)   Construct, in any form, a query to find the phone numbers of all the people involved in
            the production of a journal with a “Special” number.                                        [5]

      The publisher only needs to see the activities of the editors, not of the reviewers.

      (e)   Outline how a query can provide a view of a database.                                       [3]

      (f)   Discuss whether a view is physically stored in the database.                                [3]

      Each submitted paper that will be reviewed is assigned a unique identifier. The following table
      gives an overview of the current papers to review, for which the editors have already found
      a reviewer.

Option B — Modelling and simulation

4.    A simplified version of a country’s debt in a three-month period, i, can be measured by:

      current debt (CDi ) = government spending (GS) + previous debt (CDi–1 ) – income (I)

      The debt is recalculated every three months according to the latest figures and expressed as a
      percentage of the value of the country’s production (GDP).

      For example, in June 2011, the figures for France were:

                                                                                   debt       
      debt (in €): 1 717 256    GDP (in €): 1 996 583     %debt: 85.8       %debt  GDP  × 100 
                                                                           =
                                                                                              

      A model is to be used to hold the figures for each three-month period over several years.

      (a)   Outline the way in which a mathematical model of the debt and %debt for one country
            could be formulated to hold the figures for each three-month period over a number
            of years. You should include the necessary inputs for each period.                            [4]

      Government income includes taxes and the sale of bonds (investments).

      (b)   With reference to a spreadsheet, or any other simulation software with which you are
            familiar, describe how the model could be adapted to include these taxes and bond sales
            and used to simulate the trend in debt over the next few years.                               [6]

      The trend in rising debt is important for financial and political reasons.

      (c)   Discuss the advantages and limitations, to governments, of using this simulation to control
            the level of debt.                                                                            [6]




                                                                 (Option B continues on the following page)

(Option B continued)

5.    A simple learning game for young children consists of random arithmetic questions
      being presented for the player to answer. The questions consist of two randomly selected
      numbers and an arithmetic operator, randomly selected from addition, subtraction,
      multiplication and division. The game is scored and each time the correct answer is given
      the score is incremented.

      (a)   Identify the variables needed to implement the game as a program and describe how they
            would change each time a question is generated.                                                [4]

      It is decided to make the game more interesting by using 3D visualization so that numbers
      and arithmetic operators are represented as characters such as animated monsters and wizards.
      Correct answers lead the player successfully through a castle maze and wrong answers lead the
      player into dungeons with scary animals.

      (b)   Outline the need for rendering in the creation of the visualization of the characters.         [2]

      (c)   Discuss two technical and two social implications of implementing an arithmetic game in
            this way.                                                                                      [8]

6.    Many cities face problems of traffic congestion at busy times of the day. These problems can
      be reduced by various methods, for example:

      •     build more roads
      •     introduce more one-way systems
      •     replace traffic lights with roundabouts (traffic circles)
      •     change the timing of traffic lights at different times of the day.

      Before introducing any of these methods it is necessary to research the current traffic patterns
      and to consider the effect that these methods would have on the situation. One way of doing
      this is to create a computer simulation.

      (a)      Suggest ways in which data could be collected that describes the current traffic situation.   [4]

      (b)      Describe how current traffic and infrastructure could be simulated.                           [4]

      The simulation can be run with changes in rules to reflect the four methods described above.

      (c)      Suggest two criteria that could be used to evaluate the results of the simulation, to help
               decide which of the four methods should be implemented.                                       [4]

      Other factors could be incorporated into the model, such as improved bicycle lanes and
      public transport.

      (d)      Outline the difficulties in incorporating these other factors into the simulation.            [3]

Option C — Web science

7.    The process of downloading web pages onto a personal computer requires the combination of
      applications and protocols.

      (a)   Outline the interaction between client and server if the HTTP protocol is used.                [2]

      Information sent over the internet can be intercepted.

      (b)   Describe two ways in which HTTPS provides for extra security.                                  [4]

      Consider the following piece of code found inside the HTML of a downloaded web page:

      <script language="JavaScript" src="anyFile.js">
      </script>

      (c)   With reference to the above piece of code,

            (i)    identify the consequence of its execution;                                              [1]

            (ii)   identify two ways in which the executing of this code could improve the functionality
                   of the web page.                                                                        [2]

      Many websites allow users to purchase goods online. These websites may also make offers to
      recognized customers.

      (d)   Discuss the role that server-side scripting can play in these purchases.                       [6]

8.    The principal aim of search engines is to return a list of the pages most relevant to a
      search query. Web crawlers are used to find and return web pages for later analysis.

      (a)   Outline the steps by which a web crawler moves through the web.                              [3]

      There are many pages belonging to the deep web that search engines will not find.

      (b)   (i)    Outline one reason why web crawlers are not able to find these pages.                 [1]

            (ii)   Identify one way in which these pages are generated.                                  [1]

      (c)   Outline how hubs and authorities are used by some search engines in determining the
            relative importance of a web page.                                                           [4]

      Search engine users expect to find the pages most relevant to their query at the top of the
      returned list.

      (d)   Discuss the moral responsibilities of search engine designers and website developers in
            ensuring that this happens.                                                                  [6]


9.    The internet is continually evolving in structure, content and the way that it is being used.
      Two such changes are the increasing use of both ubiquitous computing and mobile computing.

      (a)   Define, with the use of an example, the term ubiquitous computing.                           [2]

      (b)   Identify one limitation of mobile computing.                                                 [1]

      A major organization that analyses data from space telescopes has traditionally used powerful
      supercomputers for large-scale processing. However, it is now considering changing over to
      grid computing.

      (c)   Examine two features of grid computing that would be considered before making the
            decision to change.                                                                          [4]

      (d)   With reference to data stored on the web, distinguish between copyright and
            intellectual property.                                                                       [2]

      Many organizations are concerned that action from Internet Service Providers (ISPs), major
      companies or certain countries might undermine the democratic nature of the web.

      (e)   With specific reference to online retailers, discuss the concept of the democratic web and
            the consequences should this democracy be lost.                                              [6]

Option D — Object-oriented programming

10.   A large zoo has a collection of many individual animals of many different species. A computer
      program is being developed to keep track of all of the animals in the collection.

      Because there are so many different kinds of species in the collection, and each species has
      some unique characteristics and some characteristics in common with other species, it was
      decided that the computer program would contain objects that correspond to different levels of
      the taxonomy used by biologists to classify all life forms. A genus is composed of a group of
      species that have similar common characteristics, as shown in the diagram.


                                                    Genus




                           Species 1                                   Species 2




              Specimen 5               Specimen 2            Specimen 4            Specimen 6

      A separate object, Specimen, is used to represent each individual animal in the zoo.

The following code implements the Species and Specimen objects:

public class Species extends Genus
{
     private String speciesName;
     public Species( String s, String g )
     {
          super(g);
          setSpeciesName(s);
     }

      public void setSpeciesName(String s){ speciesName = s; }
      public String getSpeciesName(){ return speciesName; }
      public String toString()
      {
           return "Species: " + getGenusName() + " " + speciesName;
      }

      public boolean equals(Species s)
      {
           return speciesName.equals(s.getSpeciesName());
      }
}

public class Specimen
{
     private String name;
     private int cageNumber;
     private Species toa; // "Type Of Animal"
     public Specimen( String a, int c, Species s)
     {
          setName(a);
          setCage(c);
          setTOA(s);
     }
     public void setName(String a){ name = a; }
     public void setCage(int c){ cageNumber = c; }
     public void setTOA(Species s){ toa = s; }
     public String getName(){ return name; }
     public int getCage(){ return cageNumber; }
     public Species getTOA(){ return toa; }
     public String toString()
     {
          return name + " is a " + toa + " in cage " + cageNumber;
     }

(Option D, question 10 continued)

      (a)   State the relationship between the Genus and Species objects.                            [1]

      (b)   State the relationship between the Species and Specimen objects.                         [1]

      (c)   Construct the unified modelling language (UML) diagram for the Species object.           [4]

      (d)   Outline two ways in which the programming team can benefit from the way the
            relationships between the three objects, Specimen, Species and Genus, have been
            represented in the code.                                                                 [4]

      (e)   The Genus class implements a toString() method that produces an output string that is
            different from the one produced by the toString() method in the Species class.

            Consider the following code fragment:

            Species human = new Species ( "homo", "sapiens" );
            System.out.println( human.toString() );

            (i)    Outline why calling the toString() method in this code does not cause an error.   [2]

            (ii)   Identify the term for this property.                                              [1]

11.   (a)   Define the term encapsulation.                                                            [1]

      (b)   Outline two benefits provided by encapsulation.                                           [4]

      (c)   Identify an accessor method in the Specimen class.                                        [1]

      (d)   Identify an instance variable in the Specimen class.                                      [1]

      (e)   Construct code for the Genus object including a constructor, accessor methods and a
            toString() method.                                                                        [3]

      The Specimen object could have been designed as a sub-class of the Species object.

      (f)   Outline one advantage and one disadvantage of having the Specimen object as a
            sub-class of the Species object.                                                          [4]


12.   (a)   Outline the changes that would be needed in order to add a description of each animal’s
            individual markings to the program.                                                       [4]

      An array is used to store the Specimen objects corresponding to the animals in the zoo.

      (b)   Construct a method countSpecimens( Specimen[] animals, Species s ) that
            will output the number of specimens of the given species in the zoo.                      [8]

      (c)   Construct an algorithm in pseudocode for listSpecies( Specimen[] animals ),
            which will generate a list of the different species in the zoo.                           [6]
