Answer all questions.

1.   Outline the meaning of the following terms:

     (a)    threat landscape                                                                      [2 marks]

     (b)    whitelisting.                                                                         [2 marks]


2.   (a)    Traditionally, security systems concentrated on the inspection of traffic entering
            a network.   By making reference to specific malware, explain why Intrusion
            Prevention Systems (IPS) should scan for traffic leaving a network.                   [4 marks]

     (b)    Denial of Service (DoS) attacks are designed to overload a system, making it
            cease to function as normal.

            By looking at one particular type of DoS attack listed on page 4 of the
            Case Study, explain both how the attack is designed to interrupt the operation
            of a company network and the measure(s) that the company should take to
            counteract such attacks.                                                              [4 marks]


3.   The SSL protocol has been incorporated into the transfer of data across networks
     in order to provide an additional layer of security.   Explain how it is possible for
     man-in-the-middle attacks to successfully intercept data sent using this protocol.           [6 marks]


4.   The chief executives of the pharmaceutical company, Western Heights, decided to
     follow the lead of many major enterprises in embracing a Bring Your Own Device
     (BYOD) policy with its workforce. This decision was taken after lengthy meetings
     with its security officers, many of whom expressed doubts about the wisdom of
     such a policy.

     By including reference to the rationale behind this decision, discuss both the security
     concerns that would have been expressed by the security officers and the measures
     that should now be taken in order to ensure the safety of the company’s data taking
     into account this new policy.                                                               [12 marks]
