Subject Details: Chemistry HL Paper 2 Markscheme
Mark Allocation

Candidates are required to answer ALL questions in Section A [40 marks] and TWO questions in
Section B [2 x 25 marks]. Maximum total = [90 marks].

1.    A markscheme often has more marking points than the total allows. This is intentional.

2.    Each marking point has a separate line and the end is shown by means of a semicolon (;).

3.    An alternative answer or wording is indicated in the markscheme by a slash (/). Either wording can
      be accepted.

4.    Words in brackets ( ) in the markscheme are not necessary to gain the mark.

5.    Words that are underlined are essential for the mark.

6.    The order of marking points does not have to be as in the markscheme, unless stated otherwise.

7.    If the candidate’s answer has the same “meaning” or can be clearly interpreted as being of
      equivalent significance, detail and validity as that in the markscheme then award the mark.
      Where this point is considered to be particularly relevant in a question it is emphasized by
      OWTTE (or words to that effect).

8.    Remember that many candidates are writing in a second language. Effective communication is more
      important than grammatical accuracy.

9.    Occasionally, a part of a question may require an answer that is required for subsequent
      marking points. If an error is made in the first marking point then it should be penalized. However,
      if the incorrect answer is used correctly in subsequent marking points then follow through marks
      should be awarded. When marking, indicate this by adding ECF (error carried forward) on the
      script.

10.   Do not penalize candidates for errors in units or significant figures, unless it is specifically referred
      to in the markscheme.

11.   If a question specifically asks for the name of a substance, do not award a mark for a correct
      formula unless directed otherwise in the markscheme, similarly, if the formula is specifically asked
      for, unless directed otherwise in the markscheme do not award a mark for a correct name.

12.   If a question asks for an equation for a reaction, a balanced symbol equation is usually expected, do
      not award a mark for a word equation or an unbalanced equation unless directed otherwise in the
      markscheme.

13.   Ignore missing or incorrect state symbols in an equation unless directed otherwise in the
      markscheme.

      (iii) restricted rotation around (C=C) double bond;                             [1]

                  C                              C      ;

             The two structures must be clear 3D representations of mirror images.
             Tapered (wedge/dash) notation not necessary.

      (v)    the two enantiomers rotate the plane of plane-polarized light by equal
             amounts, but in opposite directions;
             using a polarimeter;                                                     [2]
