General Marking Instructions

   Assistant Examiners (AEs) will be contacted by their team leader (TL) through Scoris™, by e-mail
   or telephone – if through Scoris™ or by e-mail, please reply to confirm that you have downloaded
   the markscheme from IBIS. The purpose of this initial contact is to allow AEs to raise any queries
   they have regarding the markscheme and its interpretation. AEs should contact their team leader
   through Scoris™ or by e-mail at any time if they have any problems/queries regarding marking.
   For any queries regarding the use of Scoris™, please contact emarking@ibo.org.

1.   Follow the markscheme provided, award only whole marks and mark only in RED.

2.   Make sure that the question you are about to mark is highlighted in the mark panel on the
     right-hand side of the screen.

3.   Where a mark is awarded, a tick/check () must be placed in the text at the precise point where it
     becomes clear that the candidate deserves the mark. One tick to be shown for each mark awarded.

4.   Sometimes, careful consideration is required to decide whether or not to award a mark. In these
     cases use Scoris™ annotations to support your decision. You are encouraged to write comments
     where it helps clarity, especially for re-marking purposes. Use a text box for these additional
     comments. It should be remembered that the script may be returned to the candidate.

5.   Personal codes/notations are unacceptable.

6.   Where an answer to a part question is worth no marks but the candidate has attempted the
     part question, enter a zero in the mark panel on the right-hand side of the screen. Where an answer
     to a part question is worth no marks because the candidate has not attempted the part question,
     enter an “NR” in the mark panel on the right-hand side of the screen.

7.   If a candidate has attempted more than the required number of questions within a paper or section
     of a paper, mark all the answers. Scoris™ will only award the highest mark or marks in line with
     the rubric.

8.   Ensure that you have viewed every page including any additional sheets. Please ensure that you
     stamp “seen” on any page that contains no other annotation.

9.   Mark positively. Give candidates credit for what they have achieved and for what they have
     got correct, rather than penalizing them for what they have got wrong. However, a mark should not
     be awarded where there is contradiction within an answer. Make a comment to this effect using a
     text box or the “CON” stamp.

Subject Details: Environmental Systems and Societies SLP1 Markscheme

Mark Allocation

Candidates are required to answer ALL questions. Total = [45 marks].

1.    A markscheme often has more marking points than the total allows. This is intentional.

2.    Each marking point has a separate line and the end is shown by means of a semicolon (;).

3.    An alternative answer or wording is indicated in the markscheme by a slash (/). Either wording can
      be accepted.

4.    Words in brackets ( ) in the markscheme are not necessary to gain the mark.

5.    Words that are underlined are essential for the mark.

6.    The order of marking points does not have to be as in the markscheme, unless stated otherwise.

7.    If the candidate’s answer has the same “meaning” or can be clearly interpreted as being of
      equivalent significance, detail and validity as that in the markscheme then award the mark.
      Where this point is considered to be particularly relevant in a question it is emphasized by
      WTTE (or words to that effect).

8.    Remember that many candidates are writing in a second language. Effective communication is
      more important than grammatical accuracy.

9.    Occasionally, a part of a question may require an answer that is required for subsequent
      marking points. If an error is made in the first marking point then it should be penalized. However,
      if the incorrect answer is used correctly in subsequent marking points then follow through
      marks should be awarded. When marking, indicate this by adding ECF (error carried forward) on
      the script.

10.   Do not penalize candidates for errors in units or significant figures, unless it is specifically referred
      to in the markscheme.

     (b)   Reason needs to be explained fully for [3 max] eg.

           Reason (1 mark only)          Explanation (2 marks)
           where there is no social      to help on the farm/provide labour;
           security/state pension        to look after them as they get older;
           people may rely on
           children economically/
           more people in LEDCs
           rely on subsistence
           farming hence have
           more children;
           lack of finances in           lack of sexual education;
           LEDCs;                        lack of access to contraception;
           cultural/religious belief;    influence use of contraception;
                                         having more children/boys can improve status within
                                         some societies;
           economic development;         it is more expensive in MEDCs to bring up children than
                                         in LEDCs;
                                         pensions are more common in MEDCs so that people are
                                         less dependent on their children in old age and therefore
                                         have fewer children;
           health/sanitation;            improvements in LEDCs can reduce death rates and
                                         therefore contribute to population growth;
                                         due to good survival rates in MEDCs, people often have
                                         fewer children;
           empowerment/equality          due to time pursuing career/marrying later;
           rights/education of           more awareness of contraception/birth control;
           women can reduce birth        more personal/economic independence;
           rates;
           high fertility/birth rates;
                                     cultural/religious belief; need for greater work force;
                                     prestige; lack of sexual education; lack of finance for
                                     contraception;
           low death rates;          improvements in medicine/health care; improvements in
                                     sanitation;
                                     improvement in diet/ nutrition;

      expect growth rate will decline as country develops;
      population growth is required for development;

      can encourage research/funding into conservation management;

      Cons/weaknesses: [2 max]
      focused on preservation rather than conservation management;
      adversely can restrict benefit to local community;
      participation is not mandatory;
      CITES focused on individual species conservation rather than habitat loss
      (primary threat to wildlife);
      human use of wildlife can be used positively in conservation/if people benefit
      from wildlife there is an incentive to maintain wild habitats;
      enforcement can be difficult;
      trade is driven underground/black market;
      (There is some possible overlap with) UN Convention of Biological Diversity
      (focused on loss of biodiversity) takes a more comprehensive approach than
      CITES;                                                                           [4 max]
