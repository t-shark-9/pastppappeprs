This markscheme is confidential and for the exclusive use of
examiners in this examination session.

It is the property of the International Baccalaureate and must not
be reproduced or distributed to any other person without the
authorization of the IB Assessment Centre.

                                          Instructions to Examiners

Abbreviations

M     Marks awarded for attempting to use a correct Method; working must be seen.

(M)   Marks awarded for Method; may be implied by correct subsequent working.

A     Marks awarded for an Answer or for Accuracy; often dependent on preceding M marks.

(A)   Marks awarded for an Answer or for Accuracy; may be implied by correct subsequent working.

R     Marks awarded for clear Reasoning.

N     Marks awarded for correct answers if no working shown.

AG    Answer given in the question and so no marks are awarded.


Using the markscheme

1     General

      Write the marks in red on candidates’ scripts, in the right hand margin.

       Show the breakdown of individual marks awarded using the abbreviations M1, A1, etc.
       Write down the total for each question (at the end of the question) and circle it.


2     Method and Answer/Accuracy marks

       Do not automatically award full marks for a correct answer; all working must be checked, and marks
        awarded according to the markscheme.
       It is not possible to award M0 followed by A1, as A mark(s) are often dependent on the preceding
        M mark.
       Where M and A marks are noted on the same line, e.g. M1A1, this usually means M1 for an attempt to
        use an appropriate method (e.g. substitution into a formula) and A1 for using the correct values.
       Where the markscheme specifies (M2), N3, etc. do not split the marks.
       Once a correct answer to a question or part-question is seen, ignore further working.

3     N marks

      Award N marks for correct answers where there is no working.

       Do not award a mixture of N and other marks.
       There may be fewer N marks available than the total of M, A and R marks; this is deliberate as it
        penalizes candidates for not following the instruction to show their working.

4   Implied marks

    Implied marks appear in brackets e.g. (M1), and can only be awarded if correct work is seen or if implied in
    subsequent working.

     Normally the correct work is seen or implied in the next line.
     Marks without brackets can only be awarded for work that is seen.

5   Follow through marks

    Follow through (FT) marks are awarded where an incorrect answer from one part of a question is used
    correctly in subsequent part(s). To award FT marks, there must be working present and not just a final
    answer based on an incorrect answer to a previous part.

     If the question becomes much simpler because of an error then use discretion to award fewer FT marks.
     If the error leads to an inappropriate value (e.g. sin   1.5 ), do not award the mark(s) for the final
      answer(s).
     Within a question part, once an error is made, no further dependent A marks can be awarded, but M
      marks may be awarded if appropriate.
     Exceptions to this rule will be explicitly noted on the markscheme.

6   Mis-read

    If a candidate incorrectly copies information from the question, this is a mis-read (MR). Apply a MR
    penalty of 1 mark to that question. Award the marks as usual and then write –1(MR) next to the total.
    Subtract 1 mark from the total for the question. A candidate should be penalized only once for a particular
    mis-read.

     If the question becomes much simpler because of the MR, then use discretion to award fewer marks.
     If the MR leads to an inappropriate value (e.g. sin   1.5 ), do not award the mark(s) for the
      final answer(s).

7   Discretionary marks (d)

    An examiner uses discretion to award a mark on the rare occasions when the markscheme does not cover the
    work seen. The mark should be labelled (d) and a brief note written next to the mark explaining this
    decision.

8   Alternative methods

    Candidates will sometimes use methods other than those in the markscheme. Unless the question specifies a
    method, other correct methods should be marked in line with the markscheme. If in doubt, contact your team
    leader for advice.

     Alternative methods for complete questions are indicated by METHOD 1, METHOD 2, etc.
     Alternative solutions for part-questions are indicated by EITHER . . . OR.
     Where possible, alignment will also be used to assist examiners in identifying where these alternatives
      start and finish.

9    Alternative forms

     Unless the question specifies otherwise, accept equivalent forms.

      As this is an international examination, accept all alternative forms of notation.
      In the markscheme, equivalent numerical and algebraic forms will generally be written in brackets
       immediately following the answer.
      In the markscheme, simplified answers, (which candidates may not write in examinations), will generally
       appear in brackets. Marks should be awarded for either the form preceding the bracket or the form in
       brackets (if it is seen).
     Example: for differentiating f ( x)  2sin (5 x  3) , the markscheme gives:

                f  ( x)   2cos (5 x  3)  5     10cos (5 x  3)                       A1

     Award A1 for  2cos (5 x  3)  5 , even if 10cos (5 x  3) is not seen.


10   Accuracy of Answers

     The method of dealing with accuracy errors on a whole paper basis by means of the Accuracy Penalty (AP)
     no longer applies.

     Instructions to examiners about such numerical issues will be provided on a question by question basis
     within the framework of mathematical correctness, numerical understanding and contextual
     appropriateness.

     The rubric on the front page of each question paper is given for the guidance of candidates.
     The markscheme (MS) may contain instructions to examiners in the form of “Accept answers which round to
     n significant figures (sf)”. Where candidates state answers, required by the question, to fewer than n sf,
     award A0. Some intermediate numerical answers may be required by the MS but not by the question. In
     these cases only award the mark(s) if the candidate states the answer exactly or to at least 2sf.

11   Crossed out work

     If a candidate has drawn a line through work on their examination script, or in some other way crossed out
     their work, do not award any marks for that work.

12   Calculators

     A GDC is required for paper 1, but calculators with symbolic manipulation features (e.g. TI-89) are not
     allowed.

     Calculator notation
     The Mathematics HL guide says:
             Students must always use correct mathematical notation, not calculator notation.
     Do not accept final answers written using calculator notation. However, do not penalize the use of calculator
     notation in the working.

13   More than one solution

     Where a candidate offers two or more different answers to the same question, an examiner should only mark
     the first response unless the candidate indicates otherwise.

16.   (a)   the right coset containing a has the form ha h  H                         A1
                                                                                              [1 mark]

      Note: From here on condone the use of left cosets.

      (b)   let b , c be distinct elements of H . Then, given a  G , by the Latin
            square property of the Cayley table, ba and ca are distinct                  A1
            therefore each element of H corresponds to a unique element in the
            coset which must therefore contain n elements                                R1
                                                                                              [2 marks]

      (c)   let d be any element of G . Then since H contains the identity
            e , ed  d will be in a coset                                                R1
            therefore every element of G will be contained in a coset which proves
            that the union of all the cosets is G                                        R1
                                                                                              [2 marks]

      (d)   let the cosets of b and c (b , c  G ) contain a common element so that
             pb  qc where p , q  H . Let r denote any other element  H               M1
            then
             rb  rp 1qc                                                                A1
            since rp 1q  H , this shows that all the other elements are common and
            the cosets are equal                                                         R1
            since not all cosets can be equal, there must be other cosets which are
            disjoint                                                                     R1

      (e)   the above results show that G is partitioned into a number of disjoint
            subsets containing n elements so that N must be a multiple of n              R1
