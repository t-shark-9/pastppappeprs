1.    (a)   What, according to Source C, were the problems of implementing
            Wilson’s Fourteen Points?                                                     [3 marks]

             The ideas originated in America;
             They took no account of the realities, passions and suspicions of Europe raised by the
              war;
             Europe was still suffering from the war;
             Clemenceau had anxieties over Germany.

     Award [1 mark] for each relevant point up to a maximum of [3 marks].

      (b)   What is the message conveyed by Source E?                                     [2 marks]

             The crying babies and stern looks on the mothers represent Europe's competing
              claims. Their attitudes seem to indicate a certain unwillingness to cooperate;
             Wilson was acting as a judge in the baby show trying to resolve the competing
              claims. This indicates he was seen as having an important role to play;
             There were no prospects of success. This could be supported with reference to the
              caption.

     Award [1 mark] for each relevant point up to a maximum of [2 marks].

2.   Compare and contrast the views expressed in Sources B and D about Wilson
     and the Fourteen Points.                                                          [6 marks]

     For “compare”
      Both sources focus on the contradictions between Wilson's principles and the realities of
       the European situation;
      Both sources mention that Wilson hoped an international organization would solve
       disputes; the Covenant of the League of Nations is mentioned in Source B, and Source D
       refers to an international organization acting as a mediator;
      Both sources agree that the old diplomacy had its faults;
      Both sources mention a shift from the old diplomacy to the new diplomacy outlined in the
       Fourteen Points.

     For “contrast”
      Source D states Wilson encouraged ethnic groups to have their own nation states in public
       statements, but considers it unfair to blame him for tensions over self determination as
       nationalism was a force that already existed in Europe, whereas Source B indicates that he
       allowed violations to his own doctrine on this issue;
      Source B indicates that the new diplomacy would be unable to deal with threats, whereas
       Source D states that a new way to deal with international relations made sense;
      Source B allocates responsibility for the failure of the settlement to Wilson, whereas
       Source D considers that many of Europe’s problems had not been created by Wilson.

     Do not demand all of the above. If only one source is discussed award a maximum of
     [2 marks]. If the two sources are discussed separately award [3 marks] or with excellent
     linkage [4–5 marks]. For maximum [6 marks] expect a detailed running comparison/contrast.
     Award up to [5 marks] if two sources are linked/integrated in either a running comparison or
     contrast.

3.   With reference to their origin and purpose, assess the value and limitations
     of Source A and Source C for historians studying the contribution of
     Wilson’s Fourteen Points to the peacemaking process.                                [6 marks]

     Source A
     Origin:        German chancellor Prince Max of Baden’s letter to President Woodrow
                    Wilson, 6 October 1918.

     Purpose:       To request that President Wilson take diplomatic steps to restore peace and
                    start negotiations between the parties; to avoid further bloodshed by concluding
                    an armistice; to inform him that the German government accepted the Fourteen
                    Points as the basis for negotiations.

     Value:         An official communication from the German chancellor that was produced at
                    the time negotiations for an armistice were taking place. It shows that
                    Germany believed the Fourteen Points were Germany's best chance for a just
                    peace and that Wilson was central to the peacemaking process. It provides
                    evidence that in the upper echelons of the German government there was a
                    belief that the Fourteen Points could be applied.

     Limitations:   It doesn’t tell us whether or not the Fourteen Points were subsequently applied.
                    Also, because of the political instability in Germany at the time, Source A
                    cannot tell us whether this approach by the German government would
                    continue to be the negotiating policy of a possible new German government.

     Source C
     Origin:        Extract from a book written by a German professor in 1940.

     Purpose:       To assess the history of relations between Europe and Germany.

     Value:         Written by an academic, as such, the author may have had an opportunity to
                    research the topic in-depth and with hindsight. The author lived during the
                    period when the Fourteen Points were being considered.

     Limitations:   The book aims at analysing issues beyond the events of 1918–19, so treatment
                    of Wilson’s Fourteen Points may be limited; the pacifist ideology of the author;
                    the fact that it was written by a German in the context of another world war.

     Do not expect all of the above. Ideally there will be a balance between the two sources,
     and each one can be marked out of [3 marks], but allow a [4/2 marks] split. If only one
     source is assessed, mark out of [4 marks]. For a maximum of [6 marks] candidates must refer
     to both origin and purpose, and value and limitations in their assessment.

4.   “President Wilson thought he could bring peace to Europe but he
     succeeded in bringing confusion.” Using these sources and your own
     knowledge, evaluate the validity of this claim.                                       [8 marks]

     Source material
     Source A:    Wilson’s Fourteen Points played an important part in bringing an end to the
                  war and opening negotiations with Germany.

     Source B:      Wilson ignored nationalism in many areas; he did not contribute positively to
                    the reparations issue; he did not support self-determination in Austria, Hungary
                    and Germany; he deluded himself about the benefits of the Covenant of the
                    League. The new diplomacy was confronted with threats.

     Source C:      Wilson was unfamiliar with the nature of European problems, such as the
                    mistrust between France and Germany; he misguidedly thought he could
                    impose a new order on the continent. However, he contributed to raising
                    awareness about the need for a new international order to achieve a
                    lasting peace.

     Source D:      This source claims that Wilson did not play a role in the development of ethnic
                    conflicts in Europe, many of which had long term roots; it lays stress on the
                    importance of his contribution to open diplomacy and promotion of an
                    international organisation to provide collective security. Older forms of
                    diplomacy had failed.

     Source E:      The cartoon shows President Wilson, with the Fourteen Points in his hand,
                    judging the claims of the European nations. He is confronted with a difficult
                    task with no satisfactory way to resolve all the conflicting claims and
                    expectations of the different national groups.

     Own knowledge
     Own knowledge could include: analysis of Wilson’s idealism with reference to the content of
     the Fourteen Points; his efforts to address the issues that had caused the First World War;
     the part played by the conflicting aims of the remaining countries of the Big Four in making
     the terms of the Paris Peace Settlement deviate from the Fourteen Points; further details of the
     role of Clemenceau and France’s fear of Germany; the clash between self-determination and
     the conflicting territorial adjustments made (with detail of at least one conflict); the creation
     of numerous weak, small states, that contributed to instability in Europe; the issue of
     reparations; Versailles as a peace that was not “between equals”; the role played by public
     opinion in each country; the proposal to form a League of Nations to manage international
     disputes initially produced some good results; the rapid changes in Europe (revolutions, the
     collapse of governments and/or empires) acted as forces that contributed to destabilising the
     continent; although it was beyond Wilson's control, it was difficult for stability to be achieved
     without the support of the now isolationist US.

     Do not expect all the above and accept other relevant material. If only source material or own
     knowledge is used the maximum mark that can be obtained is [5 marks]. For maximum
     [8 marks] expect argument, synthesis of source material and own knowledge, as well as
     references to the sources used.
