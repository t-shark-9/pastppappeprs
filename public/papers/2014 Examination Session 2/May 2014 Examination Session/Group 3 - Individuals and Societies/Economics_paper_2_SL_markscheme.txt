           goods and the balance of trade in services, as well as net transfers and net
           income flows or for explaining that the Japanese trade deficit is negative,
           but this simply means that the other elements of the current account must
           outweigh that deficit, giving an overall surplus.

       2   The written response is accurate.                                                  3–4

       1   There is a correct diagram or an accurate written response.                        1–2
           For drawing a correctly labelled exchange rate diagram showing an increase
           in supply of the yen and a fall in the exchange rate or for an explanation that
           the Japanese authorities would enter the foreign exchange markets, buying
           foreign currencies, thus increasing the supply of their own currency in the
           market and so increasing its supply and lowering its exchange rate.

      Candidates who incorrectly label diagrams can be rewarded with a maximum of

      For an exchange rate diagram, the vertical axis may be exchange rate or yen per
      other currency. The horizontal axis should be quantity, or quantity of yen. A title
      is not necessary.

      “Discuss” requires candidates to offer a considered and balanced review that
      includes a range of arguments, factors or hypotheses. Opinions or conclusions
      should be presented clearly and supported by appropriate evidence.

      Responses may include:
       definition of appreciation
       an increasing trade in goods deficit and falling current account surplus
        (paragraph )
       an eventual current account deficit (paragraph )
       slowing economic growth (paragraph )
       the impact of outward foreign direct investment (paragraph )
       the impact on employment of firms moving their production abroad
        (paragraph )
       the short-run and long-run impacts on the balance of payments accounts of FDI
        and increased (property) income from abroad (paragraph )
       “Japanese firms are also acquiring shares in natural resource companies”
        (paragraph ) advantages of diversification
       the pressures on the government to intervene in the value of the Japanese yen
        (paragraph )
       downward pressure on inflation
       cheaper imports, with benefits for consumers and lower costs of imported raw
        materials and energy for Japanese companies
       the impact on export industries (paragraph )
       self-correcting nature of currency if it is allowed to float

 reaction from the international community of the manipulation of the currency
  by the government. Others may follow suit
 PEDx = .34 (paragraph ) export revenue should increase despite currency
  appreciation (trade in services inelastic)
 Japan has an underlying problem of an aging and decreasing population that
  should be addressed beyond currency value
 the concern that the appreciation is partly due to the yen being viewed as a
  “safe haven” (paragraph ) and therefore the financial inflows may suddenly
  be reversed.

Any reasonable discussion.

           For drawing a correctly labelled demand and supply diagram, showing a
           decrease in demand for Australian cars or for an explanation that
           appreciation of the currency makes imported cars less expensive resulting in
           a fall in demand for Australian cars, reducing the price and quantity sold.

      Candidates who incorrectly label diagrams can be rewarded with a maximum of
      [3 marks]. The use of P and Q on the axes is sufficient for a demand and supply
      diagram. A title is not necessary.

      Note: Candidates may show the supply curve shifting to the right and suggest that
      an appreciation of the currency will lead to cheaper imported raw materials and so
      lower costs for car producers. More cars would be sold at a lower price. If this is
      correctly drawn and explained, then it may be fully rewarded.

      Command term
      “Discuss” requires candidates to offer a considered and balanced review that
      includes a range of arguments, factors or hypotheses. Opinions or conclusions
      should be presented clearly and supported by appropriate evidence.

      Responses may include:
      “Global economic uncertainty”
       reduced demand for cars on a global scale hence reduced demand for
        Australian cars or supply of car parts (including exports)
       likely to require government assistance resulting in opportunity cost issues for
        government (paragraph )
       lack of “policy certainty” (paragraph ) further reduces investment in the car
        industry during time of global economic uncertainty.

      “Low trade barriers”
       “most open car market in the world” (paragraph ), facing increasing
        competition from cheaper imports
       intense competition from imports (paragraph ), which may stimulate
        innovation and cost reductions
       decision to “reduce the funding of the Green Car Innovation Fund by hundreds
        of millions of dollars” (paragraph ) reduces incentive to produce cars to
        compete with cheaper imports
       Australian producers not competing on equal terms with foreign producers
        (paragraph ). In light of this, Australian government not giving enough
        support to domestic producers according to Mr Devereux (paragraph )

 Australian innovations have been developed by foreign car manufacturers
  (paragraph ) vs developing domestically.

“Carbon Tax”
 increases production costs at a time when the industry is already suffering from
  increasingly competitive imports (paragraph ) and other problems such as a
  high dollar, low trade barriers, less government financial support and lower
  demand due to global economic uncertainty
 encourages industry to pursue cleaner production methods which are likely to
  make them more internationally competitive in long run and possibly increase
  car exports. Other countries may copy this Australian innovation
 if car makers in other countries don’t have the same carbon taxes, this will
  make the Australian car makers less competitive.

Any reasonable discussion.
