      IT system: Using cell/mobile/smart phones and online databases

      Smart phones that can be used to access the internet have become less expensive and increasingly
      popular, changing the way people shop. More and more people are using smart phones to buy goods
      that they used to buy in local stores. In China, for example, people who used smart phones to
      buy goods and services mostly bought digital products such as ringtones and games, but that has
 5    changed. Now Taobao, one of China’s most popular online shopping companies, reports that physical
      merchandise such as shoes, baby products, cosmetics, and clothing account for a large proportion of
      online sales. In China, the number of online transactions tends to peak when people are commuting
      to and from work. In fact, people can now shop anywhere.

      Many shoppers are still going to local stores as they still enjoy a shopping environment where they
10    can touch and try on goods and ask assistants for advice. However, a significant number of shoppers
      avoid salespeople, preferring to use an app (an application – typically a small specialized program
      downloaded onto mobile devices) to check the product online and frequently going on to buy it from a
      competitor at a lower price. In the UK, researchers report that “One in every three mobile (shopping)
      transactions is done while in a store.”

15    Shoppers can do this because Amazon and other sites now provide easy-to-use mobile shopping
      apps that allow shoppers to check prices, find discount coupons, and research product reviews and
      details online. The diagram below shows how Amazon’s Price Check App looks on a smart phone.

      Once they have used the app to access information about the product, shoppers can use their
      smart phone to purchase items online. They can even do this in a store if the price online is better than
20    in the store. They can also choose not to buy the product if the reviews are poor.

      In order to purchase these items online, shoppers are required to set up an account and provide
      personal information. This information is held in the store’s online database. Additional information,
      such as the shopper’s location, may be picked up from the smart phone.
