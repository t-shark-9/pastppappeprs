These sources and questions relate to the aims of the participants and peacemakers: Wilson and the
Fourteen Points.

SOURCE A                 Extract from a letter by German chancellor Prince Max of Baden to US
                         president Woodrow Wilson, 6 October 1918.

The German government requests the president of the United States of America to take steps for
the restoration of peace, to notify all belligerents [adversaries] of this request, and to invite them to delegate
diplomats for the purpose of taking up negotiations. The German government accepts, as a basis for the
peace negotiations, the program laid down by the president of the United States in his message to Congress
of 8 January 1918. In order to avoid further bloodshed the German government requests to bring about
the immediate conclusion of a general armistice on land, on water, and in the air.


SOURCE B                 Extract from Peacemaking, 1919: Being Reminiscences of the Paris Peace
                         Conference by Harold Nicolson, 1933. Harold Nicolson was a British diplomat
                         who attended the Paris Peace Conference.

[Woodrow Wilson] allowed the whole disarmament question to be limited to the one-sided disarmament
of Germany. He surrendered in Shantung, even as he surrendered on Poland. He surrendered over
the Rhineland, even as he surrendered in the Saar. On the reparation, financial and economic clauses
he exercised no beneficial influence at all, being, as he confessed, “not much interested in the economic
subjects”. He allowed the self-determination of Austria to be prohibited. He permitted the frontiers of
Germany, Austria and Hungary to be drawn in a manner which was a flagrant [blatant] violation of his own
doctrine. And he continued to maintain that his original intentions had not, in fact, been ignored – that in
the Covenant of the League could be found the blessings which he had undertaken to provide to the world
… The old diplomacy may have possessed grave faults. Yet they were minor in comparison to the threats
which confront the new diplomacy.

SOURCE C                Extract from Europe and the German Question by FW Foerster, 1940.
                        FW Foerster was a German professor at the University of Vienna and a pacifist
                        who opposed German militarism both before and after the First World War.

So far as the spirit of his ideals were concerned, Wilson was certainly right. But he overlooked the fact
that these ideas originated in America. He took no account of the realities of Europe, nor of the passions
and suspicions provoked by the war. He thought it possible to impose the new order on a Europe still
suffering from the war. Clemenceau confronted him with a more realistic language. “The French are
Germany’s nearest neighbour and liable, as in the past, to be suddenly attacked by the Germans.”

Wilson cannot be praised too highly in that he called the world’s attention to the necessity of a new
international order and pointed out that, without it, no treaty provisions could endure. Without the observance
of these [treaty provisions] it would not be long before a second catastrophe overwhelmed Europe.


SOURCE D                Extract from Lessons from History? The Paris Peace Conference of 1919,
                        a lecture delivered by historian Margaret MacMillan at the Vancouver Institute
                        on 1 October 2005.

Woodrow Wilson is sometimes blamed for creating the expectations that ethnic groups should have
their own nation states. This again is unfair. He certainly gave encouragement to the idea in his public
statements, including the Fourteen Points, but he did not create what was by now a very powerful force.
Europe had already seen how powerful nationalism and the desire of nations to have their own states
could be with both Italian and German unification. It had already seen how powerful that force could
be in the Balkans. Ethnic nationalism and the idea of self-determination for ethnic states was not
suddenly created by a few careless words from the American president … Wilson spoke for many both
in Europe and the wider world when he said that a new and more open diplomacy was needed based on
moral principles including democratic values, with respect for the rights of peoples to choose their own
governments and an international organization to mediate among nations and provide collective security
for its members. He was called dangerously naive at the time and Wilsonianism has been controversial
ever since. In the world of 1919, though, when the failure of older forms of diplomacy – secret treaties
and agreements, for example, or a balance of power as the way to keep peace – was so terribly apparent,
a new way of dealing with international relations made considerable sense.

1.    (a)   What, according to Source C, were the problems of implementing Wilson’s
            Fourteen Points?                                                        [3 marks]

      (b)   What is the message conveyed by Source E?                                         [2 marks]


2.    Compare and contrast the views expressed in Sources B and D about Wilson and the
      Fourteen Points.                                                                 [6 marks]


3.    With reference to their origin and purpose, assess the value and limitations of Source A
      and Source C for historians studying the contribution of Wilson’s Fourteen Points to the
      peacemaking process.                                                                     [6 marks]


4.    “President Wilson thought he could bring peace to Europe but he succeeded in
      bringing confusion.” Using these sources and your own knowledge, evaluate the validity
      of this claim.                                                                         [8 marks]
