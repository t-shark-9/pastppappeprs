            (iii) State the effect of rolling back a transaction.                                         [1]

      A database is to be used by a small bank to process deposits, withdrawals, account balance
      enquiries and the creation of new accounts.

      (b)   Outline two reasons for using a database for this application.                                [4]

      (c)   Explain, with examples, how this application might use data validation and data
            verification in processing a deposit.                                                         [4]

      (d)   Discuss, with an example, the importance of isolation (the ACID property) in
            this application.                                                                             [3]


2.    A company sells handmade hats online. They plan to introduce a database management system
      (DBMS) which is to be used as part of their online shop. The data the company stores for each
      hat are: size, price and the name of the person who made the hat.

      (a)   Identify the data types for the data of each hat.                                             [3]

      (b)   Identify three capabilities that must be supported by DBMS tools.                             [3]

3.    A bookstore has hired you to design a database for keeping track of their books. They have
      provided the following description:

      • each book is entered into the database with a title, an author, a publication date, a list price
            and the number of copies in the bookstore
      • each bookcase contains shelves and has an aisle number and a bookcase number
        (eg bookcase 23 has 5 shelves and is on aisle 4)
      • each shelf contains book titles
      • a sales log contains a book title, the customer name, the price paid and the date of the sale.

      (a)     Describe the characteristics of a normalized database.                                        [2]

      (b)     Outline the issues caused by redundant data.                                                  [2]

      (c)     Construct an entity-relationship diagram (ERD) for the bookstore’s database that exactly
              represents the information in the four bullet points shown above.                             [3]

      (d)     (i)    Identify a component of the ERD that is not consistent with 3rd Normal
                     Form (3NF).                                                                            [1]

              (ii)   Outline what could be done to transform the ERD into 3NF.                              [3]

      (e)     Discuss one issue related to privacy that might be raised if the data in this database were
              accessed by the police.                                                                       [3]

Option B — Modelling and simulation

4.    The amount of an antibiotic medicine given to a patient in each dose depends on the weight,
      in kg, and the age of the patient at the start of the treatment.

      The amount to be given to different patients is calculated as follows.

       Age           Amount of medicine per kg
       18 – 40       1.50 mg
       41 – 60       1.75 mg
       over 60       2 mg

      (a)   Calculate the amount in each dose to be given to a patient who is 20 years old and
            weighs 50 kg.                                                                                    [1]

      (b)   State the variables and calculation needed to model the amount required for a patient.           [2]

      Consider the case where the medicine must be given every 8 hours for a period of 10 days.

      (c)   Construct an algorithm that uses this model to create a list of days, times and amount in each
            dose to be taken by a patient, assuming that the first dose is given at 8:00 on the morning
            of day1. The list should refer to the dates as day1, day2 etc and the times should be in
            24-hour format.                                                                                  [4]

      Over time the patient’s body absorbs some of the medicine. Immediately before the
      next treatment the amount of medicine in the body is 20 % of that which was present
      immediately after the last treatment. A record needs to be kept of the amount of medicine
      which is in the body at each stage of the treatment.

      (d)   (i)    With reference to any software with which you are familiar, explain how a model
                   could be constructed to calculate the amount of medicine in the blood of a particular
                   patient immediately after each amount is given.                                           [4]

            (ii)   Identify the effect of input errors that could occur in this model.                       [1]

            (iii) Suggest a suitable way of checking the accuracy of the model.                              [3]




                                                                  (Option B continues on the following page)

5.    A new town has experienced population growth of 7 % over the past year, which is more than
      was expected. At present there are 25 000 inhabitants. For the town planner, it is important to
      predict the future population size in the town.

      (a)   State how a simulation could be set up to predict the population over the next 10 years
            using only the current rate of growth.                                                        [1]

      (b)   Identify three factors that affect population growth in a town.                               [3]

      (c)   Outline an improvement to the simulation that could be made using the three factors you
            identified in part (b).                                                                       [3]

      (d)   Discuss the accuracy of simulating population growth in this way.                             [4]

      (e)   Predict two social consequences of an inaccurate simulation of population growth in
            a town.                                                                                       [4]


6.    Computer-aided design incorporates 2D and 3D visualization. A car manufacturer decides to
      adapt a current design to include extra features. The designer starts by loading a wire frame
      version of the current design.

      (a)   Outline the way in which the wire frame graphic represents the car design.                    [2]

      (b)   (i)    Identify one change to the design of the car that could be made using the
                   wire frame.                                                                            [1]

            (ii)   Outline how the wire frame could be manipulated to make this change.                   [2]

            (iii) Outline how the designer could interact with the computer in order to achieve this.     [2]

      After changes have been made to the basic design, changes to the interior and exterior of the car
      can be made.

      (c)   Identify two changes to the interior and exterior that the designer may want to make.         [2]

      To make these changes the designer needs a different view.

      (d)   Describe the visualization techniques that would be applied to convert the wire frame to
            a 3D view of the car, as it would appear when manufactured.                                   [6]

Option C — Web science

7.    A student in the United Kingdom is viewing a page from a newspaper’s website based in
      South Africa.

      (a)   Using this example, distinguish between the internet and the World Wide Web.                [3]

      Many newspapers now host an internet version through which users can read the various
      news stories.

      (b)   Identify two other electronic ways in which newspapers provide information through the
            use of the technology brought about by the evolving web.                                    [2]

      The uniform resource locator (URL) is used to identify a specific internet resource. An example
      from an international newspaper is

                       http://www.southafricantimes.com/football/mon/rt

      (c)   By using the URL example given above, identify three characteristics of a URL.              [3]

      An HTML page from a particular website displays a form containing radio buttons.
      These buttons allow the user to choose a particular option. This option will determine the
      content of the next web page to be delivered from the website’s server.

      (d)   With direct reference to the common gateway interface (CGI), explain how this process
            takes place.                                                                                [4]

      (e)   As the number of websites continues to increase, the range of addresses also needs
            to increase. Suggest, with reasons, which protocol has been updated to allow this
            to happen.                                                                                  [3]




                                                               (Option C continues on the following page)

(Option C continued)

8.    Two new scientific magazines have been made available online.

      (a)   By making reference to both content and links, describe how a search engine using the
            HITS algorithm might produce different page rankings for the two magazines.                  [4]

      Both magazines allow content to be downloaded. This content could be text or images,
      for example.

      (b)   Outline why different compression techniques might be used for transferring
            this information.                                                                            [4]

      (c)   Explain, with an example, how the same search terms on the same search engine might
            produce different results for different users.                                               [3]

      (d)   Identify two different types of distributed systems, giving an example of how each one
            might be used.                                                                               [4]


9.    Laptops that only use cloud computing for all services and applications are now
      being marketed.

      (a)   (i)    Identify two features of this type of laptop relating to cloud computing.             [2]

            (ii)   Outline two possible disadvantages to the user of this type of laptop.                [4]

      (b)   By looking at one positive and one negative aspect, discuss the effect of the lack of
            central control of the web.                                                                  [5]

      (c)   For one example of intellectual property, evaluate one measure that has been taken for its
            protection on the web.                                                                       [4]

Option D — Object-oriented programming

A delivery company uses trains in its operations. It uses an object-oriented program to keep track of
its trains and the parcels that it carries.

The company has many objects in their program; here are some of them.

Object       Description
             Each Train is made up of RollingStock objects, each of which is either a
Train
             Wagon or an Engine.
             A RollingStock object can be an Engine (that can pull) or a Wagon (that needs
RollingStock
             to be pulled). Each RollingStock has a unique ID number and a weight.
             A variety of RollingStock. Each Engine has a maximum weight that it
Engine
             can pull.
Wagon        A variety of RollingStock. Each Wagon has a maximum cargo weight.
             Each Parcel is tagged with a tracking number, the addresses from where it came
Parcel
             (origin) and to where it is going (destination) and its weight.

The code on the following pages implements the Train class used in this program.

11.   (a)   Outline one advantage of using standard library collections.                                 [2]

      (b)   Describe two ways in which programming by a team differs from programming by an
            individual working alone.                                                                    [4]

      The following code implements the Parcel class used in the delivery company’s program.

      public class Parcel
      {
        private int trackingID;
        private double weight;
        public String destinationAddress;
        public String originAddress;
        public Parcel(int ID)
        {
           trackingID = ID;
           weight = 0;
        }
        public void setWeight(double newWeight) { weight = newWeight; }
        public double getWeight() { return weight; }
      }

      The origin and destination addresses are stored in a Parcel object as simple strings. However,
      addresses are complex and there are a lot of different pieces of information that may or may not
      be present such as a first name or a business name, in addition to house number, street name,
      city and country.

      It has been decided to create a new Address class to handle this information.

      (c)   State the appropriate data type to be used in the Address class to store

            (i)    the street name;                                                                      [1]

            (ii)   the building number;                                                                  [1]

            (iii) an indication of whether or not this is a business address.                            [1]

      (d)   Identify the changes to the Parcel class that will be needed to make use of the new
            Address class.                                                                               [3]

      Separate OriginAddress and DestinationAddress classes will be created. The destination
      address may contain special instructions to the delivery person. The origin address contains a
      variable that indicates if the parcel was collected from the customer’s house or from the local
      post office.

      (e)   Outline how these two new classes can be created with minimal duplication of code.           [3]

                                                                (Option D continues on the following page)

12.   (a)   Consider the following code fragment.

            Train A = new Train(123);
            Engine B = new Engine(7);
            A.addEngine(B);
            Wagon C = new Wagon(23);
            A.addWagon(C);
            Wagon D = new Wagon(66);
            A.addWagon(D);
            Wagon E = new Wagon(71);
            A.addWagon(E);
            A.addEngine(new Engine(9));

            (i)    Draw the mEngines array after the code fragment has been executed.                [2]

            (ii)   State the value of mEngineCount after the code fragment has been executed.        [1]

            (iii) Draw the mWagons array after both the code fragment above and the code fragment
                  below have been executed.                                                          [2]

                   Wagon F = A.removeWagon();
                   F = A.removeWagon();
                   A.addWagon(new Wagon(214));

      The parcels loaded into a wagon cannot weigh more than the capacity of the wagon. A train’s
      engines must have enough combined power to pull the loaded wagons. The company needs to
      be able to check that these requirements are being met.

      (b)   Construct the getWeight() method in the Wagon class that returns the total combined
            weight of the parcels currently in the wagon and the wagon itself.                       [4]

      (c)   Construct the getWeight() method in the Train class that returns the total combined
            weight of all the parcels, engines and wagons in a train.                                [4]

      (d)   Explain why having a getWeight() method in both the Train and Wagon classes
            does not cause a compiler error, even though the Train class does not inherit from the
            RollingStock class.                                                                      [2]
