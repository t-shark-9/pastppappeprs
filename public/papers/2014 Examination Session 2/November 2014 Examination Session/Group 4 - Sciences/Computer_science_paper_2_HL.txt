3.    A bookstore has hired you to design a database for keeping track of their books. They have
      provided the following description:

      • each book is entered into the database with a title, an author, a publication date, a list price
            and the number of copies in the bookstore
      • each bookcase contains shelves and has an aisle number and a bookcase number
        (eg bookcase 23 has 5 shelves and is on aisle 4)
      • each shelf contains book titles
      • a sales log contains a book title, the customer name, the price paid and the date of the sale.

4.    A global retailer is developing a data warehouse. The data to be available in the warehouse is
      derived from multiple sources:

      •     the retailer’s stores, all over the world
      •     their manufacturing plants in China
      •     their personnel and financial data
      •     their transport providers.

      (a)      Describe one advantage of using data warehousing for the retailer.                             [2]

      (b)      Outline the ETL processes in the data warehouse.                                               [3]

               the manufacturing plants and data from the transport providers suitable for analysis.          [4]

      (d)      By using an example of each, compare the use of associations with the use of classifications
               in discovering patterns in the data warehouse.                                                 [4]

      (e)      With the use of an example, outline the use of deviation detection in the data warehouse.      [2]

      As a result of data mining operations in its data warehouse, the retailer has discovered a specific
      pattern of purchasing which suggests that a customer is very likely to be pregnant. This pattern
      is now being used to identify customers who should be sent advertisements and discount
      coupons for items relating to babies.

      (f)      Identify two data mining techniques that might have been used to discover this pattern.        [2]

      (g)      Discuss one ethical consideration of using this advertising strategy.                          [3]

Option B — Modelling and simulation

5.    The amount of an antibiotic medicine given to a patient in each dose depends on the weight,
      in kg, and the age of the patient at the start of the treatment.

      The amount to be given to different patients is calculated as follows.

       Age           Amount of medicine per kg
       18 – 40       1.50 mg
       41 – 60       1.75 mg
       over 60       2 mg

      (a)   Calculate the amount in each dose to be given to a patient who is 20 years old and
            weighs 50 kg.                                                                                    [1]

      (b)   State the variables and calculation needed to model the amount required for a patient.           [2]

      Consider the case where the medicine must be given every 8 hours for a period of 10 days.

      (c)   Construct an algorithm that uses this model to create a list of days, times and amount in each
            dose to be taken by a patient, assuming that the first dose is given at 8:00 on the morning
            of day1. The list should refer to the dates as day1, day2 etc and the times should be in
            24-hour format.                                                                                  [4]

      Over time the patient’s body absorbs some of the medicine. Immediately before the
      next treatment the amount of medicine in the body is 20 % of that which was present
      immediately after the last treatment. A record needs to be kept of the amount of medicine
      which is in the body at each stage of the treatment.

      (d)   (i)    With reference to any software with which you are familiar, explain how a model
                   could be constructed to calculate the amount of medicine in the blood of a particular
                   patient immediately after each amount is given.                                           [4]

            (ii)   Identify the effect of input errors that could occur in this model.                       [1]

            (iii) Suggest a suitable way of checking the accuracy of the model.                              [3]




                                                                  (Option B continues on the following page)

6.    A new town has experienced population growth of 7 % over the past year, which is more than
      was expected. At present there are 25 000 inhabitants. For the town planner, it is important to
      predict the future population size in the town.

      (a)   State how a simulation could be set up to predict the population over the next 10 years
            using only the current rate of growth.                                                        [1]

      (b)   Identify three factors that affect population growth in a town.                               [3]

      (c)   Outline an improvement to the simulation that could be made using the three factors you
            identified in part (b).                                                                       [3]

      (d)   Discuss the accuracy of simulating population growth in this way.                             [4]

      (e)   Predict two social consequences of an inaccurate simulation of population growth in
            a town.                                                                                       [4]


7.    Computer-aided design incorporates 2D and 3D visualization. A car manufacturer decides to
      adapt a current design to include extra features. The designer starts by loading a wire frame
      version of the current design.

      (a)   Outline the way in which the wire frame graphic represents the car design.                    [2]

      (b)   (i)    Identify one change to the design of the car that could be made using the
                   wire frame.                                                                            [1]

            (ii)   Outline how the wire frame could be manipulated to make this change.                   [2]

            (iii) Outline how the designer could interact with the computer in order to achieve this.     [2]

      After changes have been made to the basic design, changes to the interior and exterior of the car
      can be made.

      (c)   Identify two changes to the interior and exterior that the designer may want to make.         [2]

      To make these changes the designer needs a different view.

      (d)   Describe the visualization techniques that would be applied to convert the wire frame to
            a 3D view of the car, as it would appear when manufactured.                                   [6]

      (a)   (i)    Define the term chatbot.                                                            [2]

            (ii)   Define the term supervised learning.                                                [1]

            (iii) Compare supervised and unsupervised learning in the training of a chatbot.           [3]

      As the proportion of elderly people in the community increases, robots are being developed
      to help elderly people. The tasks that the robots can do vary from household chores to
      interactive company.

      Consider a robot that is introduced to the home of an elderly person for the first time.

      (b)   (i)    Outline what is meant by cognitive learning.                                        [2]

            (ii)   Outline an advantage of a cognitive learning robot in the elderly person’s home,
                   mentioned above.                                                                    [2]

      (c)   Suggest, with an example, a form of communication between the human and the robot

Option C — Web science

9.    A student in the United Kingdom is viewing a page from a newspaper’s website based in
      South Africa.

      (a)   Using this example, distinguish between the internet and the World Wide Web.                [3]

      Many newspapers now host an internet version through which users can read the various
      news stories.

      (b)   Identify two other electronic ways in which newspapers provide information through the
            use of the technology brought about by the evolving web.                                    [2]

      The uniform resource locator (URL) is used to identify a specific internet resource. An example
      from an international newspaper is

                       http://www.southafricantimes.com/football/mon/rt

      (c)   By using the URL example given above, identify three characteristics of a URL.              [3]

      An HTML page from a particular website displays a form containing radio buttons.
      These buttons allow the user to choose a particular option. This option will determine the
      content of the next web page to be delivered from the website’s server.

      (d)   With direct reference to the common gateway interface (CGI), explain how this process
            takes place.                                                                                [4]

      (e)   As the number of websites continues to increase, the range of addresses also needs
            to increase. Suggest, with reasons, which protocol has been updated to allow this
            to happen.                                                                                  [3]

10.   Two new scientific magazines have been made available online.

      (a)   By making reference to both content and links, describe how a search engine using the
            HITS algorithm might produce different page rankings for the two magazines.                  [4]

      Both magazines allow content to be downloaded. This content could be text or images,
      for example.

      (b)   Outline why different compression techniques might be used for transferring
            this information.                                                                            [4]

      (c)   Explain, with an example, how the same search terms on the same search engine might

Option D — Object-oriented programming

A delivery company uses trains in its operations. It uses an object-oriented program to keep track of
its trains and the parcels that it carries.

The company has many objects in their program; here are some of them.

Object       Description
             Each Train is made up of RollingStock objects, each of which is either a
Train
             Wagon or an Engine.
             A RollingStock object can be an Engine (that can pull) or a Wagon (that needs
RollingStock
             to be pulled). Each RollingStock has a unique ID number and a weight.
             A variety of RollingStock. Each Engine has a maximum weight that it
Engine
             can pull.
Wagon        A variety of RollingStock. Each Wagon has a maximum cargo weight.
             Each Parcel is tagged with a tracking number, the addresses from where it came
Parcel
             (origin) and to where it is going (destination) and its weight.

The code on the following pages implements the Train class used in this program.

            individual working alone.                                                                    [4]

      The following code implements the Parcel class used in the delivery company’s program.

      public class Parcel
      {
        private int trackingID;
        private double weight;
        public String destinationAddress;
        public String originAddress;
        public Parcel(int ID)
        {
           trackingID = ID;
           weight = 0;
        }
        public void setWeight(double newWeight) { weight = newWeight; }
        public double getWeight() { return weight; }
      }

      The origin and destination addresses are stored in a Parcel object as simple strings. However,
      addresses are complex and there are a lot of different pieces of information that may or may not
      be present such as a first name or a business name, in addition to house number, street name,
      city and country.

      It has been decided to create a new Address class to handle this information.

      (c)   State the appropriate data type to be used in the Address class to store

            (i)    the street name;                                                                      [1]

            (ii)   the building number;                                                                  [1]

            (iii) an indication of whether or not this is a business address.                            [1]

      (d)   Identify the changes to the Parcel class that will be needed to make use of the new
            Address class.                                                                               [3]

      Separate OriginAddress and DestinationAddress classes will be created. The destination
      address may contain special instructions to the delivery person. The origin address contains a
      variable that indicates if the parcel was collected from the customer’s house or from the local
      post office.

      (e)   Outline how these two new classes can be created with minimal duplication of code.           [3]

16.   (a)   Consider the following code fragment.

            Train A = new Train(123);
            Engine B = new Engine(7);
            A.addEngine(B);
            Wagon C = new Wagon(23);
            A.addWagon(C);
            Wagon D = new Wagon(66);
            A.addWagon(D);
            Wagon E = new Wagon(71);
            A.addWagon(E);
            A.addEngine(new Engine(9));

            (i)    Draw the mEngines array after the code fragment has been executed.                 [2]

            (ii)   State the value of mEngineCount after the code fragment has been executed.         [1]

            (iii) Draw the mWagons array after both the code fragment above and the code fragment
                  below have been executed.                                                           [2]

                   Wagon F = A.removeWagon();
                   F = A.removeWagon();
                   A.addWagon(new Wagon(214));

      The parcels loaded into a wagon cannot weigh more than the capacity of the wagon. A train’s
      engines must have enough combined power to pull the loaded wagons. The company needs to
      be able to check that these requirements are being met.

      (b)   Construct the getWeight() method in the Wagon class that returns the total combined
            weight of the parcels currently in the wagon and the wagon itself.                        [4]

      (c)   Construct the getWeight() method in the Train class that returns the total combined
            weight of all the parcels, engines and wagons in a train.                                 [4]

      (d)   Explain why having a getWeight() method in both the Train and Wagon classes
            does not cause a compiler error, even though the Train class does not inherit from the
            RollingStock class.                                                                       [2]

(Option D continued)

17.   The static array used to store Wagon objects in the Train class is to be replaced by a linked list
      of Wagon objects.

      (a)   Without writing detailed code, identify the changes that will need to be made.                 [3]

      (b)   Without the use of library functions, construct the addWagon() method in the Train
            class to add a Wagon object at the beginning of the linked list.                               [3]

      (c)   Describe how a method to remove a particular wagon would be implemented.                       [5]

      The wagons have a single door so the first parcel loaded into a wagon is the last one to
      be unloaded.

      (d)   Identify a dynamic abstract data structure that would be appropriate to model the storage
            of parcels in a wagon.                                                                         [1]

      (e)   The Wagon class has been modified to include an object named model which is an instance
            of the abstract data structure identified in (d). Construct code for the following methods
            in the Wagon class using this new object.

            (i)    addParcel()                                                                             [2]

            (ii)   getParcel()                                                                             [2]

      (f)   Explain the importance of style and naming conventions in code.                                [4]
