Option D — Evolution

1.   (a)   as nitrogen levels increase so does epidemic size / positive correlation
           /relationship                                                                                      [1]

     (b)          increases in nitrogen means more food/phytoplankton (for D. dentifera/ Daphnia);
                  more food means a bigger D. dentifera/Daphnia population;
                  a bigger D. dentifera/Daphnia population leads to more infection (by the
                  parasite);                                                                              [2 max]

     (c)          high epidemic sizes associated with higher populations of D. dentifera/Daphnia;
                  the greater the population of D. dentifera/Daphnia, the greater the possibility
                  of variation/mutations in population;
                  some of the variations may include greater resistance to the parasite;
                  (resistant strains) have a greater chance of reproducing/produce more offspring;
                  (leads to) selection in favour of resistant strains / death of non resistant strains;   [2 max]

     (d)          the resistant strains of D. dentifera/Daphnia will increase;
                  predators eating the infected D. dentifera/Daphnia reduce the epidemic;
                  the resistant strains of D. Daphnia lose their adaptive advantage;                      [2 max]


2.   (a)          fossils are rare / fossilization is rare;
                  fossil record is incomplete / fossils may not be representative of the species;
                  some parts of organisms do not fossilize / only part of organisms found;
                  dating of fossils is only approximate / OWTTE;                                          [2 max]

     (b)   the half-life is the time taken for half the parent atoms to decay to the daughter
           atoms / OWTTE                                                                                      [1]

           (ii)     there is very little carbon-14 left after 50 000 years / OWTTE                            [1]

     (d)                             genetic                                     cultural

     classification was traditionally based on morphology;
     morphology is still important in cladistics for fossil species;
     cladistics is also based on molecular differences/base sequences/amino acid sequences;
     cladistics is based on probability/the Principle of Parsimony/Occam’s razor;
     but improbable events do occur, so relationships can be wrong;
     cladistics allow predictions to be made;
     but a common ancestor may not have existed/diverging species may hybridize;
     classification based on cladograms often give the same result as traditional classification;
     in some groups cladograms have led to revised classification;                                [6 max]

     (e)      the expression of (neurotransmitter) genes that encourage scouting in bees vary;
              those bees showing scouting behaviour will find more food sources;
