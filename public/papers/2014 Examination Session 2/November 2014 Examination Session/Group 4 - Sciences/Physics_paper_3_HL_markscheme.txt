Subject Details: Physics HL Paper 3 Markscheme
Mark Allocation

Candidates are required to answer questions from TWO of the Options [2 × 30 marks].
Maximum total = [60 marks].

1.    A markscheme often has more marking points than the total allows. This is intentional.

2.    Each marking point has a separate line and the end is shown by means of a semicolon (;).

3.    An alternative answer or wording is indicated in the markscheme by a slash (/). Either wording can
      be accepted.

4.    Words in brackets ( ) in the markscheme are not necessary to gain the mark.

5.    Words that are underlined are essential for the mark.

6.    The order of marking points does not have to be as in the markscheme, unless stated otherwise.

7.    If the candidate’s answer has the same “meaning” or can be clearly interpreted as being of
      equivalent significance, detail and validity as that in the markscheme then award the mark.
      Where this point is considered to be particularly relevant in a question it is emphasized by
      OWTTE (or words to that effect).

8.    Remember that many candidates are writing in a second language. Effective communication is
      more important than grammatical accuracy.

9.    Occasionally, a part of a question may require an answer that is required for subsequent
      marking points. If an error is made in the first marking point then it should be penalized. However, if
      the incorrect answer is used correctly in subsequent marking points then follow through marks
      should be awarded. When marking indicate this by adding ECF (error carried forward) on the script.

10.   Do not penalize candidates for errors in units or significant figures, unless it is specifically referred
      to in the markscheme.

Option E — Astrophysics

1.   (a)   stars of stellar cluster are close together (in space)/bounded gravitationally;
           stars of constellations are not bounded gravitationally/appear to be close together
           (from Earth);                                                                            [2]

     (b)   the stars rise in the east/northeast/southeast and set in the west/northwest/southwest
           (moving in an arc across the sky) / a description of arcs (as if rotating) in
           clockwise/anticlockwise direction / OWTTE;                                               [1]
           An answer such as “move like Sun” is not sufficient for the mark.
           Accept answers based in either hemisphere.


2.   (a)   (i)    Alnilam must be further away from Earth than Bellatrix;
                  Alnilam has greater luminosity with a more negative absolute magnitude /
                  absolute magnitude is a measure of how bright the star is if it is positioned
                  10 pc away from Earth (and apparent magnitude is a measure of how bright the
                  star is from Earth) / OWTTE;                                                      [2]

                  months apart/January to July;

                  the distance of Alnilam cannot be determined (from Earth) using stellar

                  determined by parallax due to recent improvements (in astrophysics);              [3]

3.   (a)   (an infinite) universe can be split into an infinite number of thin shells with diameter
           of r (with Earth in the centre);
           the number of stars in each shell is proportional to r 2 and the brightness of each star
           is inversely proportion to r 2 ;
           this means that each shell is equally bright (as seen from Earth);                             [3]

     (b)   the temperature has cooled considerably since the Big Bang / the Big Bang model
           predicted cooling and the present temperature;
           this cooling was caused by the expansion of the universe/the stretching of spacetime;          [2]

     (c)   the Big Bang suggests that the universe had a starting point in time;
           light from distant stars has been red-shifted beyond the visible spectrum;
           light from distant stars has not yet reached us;
           the universe has a finite number of stars;                                                 [2 max]

     (b)   Phi-1 Orionis has a larger mass so it has a larger gravitational pressure;
           to remain in equilibrium it requires (an equal) radiation pressure which is provided
           by burning (hydrogen) at a faster rate;                                                        [2]

           most of Earth’s surface receives coverage at regular intervals;
           orbit is closer to Earth so more detail/better resolution can be obtained;
           disadvantage: [1 max]
           Polar orbiting satellite has:
           no fixed position so tracking is required;
           unable to maintain permanent link with satellite from one point on the Earth;
           close orbit so smaller area covered at any one time;                                    [2 max]

     (c)   the transmitter will affect the receiver if on the same frequency;
           the different frequencies prevent resonance occurring between transmitting and
           receiving devices;
           the lower frequency for the down-link allows for it to be transmitted more energy-
           efficiently from the satellite;
           different frequencies mean that the high power signal being transmitted from Earth
           does not drown out the weak signal received from the satellite;                    [1 max]

                    required to provide sufficient contrast between the muscle and the blood;
                    this is too small to provide a clear difference on the X-ray film;                      [2]
