Figure 5a                 Information on the Niger Delta tropical swamp forest biome

y Forms on low lying coastal delta from sediment deposited by the Niger river.
y Over 80 % of the delta floods seasonally. Swamps remain when flood waters drain away.
y Important role in the global economy (through the slave trade, palm oil trade and now fossil fuels) over
  the last 400 years.
y Conservation Status of selected organisms: Critical/Endangered.
y Flora and Fauna only systematically surveyed since 1980s.
y Endemic species such as red colobus (Procolobus badius epieni) and Heslop’s pygmy hippopotamus
  (Hexaprotodon liberiensis heslopi).
y Delta believed to be a meeting point for chimpanzee populations.
y Includes 75 % of Africa’s remaining mangrove forests.
y Swamp forests have no large scale formal protection, although crocodiles and chimpanzees receive
  some protection.

Figure 6a       Environmental threats in the Niger delta

yy Over 1.5 million tonnes of oil spilt in the delta over the past 50 years, polluting water sources, damaging
   crops and fishing grounds. The delta is one of the five most polluted spots on Earth.
yy More than 20 000 hectares of mangroves have been destroyed by oil exploration.
yy Natural gas from the oil fields is burnt off as flares. Hundreds of flares have burned for many years
   potentially causing acid deposition and global warming.
yy Limited access to electricity, fresh water or health care.
yy The oil industry provides very few jobs.
yy Improving transport in the delta has enabled other Nigerians to exploit the timber and fish resources.
   This has led to overfishing, habitat loss, overhunting and clashes between ethnic groups. Once common
   Abura trees are almost completely gone.
yy Rightfully or not, local people hold the oil industry responsible for environmental damage to the
   Niger delta. Oil pipelines and facilities are regularly attacked and oil company employees must live in
   heavily guarded compounds.

Figure 7a        Ogoniland and the Ogoni people

A recent UN report on pollution of Ogoniland called for a US$1 billion clean-up fund to be set up to restore
the environment.

The investigation found:
yy Drinking water with dangerous concentrations of benzene and other pollutants.
yy Soil contamination more than five metres deep.
yy Failure by oil companies to meet their own or Nigerian minimum standards.
yy Most of the spill sites claimed to have been cleaned by oil firms still highly contaminated.

The Ogoni People

yy Fish and farm (yam and cassava).
yy Worship the land and rivers as God.
yy “Tradition” in the local language means the honouring of the land.
yy Believe that the soul of every human being has the ability to leave its human form and enter into that of
   an animal. Certain animals are protected for this reason.
yy Set up an environmental pressure group in 1990 to campaign against degradation of the environment.
yy During their non-violent campaign, Ken Saro-Wiwa, their President, was arrested, tried and hanged
   in 1995. His death caused international outrage.
