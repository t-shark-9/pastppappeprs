General Marking Instructions

 Assistant Examiners (AEs) will be contacted by their team leader (TL) through Scoris™, by e-mail
 or telephone – if through Scoris™ or by e-mail, please reply to confirm that you have downloaded
 the markscheme from IBIS. The purpose of this initial contact is to allow AEs to raise any queries
 they have regarding the markscheme and its interpretation. AEs should contact their team leader
 through Scoris™ or by e-mail at any time if they have any problems/queries regarding marking.
 For any queries regarding the use of Scoris™, please contact emarking@ibo.org.

1.   Follow the markscheme provided, award only whole marks and mark only in RED.

2.   Make sure that the question you are about to mark is highlighted in the mark panel on the
     right-hand side of the screen.

3.   Where a mark is awarded, a tick/check () must be placed in the text at the precise point where it
     becomes clear that the candidate deserves the mark. One tick to be shown for each mark awarded.

4.   Sometimes, careful consideration is required to decide whether or not to award a mark. In these
     cases use RM Assessor™ annotations to support your decision. You are encouraged to write
     comments where it helps clarity, especially for re-marking purposes. Use a text box for these
     additional comments. It should be remembered that the script may be returned to the candidate.

5.   Personal codes/notations are unacceptable.

6.   Where an answer to a part question is worth no marks but the candidate has attempted the
     part question, enter a zero in the mark panel on the right-hand side of the screen. Where an answer
     to a part question is worth no marks because the candidate has not attempted the part question,
     enter an “NR” in the mark panel on the right-hand side of the screen.

7.   If a candidate has attempted more than the required number of questions within a paper or section
     of a paper, mark all the answers. RM Assessor™ will only award the highest mark or marks in line
     with the rubric.

8.   Ensure that you have viewed every page including any additional sheets. Please ensure that you
     stamp ‘seen’ on any page that contains no other annotation.

9.   Mark positively. Give candidates credit for what they have achieved and for what they have
     got correct, rather than penalizing them for what they have got wrong. However, a mark should not
     be awarded where there is contradiction within an answer. Make a comment to this effect using a
     text box or the “CON” stamp.

Subject Details: Environmental Systems and Societies SLP1 Markscheme

Mark Allocation

Candidates are required to answer ALL questions. Total = [45 marks].

1.    A markscheme often has more marking points than the total allows. This is intentional.

2.    Each marking point has a separate line and the end is shown by means of a semicolon (;).

3.    An alternative answer or wording is indicated in the markscheme by a slash (/). Either wording can
      be accepted.

4.    Words in brackets ( ) in the markscheme are not necessary to gain the mark.

5.    Words that are underlined are essential for the mark.

6.    The order of marking points does not have to be as in the markscheme, unless stated otherwise.

7.    If the candidate’s answer has the same “meaning” or can be clearly interpreted as being of
      equivalent significance, detail and validity as that in the markscheme then award the mark.
      Where this point is considered to be particularly relevant in a question it is emphasized by
      OWTTE (or words to that effect).

8.    Remember that many candidates are writing in a second language. Effective communication is
      more important than grammatical accuracy.

9.    Occasionally, a part of a question may require an answer that is required for subsequent
      marking points. If an error is made in the first marking point then it should be penalized. However,
      if the incorrect answer is used correctly in subsequent marking points then follow through
      marks should be awarded. When marking, indicate this by adding ECF (error carried forward) on
      the script.

10.   Do not penalize candidates for errors in units or significant figures, unless it is specifically referred
      to in the markscheme.

5.   (a)   Must include: clear arrows with processes attached
           Award [1 mark] for 2 arrows correctly labelled.




           Only credit arrow labelled with process (not storages).
           Allow any other reasonable arrow with process.                                          [3 max]

     (b)   transfer is the movement/change in location of nitrogen in the cycle;
           whereas transformation is chemical conversion/change of state of nitrogen in
           the cycle;
           [1 max] if there is no reference made to the nitrogen cycle but student
           distinguishes between transfer and transformation process.
           Accept examples of each process such as examples given below

           Transfer [1 max]:
           nitrates from soil to roots of plants;
           movement of nitrogen in plants to nitrogen in animals;

           Transformations [1 max]:
           bacteria convert one form of nitrogen to another;
           ammonium to nitrite;
           nitrite to nitrate;
           denitrification from ammonium/nitrate to N2;                                            [2 max]

     (c)   use of Haber process to produce fertilizers / addition of nitrogen fertilizers/manure
           to soil;
           addition/removal of nitrogen fixing plants in agriculture monocultures;
           removal of crops without addition of fertilizers (loss of nitrogen in cycle for a
           particular area) / removal of plants/crops resulting in reduction of nitrogen in
           the soil;
           addition of nitrogen compounds to the atmosphere by combustion of fossil fuels;         [2 max]

6.   (a)   more people in world and so less freshwater to share;
           freshwater being used from fossil resources/aquifers at unsustainable rate;
           development needs more/uses more water;
           global warming is making some areas drier;
           pollution of freshwater is limiting available source;
           rivers cross international boundaries;
           uneven distribution of water leaving some areas with a limited/insufficient supply;
           control of water means control of agriculture/agriculture profit/food
           resources;
           Award [2 max] where one reason is explained in sufficient depth.
           Also credit responses that cover two valid reasons.
           Do not award marks where a reason for water scarcity is not given.                    [2 max]

     (b)   increase the cost of water;
           public education programmes;
           promote use of water efficient goods;
           incentive schemes for replacing water wasting devices with water saving ones;
           metering water use;
           fines for wasting water;
           bans on hoses/washing cars etc/restrictions of date and time of using hoses;
           encouraging/incentives for the use of low water use plants in gardens;
           Do not award marks for actions such as “have showers instead of baths” without
           explanation of how that is achieved.                                                  [1 max]

     (c)   Technocentric would apporove of a dam [1 mark]:
           as a technological solution for collecting and storing water;
           large scale and supplies many people/areas;
           the reservoir can be used by many groups for a variety of activities;
           Ecocentric would oppose new dams [1 mark]:
           as they would prefer smaller/local water storage solutions;
           would prefer recycling and using less water and therefore avoid the need for
           dams;
           would consider dams as interrupting environments downstream /reducing flow;
           Do not accept only “technocentric support dams and ecocentric oppose dams.”           [2 max]
