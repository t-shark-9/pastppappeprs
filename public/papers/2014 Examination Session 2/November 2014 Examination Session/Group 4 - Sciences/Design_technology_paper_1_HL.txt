Questions 36–40 relate to the following case study. Please read the case study carefully and answer
the questions.

Design student, Quentin Debaene, won the James Dyson Design Award for creating “a product which
solves a problem of everyday life”. Quentin’s design was for the “Airblow 2050” – an invisible umbrella –
which seeks to overcome the problems associated with the use of traditional umbrellas (Figure 12) – most
of which relate to the use of the fabric. Through a process that Quentin referred to as ideation (Figure 13)
he developed the design for the “Airblow 2050” (Figure 14) which uses a small motor in its handle to blow
out air from the top of the tube and push the rain away, keeping its user dry.
