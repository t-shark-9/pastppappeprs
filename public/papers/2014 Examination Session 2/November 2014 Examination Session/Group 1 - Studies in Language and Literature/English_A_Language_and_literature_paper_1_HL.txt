Text A

                                              Sunday 2 September 1666

            (Lord’s day). Some of our mayds sitting up late last night to get things ready against our feast
            to-day, Jane called us up about three in the morning, to tell us of a great fire they saw in the City.1
            So I rose and slipped on my nightgowne, and went to her window, and thought it to be on the
            backside of Marke-lane at the farthest; but, being unused to such fires as followed, I thought it
      5     far enough off; and so went to bed again and to sleep. About seven rose again to dress myself,
            and there looked out at the window, and saw the fire not so much as it was and further off. So to
            my closett to set things to rights after yesterday’s cleaning. By and by Jane comes and tells me
            that she hears that above 300 houses have been burned down to-night by the fire we saw, and that
            it is now burning down all Fish-street, by London Bridge.2 So I made myself ready presently,
     10     and walked to the Tower and there got up upon one of the high places, […] and there I did see the
            houses at that end of the bridge all on fire, and an infinite great fire on this and the other side the
            end of the bridge. […] So down, with my heart full of trouble, to the Lieutenant of the Tower,
            who tells me that it begun this morning in the King’s baker’s house in Pudding-lane, and that it
            hath burned St. Magnus’s Church and most part of Fish-street already. So I [went] down to the
     15     waterside, and there got a boat, and there saw a lamentable fire. Poor Michell’s house, as far as
            the Old Swan, already burned that way, and the fire running further, that in a very little time it got
            as far as the Steelyard, while I was there. Everybody endeavouring to remove their goods, and
            flinging into the river or bringing them into lighters3 that layoff; poor people staying in their houses
            as long as till the very fire touched them, and then running into boats, or clambering from one pair
     20     of stairs by the waterside to another. And among other things, the poor pigeons, I perceive, were
            loth4 to leave their houses, but hovered about the windows and balconys till they were, some of
            them burned, their wings, and fell down. […]

            So I was called for, and did tell the King and Duke of Yorke what I saw, and that unless his
            Majesty did command houses to be pulled down nothing could stop the fire. They seemed
     25     much troubled, and the King commanded me to go to my Lord Mayor from him, and command
            him to spare no houses, but to pull down before the fire every way. […] And walked along
            Watling-street, as well as I could, every creature coming away loaden with goods to save, and here
            and there sicke people carried away in beds. Extraordinary good goods carried in carts and
            on backs. At last met my Lord Mayor in Canning-street, like a man spent, with a handkercher
     30     about his neck. To the King’s message he cried, like a fainting woman, “Lord! what can I do?
            I am spent: people will not obey me. I have been pulling down houses; but the fire overtakes us
            faster than we can do it.”

            Having seen as much as I could now, I […] walked to my boat; and there upon the water again,
            and to the fire up and down, it still encreasing, and the wind great. So near the fire as we could
    35      for smoke; and all over the Thames, with one’s face in the wind, you were almost burned with a
            shower of firedrops. […] As it grew darker, [the fire] appeared more and more, and in corners and
            upon steeples, and between churches and houses, as far as we could see up the hill of the City, in a
            most horrid malicious bloody flame, not like the fine flame of an ordinary fire.
