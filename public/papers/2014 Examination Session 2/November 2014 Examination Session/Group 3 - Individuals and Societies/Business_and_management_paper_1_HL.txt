                                               SECTION C

Answer the compulsory question from this section.

5.    Martin Kimathi received shocking news: GP had sold The Imperial to the National Wealth Fund
      (NWF) of Kumali, a small Arabian country.

      NWF representatives told Martin that as long as he agreed to assist them in bringing about the changes
      that were best for NWF, he could keep his job for at least three years.

      NWF is considering the following two strategies:

      Modified Option 1: extensively upgrade The Imperial in order to make it one of the most luxurious
      hotels in Africa. Although this strategy is similar to Option 1, the renovation of the hotel would be
      to a much higher standard. Martin read a consultant’s engineering report (Item 1) indicating that The
      Imperial would be closed for 18 months for the renovation.

      To implement modified Option 1, NWF representatives would need Martin to do the following:
      • promote Susan Chapman to Assistant Manager.
      • dismiss all other employees within 60 days.
      • develop a workforce plan according to NWF Human Resources Guidelines (Item 2).

      Modified Option 2: half the hotel would be converted to apartments for sale, all the spare land
      converted to a golf course, and the other half of the hotel kept open as a hotel which would be
      gradually renovated over 9 months. Martin and Susan would keep their current jobs. Around half
      of the remaining employees would be made redundant. The other half could keep their jobs during
      the renovations, but their positions would be reviewed after 6 months according to NWF Human
      Resources Guidelines (Item 2).



                                                           (This question continues on the following page)

(Question 5 continued)

      (a)   Copy the network diagram from Item 1 and identify the critical path.                    [2 marks]

      (b)   With reference to Item 1:

            (i)    explain the purpose of the dummy activity X.                                     [2 marks]

            (ii)   calculate the free float and the total float for activity B.                     [2 marks]

      (c)   Using information from Item 3, calculate:

            (i)    the average rate of return for the six-year forecast for modified Option 1
                   (show all your working).                                                         [2 marks]

            (ii)   the payback period for modified Option 2.                                         [1 mark]

      (d)   Analyse NWF’s human resource plan for The Imperial.                                     [9 marks]

            NWF which modified Option 1 or 2 should they implement.                               [12 marks]

Additional Information

Item 1: Engineering report for modified Option 1

Our calculations suggest that the minimum possible time required to complete the renovations is
18 months, as shown in the critical path analysis below:


                             A             7              C               11   F
                                    2                                 4
                                           7                              11

                                               X                 D
                         0                                 7                        18
                    1                                 3                         5
                         0          B                      8         E              18


We also recommend that, because of the noise and disruption that will occur during the renovations, the
hotel should close throughout that period. This will help the contractors meet the deadlines.

Key to activities on critical path analysis above:

                              Activity             Order/Dependency           Duration
                                 A                                            7 months
                                 B                 Can be done same time as A 4 months
                                 C                 Must follow A              4 months
                                 D                 Must follow A and B        3 months
                                 E                 Must follow A and B        5 months
                                 F                 Must follow C and D        7 months
                             End project           E and F completed

Item 4: Kenya tourism facts


  There are now over 1 million foreign tourists a year, recent growth was 15 % per annum.
  There is an 18 % growth in hotel revenues.
  Kenya won a prestigious “Best Undiscovered Golf Destination” award with excellent all year round
    weather, good golf courses and opportunities to combine a golfing holiday with safaris, white sandy
    beaches and good food.

                                   Adapted from www.kenya-golf-safaris.com and www.tourism.go.ke



Item 5: Extract from a newspaper report on the Kenyan housing market

  Apartment prices are increasing rapidly due largely to multinational corporations and international
    non-governmental organizations (NGOs) opening offices in Kenya.
  There are growing numbers of middle income Kenyans seeking quality property.
  However, recovering property markets elsewhere in the world could attract investment money away
    from Kenyan property.
  Likely rises in interest rates may make property less affordable.
