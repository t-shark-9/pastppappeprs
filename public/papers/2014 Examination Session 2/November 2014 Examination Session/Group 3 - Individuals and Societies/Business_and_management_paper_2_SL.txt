                                                SECTION A

Answer one question from this section.

1.    Suparman Fish (SF)

      Gepa Suparman owns and operates four fishing boats in Indonesia. There is a growing demand for
      canned (tinned) food, including cans of fish. Gepa wants to enter the secondary sector by opening a
      small factory producing cans of fish.

      Gepa’s business will be called Suparman Fish (SF) and will be a private limited company.
      Gepa will own all of the shares. The factory will be located in a village three miles from the harbour.
      Because unemployment is high in the village, Gepa should easily find workers for the new factory.
      In addition to the manager’s salary, workers’ wages, and the cost of fish, supplies, and cans, SF will
      have the semi-variable cost of electricity.

      Gepa has prepared a four-month cash-flow forecast based on the following information:
      • opening balance month 1: $15 000.
      • month 1: sales revenue of $1000, increasing by 20 % per month.
      • manager’s salary: $300 per month.
      • workers’ wages: $175 per worker per month.

       Month                     1       2      3       4
       Number of workers         2       3      4       5

      • variable costs (fish, supplies, and cans) are equal to 40 % of sales revenue.
      • semi-variable cost of electricity: fixed cost of $100 per month, plus a variable cost of $0.10 per
        kilowatt hour (kwh). Month 1 usage: 100 kwh, increasing by 10 % each month.

      Although SF would create several jobs in the village, many residents are not happy about the new
      factory. The new factory would use chemicals, which cause pollution. Residents are concerned
      about the unpleasant smells from the factory. A representative from the local employment office is
      concerned whether Gepa’s factory will provide a safe working environment.


      (a)   (i)    Define the term secondary sector.                                              [2 marks]

            (ii)   Identify two advantages to SF of being a private limited company.              [2 marks]

      (b)   Explain why electricity is a semi-variable cost for SF.                               [2 marks]

      (c)   Prepare a monthly cash-flow forecast for SF for the first four months of operation. [6 marks]

      (d)   Calculate SF’s forecast net profit for the first four months of operation (show all
            your working).                                                                        [2 marks]

      (e)   Calculate SF’s forecast net profit margin for the first four months of operation.      [1 mark]

      (f)   Examine two potential stakeholder conflicts when Gepa opens his factory.              [5 marks]

2.    Raapin Guitars (RG)

      Raapin Guitars (RG) manufactures guitars in Finland. Over many decades, it has built a reputation
      for producing high quality, handmade guitars. Apprentices* are recruited when they are 16 or 17
      years old. Each apprentice completes a seven-year training program. They are then considered
      “professional craftsmen” and can expect permanent careers at RG. Each craftsman works with two
      apprentices to produce high-quality guitars using a batch production method.

      Last year, RG sold 4920 guitars at an average price of €1200 each. It employed 42 professional
      craftsmen earning €50 000 per year and one manager earning €70 000 per year.

       Other                                   15

      Recently, RG has struggled to recruit talented teenagers for the apprentice program. Most teenagers
      in Finland complete secondary school and go to university. Many of them graduate as engineers
      and design technologists. As a consequence, Anni Raapin, Chief Executive Officer (CEO) of RG,
      is considering changing the overall production process at RG. She wants to change from a traditional
      batch production process using professional craftsmen, to an automated flow production process led
      by two highly trained engineers. These engineers will manage the new production process operated
      by low-skilled workers.

      Even if RG changes to this new production process, the professional craftsmen will not be made
      redundant. The oldest craftsmen will be offered early retirement. Others will become managers
      of the new flow production process; the youngest ones will become low-skilled workers. As the
      craftsmen retire, they will be replaced by workers who have not trained as apprentices and have no
      knowledge of the traditional batch production process. These new workers will be paid half the salary
      of the previous professional craftsmen.


      * apprentice: typically a young person between 15 and 25 years old, who is learning a trade or occupation.


                                                                          (This question continues on the following page)

Answer two questions from this section.

3.    SGS

      SGS operates a worldwide delivery business. SGS’s aim is to deliver all packages on time, at low
      prices, anywhere in the world. Its Chief Executive Officer (CEO) Jean-Paul Lominé is known even
      by customers as an autocratic leader. Twice a year he sets prices and targets for costs and customer
      satisfaction.

      SGS has three main competitors, Company A, B and C.

                              Perception             Perception of
                              of price               reliability
       SGS                    Low                    Medium
       Company A              Medium                 High
       Company B              Low                    Low
       Company C              High                   High

      Primary market research revealed that customers value delivery on time, but many would pay higher
      prices for a more environmentally friendly service. It also showed that customers did not know
      whether SGS followed socially responsible “green” (environmentally friendly) practices. Customers
      also believed that the company’s current autocratic leadership style did not fit with “green” practices.

      Jean-Paul decided to change his leadership style from autocratic to situational*. He wrote a new aim
      for SGS: to make it the world’s greenest delivery company. He ordered the Operations Department to
      recommend possible strategies. The Operations Department suggested two:
      • purchase new, energy-efficient airplanes
      • adopt new software to set fuel-saving air routes.

      The Finance Department calculated that purchasing new airplanes would be a significant cost
      resulting in higher prices to customers. Tactically SGS would purchase a new airplane each time an
      existing airplane required significant expenditure to keep it flying. Adopting new software would
      require major computer upgrades, but the cost of the investment would be quickly recovered from
      fuel savings. The Marketing Director reported to Jean-Paul that if customers did not realize that
      SGS was now more environmentally friendly, they might think that it had only increased prices.
      Jean-Paul, however, refused to listen to the Marketing Director.



      * situational: style of leadership that is also called situation leadership



                                                                               (This question continues on the following page)

(Question 3 continued)

      (a)   Identify two methods of primary market research that SGS may have used.             [2 marks]

      (b)   Using information from the table, construct a fully labelled position/perception
            map of SGS and its three main competitors.                                          [4 marks]

      (c)   Explain one disadvantage of Jean-Paul changing to a situational leadership style.   [2 marks]

      (d)   Examine the relationship between investment, profit and cash flow for SGS.          [5 marks]

      (e)   Discuss the interrelationships between SGS’s aims, strategies and tactics.          [7 marks]

4.    Hair & Beauty (H&B)

      Bettina runs a successful hairdressing salon called Hair & Beauty (H&B). She offers a range of
      services such as haircutting, colouring, and beauty treatments such as body massages. H&B’s
      popularity is mainly based on Bettina’s expertise, networks and personality. Many local celebrities
      rely on her sense of style; as a consequence, H&B’s customer base is growing rapidly.

      Bettina currently has 12 employees. They are paid good salaries plus commission, but Bettina is very
      controlling and demanding. Morale and job satisfaction are falling; absenteeism and staff turnover
      are high. Some workers have expressed concerns about not spending enough time with their families.
      As a result, Bettina is reluctantly planning to introduce a flexitime workscheme.

      Her younger brother Gavin wants to open a H&B franchise in a small city nearby where several
      hairdressing salons already operate. None, however, is perceived as stylish and high quality.
      Bettina will be responsible for training the new employees. She will also pay for the advertising
      costs. In return, Gavin will pay Bettina an annual fee of 10 % of his sales revenue and maintain
      H&B’s high standards and quality.

      Gavin’s personal savings are insufficient to meet the start-up costs of the new salon. He will ask for
      a bank loan. He has already prepared a business plan for his bank manager.


      (a)   Describe one source of finance, other than a bank loan, that Gavin could use to
            fund the start-up of the new salon.                                                  [2 marks]

      (b)   (i)    Explain one disadvantage to H&B of introducing a flexitime workscheme.        [2 marks]

            (ii)   Explain one advantage and one disadvantage to H&B of using a
                   commission-based financial reward package.                                    [4 marks]

      (c)   Analyse the importance of Gavin’s business plan when seeking finance from his
            bank manager.                                                                        [5 marks]

      (d)   Evaluate the use of franchising as a growth strategy for Bettina and her salon,
            H&B.                                                                                 [7 marks]

5.    Reading enables all People (RP)

      RP is a non-profit and non-governmental organization (NGO) that teaches reading to financially
      disadvantaged children and teenagers. RP’s mission statement is: “To educate those in need in order
      to foster social inclusion and change”.

      RP has 64 paid full-time staff and 350 part-time volunteers, mostly college students, who work in all
      areas of the city where RP is located. Volunteers do not work under a contract. RP is experiencing
      communication problems. One young volunteer complained, “I often receive contradictory
      information. One person says one thing and another says something else”. RP’s organizational
      structure is tall. There are several formal methods of communication present at RP, but most of the
      information passes through informal communication channels.

      RP is planning to extend its literacy program to rural areas. The program will last five years.
      RP’s current sources of finance are insufficient to fund the new program. At present, RP is only
      financed by national businesses. Alice Lire, RP’s Chief Executive Officer (CEO), has contacted the
      government for financial support. However, the state budget is limited and chances of government
      cooperation are low.

      As part of its corporate social responsibility policy, McMikey, a multinational company that markets
      products to children, is willing to pay for the books for the program for two years. Alice is ready
      to accept the offer, but she would prefer McMikey to guarantee its support for five years. However,
      there is internal disagreement at McMikey. The Finance Manager believes that it would be too costly.
      However, the Marketing Manager argues that McMikey’s brand image would be improved by a
      longterm association with RP’s literacy program.


      (a)   Define the term mission statement.                                                  [2 marks]

      (b)   Explain one formal method of communication that might be used at RP.                [2 marks]

      (c)   Explain one advantage and one disadvantage for McMikey of having a corporate
            social responsibility policy.                                                       [4 marks]

      (d)   Analyse the impact on RP of McMikey’s offer to pay for the books.                   [5 marks]

      (e)   Evaluate RP’s use of a very large number of part-time volunteers.                   [7 marks]
