Paper 3 markbands: The following bands provide a précis of the full markbands for paper 3 published in the
History guide (2008) on pages 77–81. They are intended to assist marking but must be used in conjunction
with the full markbands found in the guide. For the attention of all examiners: if you are uncertain about
the content/accuracy of a candidate’s work please contact your team leader.

 18–20: Answers are clearly focused with a high degree of the awareness of the question and may
        challenge it successfully. Knowledge is extensive, accurately applied and there may be a high
        level of conceptual ability. Evaluation of different approaches may be present as may be
        understanding of historical processes as well as comparison and contrast where relevant.
        Evaluation is integrated into the answer. The answer is well-structured and well-focused.
        Synthesis is highly developed.
 15–17: Answers are clearly structured and focused, have full awareness of the demands of the
        question, and if appropriate may challenge it. Accurate and detailed historical knowledge is
        used convincingly to support critical commentary. Historical processes such as comparison
        and contrast, placing events in context and evaluating different interpretations are used
        appropriately and effectively. Answers are well-structured and balanced and synthesis is well-
        developed and supported with knowledge and critical commentary.
 12–14: Answers are clearly focused on the demands of the question. Relevant in-depth knowledge is
        applied as evidence, and analysis or critical commentary are used to indicate some in-depth
        understanding but is not consistent throughout. Events are placed in context and there is
        sound understanding of historical processes and comparison and contrast. Evaluation of
        different approaches may be used to substantiate arguments presented. Synthesis is present
        but not always consistently integrated. Focus on AO3 and AO4.
 9–11: Answers indicate that the question is understood but not all implications considered.
        Knowledge is largely accurate. Critical commentary may be present. Events are generally
        placed in context, and historical processes, such as comparison and contrast, are understood.
        There is a clear attempt at a structured approach. Focus on AO1, AO2 and AO4. Responses
        that simply summarize the views of historians cannot reach the top of this markband.
 7–8:   The demands of the question are generally understood. Relevant, historical knowledge is
        present but is unevenly applied. Knowledge is narrative or descriptive in nature. There may
        be limited argument that requires further substantiation. Critical commentary may be present.
        There is an attempt to place events in historical context and show an understanding of
        historical processes. An attempt at a structured approach, either chronological or thematic has
        been made.
 5–6:   Answers indicate some understanding of the question, but historical knowledge is limited in
        quality and quantity.        Understanding of historical processes may be present but
        underdeveloped. The question is only partially addressed.
 3–4:   There is little understanding of the question. Historical knowledge is present but the detail is
        insufficient. Historical context or processes are barely understood and there are little more
        than poorly substantiated assertions.
 1–2:   Answers do not meet the demands of the question and show little or no evidence of
        appropriate structure. There is little more than unsupported generalization.
 0:      Answers not meeting the requirements of descriptors should be awarded no marks.

 Examiners and moderators are reminded of the need to apply the markbands that provide the “best fit” to
 the responses given by candidates and to award credit wherever it is possible to do so. If an answer
 indicates that the demands of the question are understood and addressed but that not all implications are
 considered (eg, compare or contrast; reasons or significance; methods or success), then examiners should
 not be afraid of using the full range of marks allowed for by the markscheme: ie, responses that offer good
 coverage of some of the criteria should be rewarded accordingly.

The French Revolution and Napoleon — mid 18th century to 1815

1.   Discuss the reasons for the Thermidorean Reaction (1794–1795).

     Candidates should understand why Robespierre was overthrown and executed in July 1794. They
     can also refer to the “White Terror” of 1795 against other Jacobins. In the case of the former,
     reasons could include a simple desire for self preservation, as many revolutionaries (eg Fouché and
     Tallien), feared that they would be next for the guillotine after the execution of the Danton faction
     in March 1794. It is possible to argue that by mid-1794 France was less threatened by foreign
     invasion than before, (eg victory at Fleurus June 1794 and fall of Toulon in December 1793) and
     therefore that the need for the Committee of Public Safety was much reduced. For the events of
     1795 and the persecution of Jacobins in that year; revenge was a key motive, with royalists seizing
     this opportunity in many areas of France to settle scores with local Jacobins. More generally,
     political instability was rife in 1795 with pro-Jacobin riots in Paris. These were caused in part by
     the rising cost of food, (price controls on food were abolished in December 1794). A variety of
     reasons could be considered by candidates.

     The above material is an indication of what candidates may elect to write about in their
     responses. However, it is not exhaustive and no set answer is required.

     Examiners and moderators are reminded of the need to apply the markbands that provide the
     “best fit” to the responses given by candidates and to award credit wherever it is possible to do so.


2.   Examine the reasons for the collapse of the Napoleonic Empire (1812–1815).

     Responses can focus on events on the battlefield: French retreat from Russia 1812, Battle of
     Leipzig 1813, French defeat in the Peninsular War in 1813, the invasion of France in 1814 and
     then the final defeat at Waterloo in 1815 which ended Napoleon’s return to power from Elba.
     Candidates should also look at underlying reasons for French military defeats in this period: these
     may include the success of alliance-building against Napoleon (eg by Castlereagh), as well as the
     economic effects of the British blockade upon Napoleonic Europe. There was also the increasing
     unpopularity of French rule in many parts of the Empire especially in parts of Germany and in
     Spain, which undermined the idea that Napoleonic rule constituted some form of liberation from
     traditional elites. Better answers will avoid simple narratives of events and will include analysis
     along with detailed historical knowledge.

     The above material is an indication of what candidates may elect to write about in their
     responses. However, it is not exhaustive and no set answer is required.

Unification and consolidation of Germany and Italy 1815–1890

3.   “By 1862 the necessary conditions for German unification under Prussian leadership were in
     place.” To what extent do you agree with this statement?

     This question allows candidates to range across the whole period 1815–1862. Arguments that
     Prussian leadership was most likely could include: Prussian territorial gains by the Congress of
     Vienna; Austrian focus on Italy and Austrian suppression of Liberal/nationalist revolts 1815–1849;
     Prussian economic growth 1815–1859 and comparative Austrian economic stagnation. Arguments
     that a Prussian leadership was not so likely could include: Prussian elite uncertainty about a
     leadership role; Frederick William IV rejecting the Crown offered by the Frankfurt Assembly; also
     the 1850 Punctation of Olmutz when Prussia was forced to abandon the Erfurt Union by Austria.
     While candidates may validly argue that Bismarck’s leadership was more significant to unification
     than other factors, they should link their analysis to the question.

     The above material is an indication of what candidates may elect to write about in their
     responses. However, it is not exhaustive and no set answer is required.

     Examiners and moderators are reminded of the need to apply the markbands that provide the
     “best fit” to the responses given by candidates and to award credit wherever it is possible to do so.


4.   Discuss which Italian leader played the most important role in the unification of Italy.

     Candidates are likely to focus on Cavour, Garibaldi and possibly Mazzini and Victor Emmanuel II.
     Rather than narratives of events, detailed analytical answers are sought with an assessment of the
     importance of individual leaders. It could be argued that Cavour modernised Piedmont, enabling it
     to take on a leadership role and that he successfully positioned it diplomatically (the Crimean War
     and then the Plombières meeting with Napoleon III). After war with Austria in 1859, Lombardy
     and the Central Duchies joined Piedmont. How far Cavour intended a unified Italy rather than
     merely an expanded Piedmont could be debated. While Garibaldi was entirely committed to Italian
     unification, there was mutual distrust between Cavour and Garibaldi. Examination of his role could
     include the defence of the Roman Republic in 1849 and his strong international and national profile
     in favour of unification. He led the expedition of the Thousand resulting in his ceding of his
     Neapolitan conquests to Victor Emmanuel II at Teano in October 1860 and subsequent attempts to
     conquer Rome for Italy.

     Mazzini was the intellectual of the Risorgimento and inspired many followers (eg Young Italy),
     but he had a limited political role and he was deeply mistrusted by Cavour. Victor Emmanuel II
     was significant in that he appointed Cavour as Prime Minister in 1852 and allowed him to pursue
     his modernising policies thereafter. He was also important in diplomatic and military events
     1856–1870.

     The above material is an indication of what candidates may elect to write about in their
     responses. However, it is not exhaustive and no set answer is required.

     Examiners and moderators are reminded of the need to apply the markbands that provide the
     “best fit” to the responses given by candidates and to award credit wherever it is possible to do so.

Ottoman Empire from the early 19th to the early 20th century

5.   Examine the reasons why the European Powers intervened in the campaigns of Muhammad
     Ali between 1827 and 1841.

     This question covers the European intervention in the Greek War of Independence (Treaty of
     London, 1827, of Britain, France and Russia) that led to the Battle of Navarino in October 1827. It
     also covers the First and Second Ottoman Egyptian Wars 1831–1833 and 1839–1841 and the roles
     of Russia, Austria, France, Britain and, to a lesser extent, Prussia in these crises. Candidates may
     reflect on the extent to which the Great Powers had interests in common during these crises
     (protection of Greeks and other Christian subjects of the Ottoman Empire) and how far their
     policies differed (in the 1830s, there was some French support for Muhammad Ali, Russia had
     ambitions in the Mediterranean while Britain and Austria preferred the status quo. In the 1820s,
     Russia was enthusiastic about helping the Greeks, while British government policy was initially
     more lukewarm).

     For the role of Russia in the First Ottoman Egyptian War, see the Treaty of Hunkar Iskelesi (Unkiar
     Skelessi) in July 1833. For the Austrian response, there was the Münchengrätz meeting September
     1833 where it was agreed that Russia and Austria would work together if the Ottoman Empire
     collapsed. In the case of the Second Ottoman Egyptian War, France was out of step with the other
     European powers in being unwilling to limit the gains of Muhammad Ali after the Egyptians’
     victory over the Ottomans at Nizip in June 1839. A joint British-Austrian-Turkish campaign
     against the Egyptians took place September-November 1840, culminating in the bombardment of
     Acre and the defeat of Muhammad Ali’s forces. Rather than narration of events, look for analysis
     of the European powers’ interests and to what extent Muhammad Ali was perceived to threaten or
     help them. Candidates could analyse why the European powers’ response was more rapid in the
     Second Ottoman Egyptian War than the First and why there was disunity in both cases.

     The above material is an indication of what candidates may elect to write about in their
     responses. However, it is not exhaustive and no set answer is required.

     Examiners and moderators are reminded of the need to apply the markbands that provide the

6.   Examine the importance of the Balkan Wars (1912–1913) in the decline of the Ottoman
     Empire.

     The loss of Tripolitania to Italy in 1911–1912 had shown the military and diplomatic weakness of
     the Ottoman Empire. In October 1912, Greece, Serbia, Bulgaria and Montenegro all declared war
     on the Ottoman Empire and the First Balkan War led to comprehensive defeat for the Empire and
     the loss of significant territory. The Second Balkan War in 1913 saw the Ottoman Empire take
     advantage of Bulgaria’s defeat and retake the province of Edirne (Adrianople). It could be argued
     that the Balkan Wars were very important in the decline of the Ottoman Empire as they led to the
     loss of almost all its European territories: Macedonia, Albania and much of Thrace. These had been
     among the wealthiest provinces of the Empire. There was also significant disruption with
     thousands of Muslim refugees fleeing the territories the Ottomans had lost. Ultimately, it could be
     suggested that the diplomatic isolation of the Empire in 1912 made it desperate for a European
     alliance in 1914 and this is what led to the disastrous decision to ally with Germany in the First
     World War.

     Some candidates may suggest that the Balkan Wars were just another stage in the long-term decline
     of the empire that had accelerated in the 19th century. Effective answers would need to identify
     significant events such as the loss of Greece and the various interventions of the Great Powers or
     other relevant material.

     On the other side of the argument, one could plausibly maintain that it was only as a consequence of
     defeat in 1918 that the Empire was ended. In fact, the Empire demonstrated significant vitality in
     the early stages of the First World War – the Ottomans forced the British to withdraw from
     Gallipoli in January 1916 and captured the British Indian army at Kut-el-Amara in April 1916.

     responses. However, it is not exhaustive and no set answer is required.

Western and Northern Europe 1848–1914

7.   “The Boulanger affair showed the weakness of the Third French Republic.” To what extent
     do you agree with this statement?

     Boulanger was Minister of War from January 1886 until May 1887. He promoted a policy of
     revanche against Germany and became extremely popular. His popularity coincided with the
     Honours scandal that led to the resignation of Grévy, President of France in December 1887. In
     1888, Boulanger was not brought back into the cabinet and his political support grew as he
     denounced those in power. Boulanger was twice elected as a Deputy; on the second occasion in
     January 1889 some argue that he was on the point of launching a coup d’état. However, a warrant
     was issued for his arrest and he fled to Belgium in April 1889.

     It could be argued that Boulanger’s links with monarchist and Bonapartist circles and his evident
     popular support show that the Third Republic remained relatively weak, especially given the
     obvious corruption of some of its politicians. On the other hand, the period of mass support for
     Boulanger was rather brief and the Third Republic survived what were arguably greater tests (eg the
     Dreyfus affair and general strikes before 1914). Candidates could argue that the Third Republic
     also went on to demonstrate great strength in surviving both the First World War and the
     Depression.

     The above material is an indication of what candidates may elect to write about in their
     responses. However, it is not exhaustive and no set answer is required.

     “best fit” to the responses given by candidates and to award credit wherever it is possible to do so.


8.   Examine the effects of the Second and Third Reform Acts on British political parties.

     The focus should clearly be on the effects of the Second (1867) and Third Reform Acts
     (1884–1885) on British political parties rather than a narrative of events, although some discussion
     of the main provisions of the Acts could be appropriate. One approach could be to show the role of
     popular mobilisation throughout this period.          The Liberal Party successfully mobilised
     Nonconformists and a range of special interest groups under Gladstone’s leadership. Meanwhile,
     popular Conservatism was also successful after both of these Acts. The Conservatives won election
     victories in 1874, 1886, 1895 and 1900. One could argue that through organisations such as the
     Primrose League and a well-organised party they were able to move away from their traditional
     position of defenders of the landed interest. Another approach would be to argue that the Third
     Reform Act had a greater impact, eg the emergence of the Labour Party (42 MPs elected in the
     December 1910 general election), bringing a new dimension to the traditional dominance of the
     Liberal and Conservative parties.

     The above material is an indication of what candidates may elect to write about in their
     responses. However, it is not exhaustive and no set answer is required.

Imperial Russia, revolutions, emergence of Soviet State 1853–1924

9.    To what extent did Alexander II’s reforms improve the lives of the Russian peasantry?

      The main focus of answers should be whether or not the lives of the Russian peasants improved as a
      result of emancipation in 1861. The details of the Emancipation Edict could be outlined – the
      granting of civil rights to peasants and the fact that land was redistributed from the nobility to the
      peasantry. Analysis could consider whether emancipation actually improved living standards.
      Issues to consider: the amount and quality of land redistributed; the fact that the Mir and not
      individuals held the land; the issue of Redemption Dues and its effect on the peasants.

      Modern historiography suggests that peasant income fell and by 1870 only 50 % of peasants were
      producing surplus. Many were working at subsistence levels and they lacked the means to improve
      farming. Thus, limited supplies of land and increased population led to Land Hunger, famines and
      peasant discontent by the 1890s.

      Candidates may refer to other reforms that were necessary corollaries to emancipation such as local
      government, education, legal and military reforms etc. However the main focus should be on their
      impact on the lives of the peasants.

      “best fit” to the responses given by candidates and to award credit wherever it is possible to do so.


10.   Evaluate the factors that enabled Lenin to ensure the survival of the Soviet State.

      Factors could include Lenin’s willingness to deal ruthlessly with potential opposition both within
      and outside the Bolshevik party – suppression of the Constituent Assembly; the establishment of the
      Cheka and the Red Terror. The harsh treatment of opponents during the civil war (the death of the
      Romanov family), the crushing of the Kronstadt Revolt when the sailors demanded a return to
      soviet power, the establishment of the one-party state and the Ban on Factionalism within the party
      itself followed by purges could all be considered.

      Other factors could include: policies that were approved of by the Russian people or were effective
      in dealing with a particular crisis; decrees on Land and Peace 1917; the granting of workers control
      of economic enterprises. War Communism, although unpopular, was important in supplying the
      Red Army during the Civil War. This helped in defeating the Whites and their foreign allies. The
      adoption of the New Economic Policy (NEP) in 1921 stimulated economic recovery and increased
      the popularity of the regime.

European diplomacy and the First World War 1870–1923

11.   Examine the importance of global colonial rivalry as a cause of the outbreak of the First
      World War in 1914.

      It could be argued that Anglo-German colonial tensions (eg Kruger Telegram and more especially
      the naval competition, which was linked to British and German colonial ambitions) led to the initial
      move of Britain towards France, leading to the Entente Cordiale of April 1904. Furthermore,
      Franco-German colonial rivalry in Morocco led to the consolidation of the Entente between Britain
      and France during the crises of 1905 and 1911. While Russia had been allied with France since
      1894 there was no agreement between Britain and Russia until the Triple Entente of August 1907
      (after the resolution of colonial difficulties between the two). Global colonial rivalry played a role
      in establishing and strengthening the two blocs of powers that confronted each other in 1914.

      On the other hand, one can argue that colonial disputes were not at all important in the actual
      outbreak of war in 1914. This was due in large part to events in the Balkans, Austro-Russian
      rivalries in the region and the European policies of the Great Powers. Some candidates may wish to
      stress the primacy of German policy as the main cause of the outbreak of war.

      One could also argue that Britain and France and Britain and Russia had traditionally been colonial
      rivals, but were on the same side in 1914, suggesting that colonial rivalry was not an especially
      important cause of the outbreak of the First World War.

      responses. However, it is not exhaustive and no set answer is required.

12.   “German military and diplomatic errors were responsible for the defeat of the Central
      Powers in 1918.” To what extent do you agree with this statement?

      German strategic errors could include the actual execution and arguably the design of the Schlieffen
      Plan, (how far had it taken account of Russia’s improved ability to mobilize?). The provocation of
      the US, which brought her into the war, was a diplomatic error (eg the decision to attack US
      shipping and the Zimmermann telegram). The failure of the Schlieffen Plan and the US entry into
      the war could be argued to have been key reasons for the defeat of the Central Powers.

      On the other side of the argument, there were factors that led to defeat in 1918 that were not
      German strategic/diplomatic errors, these could include: the blockade of Germany and its effects on
      the civilian population; the arguably greater mobilisation of the home front in Britain compared to
      Germany; the collapse of the Austrian and Ottoman Empires; and perhaps the generally greater
      resources of the Allied powers.

War and change in the Middle East 1914–1949

13.   Evaluate the impact of actions by European Powers on the problems in Palestine in the years
      1914 to 1939.

      Contributions to tensions could include the impact of wartime diplomacy (McMahon-Hussein
      Correspondence, Sykes-Picot Agreement, Balfour Declaration). All contributed to tensions as the
      expectations of both Jews and Arabs were raised and then unfulfilled. Changing British policy
      during the mandate years also raised tensions, as British rule seemed to favour one side and then the
      other.

      In the early 1920s under Samuel there was limited violence and it seemed possible that the two
      groups might find a way to coexist. This relative peace ended with the Wailing Wall incident.
      There may be mention of the various White Papers and Commissions set up by the British.

      Answers should also consider the impact of Nazi policies on Palestine, the massive increase in
      Jewish immigration certainly exacerbated tensions and contributed to the Arab revolt, 1936–1939.
      Furthermore British attempts to end the revolt only served to anger both Arabs and Jews.

14.   “Reza Khan’s modernization policies had limited success up to 1941.” To what extent do you
      agree with this statement?

      Answers should identify what Reza Khan’s aims were: he wanted to westernize and centralize
      power in Iran to strengthen the state. Laws were passed to demonstrate how Iran was adopting
      western culture and values (banning the veil, ethnic dress and polygamy). The law courts were
      secularized at the expense of religious law and education reforms were implemented, which not
      only provided trained lawyers to administer the new legal codes but contributed to a decline in
      illiteracy especially in urban areas.

      Answers might argue that establishing a monarchy, which relied to some extent on the army to
      retain power, was not modernizing the state. The Majlis had limited power and Reza Khan’s main
      supporters were the landlord class who limited the impact of any modernization in the countryside.

      Economically Iran was hindered by unfavourable trade agreements with Russia and because Iran’s
      major resource (oil) was controlled by foreign companies, especially the Anglo-Iranian Oil
      Company whose profits went abroad. Other industrial activity remained fairly small scale –
      hindered by poor infrastructure, attempts to modernize the railways were costly and ineffective.
      Iran’s economy remained dominated by agriculture, which had low productivity levels.
      Modernization remained confined to the urban elites and the influence of the ulama remained
      strong.

Interwar years: conflict and cooperation 1919–1939

15.   “Collective security failed because of the weakness of the League of Nations.” To what extent
      do you agree with this statement?

      This is not a “successes and failures’ of the League of Nations question and the main focus should
      be on factors that limited international cooperation. Examples of where the League was seen to be
      weak such as Manchuria and Abyssinia should be linked to their impact on international affairs.
      Candidates may argue that the League was dominated by Britain and France that led to ineffective
      polices such as weak sanctions against Italy.

      The impact of the Great Depression on cooperation is also important. Without the economic crisis
      in Germany, Hitler would probably not have gained power and Italy would perhaps not have
      pursued expansion in Abyssinia. Britain and France became more focused on internal problems and
      there was a tendency to erect tariff barriers which hindered cooperation.

      Nations began to act outside of the League eg the Little Entente, the Balkan Pact, the Stresa Front
      and the Anglo-German Naval agreement in pursuit of national interests and security.

      Fear of the Soviet Union was also a factor, Stalin joined the League in 1934 but despite signing
      agreements with both Czechoslovakia and France, he was still regarded with suspicion, especially
      by the British. Soviet support for the Republicans in Spain contributed to this suspicion.

      By 1936 Britain and to a lesser extent France was pursuing a policy of Appeasement signalling the
      end of the search for collective security and underlining the weakness of the League of Nations.

16.   Evaluate the impact of Hitler’s social and economic policies in Germany up to 1939.

      Impact on society is the key focus, analysis should relate to pre-1939 Germany, as the outbreak of
      war led to major change in social and economic policies.

      Social policies to consider: youth and education; policies on women (Kinder, Kuche, Kirche);
      policies on religion; anti-Semitic policies. Some might argue that there was the appearance of
      change because of propaganda, but that in fact there was limited change except as a consequence of
      anti-Semitic legislation. By 1939, Germany’s Jewish population was socially, politically and
      economically excluded from the Volksgemeinschaft.

      Economic policies could include: reducing unemployment; Schacht’s New Plan, which attempted
      to balance the trade deficit; the 1936 Four Year Plan, which aimed to establish autarky and prepare
      Germany for war.

      Answers should be well-balanced and assess impact: (was unemployment ended? was Germany self
      sufficient and ready for war in 1939?). There is an opportunity here to consider the views of
      economic historians such as Mason, Overy, Twose.

The Soviet Union and Eastern Europe 1924–2000

17.   Examine the ways and extent to which two countries in Eastern Europe (excluding East
      Germany) experienced liberation between 1944 and 1948.

      As the Red Army moved westwards anti-fascist coalitions were established but as Cold War
      tensions emerged Stalin ensured, with the threat of the Red Army, that local Communist parties
      gained more power and influence.

      Some detail of events is required to support analysis. For example: in Poland in July 1944 the
      Lublin Poles (pro-Soviet) set up a provisional government and in August 1944 the Red Army failed
      to assist the Warsaw Uprising in order to limit the influence of the London Poles. Tensions arose at
      Yalta and Potsdam over Poland (Oder–Neisse Line etc) and Stalin agreed to hold free elections.
      These were held in 1947 and were clearly rigged in favour of the Communist candidates.

      Events in Czechoslovakia are also likely to be well known. Czechoslovakia was the only fully
      democratic state pre-war and initial elections were probably reasonably free – the Communists were
      popular winning 38 % of the vote in 1946 and a coalition was formed with Gottwald (Communist)
      at its head. Discontent rose because of the rejection of Marshall Aid. The Communist party staged
      a coup supported by five Red Army Divisions, Jan Masaryk was killed and in the May 1948
      elections the Communists were the only party to stand.

      It could be argued that to some extent Poland was more clearly occupied because of the political
      interference as early as 1944, whereas in the case of Czechoslovakia there were free elections and
      the Soviet Union only encouraged the Czech Communists when there was a danger of a less
      friendly government being elected. Other valid examples could include Hungary or Romania.

18.   Examine the role played by the Cold War in shaping Brezhnev’s foreign policy.

      Key areas of foreign policy should be well known: Czechoslovakia 1968; the Brezhnev Doctrine,
      Detente and the Strategic Arms Limitation Talks (SALT) agreements; the Chinese-Soviet split and
      Brezhnev’s response to it; better relations with West Germany; 1970 Moscow Treaty and 1972
      Basic Treaty; Helsinki Agreements 1975; the search for allies in the Middle East and Africa etc; and
      the Soviet move into Afghanistan in 1979.

      Candidates may not know all of the above but they should consider whether it was Cold War
      tensions or other factors such as domestic concerns or consideration of the Soviet Union’s global
      position that drove Brezhnev’s foreign policy.

The Second World War and post-war Western Europe 1939–2000

19.   Evaluate the reasons why the Allies were victorious in Europe in 1945.

      A relatively straightforward question that requires candidates to consider a number of factors that
      led to Allied victory.

      Factors could include: the failure to defeat Britain in 1940, the decision to invade Russia with
      Operation Barbarossa, the declaration of war on the US all of which led to a very strong alliance
      against Germany and Italy. Italy’s military weakness meant that Nazi Germany’s forces were
      overstretched; the potential of the Allied powers both in men and resources was much greater than
      the Axis powers; clear policy making (Stalin focused all economic activity on fighting the war as
      did Great Britain and the US), whereas Hitler failed to put the German economy on a total war
      footing until 1944; the Allies had air and naval superiority for much of the war, which facilitated the
      supplying of Britain and the Soviet Union as well as the preparations for invasion in 1944.

      Other factors to consider could be: the nature of the Nazi regime meant that there were active
      guerrilla resistance movements in occupied territories that tied up large numbers of troops; the
      German response to the D-Day landings was limited because troops were engaged in such great
      numbers on the eastern front and elsewhere in Europe. In addition, Hitler’s military decisions
      arguably contributed to defeat, eg the refusal to allow a retreat from Stalingrad.

      Answers may not cover all these factors but there should be some analysis as to which were more
      significant.

20.   Examine the factors that led to German reunification in 1990.

      The sequence of events should be well known; however answers should not only focus on
      Gorbachev’s reforms but should consider factors within East and West Germany and the
      international response to reunification.

      Events: abandonment of the Brezhnev Doctrine in 1985 by Gorbachev, the reduction in size of the
      Red Army by 1988, and the promise of withdrawal of the Red Army from the GDR. These all
      created the potential for change in the GDR.

      Knowledge of reforms within the Soviet Union stimulated popular protests in the GDR with
      demands for economic reforms. There was an economic crisis in 1989 when thousands of East
      Germans crossed to the west via Hungary and Austria, seeking a better standard of living. There
      were massive demonstrations in Leipzig in October 1989. Honecker resigned and in November
      Krenz decided to open the Berlin Wall (it collapsed on 9 November) as the government was unable
      to resist the scale of the demand for reform. Attempts at political change (free elections etc) were
      too late and in December the demonstrators in Leipzig began to demand reunification.

      Chancellor Kohl of West Germany hoped that reunification would stabilize the flow of economic
      migrants to the west. In 1990, in both East and West Germany, the idea of reunification and how to
      manage it became the main focus of politicians. In October 1990 East and West Germany were
      formally reunified.

      It is also important to note that other powers were willing to accept a reunified Germany within the
      EU and to relinquish their obligations to Berlin, which was still technically under Four Power
      administration. The US was particularly supportive of reunification and Gorbachev was realistic
      enough to realise that there was very little the Soviet Union could do despite anxieties about a
      reunified Germany as a member of NATO.

      This is not an end of the Cold War question; the focus should be on events in Germany.

Post-war developments in the Middle East 1945–2000

21.   Examine the role played by the confessional state in the outbreak of the civil war in Lebanon
      in 1975.

      An outline of the structure of the Confessional State would be a useful starting point here with some
      links to the various population groups in Lebanon. Political roles were dictated by confessional
      identity. The President was Maronite, the prime minister a Sunni and the speaker a Shia and the
      Maronites were the largest group in the assembly. By the mid 1970s Shia Muslims were the largest
      population group. Population balance had been destroyed by the influx of Palestinian refugees
      post-1948 and by 1970 their numbers were between 300,000 and 400,000. This imbalance was
      exacerbated by the movement of the PLO to Lebanon after Black September and in the early 1970s
      southern Lebanon was dominated by the PLO. Their presence and actions caused frequent
      tensions/incidents with Israel.

      In 1975 the government tried to regain control of the south – PLO resistance led to clashes with the
      army (the officer corps was largely Christian and the rank and file were largely Muslim). Maronite
      militias became involved and, in response, the radical militias who were sympathetic to the PLO
      became active. Thus it is clear that the attempts by a Maronite-dominated state to establish control
      were resisted by other confessional groups.

      Confessional tensions were also increased because of economic disparity; the Maronites and Sunnis
      were far wealthier than the Shia population many of whom had moved to urban areas with little
      opportunity for economic improvement. The government did little to implement social and
      economic reforms that may have prevented many of the urban working class from supporting the
      radical militias.

      This is a complex issue and answers should focus on the factors that upset the delicate political
      balance in Lebanon leading to civil war.

22.   Compare and contrast the nature and consequences of the 1967 and 1973 Arab–Israeli
      conflicts.

      For compare: both conflicts were relatively brief; Israel used US-supplied equipment and was able
      to defeat or weaken Arab forces; both conflicts were ended by a UN demand for a ceasefire; both
      conflicts were regarded as military successes for Israel; both conflicts left the Occupied Territories
      as a cause of tension.

      For contrast: 1967 was a pre-emptive strike by Israel whereas 1973 was an Egyptian-led offensive
      to regain lost territory; 1973 could be seen as a diplomatic victory for Sadat; in 1973 some territory
      was returned to Egypt (Sinai); the 1967 conflict led to increased tension in the region whereas 1973
      contributed to movements towards peace talks.

Social and economic developments in Europe and the Middle East in the 19th or 20th century

23.   Evaluate the reasons for changes to the suffrage in any one country you have studied.

      Britain is likely to be a popular choice; but allow any country in the region. Detailed knowledge
      rather than vague generalisations are sought. In Britain, changes in suffrage can include: the
      gradual extension of the franchise to remove property qualification between 1832 and1928; giving
      women the vote; reducing, in 1969, the voting age from 21 to 18. Reasons could include:
      demographic change; the Suffragette movement and the impact of the First World War. There
      should be a clear focus on reasons for change rather than just a list of alterations to the suffrage.

      If other exemplars are chosen, both changes to the suffrage and the reasons for that change should
      be clearly outlined.

24.   Examine the reasons for changes in social welfare policy over a fifty year period in any one
      country you have studied.

      Germany and Britain are likely to be the most popular choices, but allow any country within the
      region. For Germany, candidates may discuss Bismarck’s social insurance legislation and contrast
      it with what went before. For reasons, they could place the social insurance measures in the context
      of his Anti-Socialist campaigns. For Britain, there could be material on social welfare policy under
      some of the following: Asquith; Attlee; Thatcher; Major; Blair (up to 2000). A wide variety of
      reasons could be examined for the changes in British social welfare in the fifty years following the
      Second World War.

      Candidates could choose to consider reasons for change in social welfare policy in either the 19th or
      the 20th centuries.
