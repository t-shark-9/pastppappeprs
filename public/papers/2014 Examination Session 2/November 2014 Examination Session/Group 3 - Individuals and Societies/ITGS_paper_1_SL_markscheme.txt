Examiners should be aware that in some cases, candidates may take a different approach, which if
appropriate should be rewarded. If in doubt, check with your Team Leader.

In the case of an “identify” question read all answers and mark positively up to the maximum marks.
Disregard incorrect answers. In all other cases where a question asks for a certain number of facts
eg “describe two kinds”, mark the first two correct answers. This could include two descriptions,
one description and one identification, or two identifications.

It should be recognized that, given time constraints, answers for part (c) questions are likely to include a
much narrower range of issues and concepts than identified in the markband. There is no “correct”
answer. Examiners must be prepared to award full marks to answers which synthesize and evaluate even
if they do not examine all the stimulus material.

        discounts via a website, link or barcode
       item details – some receipts may provide links to items purchased that contain
        further details about the item
       surveys and contests – customers can complete surveys or enter contests from
        the e-receipt
       tracking – easier for the customer to track their expenses
       environmental – paperless storage, reducing the amount of paper used /
        is better for the environment.

(c)   Discuss the advantages and disadvantages to the patient of using the MMC as
      a health care tool.                                                         [8 marks]

      Answers may include:
      Advantages
       remind patient to take the correct medication – uses facial recognition to
        identify patient and RFID tags on patient’s medication to ensure they are taking
        correct medication and not someone else’s
       remind patient to take medication on time – using facial recognition, identifies
        patient and reminds them to take medications daily
       tracking vital signs – can send information to doctor/nurse who can determine
        in levels are acceptable
       access up-to-date personalized health information – stores your health
        information (prescriptions, vital signs, etc) in one location
       interact online with physicians and pharmacists – if user cannot get out to
        office, that data collected can be accessed online by doctor/pharmacist
       used by people in remote areas with limited access to health care
       RFID-based smart labels attached to the individual medication as a safety
        measure
       vital sign sensors to monitor blood pressure and heart rate – like having nurse
        at home, and can be sent to doctor
       voice synthesis technology to allow additional audio output to what is shown
        on the cabinet display – gives audio cues for those visually impaired

      Disadvantages
       malfunction – may stop working, and therefore may not be able to access data
       malfunction – may not work if there is a power failure
       lockout – system may lock out patients making them unable to access their
        prescriptions
       may cause problems if patient does not use that bathroom for a period of time
        (gone on holiday, uses another bathroom, etc)
       database may not be kept up-to-date
       face recognition may wrongly identify a person within a house where there are
        members that look alike, and the image is captured with poor lighting
       people become reliant. Will not be able to reliably take medicine if it breaks
        down because they will not know what to do.

      Do not accept “it is difficult to use/handle”.

      In part (c) of this question it is expected there will be a balance in the ITGS
      terminology between IT technical terminology and the terminology related to
      social and ethical impacts.

3.   Who has my data?

     (a)   (i)    Identify four characteristics that may be required by a system when
                  setting up a strong password.                                       [4 marks]

                  Answers may include:
                   minimum length required
                   combination of numbers, symbols, lowercase OR uppercase letter
                   lowercase AND uppercase letters
                   avoid sequences or repeat characters
                   avoid dictionary words
                   password cannot be the same as the username
                   is different than previous passwords.

                  Award [1 mark] for each characteristic identified up to a maximum of
                  [4 marks].

           (ii)   Passwords are often set to expire periodically, such as every 90 days.
                  Identify two reasons why passwords are set to expire on a regular basis. [2 marks]

                  Answers may include:
                   narrows window of opportunity for hacker
                   old passwords cannot be reused if found as they have expired
                   it is a way to disable accounts that are not being used/are not active
                   secures data from previous employees who once had access
                   protects the account in case the owner has been sharing the password
                   when same password is used for too long it is easier for hackers to crack
                    it. Some methods to crack a password (brute force and dictionary) may
                    take some time to discover a password.

                  Award [1 mark] for each step identified up to a maximum of [2 marks].

(b)   Compare the security of typing a password with the security of using a finger
      scan.                                                                         [6 marks]

      Answers may include:
      Typing
       could be viewed by an individual watching keyboard
       keylogger programs can record passwords typed into system
       typed password could be guessed or hacked by an individual
       user writes down the password as he/she may not remember the password
       user constantly change password regularly and to remember them they will
        write them down.

      Finger scan
       someone else cannot login to your account – more secure, but can also be a
         problem if you need someone else to login for you
       someone cannot steal your password
       users do not need to memorize a password – no need to write down the
         password
       scan never changes because finger biometric patterns do not change – it cannot
         be used by a different person
       technology experts can duplicate a fingerprint, major security issue as user
         cannot change his/her fingerprint
       sensitivity of equipment may change over time, making the process less secure.

(c)   To what extent is it acceptable for the State of Furlong to hold sensitive data
      in its criminal database?                                                       [8 marks]

      Answers may include:
      Benefits
       would allow them to solve crimes using stored information, (eg, data in a DNA
        database)
       provides protection for children, holds a list of offenders in database
       allows background safety checks (jobs, schools)
       companies such as grocery stores and clothing stores already collect
        information with loyalty cards, many people are already giving out their
        information publically
       sensitive information as DNA may allow to identify a dead body.

      Concerns
       could open doors to misuse of information collected, who is authorized to
        access information
       database can be hacked, leads to possible loss of personal data
       data sharing between departments can be misused by others
       people have right to privacy, Human Rights Act
       accuracy of data, if not always kept current then incorrect information will be
        shared
       human error can occur during data input
       false positives can occur if persons are linked incorrectly by similar name or
        birth date
       source of information not always reliable, do not know where the information
        in the database originally came from
       identity theft can occur if this information can be stolen and misused.

      In part (c) of this question it is expected there will be a balance in the ITGS
      terminology between IT technical terminology and the terminology related to
      social and ethical impacts.

(b)   Explain three factors that could influence the decision by the school in Haiti
      to use open source or proprietary software on the donated computers.           [6 marks]

      Answers may include:
       cost – if development is done in-house by the company there are minimal
        development expenses / open source is free or cheaper than proprietary
        software, more licences can be installed (on more computers) and more
        software can be installed providing the donated computers with a greater
        variety of applications for the new users to have
       customization – open source software is designed for developers to adapt and
        extend. Proprietary software cannot make non-cosmetic changes
       flexible – open source software tends to adopt new trends faster than
        proprietary software
       integration – open source software integrates better with other systems.
        Proprietary software is often locked
       security – open source software fix problems quicker than proprietary software
       responsibility – proprietary software supports the product. Open source
        software has no direct support
       compatibility – proprietary software may offer different applications that use
        similar toolbars, making it easier for users / when installing open source
        different applications may have very different user interfaces, making it harder
        for users as they have to learn each.

      Award [1 mark] for each factor identified that have influenced the decision
      whether to use open source or proprietary software up to a maximum of
      [3 marks].
      Award an additional [1 mark] for each explanation of the factor identified that
      have influenced the decision whether to use open source or proprietary software
      up to a maximum addition of [3 marks].

(c)   Other companies are considering whether it is better to donate or dispose of
      obsolete equipment. Evaluate these two options.                              [8 marks]

      Answers may include:
      Donate
       give to organization in need – good publicity
       charitable companies will often pick up used equipment for free when donating
        equipment
       environmental issues – recycling is environmentally friendly way to get rid of
        older equipment, no waste
       tax friendly – is a charitable donation and eligible for a tax receipt
       age of equipment – if equipment is too old, no one will want it
       responsibility – company may feel responsibility that machines are working
        properly if they donate them to a school or charitable company, so they may
        not want to get involved
       donating will help in education/training
       gives those in need computers that they might not otherwise afford
       others can recycle/reuse these parts
       others can sell the parts for profit.

      Dispose
       security of data – need to ensure data is completely removed from hard drives
       environmental concerns – hazardous materials, need to be disposed of properly
       cost – often a fee for disposing of equipment properly
       functionality – if equipment is not working, it is easier to dispose of it as no
        one will want broken items.

      In part (c) of this question it is expected there will be a balance in the ITGS
      terminology between IT technical terminology and the terminology related to
      social and ethical impacts.

(c)   Although the Twitter reporting system is not managed by the Californian
      authorities, they are using it to identify areas of high concentrations of flu in
      the state.

      To what extent can data collected by the Twitter reporting system benefit the
      California health authority?                                                  [8 marks]

      Answers may include:
      Benefits
       provides information about flu outbreaks more quickly than “traditional”
        methods
       provides health care professionals with information that can be used to prevent
        epidemics spreading
       provides data that can be easily analysed by a range of stakeholders such as

        claims to medical insurance companies.

      Concerns
       data collected is more likely to refer to diseases prevalent among those who use
        Twitter and might miss epidemics affecting some of the population less likely
        to use Twitter
       data mining requires data preparation which can uncover information or
        patterns which may compromise confidentiality and privacy obligations
       tweets can be posted by anyone, anytime, anywhere
       tweets are not reviewed or edited for accuracy
       hashtags can be added to anything, throws off search results done by hashtag.
