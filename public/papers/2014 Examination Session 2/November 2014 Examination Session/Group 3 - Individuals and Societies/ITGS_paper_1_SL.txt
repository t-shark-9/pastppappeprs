Answer three questions. Each question is worth [20 marks].

1.    E-receipts

      In some countries retailers give customers the option of an emailed receipt (e-receipt) as well as a
      paper receipt. To be included in this email receipt system, a customer provides personal information
      to the store cashier, which is entered into the store database.

      Once registered on the system, the customer tells the cashier their first name and last name every time
      they make a purchase.

(Question 1 continued)

      As customers begin to collect more e-receipts from different stores in their inbox, they need a
      method of organizing their e-receipts. Websites such as Myreceipts.com can assist customers with
      this problem. The data held by each store is shared with Myreceipts.com upon customer approval.

      One store, RAX, has a database which is used to keep a record of customers’ visits to the stores.
      This part of the relational database is illustrated below.

2.    Magic Medicine Cabinet

      A new product is being developed for your bathroom, the Magic Medicine Cabinet (MMC).
      It is a smart appliance for supporting family health care. It includes a number of technologies that
      can remind the user to take the right medication, track vital signs, access up-to-date personalized
      health information, and interact online with doctors and pharmacists. John Dudley has recently
      purchased one for the family.




                                     Photo removed for copyright reasons




            The MMC recognizes which medication John is holding, and warns him if he is taking the
                                          wrong medication.

                  Measuring blood pressure using the monitoring device attached to the MMC.



                                                          (This question continues on the following page)

(Question 2 continued)

      The MMC can remind John to take medication through both audio output and the embedded display
      while he is looking in the mirror. The implementation of the MMC incorporates the following
      technologies:
      • face recognition of people who approach the cabinet
      • radio frequency identification (RFID) based smart labels (tags) attached to the individual medication
      • vital sign sensors to monitor blood pressure and heart rate
      • audio output to speak the text that is shown on the cabinet display.

      John interacts with the MMC through its touch-sensitive screen, voice input, and the different sensors
      such as those to monitor blood pressure.

      Some health authorities are considering introducing the MMC in remote areas or in the homes of
      patients who cannot easily get to a doctor’s office.

      (a)   (i)   Identify two advantages of using RFID smart labels (tags) in the MMC.                           [2]

		(ii)            Identify four steps involved in the face recognition process used by the MMC.                   [4]

      (b)   John’s wife wants to take her blood pressure. Compare two methods of training that
            could be provided in using the blood pressure monitoring device.                                      [6]

      (c)   Discuss the advantages and disadvantages to the patient of using the MMC as a
            health care tool.                                                                                     [8]

                             Text and image removed for copyright reasons




      (a)   (i)   Identify four characteristics that may be required by a system when setting up
                  a strong password.                                                                    [4]

		(ii)            Passwords are often set to expire periodically, such as every 90 days. Identify two
                  reasons why passwords are set to expire on a regular basis.                           [2]

      (b)   Compare the security of typing a password with the security of using a finger scan.         [6]

      (c)   To what extent is it acceptable for the State of Furlong to hold sensitive data in its
            criminal database?                                                                          [8]

4.    Donating or disposing of old computers

      The C&R Company will be buying 200 new computers and donating their existing equipment to a
      school in Haiti. The peripheral devices will be donated along with the computers.

      Some C&R employees store personal data on the hard disk (drive) of their computer. This data must
      be backed up before it can be deleted. The school will decide what kind of operating system will be
      installed on the donated computers.

      The company will deliver completely functional computers to the school in Haiti.

      The school in Haiti will be responsible for acquiring and installing all software except for the
      operating system.


      (a)   (i)   Identify two peripheral devices.                                                       [2]

		(ii)            Identify two methods the C&R Company can use to save data from the hard disk
                  before they delete it.                                                                 [2]

		(iii) Identify two methods to remove all the information from these hard disks that
        does not physically destroy the disk.                                                            [2]

      (b)   Explain three factors that could influence the decision by the school in Haiti to use open
            source or proprietary software on the donated computers.                                     [6]

      (c)   Other companies are considering whether it is better to donate or dispose of obsolete
            equipment. Evaluate these two options.                                                       [8]

5.    Using social networking data

      Social networking sites, such as Twitter, can provide indications of a potential disease outbreak faster
      than traditional disease surveillance methods. By the time public health alerts are issued and the
      media picks up the story, people have already been talking about an illness for several weeks on social
      networking sites. Web applications use Twitter to monitor and produce automated reports on what
      illnesses people are talking about most frequently.

      Having real-time information publicly available through social networking sites like Twitter could be
      revolutionary for health officials watching out for the first clues to new, emerging infectious diseases
      in their communities and for modernizing public health systems.

      The shaded areas show the frequency of use of the keyword “flu” based on the location of the devices
      that were used to make the Twitter posting.

      Using data mining, early identification of health trends can help minimize the spread of disease.

		(ii)            Identify two data fields that could be collected and stored in a database from the
                  Twitter postings.                                                                      [2]
