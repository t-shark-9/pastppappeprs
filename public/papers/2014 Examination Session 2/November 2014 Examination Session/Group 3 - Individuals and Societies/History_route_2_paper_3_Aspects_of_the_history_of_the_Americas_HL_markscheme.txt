Paper 3 markbands: The following bands provide a précis of the full markbands for paper 3 published in the
History guide (2008) on pages 77–81. They are intended to assist marking, but must be used in conjunction
with the full markbands found in the guide. For the attention of all examiners: if you are uncertain about
the content/accuracy of a candidate’s work please contact your team leader.

 18–20: Answers are clearly focused with a high degree of the awareness of the question and may
        challenge it successfully. Knowledge is extensive, accurately applied and there may be a high
        level of conceptual ability. Evaluation of different approaches may be present as may be
        understanding of historical processes as well as comparison and contrast where relevant.
        Evaluation is integrated into the answer. The answer is well-structured and well-focused.
        Synthesis is highly developed.
 15–17: Answers are clearly structured and focused, have full awareness of the demands of the
        question, and if appropriate may challenge it. Accurate and detailed historical knowledge is
        used convincingly to support critical commentary. Historical processes such as comparison
        and contrast, placing events in context and evaluating different interpretations are used
        appropriately and effectively. Answers are well-structured and balanced and synthesis is well-
        developed and supported with knowledge and critical commentary.
 12–14: Answers are clearly focused on the demands of the question. Relevant in-depth knowledge is
        applied as evidence, and analysis or critical commentary are used to indicate some in-depth
        understanding but is not consistent throughout. Events are placed in context and there is
        sound understanding of historical processes and comparison and contrast. Evaluation of
        different approaches may be used to substantiate arguments presented. Synthesis is present
        but not always consistently integrated. Focus on AO3 and AO4.
 9–11: Answers indicate that the question is understood but not all implications considered.
        Knowledge is largely accurate. Critical commentary may be present. Events are generally
        placed in context, and historical processes, such as comparison and contrast, are understood.
        There is a clear attempt at a structured approach. Focus on AO1, AO2 and AO4. Responses
        that simply summarize the views of historians cannot reach the top of this markband.
 7–8:   The demands of the question are generally understood. Relevant, historical knowledge is
        present but is unevenly applied. Knowledge is narrative or descriptive in nature. There may
        be limited argument that requires further substantiation. Critical commentary may be present.
        There is an attempt to place events in historical context and show an understanding of
        historical processes. An attempt at a structured approach, either chronological or thematic has
        been made.
 5–6:   Answers indicate some understanding of the question, but historical knowledge is limited in
        quality and quantity.       Understanding of historical processes may be present but
        underdeveloped. The question is only partially addressed.
 3–4:   There is little understanding of the question. Historical knowledge is present but the detail is
        insufficient. Historical context or processes are barely understood and there are little more
        than poorly substantiated assertions.
 1–2:   Answers do not meet the demands of the question and show little or no evidence of
        appropriate structure. There is little more than unsupported generalization.
 0:       Answers not meeting the requirements of descriptors should be awarded no marks.

 Examiners and moderators are reminded of the need to apply the markbands that provide the “best fit” to
 the responses given by candidates and to award credit wherever it is possible to do so. If an answer
 indicates that the demands of the question are understood and addressed but that not all implications are
 considered (eg, compare or contrast; reasons or significance; methods or success), then examiners should
 not be afraid of using the full range of marks allowed for by the markscheme: ie, responses that offer good
 coverage of some of the criteria should be rewarded accordingly.

Independence movements

1.   Compare and contrast the causes of two independence movements in the Americas.

     Candidates have a number of independence movements from which they can choose, including the
     American Revolution, the Haitian Revolution, the Mexican independence movement originating
     with Father Hidalgo, the South American independence movements of Simon Bolivar and
     Jose de San Martin as well as the Brazilian movement led by Dom Pedro. Reasons could include:
     rejection of mercantilism; trade and taxation issues; class rivalry; social or racial inequality;
     restriction of political rights and the impact of the Enlightenment. With each of these reasons, and
     others that are applicable, the candidates should develop the specific examples for the independence
     movements selected. Answers must address the reasons, not methods, concerning the rise of the
     selected independence movements.

     The Mexican Revolution is not a valid example of an independence movement. While the
     movement in Cuba culminating in its independence in 1898 can be considered relevant, reference to
     Castro´s Cuban Revolution of 1959 is not.

     The above material is an indication of what candidates may elect to write about in their responses.
     However, it is not exhaustive and no set answer is required.

     Examiners and moderators are reminded of the need to apply the markbands that provide the
     “best fit” to the responses given by candidates and to award credit wherever it is possible to do so.


2.   Evaluate the economic and social impact of independence in one country of the Americas
     between 1770 and 1830.

     Any one country in the Americas is acceptable. Impact of independence will vary depending on the
     country selected. For all countries, the cost of the independence movement affected the
     post-independence economy.

     For the United States, candidates may say that there was very little change in either area, but it
     should be noted that independence ended the mercantile restrictions on trade with other countries
     and that some social changes did occur. Many loyalists left the country and resettled in Canada.
     Some slaves fought for the British, gained their freedom and settled elsewhere. Native Americans
     became even more marginalized. There were no new social classes or any real social upheaval.

     For Latin America, opportunities for social mobility opened up for some classes, like the Creoles,
     and there was some redistribution of power in favour of the rural sectors at the expense of the urban
     merchant elites. For some Latin American countries, independence from Spain brought about the
     collapse of the colonial economic system resulting in exploitation by foreign investors.

     The independence of Cuba in 1898 is outside the timeframe of the question.

     However, it is not exhaustive and no set answer is required.

Nation-building and challenges

3.   “The US Constitution of 1787 was a bundle of compromises.” To what extent do you agree
     with this statement?

     Most candidates will agree with the quote and are likely to identify several compromises that were
     reached before acceptance of the Constitution. The delegates to the Constitutional Convention
     agreed that the Articles of the Confederation were inadequate, but were unsure of what changes
     to make. The Constitution that was written was a compromise between the views of the delegates.
     The first issue of disagreement was representation (between populous states that supported
     proportional representation and smaller states that supported equal representation). This issue was
     settled by the Great Compromise, in which the legislature consisted of two houses;
     a House of Representatives, with representation based on population, and a Senate, where each state
     would have equal representation. Another issue of debate was whether slaves should be counted in
     determining the number of members a state was allowed in the House of Representatives. A
     compromise was reached known as the Three-Fifth Compromise: five slaves were to be counted as
     three free persons for both representation and direct taxation. They did not, however, have the right
     to vote. The third compromise came over the issue of the presidency. The disagreement about term
     of office and method of election was settled by authorizing a four year term and establishing the
     procedure for electing the President through an electoral college. The next compromise was about
     tariffs. The conflict was between southern states (agricultural) that did not want Congress to pass a
     tariff on their exports, and the northern states (trade) that wanted the central government to have
     power for uniform legislation on navigation and protection of shipping. In order to resolve this
     conflict, Congress was granted the power to control foreign trade and levy taxes on imports only.
     Candidates might also mention the compromise made concerning inclusion of a Bill of Rights in
     order to get ratification.

     Candidates might also choose to challenge the ‘extent’ of compromise by developing examples of
     consensus for change that were agreed upon in the early stages of the Constitutional Convention (ie
     decision to replace the Articles of Confederation, creation of a three-branch system of government,
     granting power of taxation to the national government, etc).

     The question does not require a description of the problems with the “Articles of
     Confederation” period. The focus of the question must be on the issues about which the delegates
     disagreed and the extent to which the problems were solved by compromises. Answers should
     address the specific compromises.

     The above material is an indication of what candidates may elect to write about in their responses.
     However, it is not exhaustive and no set answer is required.

     Examiners and moderators are reminded of the need to apply the markbands that provide the
     “best fit” to the responses given by candidates and to award credit wherever it is possible to do so.

4.   Evaluate the challenges to the establishment of a political system in one newly independent
     Latin American country between 1800 and 1850.

     Candidates may choose any Latin American country that gained independence from its ruling nation
     during the colonial period. Mexico, Argentina, Venezuela and Brazil may be the most
     popular choices. The challenges will vary depending upon the country chosen, but there are
     some commonalities. In all countries, the colonial legacy remained and new nations had to face the
     challenges that it presented. In most cases, the Creoles sought to replace the Peninsulars as political
     leaders, and established republics (except in Brazil). Constitutions were written that created either
     parliamentary or representative governments with three branches of government, though in practice
     it may have seemed much different. The illiteracy of much of the population and the distinct social
     and economic classes made democracy difficult. Nearly all Latin American countries were divided
     between conservatives and liberals. This division created challenges for forming functioning
     governments. Generally speaking, conservatives favoured large landowners, the Catholic Church,
     the military and established business groups. Hence, conservatives tended to favour strong,
     centralized government and special privilege for the military and the Church. Liberals tended to
     include those that had previously been outside the political realm. This meant professionals,
     new business owners and artisans. They sought to dismantle the established system that had
     prevented them from participation. Neither liberals nor conservatives paid much attention to the
     plight of Indians or mestizos.

     This division between conservatives and liberals often resulted in rebellions or revolts by those out
     of power. For most Latin American countries, these challenges to establishing political systems
     resulted in dictatorships by caudillos.

United States Civil War: causes, course and effects 1840–1877

5.   Evaluate the methods and effectiveness of slave resistance in the southern United States from
     1800 to 1860.

     Answers should focus on both methods and effectiveness of slave resistance.

     Methods could include simple forms of resistance such as working slowly, feigning illness,
     breaking tools, to more complex tactics such as running away or starting an uprising.
     The Underground Railroad and slave revolts led by Prosser, Vesey, and Turner could be mentioned.

     Effectiveness would depend on interpretation. In many cases the resistance was short-lived and
     brought about negative results such as harsher treatment, enactment of fugitive slave laws, and
     greater fear of slave revolts. In other cases, more positive results were achieved such as freedom in
     the North or Canada and the growth of the abolitionist movement and personal liberty laws in
     the North.

     The above material is an indication of what candidates may elect to write about in their responses.
     However, it is not exhaustive and no set answer is required.

     “best fit” to the responses given by candidates and to award credit wherever it is possible to do so.


6.   “The issue of states’ rights was the major reason for the secession of the Southern states.”
     To what extent do you agree with this view?

     Candidates’ answers should centre on the reasons for Southern secession and the role played by the
     issue of states’ rights. In dealing with “to what extent”, answers may reflect various levels
     of agreement. Answers should centre on the role of states’ rights, with those who are in agreement
     showing the reasons for this with some discussion of other factors. Those who disagree with the
     viewpoint will make their case using other factors (slavery, economic differences, westward
     expansion, etc) but they must still address those factors in connection to why they are more
     important than states’ rights. Some candidates will partially agree with the viewpoint and blend a
     variety of factors to show their impact. Candidates should provide specific detail showing the direct
     connection of the factors to Southern secession. Note that answers that disagree with the viewpoint
     and then discuss other factors without dealing with states’ rights have not fully answered the
     question.

The development of modern nations 1865–1929

7.   Evaluate the successes and failures of Theodore Roosevelt’s domestic policies (1901–1909).

     Roosevelt’s domestic program was known as the Square Deal. In this he advocated many of the
     ideas of Progressivism. Candidates are likely to identify some of the following as his successes:
     resolution of the Anthracite Coal Strike of 1902; trust busting in the cases of JP Morgan’s Northern
     Securities Railroad and Rockefeller’s Standard Oil; railroad reforms in the Elkins and Hepburn
     Acts; consumer protection in the Meat Inspection Act and the Pure Food and Drug Act; advocating
     for the conservation movement with the Newlands Reclamation Act and the creation of national
     parks and forests. Failures might be seen in his inability to lower the tariff, the Panic of 1907, his
     limited trust busting and his limited support of African-Americans.

     The question is limited to domestic policies. Strengthening the US Navy could be seen as a
     domestic policy, but any discussion of Roosevelt’s foreign policy is not relevant.

     The above material is an indication of what candidates may elect to write about in their responses.
     However, it is not exhaustive and no set answer is required.

8.   Examine the consequences of immigration for one country of the Americas from 1865 to 1929.

     Candidates may answer this question using any country in the Americas. Likely examples could be
     the United States, Canada, Argentina, Brazil, Chile and Peru. Immigrants from Europe and Asia
     resettled in many countries in the region. Candidates need to provide specific examples of origin of
     immigrants, where they went, what they did and the impact they had on the country chosen.

     Answers will vary depending on the country chosen, but some of the common aspects that might be
     discussed would be larger labour supply, rapid industrialization, increased number of consumers,
     urbanization and creation of ethnic neighbourhoods. Candidates might address commercial
     development in industries in which immigrants specialized. Other areas that might be discussed
     could be political impact and the growth of political machines, assimilation, cultural developments,
     and ethnic tensions, either between the new immigrants or between the new immigrants and the old
     immigrants.

Emergence of the Americas in global affairs 1880–1929

9.   Examine the effects of the Spanish-American War (1898) on both Cuba and the United States.

     For Cuba, independence was gained, but in a limited fashion. US military occupation continued
     for several years until Cuba reluctantly agreed to add the Platt Amendment to their constitution.
     The amendment gave the US the right to intervene in Cuban affairs, which the US did several times.
     Cuba suffered several thousand deaths in their struggle for independence, though the number
     particular to the Spanish-American War is difficult to determine. Cuba did write a constitution and
     practiced a degree of self-government. Economic ties to the US remained strong.

     For the US, the Spanish-American War increased national pride and unity. The US gained
     Puerto Rico, Guam and the Philippines, though not without some additional fighting especially in
     the case of the Philippines. These gains furthered the growing imperialism of the US as later seen
     in the Roosevelt Corollary and the accompanying actions in the Caribbean. US deaths were
     minimal, occurring more from disease than combat. Arguably, the Spanish-American War made
     the US a world power. Candidates might also include the Rough Riders’ fame, the rise of
     Teddy Roosevelt, and the small, but growing, Anti-Imperialist League in the United States.

10.   Examine the impact of the First World War on the foreign policy of two countries of the
      Americas up to 1929.

      The answer to this question will vary depending upon which two nations are selected by
      the candidates. Although any nation in the Americas could be selected for this question the
      United States and Canada may be the two most popular choices. Candidates may address the
      impact during the war and impact in the immediate post-war era.

      For the United States candidates may discuss: the policy of neutrality and its implementation;
      reactions to the events of war (British blockade, German unrestricted submarine warfare, the
      Zimmerman Telegram, etc); attempts to influence peace as a neutral entering the war; and US
      efforts to conclude a peace in Paris, and the resulting post-war isolationism.

      In reviewing the impact on Canada, answers may reflect the change from following an imperial
      foreign policy set by Britain to establishing a more autonomous policy within the Empire.
      Discussions of Prime Minister Borden’s role on the Imperial War Cabinet, the significant Canadian
      commitment to the war, signing the peace agreement and being a member of the League of Nations
      and lack of support for Britain in the 1922 Chanak crisis would be examples of how Canadian
      foreign policy evolved due to the impact of the war.

      Candidates may select a Latin American nation and address their foreign policy, which could
      range from neutrality throughout the war, support of the Allies or an actual declaration of war.
      Brazil may be the most selected nation due to its decision to be an active military participant in
      the conflict, but answers may successfully discuss the decision of other nations to remain neutral
      and how the war had an impact on that policy.

      In order to provide a successful answer to the question candidates must address the foreign policy of
      a nation and not simply outline a nation’s actions during the conflict.

The Mexican Revolution 1910–1940

11.   “Political factors were more important than economic factors                      in   causing   the
      Mexican Revolution.” To what extent do you agree with this statement?

      The question asks for candidates to judge the relative importance of both of these factors as causes.
      Either might be seen as the most important factor. Successful candidates will weigh the merits of
      each and support their argument with historical detail.

      Political factors could be: the corrupt dictatorship of Diaz; the Cientificos; the formation of the
      Anti-Re-election Party; the rigged election of 1910; Madero’s Plan of San Luis Potosi; the
      disenfranchisement of the majority of Mexico’s population.

      Economic factors could be: low wages and working conditions; the increasing number of strikes;
      foreign ownership of resources and a desire for land reform. Other causes could be class struggle
      between the lower classes of mestizos, indigenous peoples and the elite; poor education,
      and the power of the Catholic Church.

12.   “As a Mexican revolutionary leader, Francisco Madero’s policies led to more achievements
      than failures.” To what extent do you agree with this statement?

      Answers to this question may focus on Madero’s policies concerning implementing democracy in
      Mexico through the removal of Porfirio Diaz and the implementation of a democratic political
      system with emphasis on governing by “rule of law”. Candidates may mention Madero’s work
      La Sucesión Presidencial en 1910, his candidacy for the Presidency representing the Anti-Re-
      election Party, the Plan of San Luis Potosi and the Treaty of Ciudad Juarez in looking at general
      policies and methods of implementation. Examples of policies where judgments can be made
      include: political transition from the Diaz regime to the election of Madero; reform of the political
      process; establishment of a National Agrarian Commission; formation of a Department of Labour;
      and education reform. Most candidates will reflect on the depth, quality and longevity of Madero’s
      policies to determine their level of achievement.

The Great Depression and the Americas 1929–1939

13.   Discuss the causes of the Great Depression in one country of the Americas.

      Answers will vary depending on the country selected. The United States, Canada and Brazil will
      probably be popular choices, but any country in the region is acceptable. Though causes will vary,
      they may include: overproduction; falling prices of agricultural commodities; unequal distribution
      of income; high tariffs; decreased world trade; failure of the banking system; unemployment and the
      collapse of the US stock market and its effect on the world economy. Do not expect all of these,
      but candidates should deal with specific causes for whichever country is chosen. Since the question
      is about causes, candidates will have to show knowledge of events in the 1920s that led to the Great
      Depression.

14.   With reference to one Latin American country, examine the effectiveness of its response to
      economic problems between 1929 and 1939.

      The most probable choices for answering this question will be Argentina and Brazil, but accept any
      relevant country.

      Both Argentina and Brazil introduced Import Substitution Industrialization (ISI) as a means for
      stimulating economic growth. In Argentina, the Concordancia sought to establish new industries to
      reduce dependency, signed the Roca Runciman Treaty, and established Juntas Reguladoras. In
      Brazil, Getulio Vargas implemented import quotas, exchange controls, and low interest loans to
      stimulate industrialization and modernization; he diversified agriculture, made improvements in
      transport and communication and placed mineral resources and key industries under national
      ownership. In both countries, ISI was fairly successful in fighting the Depression. By 1934,
      Argentina’s economy had improved and industrialization was largely responsible for that. In
      Brazil, industrial output doubled between 1931 and 1936.

      Any other relevant government policy may be addressed.

The Second World War and the Americas 1933–1945

15.   To what extent could the United States be considered neutral from 1935 to 7 December 1941?

      The question allows the candidate to determine how neutral the US was in the years leading up to
      its declaration of war in the Second World War. Candidates are likely to discuss the official
      position of neutrality as indicated by the passage of the Neutrality Acts of 1935, 1936 and 1937 and
      the growth of the America First Committee and its Fortress America philosophy. At the same time,
      candidates should recognize the less than neutral actions of the Neutrality Act of 1939, the
      destroyers for bases trade with Britain, the patrolling of the western Atlantic by the US, the Lend–
      Lease Act of 1941, the Atlantic Charter, as well as economic sanctions the US imposed against
      Japan.

16.   Examine the economic effects of the Second World War on one country of the Americas
      until 1945.

      Answers will vary depending upon which nation’s economic effects are selected for assessment.
      Depending on the country chosen possible issues which could be discussed include: the ending of
      the Great Depression; conversion from a peacetime to wartime economy; employment growth with
      opportunities for women and minorities; stabilization policies; price and wage controls;
      government control of the allocation of resources and production; increased revenues to fund the
      war effort; and an expanded export market in resources needed for the war effort.

      In the United States examples of programmes that might be mentioned include the War Production
      Board, War Manpower Commission, Office of Economic Stabilization and the Office of Price
      Administration.

      While in Canada the National War Labour Order, the Wartime Prices and Trade Board and the
      Department of Munitions and Supply are examples of programmes that indicate the economic
      impact of the war on the nation. Economic effects of the Second World War in Latin America
      varied from countries challenged by the loss of American and European markets (Caribbean and
      Central American countries) to those that were able to implement industrialization (Argentina,
      Brazil and Mexico).

      Although answers will address policies and programmes, candidates should assess the effects of
      these programmes and not simply list the actions of the nation. Candidates should avoid general
      descriptions of the economic effects without specific information.

Political developments in the Americas after the Second World War 1945–1979

17.   Examine the achievements of Eisenhower’s domestic policies (1953–1961).

      Eisenhower called his domestic policy “dynamic conservatism”. His achievements could be seen in
      limiting the growth of the federal government and cutting spending. He balanced the federal budget
      three times during his presidency. Notable accomplishments that might be discussed are the
      Federal-Aid Highway Act (National Interstate Highway Act), which created the interstate highway
      system; the National Defense Education Act, which provided college loans for impoverished
      students and sought to improve the teaching of mathematics and science; creation of the Department
      of Health, Education and Welfare; expansion of Social Security; support for the civil rights
      movement by sending federal troops to force integration in Little Rock, Arkansas and by seeking to
      end segregation in Washington, DC schools. Though the Civil Rights Acts of 1957 and 1960 were
      passed during his administration, Eisenhower did little to achieve this. Some might see his actions
      against organized labour and illegal immigrants as achievements.

18.   To what extent were social issues the major cause of the Cuban Revolution of the 1950s?

      Education, health care, poor housing and social inequality are areas that may be addressed in
      looking at the social issues, which could be labelled causes of the Revolution. Candidates may also
      discuss other causes of the Revolution citing the economic and political issues that played a role in
      the revolt against the Batista government. Corrupt government practices, land consolidation, a large
      landless population, resentment of foreign ownership and oppressive government policies could
      also be cited as causes for discontent. Answers may refer to the five revolutionary laws indicating
      the goals of the early revolution to support their positions. Even if the answers include other issues
      that are regarded as being more important the candidates should include these within a discussion
      that addresses the relative importance of the social issues.

The Cold War and the Americas 1945–1981

19.   Evaluate the impact of Jimmy Carter’s human rights policies on Latin America’s relationship
      with the United States.

      Both the positive and negative impacts of Carter’s policy decisions could be considered by
      candidates in this answer. Policy issues addressing human rights may range from conflict resolution
      to democratization and North-South discussion of concerns. Changes in policy actions that could
      be introduced by candidates include transparency and multilateral cooperation. Examples of areas
      that might be considered are Panama, Nicaragua, El Salvador, Haiti, Venezuela, Argentina, Chile
      and Brazil. The Panama Canal Treaties, the American Convention on Human Rights and support
      for the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights are topics that may be discussed by
      candidates to show a relationship between policy and action. Candidates may comment on changes
      occurring during the Carter administration from early successes to more limited developments at the
      end of the administration.

20.   Discuss the factors which influenced the foreign policy of either Canada or one Latin
      American country between 1945 and 1960.

      Answers will vary considerably based on the country chosen, but candidates need to focus on the
      reasons for the foreign policy, not necessarily the foreign policy itself.

      For Canada, candidates could mention its proximity to the United States and its ties to
      Western Europe. Canadians also feared communist expansion, though perhaps not as much as
      the US. This led them to join NATO and later, to their participation in the Korean War. Close
      economic ties to the US pointed Canada towards collaboration and cooperation. However, Canada
      also desired to be its own nation and, at times, it disagreed with the US as indicated by Canada’s
      lack of participation in the Berlin Airlift.

      For countries in Latin America, proximity and desire for economic aid affected foreign policy.
      For many Latin American countries, there was a strong desire for increased strength through
      hemispheric cooperation though not US domination. Formation of regional organizations such as
      the OAS (1948) and the signing of mutual defence treaties such as the Inter-American Treaty of
      Reciprocal Assistance (Rio Pact, 1947) indicate a stronger willingness towards multilateralism.
      However, for some countries, Argentina for example, there was a strong desire to be independent of
      the ideological divide of the Cold War.

Civil rights and social movements in the Americas

21.   Examine the reasons for, and the success of, Native Americans’ (indigenous people’s)
      increased demand for civil rights in one country of the Americas after 1945.

      Answers will vary depending on the movement and the country chosen. Possible choices could be
      the American Indian Movement in the United States in the 1960s and 1970s, the First Nations
      movement in Canada, or the Zapatista Army of National Liberation in Chiapas, Mexico in
      the 1990s. Reasons why will vary but most centre around the desire for equality, a correction of
      past injustices, restitution of lands, and the poor socio-economic conditions of many indigenous
      people. Other civil rights movements also created an impetus for these movements. Success, in
      most cases, was minimal except for a few legal challenges and public recognition. It should be
      noted however that in some countries, legislation was passed to improve the conditions of
      indigenous people.

22.   To what extent was the Civil Rights Movement successful in ending segregation in the South
      between 1955 and 1965?

      Answers should not only discuss the events that occurred during the decade represented in the
      question but there should be some indication as to the extent of success in ending segregation
      brought about by the events or actions. There may be some variance as to how candidates judge
      success but this should be indicated in the essay. Actions like the Montgomery bus boycott, the
      Little Rock Nine and school desegregation, sit-ins at the lunch counter in Greensboro, NC, Freedom
      Riders, March on Washington (“I Have a Dream” speech), Birmingham marches (Bombing of the
      Sixteenth Street Baptist Church, Letter from the Birmingham Jail), Freedom Summer in Mississippi
      (voter registration drive), and the Selma to Montgomery march are all events that might be
      discussed as helping to end segregation. Successes relating to these events that candidates may
      discuss include desegregation of public transportation, schools, public dining facilities, interstate
      public transport facilities and voter registration and rights. Candidates may culminate their essay in
      a discussion of the impact of these events on the passage of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and the
      Voting Rights Act of 1965.

Into the 21st century — from the 1980s to 2000

23.   Compare and contrast the foreign policies of Reagan and Clinton.

      Candidates are likely to find many more differences than similarities. Reagan’s foreign policy was
      dominated by the containment philosophy, while Clinton’s did not have that central theme as the
      Soviet Union had collapsed between the two presidencies. Reagan’s actions were more likely to be
      unilateral, whereas Clinton often sought concerted action by either the UN or NATO. A similarity
      could be that both dealt with issues in the Middle East, particularly Israel and the PLO.

      During Reagan’s first term, he took a hard line against the USSR and ended detente. He imposed
      sanctions on the USSR after it had cracked down on dissidents in Poland and greatly increased
      defence spending, including the Strategic Defense Initiative (SDI). It wasn’t until Reagan’s second
      term and Gorbachev’s emergence as leader of the USSR, that relations between the two
      countries improved. In 1987 Reagan and Gorbachev signed the Intermediate Nuclear Forces Treaty
      (INF), actually decreasing the number of nuclear weapons. In the Caribbean, Reagan supported
      anti-communist dictators and sent aid to anti-communist insurgents.

      Clinton dealt with a variety of issues and countries including: Somalia and the withdrawal of the US
      presence there; Haiti and the restoration of democracy; and ending the civil war and genocide in
      Bosnia and Kosovo through the Dayton Accords of 1995.

24.   Examine the efforts in the Americas to address threats to the environment during the period
      1980 to 2000.

      Candidates may address actions that are both reactive and proactive. They may also discuss efforts
      of the government institutions and/or non-governmental organizations (NGOs).

      Areas that could be developed include reaction to incidents of pollution, management of hazardous
      materials, climate change, natural resource management (examples could include marine, wetlands,
      deforestation) and sustainable development. The efforts discussed must centre on the Americas but
      may include broader international decisions with impact on the nations of the Americas.

      Examples of actions that may be referenced include the reaction to the Exxon Valdez oil spill and its
      impact, the Montreal Protocol of 1987 and the Earth Summit in Rio de Janeiro 1992 that produced
      the “Rio Principles”. These are only a few examples of actions taken and candidates could use
      these or others that are appropriate in their discussion. Regional actions that also address
      environmental issues, such as the North American Trade Agreement, may also be a part of
      candidates’ answers.

      When addressing actions candidates may look at government regulations, subsidization, support for
      international rules or restrictions, actions specific to an environmental incident, actions by NGOs in
      both funding and prevention and either support or lack of support for long term goals that have been
      introduced by the international community.

      It is important that candidates focus on actions within the time parameters (1980–2000) and address
      the actions of nations in the Americas. In answering the question the candidate may focus on one
      nation and develop that fully or there may be a broader approach that looks at actions by a number
      of nations in the Americas.

      The above material is an indication of what candidates may elect to write about in their responses.
