1.    Magic Medicine Cabinet

      A new product is being developed for your bathroom, the Magic Medicine Cabinet (MMC).
      It is a smart appliance for supporting family health care. It includes a number of technologies that
      can remind the user to take the right medication, track vital signs, access up-to-date personalized
      health information, and interact online with doctors and pharmacists. John Dudley has recently
      purchased one for the family.




                                     Photo removed for copyright reasons




            The MMC recognizes which medication John is holding, and warns him if he is taking the
                                          wrong medication.

(Question 1 continued)

      The MMC can remind John to take medication through both audio output and the embedded display
      while he is looking in the mirror. The implementation of the MMC incorporates the following
      technologies:
      • face recognition of people who approach the cabinet
      • radio frequency identification (RFID) based smart labels (tags) attached to the individual medication
      • vital sign sensors to monitor blood pressure and heart rate
      • audio output to speak the text that is shown on the cabinet display.

      John interacts with the MMC through its touch-sensitive screen, voice input, and the different sensors
      such as those to monitor blood pressure.

      Some health authorities are considering introducing the MMC in remote areas or in the homes of
      patients who cannot easily get to a doctor’s office.

3.    Donating or disposing of old computers

      The C&R Company will be buying 200 new computers and donating their existing equipment to a
      school in Haiti. The peripheral devices will be donated along with the computers.

      Some C&R employees store personal data on the hard disk (drive) of their computer. This data must
      be backed up before it can be deleted. The school will decide what kind of operating system will be
      installed on the donated computers.

      The company will deliver completely functional computers to the school in Haiti.

      The school in Haiti will be responsible for acquiring and installing all software except for the
      operating system.


      (a)   (i)   Identify two peripheral devices.                                                       [2]

		(ii)            Identify two methods the C&R Company can use to save data from the hard disk
                  before they delete it.                                                                 [2]

		(iii) Identify two methods to remove all the information from these hard disks that
        does not physically destroy the disk.                                                            [2]

      (b)   Explain three factors that could influence the decision by the school in Haiti to use open
            source or proprietary software on the donated computers.                                     [6]

      (c)   Other companies are considering whether it is better to donate or dispose of obsolete
            equipment. Evaluate these two options.                                                       [8]

4.    Disaster management strategies

      Cyclone Betty struck Mackay in Northern Queensland, Australia in 2013. This led to the tax office
      being flooded and the IT network being severely damaged. The server room was located in the
      basement where most of the flooding occurred.

      At the time, the tax office was handling sensitive financial data of over 1 million people.

      As a result of the flooding, much of the data held on the tax office servers was lost and due to
      inadequate backup procedures, much of it could not be recovered. Even though there were regular
      backups, it became clear the way they were done was not reliable. The network manager was the
      person in charge of backing up the data.

      The tax office IT staff needed to reinstall the licensed software on the new servers.


      (a)   (i)   Identify two actions that should have been taken to ensure the backing up of data
                  was done reliably.                                                                     [2]

		(ii)            Identify two methods that could be used to reinstall licensed software on the
                  client machines.                                                                       [2]

		(iii) Outline the purpose of an uninterruptible power supply (UPS) for the tax office.                 [2]

      (b)   The management team of the tax office is considering installing a virtual private network
            (VPN) to allow employees to work away from the office. They will be carrying out a
            feasibility study.

            Explain three considerations that should be included in a feasibility study to ensure that
            the VPN meets the requirements of the tax office.                                            [6]

      (c)   The management team of the tax office have realized that their previous disaster
            recovery plan was insufficient. As part of the analysis phase for the development of
            a future disaster recovery plan, they are considering various plans for setting up
            offsite backup. Two possible options are:
            • in a different office in a nearby city
            • cloud storage.

            Evaluate these two options.                                                                  [8]

      Earlet, a major Canadian clothing retailer, has commissioned Eliboms to develop a new information
      system that will replace the existing one. As part of the project, a thorough stakeholder analysis
      was carried out.

      Once this analysis had been carried out, a Gantt chart was created to show the proposed timeline of
      the development of the project. The project will be managed using a waterfall method.


      (a)   (i)   Identify four components of an information system.                                                  [4]

		(ii)            State two aspects of the project that need to be agreed upon with the client during
                  the initial interview.                                                                              [2]

      (b)   (i)   Explain one advantage of using a Gantt chart.                                                       [2]

		(ii)            Distinguish between the use of the waterfall method and the agile method in the
                  development of a new information system for Earlet.                                                 [4]

      (c)   The project was not a success because the final product did not meet the
            client’s requirements.

            Discuss how Eliboms (the developer) could involve various stakeholders during the
            different stages of the project system to ensure it meets the needs of Earlet (the client).               [8]

7.    Artiﬁcial intelligence in the classroom




                            [Source: www.advancedtechnologykorea.com/6372/, 16 November 2012]



      This is not a sci-fi movie! It is an English language class taught by Engkey, a first-generation
      robot teacher, in the coastal city of Masan in South Korea. Engkey is controlled by a teacher in the
      Philippines where labour costs are much lower.

      Engkey says: “Where do you live?”
      Student says: “I live in Masan.”
      Engkey says: “Good, well done.”

      There are plans to develop a second-generation version of Engkey, which will be able to teach
      autonomously. At the moment Engkey can only respond to a limited number of phrases that are
      stored in its database.

             [Source: adapted from http://edition.cnn.com/2010/TECH/innovation/10/22/south.korea.robot.teachers/index.html,

      (a)   (i)    Identify two of Engkey’s sensors.                                                                          [2]

            (ii)   Identify the steps that Engkey would use to respond to a student asking a question.                        [4]

      (b)   (i)    Explain the relationship between a knowledge base and an inference engine in an
                   expert system.                                                                                             [2]

            (ii)   Explain two ways that Engkey could be developed to be more effective as a teacher.                         [4]

      (c)   To what extent should robots such as Engkey replace a human teacher for teaching
            English?                                                                                                          [8]
