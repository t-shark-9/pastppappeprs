Paper 3 markbands: The following bands provide a précis of the full markbands for paper 3 published in the
History guide (2008) on pages 77–81. They are intended to assist marking but must be used in conjunction
with the full markbands found in the guide. For the attention of all examiners: if you are uncertain about
the content/accuracy of a candidate’s work please contact your team leader.

 18–20: Answers are clearly focused with a high degree of the awareness of the question and may
        challenge it successfully. Knowledge is extensive, accurately applied and there may be a high
        level of conceptual ability. Evaluation of different approaches may be present as may be
        understanding of historical processes as well as comparison and contrast where relevant.
        Evaluation is integrated into the answer. The answer is well-structured and well-focused.
        Synthesis is highly developed.
 15–17: Answers are clearly structured and focused, have full awareness of the demands of the
        question, and if appropriate may challenge it. Accurate and detailed historical knowledge is
        used convincingly to support critical commentary. Historical processes such as comparison
        and contrast, placing events in context and evaluating different interpretations are used
        appropriately and effectively. Answers are well-structured and balanced and synthesis is well-
        developed and supported with knowledge and critical commentary.
 12–14: Answers are clearly focused on the demands of the question. Relevant in-depth knowledge is
        applied as evidence, and analysis or critical commentary are used to indicate some in-depth
        understanding but is not consistent throughout. Events are placed in context and there is
        sound understanding of historical processes and comparison and contrast. Evaluation of
        different approaches may be used to substantiate arguments presented. Synthesis is present
        but not always consistently integrated. Focus on AO3 and AO4.
 9–11: Answers indicate that the question is understood but not all implications considered.
        Knowledge is largely accurate. Critical commentary may be present. Events are generally
        placed in context, and historical processes, such as comparison and contrast, are understood.
        There is a clear attempt at a structured approach. Focus on AO1, AO2 and AO4. Responses
        that simply summarize the views of historians cannot reach the top of this markband.
 7–8:   The demands of the question are generally understood. Relevant, historical knowledge is
        present but is unevenly applied. Knowledge is narrative or descriptive in nature. There may
        be limited argument that requires further substantiation. Critical commentary may be present.
        There is an attempt to place events in historical context and show an understanding of
        historical processes. An attempt at a structured approach, either chronological or thematic has
        been made.
 5–6:   Answers indicate some understanding of the question, but historical knowledge is limited in
        quality and quantity.       Understanding of historical processes may be present but
        underdeveloped. The question is only partially addressed.
 3–4:   There is little understanding of the question. Historical knowledge is present but the detail is
        insufficient. Historical context or processes are barely understood and there are little more
        than poorly substantiated assertions.
 1–2:   Answers do not meet the demands of the question and show little or no evidence of
        appropriate structure. There is little more than unsupported generalization.
 0:       Answers not meeting the requirements of descriptors should be awarded no marks.

 Examiners and moderators are reminded of the need to apply the markbands that provide the “best fit” to
 the responses given by candidates and to award credit wherever it is possible to do so. If an answer
 indicates that the demands of the question are understood and addressed but that not all implications are
 considered (eg, compare or contrast; reasons or significance; methods or success), then examiners should
 not be afraid of using the full range of marks allowed for by the markscheme: ie, responses that offer good
 coverage of some of the criteria should be rewarded accordingly.

Colonialism in South and Southeast Asia and Oceania — late 18th to the mid 19th century

1.   Examine the reasons for, and impact of, Spanish colonization of the Philippines by the middle
     of the 19th century.

     The reasons for Spanish interest in the Philippines could be summed up simply as God, gold, and
     glory. The Spanish believed there was gold in the Philippines although they never found it due to
     conflict with mountain tribes. The Spanish also wanted to bring Christianity to the Philippines,
     which they did very successfully by sending priests from Spain and Mexico and building churches.
     Much of this region was already under Dutch, French or British influence and the Spanish wanted
     to share in this “glory” too. During the eighteenth century the Spanish fought wars against the
     Dutch and the British to maintain their control of the Philippines. It was believed that failure to
     maintain control over the Philippines would bring shame to the Spanish crown.

     A key impact of Spanish colonization was political unification of the Philippines, which previously
     had been composed of many independent kingdoms. A system of indirect rule helped to establish a
     Filipino upper class called the Principalla. Under Spanish control towns were founded and
     infrastructure developed. There were also significant agricultural developments, such as the
     introduction of new crops and livestock. The old concept of land being for public use was replaced
     with private ownership. Traders from other foreign powers complained that the Spanish limited
     trade opportunities by attempting to create a Spanish monopoly. There was a steady resistance on a
     small scale ever since the arrival of the Spanish: the Palaris Revolt of 1762–1765 was the largest
     revolt and then the Ambaristo Revolt in 1807. The Spanish policies of repression both helped cause
     as well as curb resistance in the Philippines. Spanish missionaries began to convert the population
     to Catholicism and were very successful in places. The Spanish also founded schools and hospitals
     in Manila and the main fort areas and a university in Manila. Education was made free for all
     Filipino subjects in 1863. The civil code of Spain was also applied.

2.   “The Great Revolt (Indian Mutiny) of 1857 was a reaction against Britain’s economic
     exploitation of India.” To what extent do you agree with this statement?

     Candidates should focus on the ways, and the extent, to which the British were economically
     exploiting India. Economic changes, such as the opening of India to free trade had a negative
     impact on Indian industry and production. Artisans, in particular, were badly affected by the influx
     of British goods. Land reform and land taxation also caused difficulties for Indian peasants.

     Candidates may also consider a range of other causes of the Great Revolt (Indian Mutiny).
     These could include religious, political, social and military factors. Many Indians were increasingly
     concerned about the activities of Christian missionaries in India, in particular the number of
     conversions that were made. To many, it appeared that the British were trying to destroy their
     religious beliefs. Actions taken by the British such as taxing lands that belonged to religious
     buildings seemed to confirm this fear. Many Indian rulers and/or princes had been displaced
     following the annexations of Indian lands. The Doctrine of Lapse, introduced by Dalhousie,
     annexed the princely states without heirs. This especially angered the ruling classes leading to
     rebellions. Social reforms made by the British (Bentinck), such as abolishing sati, allowing widows
     to remarry and making education available to girls, were all seen as unwanted interference. Indians
     also had to deal with racial prejudice, which created further resentment towards British rule. Even
     in the military forces of the region, where Indians made up most of the British troops, racial
     prejudice was experienced: Indian soldiers were paid significantly less than their British
     counterparts and promotions within the army were not open to them. Resentment was further
     increased when they were forced to serve overseas, which reduced their status in the caste system.
     An extra allowance for sepoys serving overseas (batta) was ended, resulting in even greater
     resentment. The trigger for the mutiny came as a result of the introduction of a new rifle with
     cartridges that were rumoured to be greased with animal fat. The sepoys had to bite the cartridge
     first but this was offensive for both Muslims (pork fat) and Hindus (cow fat).

     Candidates can challenge the question and discuss all these factors but there should be an in-depth
     discussion of economic factors.

     The above material is an indication of what candidates may elect to write about in their responses.
     However, it is not exhaustive and no set answer is required.

     Examiners and moderators are reminded of the need to apply the markbands that provide the
     “best fit” to the responses given by candidates and to award credit wherever it is possible to do so.

Traditional East Asian societies — late 18th to the mid 19th century

3.   “The issue of opium was only a minor cause of the First Opium War (1839–1842).” To what
     extent do you agree with this statement?

     Candidates will need to assess the issue of opium and the reasons why it caused conflict between
     China and Britain. In the 18th century, despite strong protest from the Qing (Ch’ing) government,
     the British began importing opium from India to China. This was a result of Britain’s “need” for
     Chinese tea. The Chinese were not interested in any of Britain’s goods, such as textiles, so were
     forced to trade in silver. However, with India under British rule a profitable solution to fix this
     imbalance of trade was to start trading opium. As a result of the appalling conditions many Chinese
     lived in, opium had mass appeal and thousands became addicted, leading to more social and
     economic problems. In 1796 the Jiaqing (Chia-ch'ing) Emperor banned the importation and
     cultivation of opium. However, yet again this decree was ignored by the British. By the 1820s the
     British East India Company was still importing approximately 900 tons of opium annually. In
     March 1839, Emperor Daoguang (Tao-kuang) appointed a new commissioner, Lin Zexu, (Lin Tse-
     hsu) to control the opium trade at the port of Guangzhou (Canton). Lin began the process of
     confiscating and destroying opium by dumping it in the ocean. He also wrote to Queen Victoria in
     1839 questioning the morality of British actions in this matter. The situation was exacerbated by
     the actions of Captain Charles Elliot and the Lin Weixi (Lin Wei-hsi) affair. The British
     government and merchants made no response to Lin Zexu. Instead they accused him instead of
     destroying British property and their reaction was military force.

     Candidates should also consider other factors that caused the First Opium War. These could
     include issues relating to trade in general but in particular, British resentment at the restrictions
     placed upon it by the Canton System. Poor diplomatic relations as seen with the failures of the
     Macartney (1793), Amherst (1816) and Napier (1834) missions could be addressed. Legal
     jurisdiction and the cultural differences between China and Britain may also be considered.

     Candidates may also refer to the terms of the post-war treaties to deduce causes of British
     dissatisfaction with the situation prevailing before the war.

     The above material is an indication of what candidates may elect to write about in their
     responses. However, it is not exhaustive and no set answer is required.

     Examiners and moderators are reminded of the need to apply the markbands that provide the
     “best fit” to the responses given by candidates and to award credit wherever it is possible to do so.

4.   “The Taiping (Taip’ing) Rebellion was a result of the Qing (Ch’ing) Dynasty’s inability to
     deal with foreigners.” To what extent do you agree with this statement?

     Candidates may consider a wide range of causes of the Taiping (Taip’ing) Rebellion but must
     consider in depth the impact foreigners had on China and the different ways the inability of the
     Qing (Ch’ing) to deal with them could be a cause of the rebellion.

     A significant cause of the rebellion was the Qing’s (Ch’ing’s) inability to respond to foreign
     encroachment. Widespread discontent was present in China following its defeat in the First Opium
     War and the subsequent 1842 Treaty of Nanjing (Nanking). This national humiliation had
     increased the unpopularity of the Qing government. The heavy defeat of the antiquated imperial
     forces reduced the Qing’s ability to suppress local revolts and disorders. It also meant opium
     continued to flow into China causing more social problems. The Taipings would eventually aim to
     ban opium and also distrusted foreign trade. Another major impact the foreigners had was the
     introduction of Christianity to China – the Taiping leader Hong Xiuquan (Hung Hsiu-ch’uan) had
     himself been converted to Christianity by a missionary’s leaflet. Candidates should consider the
     significance of Hong Xiuquan’s version of Christianity and its appeal to the Hakka peasants and
     workers.

     Candidates should also consider other causes of the rebellion such as long term social and economic
     discontent caused by growing population pressures, natural disasters, rising prices and conditions
     amongst the peasantry. Political factors such as official corruption and inefficiencies could be
     included. The Taiping ideas of land redistribution, sharing of resources, gender equality and the
     banning of opium had mass appeal especially amongst the peasants.

     The above material is an indication of what candidates may elect to write about in their
     responses. However, it is not exhaustive and no set answer is required.

     Examiners and moderators are reminded of the need to apply the markbands that provide the
     “best fit” to the responses given by candidates and to award credit wherever it is possible to do so.

Developing identities — mid 19th to early 20th century

5.   Examine the reasons for the rise of Burmese nationalism by 1937.

     Burma was colonized by the British in 1886 and for administration purposes was annexed to India.
     In 1937 Burma was separated from India and many powers were given back to the Burmese people,
     although independence would not be granted until 1948.

     Candidates may start by discussing the nature of British rule of Burma. Many of the social,
     economic, cultural and administrative changes introduced by the British had adverse consequences
     for the Burmese people. The British abolished the Burmese monarchy and exiled King Thibaw.
     Christian missionaries went to Burma to convert the people from Buddhism and did this mainly
     through the establishment of schools. Buddhism and traditional Burmese culture were frowned
     upon and, in reality the Burmese people were essentially excluded from both the civil and military
     service. Although the British increased rice production by opening up more land for cultivation
     most Burmese farmers could only purchase this land by buying money at high interest rates. Many
     Burmese farmers ended up being evicted from their homes after being unable to repay the Indian
     moneylenders (chettiars). Most paid employment was given to Indian labourers, forcing many
     Burmese to resort to dacoity (armed robbery) to survive. Although the Burmese economy did grow
     under British rule only British and Indian migrants profited from this. In reality, the Burmese
     people were essentially excluded from both the civil and military service. Candidates should show
     how these conditions led to the emergence of nationalist sentiments.

     There was violent resistance towards the British and Indians. A guerrilla force was established by
     former officers of the Royal Burmese Army. The guerrillas fought hard against the foreigners, but
     were often captured and punished harshly. As a result of this, Burmese resentment grew and, by the
     1920s, was openly expressed in violent riots that brought Rangoon to a standstill. Some of the
     discontent was a reaction against disrespect for Burmese culture and traditions, such as the British
     refusal to remove shoes when they entered pagodas. Buddhist monks became the forerunners of the
     independence movement. U Wisara, an activist monk, went on a hunger strike to protest against a
     rule that forbade him from wearing his Buddhist robes in prison. He died in prison. In 1930 a
     movement called Thakin was formed; its members declared themselves to be the true masters of
     their own country.

     Students also played a key role in the emerging independence movement. By 1935, students at
     Rangoon University were at the forefront of what would develop into an active and powerful
     movement for national independence. A young law student Aung San, a senior member of the
     Students Union, emerged as a possible new leader of the national movement. In the years that
     followed, he successfully organized a series of student strikes at the university. After his expulsion
     from university he joined Thakin and gained national support.

     The above material is an indication of what candidates may elect to write about in their
     responses. However, it is not exhaustive and no set answer is required.

     Examiners and moderators are reminded of the need to apply the markbands that provide the
     “best fit” to the responses given by candidates and to award credit wherever it is possible to do so.

6.   To what extent did the First World War influence the growth of national identity in either
     Australia or New Zealand?

     Candidates may suggest that the concept of national identity had only begun to emerge in either
     Australia or New Zealand by the early 20th century and ties to the British Empire were still strong.
     The reaction to the outbreak of the First World War could be seen as evidence of this loyalty. The
     Australian Prime Minister declared that Australia would support Britain to “the last man and the last
     shilling” and ,in both countries thousands of men volunteered to serve; 400,000 in Australia and
     125 000 in New Zealand.

     For both countries involvement in the war had major political consequences as a sense of national
     identity increased. Gallipoli was seen as a defining moment in nationhood, for Australia “Baptism
     by fire” and New Zealand “Baptism of blood”. The soldiers came to represent the typical
     Australian or New Zealander in uniform with his values of resourcefulness and “mateship” and war
     correspondents and cartoonists popularized this image. The heavy casualties experienced by the
     Australian and New Zealand Army Corps (ANZAC) at Gallipoli also made many question British
     military leadership. Despite the fact that the Gallipoli campaign ended in withdrawal, the ANZAC
     legend came to symbolize Australia’s or New Zealand’s involvement in the First World War and
     Anzac Day became a public holiday and de facto national day.

     The aftermath of the war may be discussed. The fact that both countries signed the Treaty of
     Versailles in their own right and that, later, they would become members of the League of Nations
     in their own right, strengthened the sense of national identity. Before the First World War,
     Australia and New Zealand had been rather isolated from international matters: involvement in the
     war, the Versailles conference and the League of Nations changed this and made them more aware
     of their own position in the world.

     Candidates may also refer to other factors that led to a growth in national identity. These could
     include constitutional developments, for example the federation movement in Australia and the
     achievement of dominion status in Australia (1901) and New Zealand (1907).

     The above material is an indication of what candidates may elect to write about in their
     responses. However, it is not exhaustive and no set answer is required.

     Examiners and moderators are reminded of the need to apply the markbands that provide the
     “best fit” to the responses given by candidates and to award credit wherever it is possible to do so.

Early modernization and imperial decline in East Asia — mid 19th to the early 20th century

7.   Examine the reasons for the Japanese victory in both the Sino–Japanese War (1894–1895) and
     the Russo–Japanese War (1904–1905).

     Candidates should show an understanding of Japanese modernization and the ways it enabled Japan
     to win such decisive victories against both China and Russia. However, this is not a general
     question about Meiji modernization and responses should be focused predominantly on economic
     and military developments. “Rich country and strong army” (fokoku kyohei) was the slogan of
     Meiji modernization. Advisors were sent from Britain and Germany to develop Japan’s navy
     and army. The Meiji government focused on military industries and there was a 60 per cent rise in
     military spending. Military reform called for an increased production of weapons, which made
     rapid industrialization essential. Also, to function efficiently, the military needed modern
     communications and so more railways, roads and ships had to be built. Candidates may therefore
     argue that both industrial and military reforms contributed directly towards Japan’s victory in
     both wars. Candidates may also suggest that China’s weaknesses led to Japanese victory in 1895
     and this too would be a valid argument. References to the failure of the Self-Strengthening
     Movement and the consequences of this for China should be credited but lengthy discussion about
     the self-strengthening movement in general is not relevant.

     Candidates should also make specific references to both wars to show how Japan defeated
     both nations. During the Sino–Japanese War (1894), Japanese warships encountered the Chinese
     Beiyang (Pei-Yang) Fleet at the Yalu River. The Japanese Navy consisted of modern warships and
     consequently it easily destroyed eight out of the ten Chinese ships that had been initially deployed,
     assuring Japan's command of the Yellow Sea. By November 1894, the Japanese had taken Port
     Arthur, killing thousands of the city's civilian Chinese inhabitants. The Treaty of Shimonoseki
     (1895) forced China to recognize the independence of Korea and gave Japan control of the
     Liaodong (Liaotung) Peninsula, Taiwan and the Penghu (P’enghu) Islands. The Anglo–Japanese
     Alliance signed in 1902 guaranteed British military support for Japan in the event they might have
     to fight two powers. This increased Japanese security and gave them the confidence to challenge
     Russia. Before, and during, the Russo–Japanese War Japan also benefited from British intelligence.
     Japan won a series of decisive victories over the Russians, who had seriously underestimated the
     military potential of its non-Western opponent. In addition, Russia was weak and underprepared as
     a result of domestic problems. In January 1905, the naval base of Port Arthur fell to the Japanese
     and this was followed by the defeat of Russian forces at Shenyang, China. In May 1905 the
     Russian Baltic fleet was completely destroyed by the Japanese. These three major defeats
     convinced Russia that further resistance against the Japanese was hopeless, and in August 1905, a
     peace treaty was signed at Portsmouth.

8.   To what extent was the Boxer Rebellion (1900–1901) a reaction against the spread of
     Christianity in China?

     Candidates may consider a wide range of factors that led to the Boxer Rebellion (1900–1901) but
     they must assess in depth the impact that the spread of Christianity had on China and the reasons
     why this contributed to the outbreak of the rebellion. The Boxers or the “Society of Harmonious
     Fists” originally emerged in Shandong (Shantung) province. They had links with earlier anti-Qing
     (anti-Ch’ing) secret societies, but by the late 1890s they had become pro-Qing and anti-foreign.

     The unequal treaties (Treaties of Huangpu (Whampoa) and Wangxia (Wanghia), both 1844, and
     Tianjin (Tientsin) in 1856) that followed the Opium Wars allowed for the introduction of foreign
     missionaries into China. They built schools, orphanages and hospitals. Unlike other foreigners in
     China at that time the missionaries lived closely amongst the Chinese population, as their aim was
     to convert them. This closeness brought increased tensions and mistrust of foreigners. The Chinese
     who converted were referred to as “Rice Christians”, suggesting they had only converted in order to
     receive material gains. The fact that the Boxers specifically targeted missionaries and their converts
     also supports the argument that the rebellion was a reaction against the spread of Christianity.
     However, the presence of missionaries in the community also made them easy targets for the
     Boxers’ anti-foreign campaign.

     Candidates may also consider a range of other factors including: strong anti-foreign sentiment and
     public anger about Western imperialism, particularly after the scramble for concessions of the late
     1890s; social and economic factors such as hardship caused by foreign domination of trade; and
     natural disasters. The inability of the Qing to reform during the Self-Strengthening Movement
     (1861–1894) and the Hundred Days Reform (1898) may be used to explain why the movement was
     initially anti-Qing. However, too much discussion of these movements is not valid.

     The above material is an indication of what candidates may elect to write about in their
     responses. However, it is not exhaustive and no set answer is required.

Impact of the World Wars on South and Southeast Asia to the mid 20th century

9.   To what extent did the Government of India Acts of 1919 and 1935 both help and hinder
     nationalist movements in the South Asian subcontinent?

     Candidates should show the ways both Acts helped and hindered the nationalist movements.
     Resentment towards the 1919 Act helped intensify nationalist feelings, but the Act also introduced
     partial self-government, which created opportunities for Indian leaders to gain some political
     experience. The 1935 Government of India Act increased the powers of provincial governments
     and gave Indian leaders essential political experience.

     The Government of India Act 1919 resulted in the introduction of a diarchy. Elected
     representatives now controlled the departments of agriculture, transport and education while the
     British-appointed governor and his advisers retained control of finance, the police and prisons. The
     viceroy also kept control of the central government and all aspects of foreign and economic
     policies. The repressive Rowlatt Act, which was introduced in early 1919, was followed, in April,
     by the Amritsar Massacre. Therefore, the anger felt amongst many Indian nationalists was not
     alleviated by the introduction of the Government of India Act in December.

     Candidates may include examples from the non-cooperation and civil disobedience movements
     from the 1920s and 1930s to show how resentment towards this act changed the nature of the
     independence movement.

     The Government of India Act 1935 resulted in a significant amount of political autonomy being
     given to the provinces of India. Provincial governments now had the authority to plan and carry out
     their own programmes but governors still had the right to intervene. This was a significant
     development as the legislators gained experience in developing and implementing policies in their
     provinces. The electorate also increased significantly from seven million to thirty five million
     people. Provision was made for the establishment of a “Federation of India”, to be made up of both
     British India and some or all of the “princely states”. This would mean the princely states could
     participate in political affairs relating to the sub-continent, and vice versa. However, the parts of
     the Act intended to establish the Federation of India never came into operation, due to opposition
     from the rulers of the princely states. Since this did not happen, the central government continued
     to function in accordance with the 1919 Act and only the part of the 1935 Act that dealt with the
     provincial governments was implemented. The Viceroy remained the head of the central
     administration and possessed extensive powers concerning administration, legislation and finance.
     No finance bill could be placed in the Central Legislature without the consent of the Viceroy. The
     Viceroy could also intervene in cases of public order or to veto a bill he disagreed with. In reality,
     control of the economy, law, foreign relations and defence was still very much in the hands of the
     British. Both the Indian National Congress and the Muslim League opposed the Act, but
     participated in the provincial elections of 1936–1937.

10.   Examine the factors that led to the growth of nationalism in French Indo–China up to 1945.

      Candidates may start their response by assessing the nature of French rule of Indo-China. There
      may be a discussion of how the French exploited the economies of these regions, for example, by
      imposing heavy taxes on local populations and exploiting the resources of tea, rice, coffee, tin and
      rubber. The negative impact of Catholic missionaries and the use of the French language on the
      people of Indo-China may also be addressed. Although many of these points are generic to the
      whole of Indo-China there should also be some attempt to discuss the rise of nationalism making
      specific references to Vietnam, Cambodia and Laos.

      Vietnam was the most important colony in Indo–China and French policies concentrated on the
      consolidation of their political authority and economic exploitation. Prior to the First World War
      there were numerous resistance groups and uprisings. Ho Chi Minh was greatly affected by the
      events of both the First World War and the Russian Revolution. In 1925 he created the Vietnamese
      Revolutionary Youth League in China. In 1927 another group, the Viet Nam Quoc Dan Dang
      (VNQDD) was formed and it led violent protests against the French authorities, but was crushed by
      the French in 1930. Ho Chi Minh founded the Indochinese Communist Party and their popular
      policies regarding land reform ensured growing peasant support throughout the 1930s. Ho Chi
      Minh formed the Viet Nam Doc Lap Dong Minh Hoi (Vietnamese Independence League), known
      as the Viet Minh, in 1941. Its aim to fight both the French and the Japanese won it much support
      among the Vietnamese people and further increased nationalist feelings throughout Vietnam.

      Cambodia was relatively subdued politically at the beginning of the 20th century. Nevertheless,
      national consciousness was emerging among the educated Khmer who formed the urban-based
      elite. In 1936 Son Ngoc Thanh, began publishing Nagaravatta, the first Khmer language
      newspaper. In his editorials, he attacked French domination of their economy and the lack of
      opportunities for educated Khmer. The Japanese calls of “Asia for the Asians” gained support
      among Cambodian nationalists. Following the arrest of a politically active Buddhist monk, Hem
      Chieu, by the Vichy French authorities in July 1942, the editors of Nagaravatta organised
      demonstrations demanding his release. The Vichy authorities arrested the demonstrators and
      imprisoned the main leaders for life. Towards the end of the war, the Japanese brought an end to
      the Vichy French administration, and encouraged Cambodia to declare its independence within the
      Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere. However, King Sihanouk responded by decreeing an
      independent Cambodia.

      The Laotians generally tolerated French presence for the first half of the twentieth century.
      However, Laotian nationalism was being promoted through Lao Nhay (Lao Renovation
      Movement). The aims of this movement were to provide Laos with its own national identity.
      Students among the movement, attempted to stage a coup in Vientiane in July 1940. After its
      failure, they fled and founded a semi secret organization, Lao Pen Lao (Laos for the Lao). During
      the Second World War many Laotians fought the Japanese alongside French agents using guerrilla
      tactics.

The Republic of China 1912–1949 and the rise of Communism

11.   Compare and contrast the aims and policies of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) with
      those of the Guomindang, GMD (Kuomintang, KMT) during the First United Front
      (1924–1927).

      Candidates will probably conclude that although the Guomindang, GMD (Kuomintang, KMT) and
      CCP each had its own distinct policy programme they did both initially share a common purpose;
      the defeat of the warlords and the establishment of a unified government.

      The Chinese Communist Party (CCP) was created in 1921 and was supported by the Comintern.
      Sun Yixian (Sun Yat-sen) began a process of reorganizing the GMD in 1923 and entered into
      negotiations with the Soviet Union for support. The 1923 Sun-Joffe Declaration stated that whilst
      Communism would not be replaced for Sun’s Three Principles, there were certain shared aims for
      the GMD and the CCP. These included nationalism, ridding China of foreign influences, socialism,
      the defeat of the warlords and the establishment of a unified government for China. Despite some
      objections, CCP members were ordered by the Comintern to join with the GMD. Both parties
      differed about the eventual form of government for China and they used the First United Front to
      further their own goals. CCP members had to join the GMD as individuals and they could see the
      benefits of being part of a stronger party. The CCP and Comintern believed that the GMD could be
      undermined from within. Sun Yixian was rather idealistic and he wanted to exploit the CCP’s
      support among the peasantry and workers to gain popular support for his Three Principles. The
      CCP saw the opportunities created by the Northern advance to spread their ideology among the
      peasants.

      Comparisons between the CCP and GMD are more apparent until the death of Sun in 1925 when
      contrasting aims become much clearer.

      Following Sun’s death, tensions between the left and right factions within the GMD developed.
      Jiang Jieshi’s (Chiang Kai-shek’s) aversion to communism was obvious from the start of his
      leadership and tensions between CCP members and the GMD over the issue of dual membership
      increased. Jiang’s ambitions and objectives differed greatly from those of the CCP. Jiang Jieshi
      used the Communists’ support among the peasantry and workers to gain popular support for the
      military drive to the north. The Communists used the northern advance to successfully spread their
      ideology among the Chinese peasants. With the capture of Shanghai (Shang-hai), Jiang Jieshi and
      the Nationalists gained access to the wealth and influence of the powerful commercial classes and
      then brutally turned on the Communists during the Shanghai Massacre (1927). The Nationalists
      may have struck first, but most candidates will acknowledge that the programmes of the two parties
      were basically incompatible.

      responses. However, it is not exhaustive and no set answer is required.

12.   Evaluate the effectiveness of the methods used by the Guomindang, GMD (Kuomintang,
      KMT) and the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) against the Japanese during the Fifteen-Year
      War (1931–1945).

      NB: The main focus of this question is how the Guomindang, GMD (Kuomintang, KMT) and the
      Chinese Communist Party (CCP) responded to the Japanese threat and not merely the ongoing
      conflict between the GMD and the CCP.

      The Japanese invasion of Manchuria in 1931 marked the beginning of a fifteen year conflict
      between Japan and China. Tensions between China and Japan were heightened after the Marco
      Polo Bridge Incident (1937). Using this incident as justification, the Japanese launched a full-scale
      invasion of China. The Japanese initially faced little organized resistance and by the end of 1937 all
      of China’s key coastal towns and trading centres were under Japanese control. The formation of the
      Second United Front (1936) meant that, in theory, the GMD and the CCP were now united against
      Japan; however the reality was very different. The only good example of effective cooperation
      between them was the Battle of Wuhan (Wu-han) in 1938.

      The GMD: Candidates will probably argue that initially the GMD put up little resistance partly as a
      result of Jiang Jieshi’s (Chiang Kai-shek’s) intense hatred of the CCP which he perceived to be a
      greater threat than the Japanese. “The Japanese are a disease of the skin but the Communists are a
      disease of the heart.” However, it should also be noted that they were up against a formidable
      enemy and that the Japanese were focusing their efforts on the enemy they could see and so,
      consequently, the GMD faced the worst of the fighting. Heavy defeats in Shanghai (Shang-hai) in
      1937, Nanjing (Nanking) also in 1937 and Wuhan in 1938 all emphasized the weaknesses of the
      GMD. Jiang was forced to move the capital to Chongqing (Ch’ung-ch’ing). The “Rape of
      Nanjing” could be used as evidence of GMD failings as it appeared that they had abandoned the
      people to suffer unthinkable consequences. Candidates may also refer to inefficiencies and
      corruption within the GMD and, in particular, to the fact that financial aid from the US was not used
      effectively. Morale was low in the GMD army as a result of the use of conscription and severe lack
      of food and supplies. Stronger responses should give examples of GMD success after 1938, for
      example, the way they adopted delaying tactics such as the strategy of “trading space for time” and
      the “scorched earth strategies”, in which dams were intentionally sabotaged to create massive
      flooding. As a result of these methods Japanese advances began to stall in late 1938 although they
      did also have dire consequences for the Chinese people as well.

      The CCP: In 1931, when the Japanese invaded Manchuria, the CCP was under attack from Jiang’s
      encirclement campaigns. Following the Long March (1934–1935) Mao established the Yan’an
      (Yen-an) Soviet where he recruited peasants into the Red Army and trained them in guerilla warfare
      tactics. In January 1937 the "anti-Japanese expedition" began and groups of guerrilla fighters were
      sent into Japanese-held territory to carry out attacks on Japanese troops. In 1940 the Red Army
      began a major offensive in northern China. The continuous harassment and sabotage by the Red
      Army became frustrating for the Japanese and led them to implement the policy of Sankō Seisaku or
      the “Three Alls Policy” (kill all, loot all, burn all) It was during this period that the majority of
      Japanese war crimes were carried out.

Imperial Japan: empire and aftermath 1912–1952

13.   “In the years following the First World War, Japan became a major power in international
      relations.” With reference to the period up to 1929, to what extent do you agree with this
      statement?

      Candidates may start by explaining the significance of the First World War to Japan’s position in
      the world. Japan entered the war as an ally of Britain in August 1914, hoping to use the war as an
      opportunity to gain territory in China (in 1915 the Japanese government presented the 21 Demands
      to Yuan Shikai (Yuan Shih-k’ai)). Japan played a key role in the Versailles Conference (1919) and
      was a member of the “Council of Ten” although it was not always treated as an equal. Although
      Japan was given Shandong (Shantung) and Germany’s Pacific possessions they had hoped for more
      territorial gains in China. The Japanese were also outraged with the rejection of the declaration of
      racial equality. Japan also joined the newly created League of Nations as one of four permanent
      members of the League Council. Candidates may use these post war events as evidence that
      although Japan was a major power in international relations it was still not perhaps seen as an equal.

      The Washington Naval Treaty (1922) was signed by Britain, the United States, Japan, France and
      Italy and was intended to prevent an arms race by restricting naval construction. Japan’s
      involvement in the treaty could be used as evidence of their increasing status in international affairs.
      However, the agreed 5:5:3 ratio could be used as evidence that Japan was not perceived as an equal
      by the major powers and also that the other powers saw Japan as a growing threat. Japan was now,
      in reality, the dominant power in the north-west Pacific. The 1924 Immigration Act passed in the
      US ended the immigration of all Asians into the US and was seen by both the Japanese government
      and public as a national humiliation. However, it could also be argued that this act was simply a
      result of the US policy of isolationism rather than a reflection of Japan’s position in international
      relations. In 1928 Japan also signed the Kellogg-Briand Pact. Countries that signed this agreement
      promised not to use war as a solution for any disputes between signatory nations.

      Candidates may conclude their responses by explaining that the events of the Great Depression led
      to many countries adopting more isolationist policies to protect their own interests and so
      international cooperation came to an end but that up to this point Japan had been a key player in
      international relations.

      responses. However, it is not exhaustive and no set answer is required.

14.   “The invasion of Manchuria undermined the Japanese government both at home and
      abroad.” With reference to the period up to 1937, to what extent do you agree with this
      assessment?

      Candidates may start by identifying the fact that events in Manchuria did not initially have the
      authorization of the government in Tokyo. Two senior officers in the Kwantung Army, Itagaki
      Seishiro and Ishiwara Kanji, had drawn up plans for an occupation of Manchuria after being
      convinced that Japan’s interests there were under threat. When news of their plans reached Tokyo
      attempts were made to prevent it, but the messenger sent by Tokyo was also part of the plot, and so,
      on the night of 18 September 1931 a bomb exploded in the railway outside Mukden and was
      subsequently blamed on the Chinese. All of this was done against the wishes of the government
      and also without even the authority of the army high command. However, it was difficult for the
      Japanese government to condemn the actions of these officers in the Kwantung Army, as this would
      be evidence that the Chinese were not responsible for the attack after all.

      The effects of the incident on the Japanese government were significant. Factions emerged in the
      military, one being the Control faction (Tosei-ha) and the other the Imperial Way faction (Kodo-
      ha). Rivalry between these factions led to ongoing violence between 1932 and 1936, including
      plots and assassinations that affected the balance of Japanese politics. The Diet was increasingly
      seen as powerless and party leaders were unable to control the armed forces. After 1932 most
      prime ministers were drawn from the military although there were exceptions, such as Konoe
      Fumimaro, who tried to control the military and maintain democratic processes. The results of the
      Manchurian Incident undermined the democratic nature of the Japanese government and led to
      increased censorship and control over education. Various organizations, such as the Boy Scouts
      and Youth Association promoted the ideals and actions of the Kwantung Army. There was a push
      for further expansion into China and, despite opposition from the Diet, war with China started
      in 1937.

      Events in Manchuria also had a damaging effect on Japan’s relations with many countries in
      the west. The Lytton Report, ordered by the League of Nations, condemned the actions of Japan in
      creating the puppet state of Manchukuo. Japan’s response was simply to withdraw from the League
      as its representative was not prepared to listen to criticism from nations who were, in their eyes,
      being hypocritical. The Japanese Foreign Ministry argued that the relationship between China and
      Japan was not the business of any other country. In 1934 Japan formally announced it intended to
      terminate its part in the Washington Naval treaty. Factions within Japan were angered at the 5:5:3
      ratio which they saw as unfair. In 1936 Japan signed the Anti-Comintern Pact with Germany,
      which was directed against the Communist International and intended to provide protection from
      the USSR. In 1936 Tokyo approved a statement known as the Fundamentals of National Policy,
      which would later form the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere. It declared Japanese interest in
      South East Asia but claimed this would only be achieved in “gradual and peaceful” ways. In 1937
      Japan increased its hostilities in China with attacks on Nanjing (Nanking) and Shanghai
      (Shang-hai).

Developments in Australia and New Zealand, and in the Pacific Islands 1941–2000

15.   To what extent did the Whitlam government (1972–1975) transform Australia’s domestic and
      foreign policies?

      Candidates will probably argue that the Whitlam government did transform Australia’s domestic
      and foreign policies although Whitlam was limited by the fact that Labor had no majority in the
      Senate. Whitlam’s early departure from office also suggests that more conservative elements were
      still strong in Australia.

      Domestic policies: A radical programme of domestic policies was introduced by Gough Whitlam.
      Universal health care was introduced, the death penalty was abolished and university fees were
      ended. Women’s equality was encouraged: an equal pay case was reopened and a tax on
      contraception pills abolished. The Whitlam government also gave grants to improve road and rail
      links between states and improve sanitation in rural areas. Perhaps most significant was the official
      conclusion of the “White Australia” policy and the active encouragement of a multicultural society.
      Candidates may conclude that Australian society became more modern, open and tolerant as a result
      of these policies. Stronger candidates may suggest that many of these developments were a
      consequence of other factors such as immigration.

      Foreign policies: Military conscription was ended and troops returned home from Vietnam.
      Australia became less tied to US policy and began to become more involved with Asian affairs.
      Evidence of this could be Australia’s official recognition of the People’s Republic of China.
      Whitlam also instructed the Australian representatives at the United Nations to vote to impose
      sanctions on South Africa for their policy of Apartheid. Australia’s relationship with Britain was
      also changing as Australia was strengthening its own national identity. Australia’s national anthem
      was changed from “God save the Queen” to “Advance Australia Fair” and the British honours
      system was replaced by the Order of Australia. Australia, it could be argued, was now developing
      its own distinct foreign policies and relations rather than being under the influence of other powers
      such as Britain and the US.

16.   Examine the impact that Britain’s membership of the European Union (EU) had on the
      region.

      Candidates may begin their responses by explaining that Britain’s role in the region had changed
      dramatically since the end of the Second World War. The ANZUS Pact signed with the US came
      about because of the concerns of Australia and New Zealand that they could no longer rely on
      Britain for defence. Australia and New Zealand also joined the South East Asia Treaty
      Organization (SEATO) as a reaction to the rise of Communism in Asia. SEATO was established in
      1954 and as well as providing collective security for its members it sought to improve social and
      economic conditions in the region. It could be argued that this showed that countries within the
      region were looking nearer to home for allies; however Britain also joined SEATO as it still had
      interests in this part of the world. Britain’s role in the region was, however, unquestionably in
      decline with several countries gaining independence from it in the years following the Second
      World War. Candidates may suggest that these factors had an impact on relations between Britain
      and the region more significantly than membership of the EU.

      Britain’s membership of the EU in 1973 certainly had an economic impact on the region. Former
      British colonies and dominions no longer had the same access to British trade and markets. The
      result of this was stronger trade links across the region and, in particular between East Asia and
      Australia and New Zealand. Australia and New Zealand also began to support developing countries
      in the region providing both aid and expertise. Britain continued to have close economic ties with
      Hong Kong, but otherwise, economic relations between Britain and the region were significantly
      altered. Politically, it could be argued that the impact of Britain’s membership of the EU was less
      significant. This was partly as a result of post-war developments but also because membership of
      the Commonwealth retained a significant bond between these nations. Most candidates will
      probably conclude that Britain’s membership of the EU was just one of many factors that led to
      countries in the region looking closer to home for economic partners and political allies.

Developments in South and Southeast Asia from mid 20th century to 2000

17.   To what extent do you agree that Nehru served India well in the years 1947 to 1964?

      This is a broad question that enables candidates to assess a wide range of Nehru’s social, economic
      and foreign policies in the years 1947 to 1964. Although candidates may start by assessing Nehru’s
      role in Indian Independence this should not be the main focus of their response.

      Nehru was a key figure in the Indian independence movement and he played a critical role in
      negotiations with the British. He opposed the Muslim League’s demands for a separate Muslim
      state. Mountbatten, the last British viceroy, proposed the division as the most practical solution and
      Nehru unwillingly agreed to it. On 15 August 1947, Nehru became the first prime minister of India
      and formed the first independent government.

      As Prime Minister, Nehru introduced a series of moderate socialist economic reforms and
      encouraged the process of industrialization. The four pillars of his domestic policies were
      democracy, socialism, unity, and secularism. Nehru sought to modernise India by importing
      modern values and encouraging scientific and technological developments. He also aspired to make
      Indian people more aware of those living in poverty. It could be argued that one of his greatest
      achievements was the reform of the ancient Hindu civil code that finally enabled Hindu widows to
      have equality with men with regards to inheritance and property.

      One of the most problematic issues Nehru faced was conflict with Pakistan over the state of
      Kashmir. Nehru sent troops into the state to support India’s claim. Despite the work of the United
      Nations the situation in Kashmir would remain volatile. The Indian army was also heavily defeated
      by Chinese forces following border disputes in 1962. Nehru worked hard to keep India out of the
      Cold War conflict by developing a policy of “positive neutrality” for India. He also became a key
      spokesman for the non-alignment movement.

18.   Examine the reasons why, and the ways in which, events in Vietnam in the years 1955 to 1975
      affected Cambodia (Kampuchea) and Laos.

      NB: Do not expect responses to be equally balanced between the two countries.

      The leader of Cambodia (Kampuchea), Sihanouk, had tried to keep Cambodia neutral as far as its
      position in the Vietnam War was concerned. However, by 1961 North Vietnamese troops had
      already began to use Cambodian territory to supply their forces stationed in South Vietnam;
      something that had already resulted in US bombing raids. Sihanouk was eventually deposed in
      1970 by General Lon Nol. This unpopular move, combined with the increasing influence of the
      North Vietnamese Army (NVA) in Cambodia led to the spread of Communism. The Khmer Rouge
      uprising in 1970 resulted in the establishment of a Communist regime led by Pol Pot. It claimed it
      wanted to protect the people from US bombing by moving citizens from urban to rural areas. The
      reality was that the Khmer Rouge created large communes where the Khmer were forced to live and
      work in horrific conditions. Families were intentionally broken up, Buddhists and intellectuals
      targeted and all infrastructure destroyed. The presence of the Khmer Rouge regime in Cambodia
      eventually led to the massacre and genocide of about 25 % of its population through execution,
      starvation and forced labour. The Khmer Rouge was unable to prevent a Vietnamese invasion of
      their country in 1979 and the Vietnamese created the People’s Republic of Kampuchea and ruled it
      for over a decade.

      The Vietnamese conflict also affected Laos in what would be known as the “Secret War”.
      North Vietnam invaded Laos in 1959 and built invasion routes through Laos into South Vietnam.
      Heavy presence from the NVA and a US bombing campaign that devastated the country for nine
      years eventually led to the establishment of a Communist state. The Ho Chi Minh trail through
      Laos was used by the NVA to fight the South and was the target of the bombing campaign. Around
      two million tons of bombs were dropped between 1964 and 1973 (the equivalent of one planeload
      every eight minutes for nine years). By 1970 at least one-quarter of the entire population of Laos
      were refugees, and about 400,000 Laotians had been killed. The Communist Pathet Lao held
      control of the northern region of Laos since independence from France in 1954 and had been
      fighting to gain control over more of Laos. The Pathet Lao’s influence increased due to both US
      bombing and NVA support. Its support increased from approximately one third of the population in
      1958 to a majority in 1973, resulting in the establishment of a Communist government.

China: the regional superpower from mid 20th century to 2000

19.   To what extent do you agree that the control of the population was the main motive behind
      Mao Zedong’s (Mao Tse-tung’s) policies?

      Candidates’ responses should be focused on a range of policies introduced during Mao Zedong’s
      (Mao Tse-tung’s) rule. Due to the nature of the statement in the question candidates may focus
      predominantly on his campaigns, which is acceptable. These could include: the Three and Five
      Antis Campaigns 1952–1953; 100 Flowers Campaign 1956 and the Anti-Rightist Campaign 1957;
      Four Pests Campaign; the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution; Destruction of Four Olds 1966.
      Policies assessed may also include Mao’s social and/or economic policies such as the Great Leap
      Forward (1958). Aspects of this policy, such as the commune movement, could be used as
      evidence of control. Candidates should assess Mao’s motives for a wide range of policies to assess
      whether their only aim was to control the population. Some candidates may challenge the question
      by considering other motives behind Mao’s policies and actions such as nation-building and
      modernizing China’s economy and society. Whilst this is valid, the issue of control should also be
      addressed.

      The Three and Five Antis Campaigns 1952–1953 targeted capitalists and business owners. They
      aimed to seek out corruption and waste, although they also served to purge any opposition to Mao.
      During The Hundred Flowers Campaign intellectuals and others were encouraged to express a
      range of views and criticisms on matters of policy under the slogan “letting a hundred flowers
      blossom and a hundred schools of thought contend”. When the criticism began targeting Mao
      Zedong and Communist rule, the movement was suppressed and many of its participants were
      punished. It could be argued that this strengthened Mao’s control of the population as potential
      opponents had been eliminated. The Anti-Rightist Campaign of 1957 targeted intellectuals.
      Approximately 10 per cent of intellectuals, engineers and technicians were labelled rightists in the
      campaign. Those accused were subject to social exclusion, criticism and repentance sessions, or
      were sent to prisons or camps as punishment. The Four Pests Campaign saw a mass mobilization
      effort to eliminate rats, flies, mosquitoes, and sparrows. However, the effects of “sparrowcide” on
      China’s agriculture were devastating. As part of the Great Leap Forward (1958) the Chinese were
      to create backyard furnaces. However, the steel produced by the backyard furnaces was frequently
      too weak to be of any use and could not be used in construction, which was its original purpose.
      Also, the backyard production method had taken many workers away from their fields. It could be
      argued that these initiatives kept the people busy and increased Mao’s control over their lives.
      During the Cultural Revolution Mao demanded that the “Four Olds” – Old Customs, Old Culture,
      Old Habits, and Old Ideas should be destroyed. The Cultural Revolution also enabled Mao to
      reassert control of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) by using the Red Guards to promote
      continuous revolution. The Red Guards were mainly responsible for the violence and terror of the
      Cultural Revolution. By 1968 various factions had developed, all of which claimed to be loyal to
      Mao, and the country had descended into disorder. Mao used the People’s Liberation Army to
      restore order and the youth were sent to the countryside in the “Learn from the peasants” campaign.
      Candidates will probably conclude that control was a key motive behind Mao’s policies but that
      other factors, such as modernization, were also important.

      responses. However, it is not exhaustive and no set answer is required.

20.   To what extent were China’s relations with other states in the region successful in the second
      half of the 20th century?

      Candidates will not be able to cover everything, but should be able to provide an evaluation of
      China’s relations within the region over the timeframe given. Most candidates will focus on
      political relations but a discussion of economic and trade agreements within the region is also valid.
      Discussion of Sino-Soviet relations is only relevant if it is linked to issues within the region.

      In 1950 conflict broke out on the Korean peninsula. UN forces pursued North Korean troops to
      the Yalu River border with China, which resulted in Chinese involvement. Chinese “volunteers”
      drove the UN forces back to the 38th parallel where the war stalemated until a ceasefire in 1953.
      North Korea became a stronghold of Communism under Kim Il-sung and formed a close alliance
      with China. Chinese success in the war raised their prestige in the region and world.

      India was among the first nations to grant diplomatic recognition to the newly created People’s
      Republic of China (PRC). However, various border conflicts between India and China occurred
      throughout the years 1959 to 1962. The cause of these conflicts was the issue of Tibet and a dispute
      over the sovereignty of the border regions. In 1962, the People’s Liberation Army (PLA) launched
      two attacks and the fighting continued for a month. The Chinese declared a ceasefire once they had
      established borders they deemed acceptable however, relations between China and India remained
      tense and India increased her support for Tibetan refugees. Pakistan sought to use this situation to
      improve their relations with China and the China–Pakistan Border Treaty was signed in 1963. As a
      result of growing threats from China and Pakistan, India transformed its military to become one of
      the largest in the world. Tensions between China and India remained an issue for the period in
      question.

      The Chinese Communist Party (CCP) and the Vietminh had a long history of cooperation. Chinese
      communists had initially aided Vietnam’s efforts towards independence and China also played a
      significant role in the Geneva Conference of 1954. However, following the Sino–Soviet split the
      Chinese cut arms support for the Vietminh as they had expected the Vietminh to support them
      against the USSR. The USSR continued to support North Vietnam throughout the war and this
      growing friendship worried China which was fearful of encirclement by a Soviet sphere of
      influence. Following clashes between Vietnam and Cambodia (Kampuchea), China began to
      support the Khmer Rouge. The Vietnamese ended the Khmer Rouge regime in 1979 and occupied
      Cambodia. In 1979 Deng Xiaoping (Ten Hsiao-p’ing) announced an attack on Vietnam claiming
      there was mistreatment of ethnic Chinese living in regions of Vietnam. The PLA advanced quickly
      into North Vietnam attacking cities and destroying infrastructure but then crossed back into China
      the following month with both sides claiming victory. Vietnam continued to occupy Cambodia
      (Kampuchea) but China managed to gain international condemnation of this. China also improved
      relations with other states in the region, including Thailand by promising them protection from
      “Vietnamese aggression”. Border skirmishes continued into the 1980s.

      Relations between the PRC and the Republic of China, ROC (Taiwan) remained tense for most of
      this time period. The first crisis began in 1954 when Mao ordered the bombing of offshore islands
      following the removal of a naval blockade by the US. The crisis came to an end in 1955 but only
      after the US had pledged to help defend Taiwan in the event of a Communist invasion. Mao
      appeared to alter his approach to Taiwan and instead adopted a more moderate policy. However
      this failed, and by 1958, tension in the Taiwan Straits resumed when Quemoy (Jinmen/Chin-men)
      was bombed in 1958. Again threats from the US forced Mao to seek a peaceful settlement with the
      Nationalist government. The Third Taiwan Crisis was the effect of missile tests conducted by the
                                            – 24 –             N14/3/HISTX/HP3/ENG/TZ0/AO/M


PRC in the Taiwan Strait from 1995 to 1996 in an attempt to undermine President Lee’s election
campaign. This was a reaction to President Lee’s visit to the US where he promoted pro-Taiwan
independence sentiments. The US again sent a large force in an attempt to protect Taiwan and
attempts at intimidation by the PRC actually boosted support for Lee within Taiwan. The crisis led
to the strengthening of military ties between the US and Japan, increasing the role Japan would play
in defending Taiwan.

In 1997 Hong Kong was “handed over” to China ending British sovereignty. Britain had initially
hoped to exchange sovereignty for administration but the PRC refused to enter any negotiations on
this issue. The Sino–British Joint Declaration was signed in 1984 and set out the policy of One
Country, Two Systems. Hong Kong’s existing system would remain in place for 50 years. In the
years leading up to the handover the British introduced a series of democratic reforms that gave the
people of Hong Kong more political influence. The handover occurred successfully on 30 June
1997.

Global impact of the region in the second half of the 20th century

21.   Examine the impact of foreign powers on the causes and course of the Korean War.

      Candidates should consider the actions of the United Nations, US, USSR and China in both initially
      causing the conflict in Korea and intensifying and prolonging it.

      At Yalta, Korea had been temporarily divided along the 38th parallel but the emerging Cold War
      conflict saw the creation of two Korean states in 1948, Communist North and a non-Communist
      South. The Soviets backed the communist regime in the North led by Kim Il-sung, and the
      Americans supported the anti-communist Syngman Rhee, who became leader of South Korea.

      The North Korean invasion of the South in June 1950 intensified US fears of the growing threat of
      communism in the region. The USSR was boycotting the United Nations at this time over the issue
      of UN recognition of the Peoples Republic of China (PRC). This situation enabled the US to gain
      UN authorization for military intervention. It could be argued that the USSR helped instigate the
      conflict as it is more than likely that Kim Il-sung asked for Stalin’s approval before invading the
      south and the USSR also encouraged Chinese involvement. Although the USSR did not send troops
      to Korea, Soviet military aid was essential to the North Korean forces, in particular sending military
      aircraft.

      UN intervention saw US forces, joined by those of other non-Communist powers, enter the conflict,
      and push the North Koreans towards the Yalu River border with China. The actions of US General
      McArthur may be discussed to explain US responsibility for intensifying and prolonging the
      conflict.

      The People’s Republic of China wanted to preserve a North Korean Communist State to serve as a
      buffer between Manchuria and US-dominated South Korea. The PRC was concerned that the US
      had broken its promise not to cross the 38th Parallel and so they might cross the Yalu River into
      China. The Chinese planned a surprise attack, secretly moving troops across the Yalu. China did
      not officially declare war and claimed the troops to be “volunteers” so that it could deny any
      responsibility. Chinese “volunteers” drove the UN forces back to the 38th parallel where the war
      reached a stalemate until a ceasefire in 1953.

      Casualties were in the millions and the country was devastated. The North became a Communist
      stronghold under Kim Il-sung and was close allies with the Chinese and the Soviets. North Korea
      would become a repressive regime and suffer severe economic hardship. The Republic of Korea
      became an American ally and began a process of democratic reform and economic development.

      Better candidates may challenge the assumptions in the question: firstly that only foreign powers
      were responsible for the outbreak of war and secondly, that the war left only a devastating legacy.
      The conflict did begin as a civil war and candidates may discuss the problems in Korea at the
      outbreak of the conflict such as the oppressive nature of Syngman Rhee’s regime. Candidates may
      also show how US investment in South Korea after the war helped lead to the “economic miracle”
      that it would experience from the 1970s onwards.

      The above material is an indication of what candidates may elect to write about in their
      responses. However, it is not exhaustive and no set answer is required.

      Examiners and moderators are reminded of the need to apply the markbands that provide the
      “best fit” to the responses given by candidates and to award credit wherever it is possible to do so.

22.   To what extent was the role of the state a key factor in determining economic success in any
      two countries of the region (not including China) in the second half of the 20th century?

      The role of the state in achieving economic success in two countries should be discussed. In the
      Asian region governments have tended to intervene more heavily in the control of their economies
      than most of their western counterparts. There is considerable variation amongst these systems over
      the nature and degree of state intervention. Other factors apart from the role of the state may also
      be used to challenge the question. These could include outside forces such as a steady expansion of
      world trade, the ease of access to foreign markets, the role and influence of the American market
      and technological advances. Cultural traditions, such as Confucian values, may have resulted in
      greater labour discipline and more focus on national success rather than personal gains. These
      factors may have also played a role in promoting economic success. Although it is valid for
      candidates to discuss these other factors the role of the state should also be addressed in depth.
      Below are some of the countries likely to be popular choices but any two countries in the region
      are valid (apart from China).
      Japan has dominated the Pacific Asian economy and the role of the state has been significant in
      determining the success of its economy. After the Second World War Japan’s major trading partner
      was the US. To maintain their price advantage with the West, Japan moved production facilities to
      other Asian countries as costs rose domestically towards the end of the twentieth century.
      Japan effectively expanded its available labour force to include those of other Asian countries
      as well. Japan has diversified economic production to sell a diverse range of Japanese products to
      foreign markets. Globalization has also played a key role in the economic development of Japan.
      The South Korea government initially had heavy state control of its economy, but by the end of
      the twentieth century this had reduced considerably. There was rapid industrialization, mainly as a
      result of heavy foreign investment, particularly from the US as a result of the Korean War.
      Shipbuilding, automobiles, construction, armaments and advanced technology were all effectively
      developed.
      Taiwan’s economy benefited from US aid as well as support from overseas Chinese. Taiwan
      profited from guidance from highly trained management and business personnel from across the
      world. Taiwan’s Four Year Plans for industry produced an annual growth rate of 9.7 per cent in the
      ten year period after 1963. Changes in mainland China’s economy since the 1980s also provided
      further investment opportunities for the Taiwanese. Taiwan became highly industrialized and
      specialized in information technology.
      The Singapore government established the Economic Development Board, which aimed to make
      Singapore more appealing to foreign investment. The government also encouraged firms to invest
      outside Singapore. Singapore’s economic strategy produced strong and consistent economic growth
      averaging 8 per cent from 1960 to 1999.
      State planning played a key role in the growth of the Malaysian economy. The First Malayan Five
      Year Plan increased government intervention in the economy, particularly to get more investment in
      infrastructure projects. The Chinese dominated Malaysian businesses and became part of the larger
      bamboo network, a network of overseas Chinese.

Social and economic developments 1945–2000

23.   Examine the changes in education in one country of the region since 1945 and their impact on
      social and economic development.

      Candidates may choose any country from the region. Responses need to show a clear understanding
      of what is meant by the term “changes” for the country they have chosen. This could mean the
      adoption of a more Western-style education system in some developing countries or it could mean
      the expansion of secondary and tertiary education in more developed ones. Candidates need to
      demonstrate the links between changes in education and the social and economic development that
      has taken place in the chosen country since the Second World War. Changes in education in a
      society can result in considerable upheaval in employment markets and family structures. These
      may be both positive and negative.

      Candidates should refer to a range of social developments that have come about as a result of
      changes in education: the position of women; social mobility; migration from the countryside to
      cities; effects upon rural and regional areas; community and political organizations; crime rates;
      cultural identity and the rise of a middle class.

      Economic developments discussed may include: greater employment opportunities; improvements
      in industry; greater technological and scientific developments; a rise in living standards for many in
      the population; economic hardship in rural areas.

      Candidates should have specific references to their chosen country and have attempted to cover the
      whole timeframe in question. Most candidates will conclude that changes in education have
      improved the social and economic conditions of the country chosen although stronger candidates
      may consider the negative impact.

24.   To what extent was there a “digital revolution” in one country of the region in the second half
      of the 20th century?

      In responding to this question it is expected that popular choices will be Japan, South Korea,
      Taiwan and Singapore.

      The term digital revolution is used to describe the significant changes brought about by computing
      and communication technologies during the second half of the 20th century. Pivotal to this
      revolution was the mass production and widespread use of computers and mobile phones. In the
      1950s and 1960s computers were only used by governments and large organizations; however, by
      the 1970s, with the introduction of home computers they began to be used on a much larger scale.
      During the 1980s millions of computers made their way into schools, homes, business, and
      industry. Automated teller machines (ATMs), industrial robots, computer-generated imagery
      (CGI), electronic music and video games all helped to transform society. In 1983 mobile phones
      became commercially available in many countries. From 1990 to 2000, worldwide mobile phone
      ownership grew from 12.4 million to 750 million. Growth was rapid even in the developing world
      where mobile phones provided a solution to a shortage of landline connections. The World Wide
      Web became accessible to the public in 1991 and by 1999 almost every country had a connection.
      The economic impact of the digital revolution has been significant. Without the World Wide Web,
      globalization may not have occurred to the extent it has. The digital revolution radically changed
      the way individuals and companies interacted with each other. The ability to share information on a
      global scale also had political consequences as it provided new opportunities for communication
      and information-sharing in countries where this had previously been difficult. The ways technology
      has transformed education, medicine, sport and the arts may also be considered

      After assessing the different ways digital technology has transformed the economy and society of
      their chosen country most candidates will conclude that there has been a digital revolution. While
      most of the results identified will be positive in nature, candidates may also have considered the
