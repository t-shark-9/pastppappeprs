Examiners should be aware that in some cases, candidates may take a different approach, which if
appropriate should be rewarded. If in doubt, check with your Team Leader.

In the case of an “identify” question read all answers and mark positively up to the maximum marks.
Disregard incorrect answers. In all other cases where a question asks for a certain number of facts
eg “describe two kinds”, mark the first two correct answers. This could include two descriptions,
one description and one identification, or two identifications.

It should be recognized that, given time constraints, answers for part (c) questions are likely to include a
much narrower range of issues and concepts than identified in the markband. There is no “correct”
answer. Examiners must be prepared to award full marks to answers which synthesize and evaluate even
if they do not examine all the stimulus material.

      [1–2 marks]
      A limited response that demonstrates minimal knowledge and understanding of
      the topic through simple statements. There is little or no appropriate ITGS
      terminology in the response. Award a maximum of [2 marks] if only one method
      of training is included in the response.

      [3–4 marks]
      A response that demonstrates some knowledge and understanding of how two
      methods of training could be provided. Some relevant examples are used within
      the response. There is some use of appropriate ITGS terminology in the response.
      There may be no explicit comparison of the two methods of training.

      [5–6 marks]
      A thorough response that demonstrates knowledge and understanding of the topic
      and makes comparisons between two methods of specific training. Relevant
      examples and appropriate ITGS terminology are used throughout the response.

(c)   Discuss the advantages and disadvantages to the patient of using the MMC as
      a health care tool.                                                         [8 marks]

      Answers may include:
      Advantages
       remind patient to take the correct medication – uses facial recognition to
        identify patient and RFID tags on patient’s medication to ensure they are taking
        correct medication and not someone else’s
       remind patient to take medication on time – using facial recognition, identifies
        patient and reminds them to take medications daily
       tracking vital signs – can send information to doctor/nurse who can determine
        in levels are acceptable
       access up-to-date personalized health information – stores your health
        information (prescriptions, vital signs, etc) in one location
       interact online with physicians and pharmacists – if user cannot get out to
        office, that data collected can be accessed online by doctor/pharmacist
       used by people in remote areas with limited access to health care
       RFID-based smart labels attached to the individual medication as a safety
        measure
       vital sign sensors to monitor blood pressure and heart rate – like having nurse
        at home, and can be sent to doctor
       voice synthesis technology to allow additional audio output to what is shown
        on the cabinet display – gives audio cues for those visually impaired

      Disadvantages
       malfunction – may stop working, and therefore may not be able to access data
       malfunction – may not work if there is a power failure
       lockout – system may lock out patients making them unable to access their
        prescriptions
       may cause problems if patient does not use that bathroom for a period of time
        (gone on holiday, uses another bathroom, etc)
       database may not be kept up-to-date
       face recognition may wrongly identify a person within a house where there are
        members that look alike, and the image is captured with poor lighting
       people become reliant. Will not be able to reliably take medicine if it breaks
        down because they will not know what to do.

      Do not accept “it is difficult to use/handle”.

      In part (c) of this question it is expected there will be a balance in the ITGS
      terminology between IT technical terminology and the terminology related to
      social and ethical impacts.

2.   Who has my data?

     (a)   (i)    Identify four characteristics that may be required by a system when
                  setting up a strong password.                                       [4 marks]

                  Answers may include:
                   minimum length required
                   combination of numbers, symbols, lowercase OR uppercase letter
                   lowercase AND uppercase letters
                   avoid sequences or repeat characters
                   avoid dictionary words
                   password cannot be the same as the username
                   is different than previous passwords.

                  Award [1 mark] for each characteristic identified up to a maximum of
                  [4 marks].

           (ii)   Passwords are often set to expire periodically, such as every 90 days.
                  Identify two reasons why passwords are set to expire on a regular basis. [2 marks]

                  Answers may include:
                   narrows window of opportunity for hacker
                   old passwords cannot be reused if found as they have expired
                   it is a way to disable accounts that are not being used/are not active
                   secures data from previous employees who once had access
                   protects the account in case the owner has been sharing the password
                   when same password is used for too long it is easier for hackers to crack
                    it. Some methods to crack a password (brute force and dictionary) may
                    take some time to discover a password.

                  Award [1 mark] for each step identified up to a maximum of [2 marks].

(b)   Compare the security of typing a password with the security of using a finger
      scan.                                                                         [6 marks]

      Answers may include:
      Typing
       could be viewed by an individual watching keyboard
       keylogger programs can record passwords typed into system
       typed password could be guessed or hacked by an individual
       user writes down the password as he/she may not remember the password
       user constantly change password regularly and to remember them they will
        write them down.

      Finger scan
       someone else cannot login to your account – more secure, but can also be a
         problem if you need someone else to login for you
       someone cannot steal your password
       users do not need to memorize a password – no need to write down the
         password
       scan never changes because finger biometric patterns do not change – it cannot
         be used by a different person
       technology experts can duplicate a fingerprint, major security issue as user
         cannot change his/her fingerprint
       sensitivity of equipment may change over time, making the process less secure.

      [1–2 marks]
      A limited response that demonstrates minimal knowledge and understanding of
      the topic through simple statements. There is little or no appropriate ITGS
      terminology in the response. Award a maximum of [2 marks] if only one method
      of security is included in the response.

      [3–4 marks]
      A response that demonstrates some knowledge and understanding of comparing
      the security of typing a password with the security of using a finger scan. Some
      relevant examples are used within the response. There is some use of appropriate
      ITGS terminology in the response. There may be no explicit comparison of the
      two methods of security.

      [5–6 marks]

(c)   To what extent is it acceptable for the State of Furlong to hold sensitive data
      in its criminal database?                                                       [8 marks]

      Answers may include:
      Benefits
       would allow them to solve crimes using stored information, (eg, data in a DNA
        database)
       provides protection for children, holds a list of offenders in database
       allows background safety checks (jobs, schools)
       companies such as grocery stores and clothing stores already collect
        information with loyalty cards, many people are already giving out their
        information publically
       sensitive information as DNA may allow to identify a dead body.

      Concerns
       could open doors to misuse of information collected, who is authorized to
        access information
       database can be hacked, leads to possible loss of personal data
       data sharing between departments can be misused by others
       people have right to privacy, Human Rights Act
       accuracy of data, if not always kept current then incorrect information will be
        shared
       human error can occur during data input
       false positives can occur if persons are linked incorrectly by similar name or
        birth date
       source of information not always reliable, do not know where the information
        in the database originally came from
       identity theft can occur if this information can be stolen and misused.

      In part (c) of this question it is expected there will be a balance in the ITGS
      terminology between IT technical terminology and the terminology related to
      social and ethical impacts.

(b)   Explain three factors that could influence the decision by the school in Haiti
      to use open source or proprietary software on the donated computers.           [6 marks]

      Answers may include:
       cost – if development is done in-house by the company there are minimal
        development expenses / open source is free or cheaper than proprietary
        software, more licences can be installed (on more computers) and more
        software can be installed providing the donated computers with a greater
        variety of applications for the new users to have
       customization – open source software is designed for developers to adapt and
        extend. Proprietary software cannot make non-cosmetic changes
       flexible – open source software tends to adopt new trends faster than
        proprietary software
       integration – open source software integrates better with other systems.
        Proprietary software is often locked
       security – open source software fix problems quicker than proprietary software
       responsibility – proprietary software supports the product. Open source
        software has no direct support
       compatibility – proprietary software may offer different applications that use
        similar toolbars, making it easier for users / when installing open source
        different applications may have very different user interfaces, making it harder
        for users as they have to learn each.

      Award [1 mark] for each factor identified that have influenced the decision
      whether to use open source or proprietary software up to a maximum of
      [3 marks].
      Award an additional [1 mark] for each explanation of the factor identified that
      have influenced the decision whether to use open source or proprietary software
      up to a maximum addition of [3 marks].

(c)   Other companies are considering whether it is better to donate or dispose of
      obsolete equipment. Evaluate these two options.                              [8 marks]

      Answers may include:
      Donate
       give to organization in need – good publicity
       charitable companies will often pick up used equipment for free when donating
        equipment
       environmental issues – recycling is environmentally friendly way to get rid of
        older equipment, no waste
       tax friendly – is a charitable donation and eligible for a tax receipt
       age of equipment – if equipment is too old, no one will want it
       responsibility – company may feel responsibility that machines are working
        properly if they donate them to a school or charitable company, so they may
        not want to get involved
       donating will help in education/training
       gives those in need computers that they might not otherwise afford
       others can recycle/reuse these parts
       others can sell the parts for profit.

      Dispose
       security of data – need to ensure data is completely removed from hard drives
       environmental concerns – hazardous materials, need to be disposed of properly
       cost – often a fee for disposing of equipment properly
       functionality – if equipment is not working, it is easier to dispose of it as no
        one will want broken items.

      In part (c) of this question it is expected there will be a balance in the ITGS
      terminology between IT technical terminology and the terminology related to
      social and ethical impacts.

(c)   The management team of the tax office have realized that their previous
      disaster recovery plan was insufficient. As part of the analysis phase for the
      development of a future disaster recovery plan, they are considering various
      plans for setting up offsite backup. Two possible options are:
       in a different office in a nearby city
       cloud storage.

      Evaluate these two options.                                                          [8 marks]

      Answers may include:

      Advantages of cloud storage
       data transfer – files are automatically copied through the internet
       cost – low monthly fee
       space – it does not take up valuable space (physical and system’s memory)
       security – storing confidential or sensitive information in the cloud is often
        more secure than storing it locally. Data is encrypted both during transmission
        and while at rest, ensuring no unauthorized users can access the files
       automation – the user selects what and when he wants to back up, and the
        service does the rest
       accessibility – account can be accessed from any internet connection
       syncing – syncing ensures files are automatically updated across all the devices
       sharing – online storage services allow easily sharing files
       collaboration – online storage services allow multiple people to edit and
        collaborate on a single file or document
       protection – cloud storage serves as an added layer of data protection. Backups
        are kept in a secure location that is physically removed from the originals
       recovery – in the event of catastrophic data loss, one will have backups of all
        the original files.

      Disadvantages of cloud storage
       requires network connection – not accessible when the network is down
       expensive when done on a small scale
       security issues – do we accept hackers here?
       bandwidth issue – insufficient bandwidth can cause very slow
        upload/download
       cost – with cloud storage, subscriptions for multiple computers may be costly
       there is no easy migration from one cloud storage to another Cloud Service
        Provider
       tied to the financial health of another company – if the Cloud Service Provider
        has financial issues, that can bring negative consequences to the service
        provided to the tax office
       dependency (loss of control) – with cloud storage, everything is in the hands of
        the Cloud Service Provider
       integration – with cloud storage, integration with equipment hosted in other
        data centres is difficult to achieve.

Advantages of offsite data backup
 privacy and security – users might not be comfortable handing over their data
  to a third party, that is, control remains with the tax service
 privacy and security – in offsite data backup, only authorized employees of the
  tax office can access, retrieve or order the retrieval of the stored information.

Disadvantages of offsite data backup
 if data transfer is done electronically, security issues arise
 if data transfer is done electronically, connectivity issues arise
 requires staff, a building, etc – could be costly
 if done by physically transporting the data – labour intensive.

In part (c) of this question it is expected there will be a balance in the ITGS
terminology between IT technical terminology and the terminology related to
social and ethical impacts.

(ii)   Distinguish between the use of the waterfall method and the agile
       method in the development of a new information system for Earlet. [4 marks]

       Answers may include:
       Waterfall method
        sequential design process
        progress is seen as flowing steadily downwards (like a waterfall) through
         the phases
        sequential, non-overlapping phases
        at the end of every phase, there is a gate where a decision is made
        the product is only finished at the end of the last phase.

       Agile method
        emphasize values and principles rather than processes conceptual model
        project priorities are re-evaluated on a continuing basis
        especially beneficial for small teams with rapidly changing requirements

(b)   Analyse a patient’s decision to choose between an operation performed by a surgeon:
       without robotic surgery
       using robotic surgery.                                                      [6 marks]

      Answers may include:
      Advantages of robotic surgery over a surgery performed by a doctor
       the patient can be treated and operated on with a minimum of staff;
        consequently, less costs (relevant to patients that are not fully insured)
       doctors will tire and become fatigued. With robotic surgery this concern is
        reduced, even eliminated
       robotic surgery will allow for a much greater degree of precision and accuracy
       simpler procedure
       minimally invasive
       better technique
       reduced bleeding
       less painful
       smaller scar
       faster healing
       decreased hospital stay.

      Disadvantages of robotic surgery in comparison to a surgery performed by a
      doctor
       lack of tactile sensation for the surgeon, which may lead to errors
       robotic technology is extremely expensive – high cost of the equipment and
        thereby the procedure (relevant to patients that are not fully insured)
       robotic technology requires the training of specialized personnel
       amount of time required for a surgeon to master its use
       large space occupied by the side-cart (da Vinci example) reduces the access for
        the health professionals assisting the surgeon in the surgery, so fewer
        professionals may be involved, which could endanger the success of the
        operation
       emergency responsiveness – robotic technology might not be able to
        effectively respond to an emergency situation during the surgery
       patient might feel more comfortable with a human in charge.

      Do not accept answers that are clearly relevant only to the hospital or to the
      surgeon, but not to the patient.

      Answers may include:
      Responsibility of the surgeon
       injuries caused by surgical negligence
       injuries caused by insufficient or inadequate training
       decision of using robotic surgery without approval of patient
       injuries caused by misuse of the device.

                  Answers may include:
                   Engkey processes the question
                   Engkey uses keywords in the question to locate and compare it with
                    questions stored in a database in his memory
                   with the use of an inference engine, Engkey finds possible matches and

             Answers may include:
              feed Engkey with more information, so that he knows more about more
               topics such as any relevant example for language learning
              program Engkey in such a way that he can build more information on its
               own (eg if he does not know the answer for something, he will try to find
               the answer for it and save this answer to its memory) – self learning

(c)   To what extent should robots such as Engkey replace a human teacher for
      teaching English?                                                       [8 marks]

      Answers may include:
      Advantages of a robot over a human teacher
       children usually like robots and enjoy talking to one
       students are not usually intimidated with robots as they may be with an adult
       robots can be more patient than human teachers
       robots do not get tired nor feel sleepy
       robots do not get sick or are contaminated by a child’s sickness
       robots can benefit schools that struggle to recruit native English teachers
       a number of robots could work together using their collective intelligence.

      Disadvantages of a robot over a human teacher
       robots need a supply of power
       robots needs maintenance to keep it running
       the cost of making or buying a robot is probably higher than that of employing
        a human teacher
       robots lack human emotions
       to teach well, it is necessary to understand the needs of the one who is being
        taught
       with the present technology, robots can assist a teacher, but cannot teach
       if the robot cannot understand the pronunciation of the students, they may
        become disheartened with lack of progress.
