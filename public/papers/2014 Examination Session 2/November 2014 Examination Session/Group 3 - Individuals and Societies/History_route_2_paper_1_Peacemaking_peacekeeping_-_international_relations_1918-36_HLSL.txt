Read all the sources carefully and answer all the questions that follow.

Sources in this paper have been edited: word additions or explanations are shown in square brackets [ ];

These sources and questions relate to the geopolitical and economic impact of the Paris Peace Treaties of
St Germain, Trianon and Neuilly on Europe.

SOURCE A                JM Keynes, an economist who was a key member of the British delegation at the
                        Paris Peace Conference, writing in an academic book analysing the Paris Peace
                        Settlement, The Economic Consequences of the Peace (1919).

Those readers … must cast their minds to Russia, Turkey, Hungary, or Austria, where the most dreadful
conditions which men can suffer – famine, cold, disease, war, murder, and anarchy – are an actual present
experience … But the opportunity was missed at Paris during the six months which followed the armistice,
and nothing we can do now can repair the damage done at that time. Great deprivation and great risks
to society have become unavoidable. All that is now open to us is to redirect, so far as lies in our power,
the fundamental economic tendencies which form the basis of recent events, so that they promote the
re-establishment of prosperity and order, instead of leading us deeper into misfortune.


SOURCE B                Carroll Quigley, a professor of History, writing in a survey book on world history,
                        Tragedy and Hope (1966).

The peace settlements made in this period were subjected to vigorous and detailed criticism in the two
decades 1919–1939. This criticism was as strong from the victors as from the vanquished [defeated].
Although this attack was largely aimed at the terms of the treaties, the real causes of the attack did not lie
in these terms, which were neither unfair nor ruthless, were far more lenient than any settlement which
might have emerged from a German victory, and which created a new Europe which was, at least politically,
more just than the Europe of 1914. The causes of the discontent with the settlements of 1919–1923
rested on the procedures which were used to make these settlements rather than on the terms of the
settlements themselves.

SOURCE C                Graham Ross, a lecturer in International Relations, writing in an academic
                        history book, The Great Powers and the Decline of the European States System
                        1914–1945 (1983).

The Austrian Republic claimed the right to be regarded as a new state and not as the successor of
Austria–Hungary but the Allies rejected this argument. Furthermore they prohibited [banned] union
with Germany. Austria was thus left in a financially weak position, cut off from her former empire and
concerned by the existence of German speaking minorities in the South Tyrol and in Czechoslovakia.
There was little she could do about it, however, and the same was true of Hungary. The latter complained
bitterly about the loss of territory to Czechoslovakia, Rumania and Yugoslavia which also involved the loss
of substantial Magyar minorities to all three. It was precisely their fear of Hungarian nationalism which
brought the three states together by various agreements in 1920 and 1921, which became known as the
Little Entente.


SOURCE D                Raymond Poincaré, president of France between 1913 and 1920, in the opening
                        speech to the delegates at the Paris Peace Conference on 18 January 1919.

The time is no more when diplomats could meet to redraw with authority the map of the empires on
the corner of a table. If you are to remake the map of the world it is in the name of the peoples, and on
condition that you shall faithfully interpret their thoughts, and respect the right of nations, small and great,
to self-determination, and to respect it with the rights, equally sacred, of ethnic and religious minorities …
You will naturally try to ensure the material and moral means of subsistence [economic support] for all
those peoples who are created or recreated into states; for those who wish to unite themselves to their
neighbours; for those who divide themselves into separate units; for those who reorganize themselves
according to their particular traditions; and, lastly, for all those whose freedom you have already agreed to
or are about to agree to.
