                                                SECTION A

1.   (a)   Describe two features of a sole trader.                                                  [4 marks]

           A sole trader runs an unincorporated business. There is therefore no legal
           separation between the owner and the business. A sole trader has unlimited
           liability and is responsible/liable for the debt of the business that may be paid with
           the sole trader’s personal assets.

           A sole trader will not face long and expensive setting up procedures. A sole
           trader/sole owner has complete control and is free to make decisions about the
           business without any consultation.

           Accept any other relevant feature.

           N.B. credit candidates that mention an advantage resulting from being a
           sole trader.


           Mark as 2 + 2.

           Award [1 mark] for each relevant and correct feature of a sole trader identified
           and [1 mark] for an appropriate description up to a maximum of [2 marks].

            N.B. do not penalize errors which are carried through.

            N.B. candidates can reach the top markband without presenting the column
            “Kilograms of fish supplied by DSC to the hotels”.

            [1 to 2 marks]
            For [1 mark] there must be some understanding shown. There are many
            inaccuracies/mistakes and the layout and working are poor. Or the layout is
            clear despite inaccuracies for [2 marks].

            [3 to 4 marks]
            The calculations contain two to three errors. The layout and/or the working
            is unclear/untidy.

            [5 to 6 marks]
            The layout and the working are largely clear and the calculations are
            essentially accurate. If the candidate does not incorporate the sale of the
            fish after two days, award a maximum of [5 marks].

             [7 to 8 marks]
            The layout and all working are clear and all the calculations are accurate.
            The last column may not be presented, but the closing stock is correct,
            hence the sale to processing factory was essentially incorporated. For
            [8 marks] all the relevant calculation for both processing stock and for stock
            held are present, the closing stock figure should also be correct.

(ii)   Using the information provided, calculate DSC’s typical weekly gross
       profit after taking into account the number of fish sold to the
       processing factory (show all your working).                          [3 marks]

       A typical weekly gross profit for DSC:
       Total revenue – Total cost  profit
       Total revenue from selling the fish to the hotels = $1600 (160kg ×$10)

       N.B. the candidates are not expected to repeat all of the calculations from
       the question above.

       Total revenue from selling the fish to the processing factory  $120 (30kg @$4)
       Total revenue = $1600 + $120 = $1720
       Less cost of goods sold
       Opening stock  0
       Purchases  $1340
       Less closing stock $130
        $1210
       Total revenue  Total costs = $1720  $1210 = $510

       Award [1 mark] for limited understanding of how to calculate the gross
       profit, working may not be shown, or may be inaccurate.

       Award [2 marks] for some understanding of the method/process of
       calculating gross profit, but with an error in the calculation that might affect
       the final figure.

       If the candidate does not incorporate the sale to the processing factory, but
       the remaining calculations are correct, award up to [2 marks].

       Award [3 marks] for a correct method/process, clear and correct working
       and correct final answer.

       If the candidate produces the correct final answer but does not show
       working, award [1 mark].

       Allow candidate own figure rule (OFR).

(iii) Calculate DSC’s typical weekly gross profit margin (show all your
      working).                                                         [2 marks]

       Award [2 marks] for a correct figure in percentage with working.
       Award [1 mark] for a correct answer which is not in percentage.
       Award [1 mark] for the correct answer in percentage without working, or for some
       implied understanding (candidate own figure rule [OFR] applies).
       Award [0 mark] if OFR applied, but the answer is not in percentage.

(c)   Explain one advantage for DSC if they provide fish meeting national quality
      standards.                                                                           [2 marks]

      Fish is a highly perishable product that can affect human health / well-being.
      Meeting national quality standards should provide the following advantages for
      DSC:

      Given the information in the stimulus, DSC avoids possible litigation about the
      food quality as well as avoids facing a threat of closure by the government.

      Other issues may include:
       it should gain recognition for providing quality fish which can lead to a
        competitive advantage from doing so (a marketing advantage)
       it may attract higher quality workers
       it can lead to increased motivation for DSC’s workers
        Candidates can explain that the above two human resource issues can lead to
        improvements in the service provided.

      Accept any other relevant advantage with an explanation.


      Award [1 mark] for a relevant and correct advantage for DSC of providing fish
      that meet national quality standards identified and [1 mark] for an explanation of
      this advantage up to a maximum of [2 marks].

      N.B. if the explanation is generic and not applied to DSC award [1 mark].

(d)   Using the PEST model, examine the impact of the external environment
      on DSC.                                                              [6 marks]

      It is expected that the candidate shows clear understanding that the question refers
      to the external environment only.

      N.B. do not credit any relevant internal issues.

      It is also expected that the candidate applies the external forces identified to DSC
      rather than producing a theoretical / potential examination of some of the PEST
      factors. It is also expected that as part of the examination, candidates
      identify/refer to opportunities and threats (similar terminology may be used).

      Below are some suggestions as to the structure and content of the answer.

      N.B. accept pressure groups as either a political, or a social factor.

      Political/legal
      The government has a restriction on DSC regarding the amount of daily fishing.
      Potentially one can argue it is a threat as the given permit limits the flexibility of
      DSC to respond to a possible increase in demand. However, from the figures
      given, it is clear that DSC is not near the 70 kg limit, hence it is an opportunity for
      DSC to adhere to the limit while the competitors may be more restricted and
      possibly use this as a USP: an opportunity to increase its competitive position.

      The suggested legislation for a compulsory installation of new and sophisticated
      technological equipment for fishing may be seen as a threat for DSC given the
      current financial position.

      Economics
      The competition is intensifying; this is a big threat to DSC who adheres to all of
      the regulations. Due to the competition, the bargaining power of the buyers
      (the hotels) is increasing, which has resulted in a fixed price of $10 per kilogram
      of fish.

      Social
      The local hotels have demanded the fishermen to be socially responsible. This is
      an opportunity for DSC, as the organization adheres to the strict demand. As a
      result, DSC’s competitive position can be stronger.

      The environmental pressure group that is pressurizing the government can be seen
      as an opportunity as DSC adheres strictly to the regulations and would see a less
      severe competitive environment if some of the illegal competitors stop operating.

      Technological
      The stimulus implies an availability of advanced technology for ethical fishing.
      This can be seen as an opportunity for DSC who is truly committed to
      ethical fishing if they are able to purchase the new equipment. However, DSC
      might find it difficult to purchase the new technology given its financial position;
      hence an imposed change of technology can be seen as a threat (this point
      cannot be repeated twice under two different PEST headings).
                                       – 10 –            N14/3/BUSMT/HP2/ENG/TZ0/XX/M

Weather conditions, the physical environment also impacts on the operation of DSC, on
occasions it can be judged as an opportunity in others a threat.

It is expected that the external factors are identified and clearly indicated.
Do not credit a response that does not mention a specific factor, but only makes
some reference to “competition” or “pressure groups” etc.

Accept ethics or environment as external factors.

Accept any other relevant / applicable examination of opportunities or threats
classified under the relevant PEST factors.

Accept similar terminology such as advantage / disadvantage, positive and
negative impact / pressure on / beneficial / non-beneficial.

N.B. it is not expected that candidates will include all of the above points in their
answer.

A balanced response is one that covers at least two of the PEST factors as well as
two opportunities and two threats.


N.B. Candidates can create a balanced response by using different factors / forces,
one as an opportunity and the other as a threat. In other words do not expect
a coverage of opportunity and a threat for each factor(s)/force(s).

For a list and/or a superficial description of up to 4 relevant external factors
award up to [2 marks].

For one relevant issue/factor that is one-sided, with no examination, award up to a
maximum of [3 marks].

For more than one relevant factor, even up to four, that are one-sided award up to
[4 marks].

For one relevant PEST factor that is balanced, with examination of an opportunity
and a threat, award up to a maximum of [4 marks].

For more than one relevant PEST factor that is one-sided, with no examination,
award up to a maximum of [4 marks].

2.   (a)   Describe two features of SF operating as a private limited company.                 [4 marks]

           Two features of SF operating as a private limited company may include:
            The company is incorporated. There is a separate legal entity between the
             shareholders namely Ori and Dan and other members of the family and the
             company itself.
            The shareholders have limited liability. Dan, Ori and the remaining
             shareholders can only lose up to what they invested in SF. Their private assets
             will not be affected in the event of any financial problems.
            The current owners, Dan and Ori cannot sell shares publically on the stock
             exchange in order to raise more money to solve the current cash-flow problem.
             Shares can only be sold privately with the agreement of the other shareholders
             of 25%. This is usually to people known to the current shareholders.
            Accept any other relevant feature.


           Mark as 2+2.

           Award [1 mark] for identifying each appropriate feature and [1 mark] for an
           appropriate description (application not required), up to a maximum of [2 marks].

(b)   Explain two advantages and one disadvantage for SF of operating “The
      Single” and “The Quad” as separate profit centres.                   [6 marks]

      The possible advantages for SF are:
      By not managing SF as single entity, possible diseconomies of scale can be
      avoided. Dan and Ori might find it increasingly difficult to control every aspect
      of the organization if SF grows. The decentralization of power through delegation
      of power and authority from each brother to employees in each profit centre can
      improve the speed and the quality of decision making, as well as the motivation of
      employees. Dan and Ori will be able to monitor performance more accurately,
      including variance analysis of each centre. Different strategies can be devised and
      implemented for each. Healthy competition between each profit centre in the
      production of each model can also improve quality and efficiency.

      Accept any other relevant benefit for SF.

      The possible disadvantages for SF are:
      Unhealthy competition between the workers of “The Single” and “The Quad” may
      reduce morale. The focus of the employees in the different profit centres may
      become too narrow and the overall aims / objective and strategy of SF may be lost
      / ignored. Some decision taken by the employees in one centre / one type of boat
      may not be in the best interest of SF. Some duplication of resources may occur,
      such as design, marketing and so on. Resulting in possible loss of opportunities of
      economies of scale. The employees might concentrate on profit rather than the
      quality of the boats. SF can lose its competitive advantage / brand image if any of
      the models are not built to the expected high standard.

      It might be difficult to allocate the fixed costs of SF accurately; hence costs might
      be allocated in an arbitrary way which may impact negatively, or positively, on
      the assessment of the performance of each profit centre.

      Accept other relevant disadvantage for SF.


      Mark as 4 + 2.

      Award [1 mark] for identifying each appropriate advantage for SF of operating
      each model as a separate profit centre up to a maximum of [2 marks] and [1 mark]
      for an appropriate explanation of each advantage with relevant application to SF
      up to a maximum of [2 marks].

      [4 marks] in total for two advantages.

      Award [1 mark] for identifying one appropriate disadvantage for SF of operating
      each model as a profit centre and award an additional [1 mark] for an appropriate
      explanation of the disadvantage with relevant application to SF up to a maximum
      of [2 marks].

(iii) whether the production of “The Quad” should be subcontracted
      overseas, assuming that the sales of “The Single” stay the same as
      in 2014.                                                           [5 marks]

     All figures in US$.

     Current profit without subcontracting the production of “The Quad”:
     Total revenue  (15000  6)  (25000  4)  190000
     Total cost  50000  (6 12000  4 18000)  194000
     A loss of – 4000

     Profit if the production of “The Quad” is subcontracted:
     SF still to produce “The Single”:
     Total revenue  6 15000  90000 (assuming the same production level)
     Total cost  36000  (12000  6)  108000
     A loss of –18000

     “The Quad” produced at new location:
     20% sales price reduction  5000
     The new price is 20 000
     Total revenue  20000  8  160000
     Total cost  0  (8 14000)  112000
     A profit of 48 000
     Overall profit for SF  –18000  48000  30000
     Which is 34000 better than not subcontracting “The Quad”.

(d)   Analyse the suggestion that SF should change from job production to flow
      production (Option 1).                                                   [6 marks]

      It is expected that the candidates provide a short description, or explanation of the
      change / the main differences between the production methods.
      The possible benefits to SF if it changes the production method from job to flow
      might be:
      Lower production costs due to an increase in scale of production / economies of
      scales, less-skilled employees – especially in the medium to long run will also
      alleviate the cash-flow problems.
      If sophisticated automated machines are bought, some mass customization may be
      possible, hence, SF will still be able to be somewhat flexible and customer focused.
      The lower cost per unit due to large scale production will enable SF to reduce the
      price per boat and hence to compete with the mass producers of rowing boats.

      Accept any other relevant, applicable issue.

      However,
      Changing to flow production method will significantly reduce SF’s ability to offer
      custom-made rowing boats and remain a market-orientated organization as in the case
      when a job production method is being used. SF’s USP is likely to disappear as the
      quality is likely to be reduced. A quick production method will not create a USP as
      the customers are willing to wait.

      SF will not be able to use a price skimming strategy for it new rowing boats. The
      motivation of the highly-skilled employees is likely to fall given the new production
      method. With automated machinery, they will not be able to use their specialized
      skills.

      Ori, the Finance Director, is worried about the initial cost of buying the new
      technology resulting from the move to job production. More borrowing might
      increase SF’s cash-flow problems.

      Accept any other relevant, applicable issue.

      To achieve the top markband candidates must give a balanced analysis of two
      relevant positives and two relevant negatives of the impacts of changing the
      production method.

      To achieve full marks, [6 marks], candidates must give a balanced analysis of two
      relevant positives and two relevant negatives of the impacts of changing the
      production method with explicit description, albeit short one of the nature /
      characteristics of the two methods.

      For one relevant impact that is one-sided, with no analysis award up to a maximum of
      [3 marks]. For two relevant impacts that are one-sided, with no analysis award up to

                                               SECTION B

3.   (a)   Describe one feature of:

           (i)    job enlargement.                                                                [2 marks]

                  One feature of job enlargement is when a business increases the number of
                  tasks/roles to be carried out by an individual along the same level of
                  hierarchy/difficulties/parallel tasks/roles without changing the challenge.
                  Job enlargement occurs horizontally in an organization increasing the range
                  but not the depth of tasks. Job enlargement is a non-financial motivator.

                  Accept any other relevant description.

                  Candidates do not have to implicitly refer to horizontal loading, but to
                  show some understanding that the job is to be carried out at the same
                  level/roles/responsibility.

                  N.B. specific application is not expected.


                  Credit relevant / applicable examples for [1 mark].

                  Award [1 mark] for the relevant feature identified and [1 mark] for the
                  description of that feature. Award up to a maximum of [2 marks].

           (ii)   international quality standards.                                                [2 marks]

                  One feature of international quality standards is that it is an international
                  benchmark, or an agreed predetermined level of quality which a good or
                  service must meet, in order for this good or service to be awarded an
                  accepted standard which is recognized by many countries throughout the
                  world.

                  Accept any other relevant description.


                  Award [1 mark] for the relevant feature identified and [1 mark] for the
                  description of that feature with reference to a wider than own country
                  recognition. Award up to a maximum of [2 marks].

                  N.B. just repeating the word international is not sufficient for [2 marks].

                  N.B. credit an example, only if it is described; otherwise award [0 marks].
                  A repetition of the term / word such as ISO cannot be accepted as an
                  example.

(b)   Explain how each of the three issues identified, could have impacted on
      C4U’s revenue leading to its first loss in 11 years.                    [6 marks]

      The first issue might have irritated and frustrated customers who through word-of-
      mouth promotion and social media raised complaints, leading to a loss of goodwill.
      The delays and cancellation were perceived as poor customer service, it resulted
      in a fall in demand of existing customers as well as lower demand from new
      customers and hence revenue – informed through social media of the unreliability
      on the part of C4U.

      The second issue is an ethical one. If the advertising is misleading and flight
      prices for return fares are deemed unfair, existing and new customers would have
      possibly transferred to competitors, leading to a fall in demand for C4U services
      and thus lower revenue for its flight services.

      The third issue is the increase choice availability of substitutes / bargaining power
      of consumers. A larger number of competitors with higher efficiency levels are
      likely to result in customers being taken away from C4U, hence a fall in total
      revenue and profit.


      Mark as 2+2+2 for each issue.

      Award [1 mark] for application to C4U, award an additional [1 mark] for a
      developed explanation of how the fall in revenue / demand / sales could have
      occurred up to a maximum of [2 marks] per issue.

      N.B. given the fact that this question is very easy, it is very important that the
      candidate actually explains how / why the total revenue falls / fall in demand /
      sales. It is also expected that for full marks, the candidates go beyond just
      copying the information from the stimulus.

      Do not credit explanation of “increase in cost”.

(c)   Analyse two appropriate sources of finance that C4U could use to purchase
      the new aircrafts for the new Q4U service.                                [6 marks]

      As C4U is a plc, an obvious source of finance for the new aircrafts would be to
      issue new shares to existing shareholders and/or to the public. The existing
      shareholders would be confident in buying these shares given that C4U is
      attempting to reverse the first loss in 11 years by introducing this new Q4U
      service. Other investors might be interested in buying shares in an organization
      that was profitable for many years apart from the last one. The gearing ratio will
      also improve, as extra shares reduce the relative percentage of current loans.

      However, C4U will have to spend funds preparing for organizing and raising the
      awareness of the share issue and it will take time to receive the fresh capital.
      Of course, the other problem is that the share issue may not be fully taken up, ie
      successful, given the emerging financial difficulties (first loss) and the industrial
      unrest, and there will not be funds for the new aircrafts. This “embarrassment”
      may also jeopardize future share issues and create a further loss of goodwill in the
      eyes of the share markets.
                                      – 18 –            N14/3/BUSMT/HP2/ENG/TZ0/XX/M

A second source of finance, given the risk involved, is to lease the new aircrafts.
By leasing, C4U is not committing significant funds (at a time of a rising
gearing ratio) and periodically will be able to take advantage of any new
technological developments, which may arise in the airline industry as newly
leased aircrafts will be updated by the manufacturer. Leasing will also give Q4U
more flexibility regarding the number of aircrafts to be used given the future
demand.

However, working capital remains limited and the leasing costs will lead to an
additional outflow expense from the profit and loss account. If the launch of Q4U
does not go well then sales revenues may not rise enough to pay for the leasing
costs of the new aircrafts. C4U’s losses will be sustained and could worsen.

Given the increasing gearing ratio, it is not expected that C4U will take on any
additional loan finance to finance the purchase of the new aircrafts. However, if
the candidates use this option, they must provide a counter argument why this
option is not really viable for Q4U.

Accept the option of selling fixed assets like current aircrafts as long as the
candidate provides a counter argument for this option as the capacity to keep
operating the low cost service will be seriously affected.

Accept government grants as long as the rationale as to why the government
might give grants to a public limited company / private ownership organization is
well explained.

Accept any other relevant analysis.


For one appropriate source of finance that is one-sided, with no analysis, award up
to a maximum of [3 marks]. For one relevant issue that is balanced, with
analysis, award up to a maximum of [4 marks]. For more than one relevant issue
that is one-sided, with no analysis award up to a maximum of [4 marks].

Please do not accept additional loan financing as an answer unless there is a clear
balanced analysis given the rising gearing ratio.

Marks should be allocated according to the markbands on page 3.

(d)   Evaluate the two new methods of training and examination that C4U are
      considering to prepare flight staff for the new Q4U service.          [9 marks]

      The two new methods of training are off-the-job training by the hotel with
      experience of offering high quality service and more self study with staff expected
      to reach international quality standards by studying for and sitting an examination
      in their own time.

      C4U lacks experience in the high income “luxury market”. The training by the
      hotel, although not exactly in the same industry, the vital issue of customer
      service can be easily transferred. For example, the people and the process mix of
      the service industry will be enhanced and will provide C4U with uptodate
      successful training methods in a market which tries to provide a high quality
      customer service.

      As C4U relies on non-financial motivation for its staff through job enlargement,
      this training will increase the skill set of flight staff (leading to perhaps greater job
      enrichment as well) and further non-financial motivation. Productivity at C4U
      may increase. The training will hopefully lead to improved customer service,
      lifting the reputation of C4U as an airline and quantity demanded of all flights
      may increase.

      Moreover, compared with the second option, staff will have to be released from
      their daily task to be trained externally in the hotel. Not during their own free
      time hence the training will be less stressful.

      However, the cost of this training will need to be borne by C4U and the working
      capital is limited. Q4U may have to borrow/raise finance to finance its human
      assets as well as its fixed assets. One may argue that given the new type of
      business, and the market positioning as well as the nature of the industry/service,
      it is worth investing in the quality of the staff even by borrowing.

      Still the training is to be conducted in a different industry. How relevant will it be?
      There will also be some disruption to workforce productivity given that the
      training is off-the-job and away from C4U’s headquarters, C4U is already
      experiencing staff shortages.

      Moreover, the organization culture of this particular hotel may not fit the
      organizational culture of Q4U.

      The introduction of exam training to allow flight staff to become internationally
      recognized in customer service will be a powerful motivator for those staff who
      study and pass in their own time. It is likely that the staff will appreciate the
      advantages of being internationally recognized in terms of their qualification and
      the great opportunity of international mobility, or even just job mobility in the
      industry. Wages for qualified staff may rise in order to encourage success
      (although this is a form of financial motivation), C4U has staff shortages and the
      creation of a new flight service, Q4U and international accreditation may help to
      reduce current recruitment issues.
                                       – 20 –             N14/3/BUSMT/HP2/ENG/TZ0/XX/M

However, the process of studying while working can be extremely stressful as the
workload is too great. The current staff are complaining that they are already
overworked and are threatening to take industrial action. C4U cannot afford this
conflict and the inevitable poor publicity that industrial action brings. Revenue
could fall further. The situation is made worse by new competitors whom it is
assumed would gladly take over C4U’s market share for both flight services in the
event of a work-to-rule or industrial stoppage such as strike action. These
customers may not return to C4U at all.

It will be difficult to monitor the learning process throughout, but passing the
examination will ensure the management at C4U that internationally accepted
standards have been reached. The same cannot be said of off-the-job training by
the hotel. No objective criteria is currently available to assess the quality of the
training and the employees’ achievement.

Accept any other relevant and applicable arguments for, or against, the two
options.

Given the two difficult human resource situations, it is likely that C4U will accept
the off-the-job training from the hotel rather than ask all overworked flight staff to
study for and pass an additional examination. The off-the-job training by the
hotel will lead to improvements in C4U’s current customer service and if
marketed accurately lead to increases in revenue given that C4U, although
entering a new higher income market will wish to preserve their positioning as the
lowest priced airline. C4U given its first loss in 11 years and growing
competition, cannot afford a prolonged bout of further human resource conflict
and the examination will only breed more discontent especially among staff who
seem to be struggling with a work-life balance and job enlargement.

Accept any other relevant and substantiated conclusions.

It is not expected that the candidates contrast “off-the-job” and “on-the-job”
training.

N.B. accept the classification of the second training option as either off or on the
job or no classification at all, as long as the answer is applicable and relevant and
not merely theoretical. There is enough information in the stimulus to evaluate
the two options without using the classification of the training as a base for the
evaluation.

N.B. it is not expected that all of the above issues are incorporated.

It is not expected that the candidates evaluate or even refer to different types of
examination, but look at the second option as “one package”. For example, study
in their own free time in order to take the required exam.


For one relevant issue that is one-sided, award up to [3 marks]. If the response is
a one-sided relevant approach with no analysis award a maximum of [4 marks].

4.   (a)   Define the term organizational culture.                                               [2 marks]

           Organizational culture is defined as the values, beliefs and norms which exist in a
           workplace underpinning working relationships, ways of communicating, reward
           systems, workforce planning, etc between both internal and external stakeholders.

           Candidates are not expected to word their definition exactly as above.


           Award [1 mark] for a definition like “the way we do things around here”.

           Award [1 mark] for a basic definition that conveys partial knowledge and
           understanding.

           Award [2 marks] for a full, clear definition that conveys knowledge and
           understanding similar to the answer above.

           N.B. do not credit as an example, or a definition, candidates that just copy the
           sentence from the stimulus describing CB’s culture.

     (b)   Identify two key features of intuitive decision-making.                               [2 marks]

           Key features of intuitive decision making could include the following:
            relies on the “gut feeling” or natural instinct of the leadership team when
             making decisions
            relies on experience of previous decisions which have been made and reflects
             on how the decision making could be improved
            contradicts scientific decision-making which relies more on numerical, or
             statistical, data, or the analysis of past data trends
            accept any other relevant feature.


           Award [1 mark] for each correct feature of intuitive decision-making identified,
           up to a maximum of [2 marks].
                                            – 23 –            N14/3/BUSMT/HP2/ENG/TZ0/XX/M

(c)   Explain two benefits and one cost to CB of using an employee
      share-ownership scheme.                                      [6 marks]

      A share-ownership scheme at CB is likely to be seen as a financial incentive as
      well as gratitude and trust of employees from management. Better performance of
      CB employees will likely to result in more profit and hence more dividends, as
      well as potential for capital gain if the price of shares increases due to a sound
      organizational performance. Hence, a clear stake for the employees in the
      company, creates greater likelihood for the employees to be motivated, creative,
      fit the organizational culture, and contribute to a better performance of CB. There
      is evidence in the stimulus that the employees are creative, loyal and as a result,
      CB has been awarded a substantial contract.

      An employee share-ownership scheme will enhance the current culture and
      complements the democratic leadership style of Jennifer. The financial and other
      rewards from share ownership create the much needed self-motivated and creative
      employees.

      There is evidence in the stimulus that this is indeed the case at CB with three of
      Jennifer’s college friends still at the company. Higher staff retention / low staff
      turnover reduce costs of recruitment for CB, enhances its reputation, which will
      further reduce the costs of future recruitment due to its reputation.

      Profit sharing via share ownership might be also perceived as fair by employees
      further increasing motivation. If profit is not made, CB’s management may not be
      obliged to provide extra financial incentive. Such a decision is unlikely to create
      resentment among the employees.

      Accept any other relevant and applicable argument.

      However,
      Jennifer wants CB to grow and expand even internationally. The possible cost to
      CB is that as the company grows and more employees are added, each individual
      share-ownership reward is potentially diluted. This situation may cause some
      resentment between current employees. The former may feel that it is unfair that
      the latter may receive the same share-ownership reward.

      More shareholders will prolong the strategic decision-making process and with
      more people some disagreements are likely to emerge, which may reduce the
      current flexibility and responsiveness of the creative teams.

      If the share-ownership scheme is related to CB’s share price and this falls, then
      morale within CB could decrease. Employees’ motivation may be negatively
      affected.

      Accept any other relevant and applicable issue.
      Application should extend beyond just stating the issue to be credited.
                                             – 24 –           N14/3/BUSMT/HP2/ENG/TZ0/XX/M

      Mark as 4+2.

      Award [1 mark] for identifying each appropriate benefit for CB of using an
      employee share-ownership scheme up to a maximum of [2 marks] and [1 mark]
      for an appropriate explanation of each benefit with relevant application to CB up
      to a maximum of [2 marks].

      [4 marks] in total for two benefits.

      Award [1 mark] for identifying one appropriate cost for CB of using an employee
      share-ownership scheme and award an additional [1 mark] for an appropriate
      explanation of the cost with relevant application to CB up to a maximum of
      [2 marks].


(d)   Analyse the effectiveness of using flexible project teams for CB.                      [6 marks]

      The structure of CB is essentially the matrix structure. Using flexible project
      teams implies temporary use of different project groups that incorporates the most
      suitable employees for particular projects. A project team is an example of a
      flexible structure that fits the creative, technological and task-orientated culture
      of CB. There is clear evidence in the stimulus that the project teams have clearly
      worked well.

      CB has produced many innovative television commercials and is a sustainable
      business employing 24 people. Project teams would be conducive to the
      democratic leadership style employed by Jennifer and would allow greater
      generation of new and creative ideas. An effective strategic fit was created
      between culture, leadership style and structure at CB.

      On an individual level, the matrix structure also benefits the employees through
      more freedom to use ones own skills and talents. The rotation of team leadership
      provides employees with opportunity to acquire new skills. This structure creates
      job enlargement and enrichment. For certain types of employees it is highly
      rewarding and motivating.

      There is plenty of evidence in the stimulus that so far the matrix structure was
      highly successful.

      Accept any other relevant and applied argument in favour of flexible / project
      team structure.

      However, project teams may suffer from “paralysis by analysis” if the democratic
      process becomes too long as the team tries to include all voices and ideas of
      highly qualified and experienced employees in the decision-making process.
      Each project team will require fresh leadership. There is no evidence in the
      stimulus that such negative consequences occurred so far, but as CB is facing
      strategic options to agree upon, the above issues might materialize especially in
      the long run when CB keeps on growing.
                                     – 25 –            N14/3/BUSMT/HP2/ENG/TZ0/XX/M

Moreover, the project team’s leadership objectives may be based more on short
termism and might conflict with CB’s overall strategic objectives. Resources will
also need to be allocated to ensure the smooth running and cooperation of all the
team members and this could lead to an increase in administration costs. Potential
managerial economies of scale could be lost, as project teams are dissolved after
the problem-solving exercise has taken place and new teams are created to solve
future problems.

While this type of structure was very suitable for CB as a small organization, the
structure may bring about new challenges in terms of coordination and control
especially if integration with overseas employees will occur – cultural and
linguistic problems may be created which will reduce the efficiency of CB.

Accept any other relevant and applied argument against flexible / project team
structure.


For one relevant issue that is one-sided, with no analysis award up to a maximum
of [3 marks]. For more than one relevant issue that is one-sided, with no analysis
award up to a maximum of [4 marks].

For a fully balanced answer, candidates are expected to provide 2 + 2 arguments
for and against.

If the candidate does not make a reference to the temporary / flexible / rotating
nature of the group, but only refers to the advantages and the disadvantages of
working in groups/teams award up to a maximum of [4 marks].

Marks should be allocated according to the markbands on page 3.
                                            – 26 –            N14/3/BUSMT/HP2/ENG/TZ0/XX/M

(e)   Recommend which of the two strategic options CB should pursue.                         [9 marks]

      The internal growth by producing the TV commercial presents a very important
      strategic move for CB. Growing internally may seem like the easier option given
      the current success resulting from a strategic fit between the culture and the
      democratic leadership style of Jennifer.

      By choosing the first option, CB capitalizes on their strengths and possibly their
      unique selling point to take advantage of some opportunities. The effective /
      important culture, structure and the leadership will be maintained.

      The above can be judged as very significant arguments for this option as due to
      their creativity, employees’ motivation, and flexibility, CB was given the contract.

      However, it represents a significant short-term financial risk given the need to
      solely finance the TV commercial and the current short-term working capital
      issues. Many organizations go into liquidation due to short-term liquidity
      problems and Jennifer has to be very careful that she finds ways of raising
      short-term finance.

      Perhaps internal growth limits the long-term potential for growth for CB.

      Moreover, South Korea is an unknown market with CB having to employ
      additional staff of whom they may not know. In addition, they will need
      inducting into CB’s organizational culture. There will be a period of transition
      required – true in fact if either option is chosen. This argument may be judged as
      less significant compared to the issues above, as the above issue is really just
      applicable for both options, but less for option 1.

      N.B. accept any relevant, applicable argument for option 1.

      The joint venture allows CB to share the risk and cost. CB will be able to gain
      local knowledge to produce an innovative commercial. Sharing costs and risk can
      reduce, or even eliminate the current worries about the working capital of CB.
      A significant short-term argument in favour of the joint venture option.

      However, the scale of operation for CB will increase dramatically and Jennifer
      may have to modify her democratic leadership style as inevitably spans of control
      will widen. The current very effective structure of flexible project teams might be
      stopped, or Korean employees will have to participate as well. Large size and
      possible cross-cultural issues may negatively affect CB’s USP / creativity.
      The relocation of one of her teams may impact on some of the long standing
      relationships Jennifer has created. The current low staff turnover at CB and
      relocating trusted and valued colleagues may create some short-term tensions.

      However, a success in South Korea can open many a new opportunity for CB. If
      the option is successful, Jennifer can look for other joint venture opportunities in
      different countries. Opportunities that Jennifer may desire.

Conclusion/judgment
The decision will depend on the degree to which Jennifer wishes to change her
business to take up this new opportunity. Assuming that revenues from the TV
commercial will be the same if either CB grows internally or externally, the
deciding factor may be initial costs, Jennifer’s concern about using up all her
working capital and the degree to which CB’s culture will change if she works
alongside a new partner. If these restrainers can be minimized, CB should look to
the joint venture as the financial opportunities from creating this TV commercial
in a new market are considerable.

It is expected that one option is recommended and that candidates produce a
substantiated recommendation / judgment.

Accept any other relevant issues with a substantiated recommendation / judgment.

5.   (a)   (i)    Identify one possible variable cost of production, other than wages, that
                  a manufacturing company may face.                                               [1 mark]

                  Examples of variable costs include:
                   raw materials
                   utilities
                   overtime payments
                   accept any other relevant variable cost.


                  Award [1 mark] for the relevant cost identified.        Candidates are not
                  expected to provide a definition or directly apply.

           (ii)   Identify one possible fixed cost of production that a manufacturing
                  company may face.                                                               [1 mark]

                  Examples of fixed costs include:
                   rent/leasing costs
                   salaries
                   fixed-price contracted services (for maintenance, or cleaning, etc)
                   accept any other relevant fixed cost.


                  Award [1 mark] for the relevant cost identified.        Candidates are not
                  expected to provide a definition or directly apply.

           (iii) Define the term offshoring.                                                      [2 marks]

                  Offshoring is the relocation by a company of a business process from one
                  country to another – typically an operational process, such as manufacturing,
                  or supporting processes, such as accounting.

                  Candidates are not expected to word their definition exactly as above.


                  Award [1 mark] for a basic definition that conveys partial knowledge and
                  understanding.

                  Award [2 marks] for a full, clear definition that conveys knowledge and
                  understanding similar to the answer above.

                  N.B. do not credit candidates            that   give    the   definition   of
                  subcontracting/outsourcing only.

                  N.B. accept a reference to the possibility of outsourcing as well as
                  offshoring together for [1 mark].

(b)   The Boston Consulting Group analyst used the same technique as sales
      forecasting to predict changes in wages. Explain one advantage and one
      disadvantage of using this technique.                                  [6 marks]

      By using the same technique as the Boston Consulting Group analyst used —
      time-series analysis and moving averages for forecasting future wages.

      One possible advantage is that such a technique will enable the identification of a
      trend and will provide a basic and initial extrapolation / prediction / indication of
      future costs of production and hence provide a good basis for managers of these
      companies in terms of planning or budgeting.

      The forecasting is based on past-known data and hence provides the initial step for
      forecasting. Moreover, the forecast was done for a rather short period into the
      future (2015) (yearly) and hence a forecast for a short period is likely to be more
      accurate.

      However,
      The assumption of this technique is that what happened in the past is likely to
      continue. When identifying a trend it can be seen as unrealistic and possibly
      misleading. It is stated in the stimulus that wages of factory workers in China
      rose by 69% which is a considerably higher figure than the likely moving average
      and the forecasted figure based on moving averages.

       The forecasting might have also been made based on unreliable information and
      data, as the examples are given by government sources in these emerging
      economies.

      The unstable external environment with some examples in the stimulus may also
      considerably reduce the accuracy of the forecasting.

      Accept any other relevant advantage and disadvantage.


      Mark as 3 + 3.

      N.B. accept responses that generally refer to sales forecasting as a technique /
      planning tool rather than the specific technique of using time-series analysis and
      moving averages.

      Award [1 mark] for identifying an appropriate advantage / disadvantage, [1 mark]
      for an appropriate explanation and [1 mark] for a further development of this
      explanation with reference to any relevant decision maker, and/or to the issue of
      changes in the wages in China, and/or any other relevant application. Award a
      maximum of [3 marks].

      N.B. accept any relevant application from the stimulus – not necessarily just
      wages (especially for the disadvantages).

      Award up to a maximum of [2 marks] for each disadvantage or advantage if no
      relevant reference is made to the stimulus material.

(c)   Examine the possible impacts on China of the US multinational companies
      offshoring manufacturing to China.                                      [6 marks]

      Although the question may seem rather theoretical, it is expected that candidates
      make some reference to some specific effects of a manufacturing company.

      Some of the positive impacts may include the following:
       A manufacturing company big enough to locate around the world / possibly an
        MNC, is likely to provide a significant number of jobs / employment and
        possibly training in its plants. The quality of the labour force can increase.
       Local customers do not have to rely only on local providers. Hence more
        choice is provided for the citizens / better standards of living.
       Global competition in the Chinese market can lead to improvement in
        efficiency, quality and a reduction in price of these manufactured products.
        Transfer of technical knowledge/know-how can also be seen as a positive
        impact on economies like China.
       A manufacturing MNC is likely to source local raw material and local labour –
        more revenue in terms of expenditure and wages is injected into the economy.
        Wider economic benefits can be gained in countries like China (the multiplier
        effect).
       A manufacturing MNC is likely to provide further employment to some
        supporting industries such as distribution, packaging and other industries in the
        supply chain as stated in the stimulus.
       These manufacturing companies are likely to be profitable and are taxed by the
        host governments. Revenue is generated for host governments providing
        further positive consequences for the host economies.
       Accept any other relevant positive impact.

      However,
       Offshoring in emerging / developing economies like China, may destroy local
        competitors as they cannot compete in terms of size, resources, economies of
        scale / efficiency and so on.
       A well-established American MNC can actually monopolize a market rather
        than encourage healthy competition and choice.
       A manufacturing MNC is likely to deplete the national resources such as raw
        materials.
       A manufacturing MNC may ignore environmental and ethical concerns.
       A manufacturing MNC might also create an external diseconomy of scale – the
        location may become congested. It is possible that the wage increase in China
        is the result of high demand for labour.
       Due to some practices of transfer pricing and/or local government support, not
        much taxes on profit are paid to the host government.
       Accept any other relevant negative impact.

      Accept any other relevant examination.

      To achieve the top markband candidates must give a balanced analysis of two
      relevant positives and two relevant negatives of the impacts of manufacturing in
      the host country.

      Marks should be allocated according to the markbands on page 3.

(d)   Discuss the suggestion that US multinational companies are likely to increase
      the scale of manufacturing at home.                                           [9 marks]

      Some of the arguments for the above may include the following:

      The labour cost of offshoring is likely to increase even more as the countries
      become more developed. The cost advantage will be further eroded or disappear.
      If the main market is indeed the US, American MNCs/companies, they will
      benefit from being close to their customers and address their needs. Not only will
      the flexibility of the American MNCs/companies increase in terms of being more
      customers’ focus and responding to their customers’ needs quickly and more
      accurately, savings can be made on transportation of the goods back to their US
      customers.

      If the main suppliers are in the US, or relatively close by, the supply chain will be
      more reliable and efficient. It is stated in the stimulus that the cost of labour is
      increasingly less significant and other issues like the supply chain and other
      relevant external factors are becoming more significant for strategic decision
      making. It is stated that many American companies had issues with less than
      effective supply chains and with some significant threats in the external
      environment like oil prices, natural disasters and so on. If serving American
      customers is their focus and the stimulus indicates that for some it is, it is likely
      that many American companies will return to manufacture their products at home.

      The stimulus has provided evidence that some well-known manufacturing MNCs,
      have already made the decision to stay at home and invest in a manufacturing
      facility in the US.

      On a more theoretical note, being located in the US will reduce the possibility of
      cultural clashes and language barriers and also the possible loss of management
      control. Coordination and communication between the American head office and
      the other plants are likely to improve.

      Given the fact that some companies are returning and some made a decision not to
      leave the US the scale of manufacturing in the US will increase.

      Accept any other relevant argument for.

However,
The prediction of the growth in the wage rate may not be accurate especially
given the technique used.

Staying or returning home is more appropriate, as stated in the stimulus, for
MNCs that essentially serve the local market, however, many MNCs serve the
global market. Perhaps this argument can be judged as a significant one.

The fast growing demand in developing countries, may intensify the need to be
located close to the new / emerging markets. The labour cost is indeed not the
main issue, but being close to customers is a highly significant argument against
the notion of coming home. MNCs could be able to assess the customers’ needs
more closely and serve the market better. The number of American customers is
likely to be of less significance for these companies in the near future. The
current financial incentive given to the US MNCs is likely to stop as stated by Mr
Pisano. A lack of government support might hinder a future returning home and
may be a driving force for seeking cheaper locations with other advantages apart
from labour costs. MNCs may be given some financial incentive from emerging
economies. Transport costs may also be reduced.

The US may lack the infrastructure, or as stated in the stimulus, the supply chain
for other production apart from basic manufacturing.

One of the most significant argument against this notion is that the Boston
Consulting Group’s comments/predictions are most relevant to the manufacturing
industry and when the main market is the US / American customers.

As stated in the stimulus, in India, despite rising wages, its innovative software
development and call centre offshoring industries are likely to retain its cost
advantages because of increasing productivity – MNCs may be looking for
innovation and flexibility, not just cost savings. Moreover, despite a rising wage
rate, the workers abroad can still be more productive, hence overall cost of
production will fall due to efficiency and productivity.

Overall judgment/conclusion it appears that even the analyst (Mr Pisano) who
highlighted the new trend of staying, or returning to the US, is aware that the
examples are not sufficient to draw a full conclusion and that there might be other
more significant reasons why many MNCs especially the American ones will
continue to offshore, especially if their main competitors do and the new markets
are to be found in emerging economies. We are quite likely to see the movement
of many MNCs including American ones throughout the world as there will be
more emerging countries rather than China. For example, India where different
and more sophisticated skills are required.

N.B. it is not expected that the judgment is the same as the above. It is essential
however, that the candidate provides a substantiated judgment. Not just repetition
of previous arguments.

Accept any other relevant judgment/conclusions.

For one relevant issue that is one-sided, award up to [3 marks]. If the response is
a one-sided relevant approach with no discussion award a maximum of [4 marks].

For a fully balanced answer, candidates are expected to provide 2 + 2 arguments
for and against.

Award a maximum of [5 marks] if the answer is of a standard that shows balanced
analysis and understanding throughout the response with reference to the stimulus
material but there is no judgment/conclusion.

Candidates cannot reach the [5–7] markband if they give judgment/conclusions
that are not based on analysis/explanation already given in their answer.

Marks should be allocated according to the markbands on page 4.
