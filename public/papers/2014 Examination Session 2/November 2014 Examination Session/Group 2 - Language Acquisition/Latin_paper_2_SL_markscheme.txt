General notes:
 The following paragraphs are to be considered suggestions, rather than prescriptions, that is, all points
  made by candidates to be marked on their merits.
 Any attempt to answer should be acknowledged as such; that should be followed especially in
  translation, when some candidates depart from literal in favour of a more poetic rendition, faithful,
  of course, to the original idea.
 The second use of the same figure of speech to answer a style question should be penalized, by not
  being taken into account: for example, double mention of alliteration.
 When Latin quotations are required, award no mark if the candidate fails to provide them.

            motion of primordial elements (principiorum motibus); no single one can be cut out (nihil ut
            secernier unum possit); nor can its power become set off from the rest by any space (spatio

             (quod genus in quovis animantum viscere volgo est odor et quidam color et sapor) [1 mark];
             yet from all these, a single corporeal mass is formed (ex his omnibus est unum perfectum
             corporis augmen) [1 mark]; so heat, air, and hidden power of wind create in combination one
             nature (sic calor atque aër et venti caeca potestas mixta creant unam naturam et mobilis illa
             vis) [1 mark].

      (e)   Award [3 marks] for a correct answer, or for an answer with no more than one minor error
