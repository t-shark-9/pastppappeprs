28.   What statement about alpha particles, beta particles and gamma radiation is true?

      A.    Gamma radiation always travels faster than beta particles in a vacuum.

      B.    In air, beta particles produce more ions per unit length travelled than alpha particles.

      C.    Alpha particles are always emitted when beta particles are emitted.

      D.    Alpha particles are deflected in the same direction as beta particles in a magnetic field.
