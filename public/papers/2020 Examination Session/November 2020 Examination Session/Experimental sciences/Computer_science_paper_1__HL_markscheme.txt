Subject details:         Computer science HL paper 1 markscheme

Mark allocation

Section A: Candidates are required to answer all questions. Total 25 marks.
Section B: Candidates are required to answer all questions. Total 75 marks.
           Maximum total = 100 marks.

General

• A markscheme often has more specific points worthy of a mark than the total allows. This is
  intentional. Do not award more than the maximum marks allowed for that part of a question.

• When deciding upon alternative answers by candidates to those given in the markscheme, consider
  the following points:

• Each statement worth one point has a separate line and the end is signified by means of a
  semi-colon (;).

• An alternative answer or wording is indicated in the markscheme by a “/”; either wording can be
  accepted.

• Words in ( … ) in the markscheme are not necessary to gain the mark.

• If the candidate’s answer has the same meaning or can be clearly interpreted as being the same as
  that in the markscheme then award the mark.

• Mark positively. Give candidates credit for what they have achieved and for what they have got
  correct, rather than penalizing them for what they have not achieved or what they have got wrong.

• Remember that many candidates are writing in a second language; be forgiving of minor linguistic
  slips. In this subject effective communication is more important than grammatical accuracy.

• Occasionally, a part of a question may require a calculation whose answer is required for subsequent
  parts. If an error is made in the first part then it should be penalized. However, if the incorrect answer
  is used correctly in subsequent parts then follow through marks should be awarded. Indicate this
  with “FT”.


General guidance

  Issue            Guidance
  Answering        • In the case of an “identify” question, read all answers and mark positively up to the
  more than          maximum marks. Disregard incorrect answers.
  the quantity     • In the case of a “describe” question, which asks for a certain number of facts
  of                 eg “describe two kinds”, mark the first two correct answers. This could include two
  responses          descriptions, one description and one identification, or two identifications.
  prescribed       • In the case of an “explain” question, which asks for a specified number of
  in the             explanations eg “explain two reasons …”, mark the first two correct answers.
  questions          This could include two full explanations, one explanation, one partial
                     explanation etc.

            requires servicing, the computer switches to running the serving program;
            polling will waste processing time whilst the device is idle;

            whilst:
            interrupt requires the device to flag the computer;
            processor receives interruption signal and services the interrupt by calling the appropriate

            In a stack, the same end is used to insert and delete the elements;
            whilst two different ends are used in the queue to insert and delete the elements;

            end of the queue);

                    checks if the queue is empty or not;

            Award [1] for adding each element popped from the stack to the end of the queue;
            Award [1] for the correct use of stack and queue methods;

(e)   Award [2 max].
      More difficult/complicated to code;
      if the data structure being processed is not recursive;

      It is difficult to find bugs;
      particularly while using global variables;

      Can use more memory (than iterative solution) when executed;
      because every recursive call increases the call stack;

      Recursion to a deeper level will be difficult/impossible to implement;
      if the call stack space on the system is limited;

      Slower execution / using a recursive function takes more time to execute;
      as compared to its non- recursive/ iterative counterpart;

13.   (a)   Award [3 max].
            Award [1] for nested loops/loop through all array elements;
            Award [1] for checking the array element for the number of colour;
            Award [1] for updating correctly each of the array elements;

            Example 1:

            loop for I=0 to N-1
                loop for J=0 to N-1
                     if A[I][J]==1
                         then A[I][J]=0
                         else A[I][J]=1
                     end if
                end loop
            end loop

            Example 2:

            R=0
            C=0
            I=0
            loop while I< N*N
                if A[R][C]==0
                     then A[R][C]=1
                     else A[R][C]=0
                end if
                C=C+1
                if C>9 then
                     C=0
                     R=R+1
                end if
                I=I+1
            end loop

      (b)   (i)    Award [1 max].

                   270 (degrees);

            (ii)   Award [2 max].
                   A rotation by 360 degrees returns the image/matrix to its original value, so no action
                   need be taken. A rotation by 360+N degrees is equivalent to a rotation by N degrees
                   (this logic repeats, so for 90 degree rotations, there are only 3 transformations needed:
                   by 90, by 2*90 and by 3*90);
                   making more is unnecessary/inefficient;

                   Unnecessary calls to the method rotate() which would make the algorithm less
                   efficient are avoided;
                   for example, repeating 10 times and repeating 2 (=10 mod 4) times, both return the
                   array holding the image rotated by 180 degrees;

                   NOTE: Accept any appropriate example, with any value of K which is greater than or
                   equal to 4;

(c)   Award [3 max].
      Award [1] for completely correct nested loops;
      Award [1] for correctly determining row indexes (in both matrixes, A and B);
      Award [1] for correctly determining column indexes (in both matrixes, A and B);

      NOTE: The method heading and return statement may not appear in the answers.
      Only an algorithm for the method rotate() is requested.

      Example:

      rotate(N,A)
          // initialize two dimensional array B
          // for example, int[][] B = new int[N][N];

              loop for I = 0 to N-1
                    loop for J = 0 to N-1
                         B[I][J] = A[N-J–1][I]
                            // instead of these array subscripts
                            // the following can be written
                            // B[J][N-1-I] = A[I][J]
                    end loop
