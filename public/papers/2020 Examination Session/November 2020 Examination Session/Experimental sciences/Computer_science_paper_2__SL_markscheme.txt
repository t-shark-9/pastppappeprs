Subject details:         Computer science SL paper 2 markscheme

Mark allocation

Candidates are required to answer all questions for one of the four options. Total 45 marks.
Maximum total = 45 marks.

General

• A markscheme often has more specific points worthy of a mark than the total allows. This is
  intentional. Do not award more than the maximum marks allowed for that part of a question.

• When deciding upon alternative answers by candidates to those given in the markscheme, consider
  the following points:

• Each statement worth one point has a separate line and the end is signified by means of a
  semi-colon (;).

• An alternative answer or wording is indicated in the markscheme by a “/”; either wording can be
  accepted.

• Words in ( … ) in the markscheme are not necessary to gain the mark.

• If the candidate’s answer has the same meaning or can be clearly interpreted as being the same as
  that in the markscheme then award the mark.

• Mark positively. Give candidates credit for what they have achieved and for what they have got
  correct, rather than penalizing them for what they have not achieved or what they have got wrong.

• Remember that many candidates are writing in a second language; be forgiving of minor linguistic
  slips. In this subject effective communication is more important than grammatical accuracy.

• Occasionally, a part of a question may require a calculation whose answer is required for subsequent
  parts. If an error is made in the first part then it should be penalized. However, if the incorrect answer
  is used correctly in subsequent parts then follow through marks should be awarded. Indicate this
  with “FT”.


General guidance

  Issue            Guidance
  Answering        • In the case of an “identify” question, read all answers and mark positively up to the
  more than          maximum marks. Disregard incorrect answers.
  the quantity     • In the case of a “describe” question, which asks for a certain number of facts
  of                 eg “describe two kinds”, mark the first two correct answers. This could include two
  responses          descriptions, one description and one identification, or two identifications.
  prescribed       • In the case of an “explain” question, which asks for a specified number of
  in the             explanations eg “explain two reasons …”, mark the first two correct answers.
  questions          This could include two full explanations, one explanation, one partial
                     explanation etc.

Option A —Databases

1.   (a)    Award [2 max].

                          has a                              has
           License                      Individual                           Vehicle
                                                           owned




                                           Individual




            Accept either diagram. License, Individual, and Vehicle correctly positioned
            Award [1] for 1 to 1.
            Award [1] for 1 to m.

     (b)    Award [3 max].
            The order that a date is written varies by country, eg dd/mm/yyyy in UK, mm/dd/yyyy in US;
            Some dates, such as 01 June 2018 (01/06/2018) could be confused with 06 January 2018
            (06/01/2018);
            leading to the incorrect information being stored and consequent decisions, eg license
            expired at the wrong time due to incorrect age;

            The Date/String datatype will make analysing slower;
            integers can be analysed more quickly than Date/String datatypes;
            because functions will be used to split/extract the data;

            The Date datatype will make validating data more difficult.
            because it is easier to validate separate integer fields;
            rather than one entire data that will need to be split by functions;
                                              –5–                N20/4/COMSC/SP2/ENG/TZ0/XX/M


(c)   Award [6 max].

      Normalisation
      Medical information is only stored if the person has a medical condition / some people will
      have no medical information stored / some people may have more than one medical
      conditions;
      this requires an additional table / normalisation requires a separate table / one to many
      relationship;
      leaving in the person table will increase storage capacity / empty fields take up space;

      Privacy
      All employees will need access to the person table and that would include sensitive medical
      information;
      Protects people’s privacy / data needs to comply with the Data Protection Act / private
      medical data seen by non-authorised personnel may cause harm to the licence applicant /
      potentially result in legal action;
      having confidential data in a separate table allows that table to be only available to people
      with a certain permission level;

      Updates
      Person table is also likely to be less permanent and need updating more often;
      medical information rarely gets updated so is more permanent;
      the person table may be useful in other applications, as it offers a way of identifying
      citizens/the medical data is not likely to be used by other applications;

      Mark as [3] + [3]

(d)   Award [4 max].
      May lead to update/deletion anomalies;
      Address changes may result in duplicate addresses;
      so letters / fines may go to the wrong address;
      Storing data multiple times wastes storage space;
      and may slow down data retrieval / data entry;

(e)   Award [4 max].
      Accept any suitable example

      Police access
      It is a legal requirement for the VDLA to give access to the police;
      eg a speeding vehicle / an accident / linked to a police investigation;
      so the police will need to look up the details of the person that owns the car;
      facial scanning software may be cross-referenced with the car owner’s driving license photo;
      so that police have a way to check the identity of the person driving the car;

      Insurance company access
      A person taking out car insurance signs a consent form to give VDLA access to their records;
      this would allow the insurance company to build up a profile eg, check for driving offences,
      see how long that person had owned a car;
      thus, a quote could be created quickly / minimal effort;
      provides proof of driver eligibility (ie, not serving a driving ban);

      Medical access
      Doctors may require access to an accident victim’s records;
      To check blood type etc;

2.   (a)    Award [1 max].
            A logical unit of work that is executed in full or not at all;
            A transaction is a single logical operation that comprises of a sequence of database
            operations;
            A transation satisfies the ACID (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability) properties;

      (b)   Award [2 max].
            The database would store details of concerts, tickets sold, customers;
            An information system would access the database to present data it in a way that aids
            informs managers / aids decision making (eg charts of ticket sales);

            Accept any other reasonable example.

      (c)   Award [3 max].
            Durability ensures that transactions are saved permanently and do not accidentally
            disappear or get erased;
            Billetmania does not need to worry the transaction being lost even in the event of power loss,
            crashes, or errors;
            A seat in a theatre is guaranteed even if the database crashes;

      (d)   Award [4 max].
            Concurrency allows multiple users try to book tickets at the same time / complete a
            transaction at the same time;
            Concurrency prevents access by more than one user to the same row/record;
            Concurrency uses row locking;
            Select seats are locked for a short period of time to ensure that they aren’t double
            booked/overwritten;

      Cloud computing is based on sharing computing resources over the internet;
      Cloud computing can be offered as a service to individuals and companies (SaaS) which
      means they do not have to maintain the infrastructure;
      Cloud computing and applications are more scalable than client-server architectures;
      Client-server architecture does not need to be operating over the internet, but instead can be
      limited to a local network;
      Client-server architectures may require more maintenance of the infrastructure by the
      organization who are using it;
      cloud computing is typically more resilient than client server, because the services offered
      are more widely distributed, rather than being concentrated on one server or on a small
      number of alternative servers;

           Open standards provide a publicly available specification for a specified task;
           This is an agreed set of parameters that enable interoperability and/or compatibility to occur;

           Using Open standards means that you are not subject to a governing body with its own
           agenda/self-interest;
           Thus, you can be confident that you won’t be subject to fees/bias;

           Open standards promote interoperability;
           This enables the various devices to communicate with each other;

           Open standards advocates also argue that openness encourages better and more secure
           systems;
           this is because more people are able to analyse the standards and resulting software and
           no-one has a proprietary interest in suppressing knowledge of problems to keep sales up.

           World Wide Web has enabled citizens to communicate easily and for ‘ordinary’ citizens to
           express their opinions;
           Therefore, the ability to publish is not confined to certain ‘privileged’ groups such as
           broadcasters and journalists;
           The World Wide Web has to a large degree given access to common resources to all citizens
           globally who have access to the Internet;
           However, it can be argued that the evolution of the World Wide Web has led to a greater
           centralization of power, for example the digital oligarchs (Microsoft, Google, Amazon, Apple,
           Facebook);
           This centralization has led to a reduction in democracy as the digital oligarchs have an
           increasing stranglehold over the lives of their ‘digital subjects’ through the aggregation,
           analysis and monetarization of their data;
           There are still issues with a lack of digital democracy, for example, many citizens may not
           have access to the World Wide Web, either through income, geography or necessary skills;

      Inheritance is when the behaviour of a class is transferred to another class;
      whereas aggregation is when a class is contained inside another and used;

      Aggregation is useful for modelling a real life situation of containment aka. “has a” (eg
      contents of a box);
      whereas Inheritance is useful for modelling real life situation that one entity is a particular
      (more specific) type of another entity, aka. “is a”;

      While both can achieve the same result, Aggregation (composition) can lead to more robust
      and safer code;
      whereas inheritance is a more flexible solution but prone to errors due to the behaviour of
      subclasses being changed;

      Inheritance allows for code reuse / lowers maintenance cost;
      whereas aggregation does neither of the above;

      Can have more than 1 aggregation;
      but only 1 superclass (in Java);

      Inheritance allows for code reuse as in the creation of sub-classes;
      whereas with aggregation each class must be written out in full;

      and Motorbike have in common. Therefore they can be referenced as Vehicles and stored in
      an array of Vehicles, even though they are subclasses;

(c)   Award [6 max].
      Award [1] for correct loop;
      Award [1] for checking if not null;
      Award [1] for checking registration using the getRegistration().equals() method;
      Award [1] for setting vehicles[i] to null;
      Award [1] for returning the reference (not the null element of the array), by making another
      variable;
      Award [1] for returning null if it is not found;

      Example 1:

      public Vehicle removeVehicle(String registration) {
      for (int i = 0; i < vehicles.length; i++) {
           if (vehicles[i] != null &&
      vehicles[i].getRegistration().equals(registration)) { //question - why
      do it in this order?
               Vehicle leaving = vehicles[i];
               vehicles[i] = null;
               return leaving;
           }
      }
      return null;
      }

      Example 2:

      public Vehicle removeVehicle(String registration)
        { Vehicle v = null;
          boolean found = false;
          int i = 0;
          while (!found && i < Vehicles.length)
          { found = Vehicles[i] != null &&
                     registration.equals(Vehicles[i].getRegistration());
            if (found)
            { v = Vehicles[i];
              Vehicles[i] = null;
            }
            else i = i + 1;
          }
          return v;
