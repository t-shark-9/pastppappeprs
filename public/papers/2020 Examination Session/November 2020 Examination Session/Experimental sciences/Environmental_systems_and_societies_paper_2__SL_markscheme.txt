Subject details: Environmental systems and societies SLP2
Markscheme
Mark allocation

Candidates are required to answer:
• ALL questions in Section A [25] and TWO questions in Section B [40].
• The maximum total = [65].


1.   Environmental systems and societies uses marking points and markbands to determine the
     achievement of candidates

     When using marking points (All of this paper except Section B, part (c) questions):
       i.    A markscheme often has more marking points than the total allows. This is intentional
      ii.    Each marking point has a separate line and the end is shown by means of a semi-colon (;)
      iii.   Where a mark is awarded, a tick/check () must be placed in the text at the precise point
             where it becomes clear that the candidate deserves the mark. One tick to be shown for each
             mark awarded
     iv.     The order of marking points does not have to be as in the markscheme, unless stated
             otherwise.

     When using markbands (Only for Section B, part (c) questions):
       i.    Read the response and determine which band the response fits into
      ii.    Then re-read the response to determine where the response fits within the band
      iii.   Annotate the response to indicate your reasoning behind the awarding of the mark
             Do not use ticks at this point
     iv.     Decide on a mark for the response
      v.     At the end of the response place the required number of ticks to enable RM Assessor to
             input the correct number of marks for the response.


2.   An alternative answer or wording is indicated in the markscheme by a slash (/). Either wording can
     be accepted.

3.   Words in brackets ( ) in the markscheme are not necessary to gain the mark.

4.   Words that are underlined are essential for the mark.

5.   If the candidate’s answer has the same “meaning” or can be clearly interpreted as being of
     equivalent significance, detail and validity as that in the markscheme then award the mark.
     Where this point is considered to be particularly relevant in a question it is emphasized by
     OWTTE (or words to that effect).
                                                   –4–                  N20/4/ENVSO/SP2/ENG/TZ0/XX/M


6.   Remember that many candidates are writing in a second language. Effective communication is
     more important than grammatical accuracy.

7.   Occasionally, a part of a question may require an answer that is required for subsequent
     marking points. If an error is made in the first marking point then it should be penalized. However, if
     the incorrect answer is used correctly in subsequent marking points then follow through marks
     should be awarded. When marking, indicate this by adding ECF (error carried forward) on the
     script.

8.   Do not penalize candidates for errors in units or significant figures, unless it is specifically referred
     to in the markscheme.

                                                Section A
1.   (a)   Costa Rica has a crude birth rate (CBR) of 15.3 and a crude death rate (CDR) of 4.8.

           (i)     Identify the stage in which Costa Rica would be placed on the demographic
                   transition model shown in Figure 1.                                            [1]

                   stage 3;

           (ii)    Calculate the natural increase rate (NIR) for Costa Rica.                      [1]

                   NIR = 1.05;

     Note: As there is some disagreement in the literature, accept 10.5 (per thousand)

           (iii)   Calculate the doubling time for Costa Rica.                                    [1]

                                          70
                   doubling time (DT) =
                                          NIR
                   DT = 66.67 years;

     Note: Accept 67 years, but do not credit unless units are given.

     (b)   Outline one strength and one limitation of the demographic transition model.           [2]

           Strength [1 max]
           provides a theoretical basis for comparing other societies;
           can be applied to a wide range of societies;
           allows predictions to be made regarding transitions / population growth;
           it is based on historical data;
           indicates relationship between multiple factors;

           Weakness [1 max]:
           many assumptions are made to make the model / relationships are quite
           simplistic;
           Eurocentric model might not apply to all countries;
           does not take into account events such as migration/war/rapid spread of disease
           that may have limited impact on populations;

     (c)   Outline the socioeconomic factors that may cause a society to move from
           Stage 2 to Stage 3 on the demographic transition model.                                [3]

           decreasing birth rate/ fertility/growth / smaller families due to:
           • increased access to contraception/family planning/sex education;
           • improved (access to) healthcare / reduced child mortality;
           • improved education/emancipation of women;
           • shift from agricultural society / less dependence on child labour

           continued decreasing death rate due to:
           • improved sanitation;
           • improved (access to) healthcare/food provision;

     Note: Must link answer to decreasing birth rate and/or decreasing death rate to earn
     mark.
     Award [2] max if candidate addresses only birth rate or only death rate.

2.   (a)   (i)    Identify one transfer and one transformation process shown in Figure 2.              [2]

                  transfer:
                  advection/precipitation/snowmelt runoff/surface run
                  off/infiltration/percolation/groundwater flow/plant uptake;

                  transformation:
                  evaporation/condensation/sublimation/snowmelt/transpiration;

     Note: Only credit those flows identified in diagram

           (ii)   Outline how urbanization might impact two of the storages in Figure 2.         [2 max]

                  reduction in biomass storage due to deforestation;
                  reduction of groundwater storage due to impermeable surfaces/urban
                  withdrawal;
                  increase in lake/river/ocean storage due to deforestation/increase of
                  impermeable surfaces;
                  less snow due to urban heat island effects;
                  increased sediment/pollution in lakes/rivers/oceans/groundwater due to
                  construction/industrialized activities;

     Note: Credit can be given for any aspect of urbanisation (deforestation/heat island/impermeable
     surface etc) with a relevant impact on a named storage that is depicted in given diagram. Only
     credit impacts on storages not on flows.

     (b)   Runoff from agricultural land can result in excess nutrients entering water bodies.

           (i)    Outline one indirect measure of organic pollution.                                   [3]

                  Alternative 1:
                        Named measure [1 max]:
                        biochemical oxygen demand;

                        Methodology [2 max]:
                        measure the initial dissolved oxygen;
                        keep a sample in the dark for five days and measure DO again;
                        take the difference of the two measurements;

                  Alternative 2:
                        Named measure [1 max]:
                        biotic index/indicator species;

                        Methodology [2 max]:
                        sample the macroinvertebrates in the stream/lake;
                        through kick sampling/dragging feet along bottom;
                        identify species present;
                        identify indicator species/tolerance levels;

     Note: Do not credit any direct measure of pollutant like total suspended matter/
     turbidity etc
                                                   –7–                  N20/4/ENVSO/SP2/ENG/TZ0/XX/M


           (ii)   State one management strategy that could control the release of
                  agricultural runoff.                                                           [1 max]

                  plant a buffer zone;
                  reduce the use of inorganic fertilizers / replace their use with organic
                  fertilisers;
                  do not apply fertilizers in the rainy season;
                  keep animals away from waterways;
                  treat livestock wastewater (to reduce phosphates and nitrates);
                  contour ploughing/terracing/agroforestry/drip irrigation (to avoid run off);

3.   (a)   Calculate the percentage of sea turtle species from Figure 4 that are critically
           endangered.                                                                               [1]

           2
             = 28.6% ;
           7

     Note: Accept 28.57 / 28.6 / 29.

     (b)   State two factors that are used to determine the conservation status of a species.    [2 max]

Note: Award [1] for any of following arguments or counterarguments (…)

      Recycling can reduce plastics entering waterways;
      ...but is costly/depends on changing lifestyles;
      Landfill can reduce wastes entering waterways;
      ...but can still lead to leaching of toxins into aquatic environments;
      Incineration can reduce wastes entering aquatic environments;
      ...but may cause air pollution and deposition/acidification of marine environments;
      Composting can reduce organic waste polluting waterways;
      ...but is only suitable for biodegradable waste;
      Littering laws can reduce waste entering marine systems
      …but need appropriate penalties/monitoring etc;

      Conclusion
      e.g. recycling is probably the most reliable protection of marine organisms
      against plastic waste;

Note: Award [3] max if neither counterarguments nor conclusion are presented I.e.
response must include at least one or the other to fulfil the ‘Discuss’ command term.

                                                  Section B

Part (c) questions in Section B are all to be assessed using the markbands on page 22
with the guidance given below for each question.

4.    (a)   Distinguish between two named biomes and the factors that cause their
            distribution.                                                                        [4 max]

            e.g. tundra vs tropical rainforest:

            Distinguishing features [3 max]:
            tundra has lower insolation / TRF has the highest insolation of all biomes;
            TRF has constant insolation throughout the year / tundra has long, dark winters;
            tundra has lower mean annual temperature / TRF has warmer temperatures;
            tundra has 6–10 months of freezing temperatures / TRF has constant warm
            temperatures;
            TRF has the largest annual precipitation compared to any biome / tundra
            precipitation is as low as in deserts;
            TRF has almost constant precipitation throughout the year;
            tundra precipitation mostly in form of snow / tundra has a characteristic layer of
            frozen ground below the surface/permafrost;
            TRFs have the highest biodiversity of all biomes;

            Explanation of distribution: [2 max]
            tundra found at the poles, while TRFs at the tropics (above and below the
            equator);
            Hadley cell rises at the Equator causing huge precipitation (low pressure zone) / as
            warm air cools and its moisture condenses;
            tundra is found in the low pressure area of polar cell / at a region where there is
            net loss of solar energy (causing freezing temperatures) / alpine tundra found on
            mountaintops, where temperatures are below 0 most time of the year due to high
            altitude;

Notes: Award [3] max for correctly indentified distinguishing features i.e. insolation / temperature /
precipitation / permafrost / high biodiversity etc.
Award [2] max for explanation of distribution.
Award [2] max overall if no biomes are named.

(b)   Evaluate one method for measuring primary productivity in a named ecosystem.           [7 max]

      Alternative 1:
            Method:
            light and dark bottle for an aquatic ecosystem;
            measure dissolved oxygen at start and end of experiment;
            compare measurements in a transparent (with light) and opaque (without
            light) bottle containing sample of water from ecosystem;
            net productivity is equivalent to change in dissolved oxygen in light bottle;
            gross productivity is equivalent to change in dissolved oxygen in light bottle
            plus the loss of dissolved oxygen in the dark bottle (due to respiration);
            measurements taken for a set period of time, eg one week;

            Evaluation:
            simple, easy to conduct method;
            ethical method – samples can be returned to ecosystem;
            difficult to isolate primary producers from consumers in ecosystem sample;
            only collecting productivity for submerged subset of ecosystem;
            measurements dependent upon temperature;
            quality of measurements depends on precision of instruments;

      Alternative 2:
            Method:
            three comparison plots, one covered in opaque plastic for terrestrial ecosystem;
            measure dry biomass at start and end of experiment;
            compare measurements from an open (with light) and covered (without
            light) plot in ecosystem;
            net productivity is equivalent to change in biomass in open plot;
            gross productivity is equivalent to change in biomass plus the loss of
            biomass in the covered plot (due to respiration);
            measurements taken for a set period of time, eg one week;

            Evaluation:
            easy to isolate primary producers in ecosystem sample;
            difficult to collect all biomass;
            ethical problems as samples need to be killed to measure dry biomass;
            measurements dependent upon temperature;
            productivity easier to measure in simpler systems;
            difficult to measure with larger producers/trees;

      Notes: Award [3] max for description of method. Evaluation should address
      inherent strengths and weaknesses of method. Do not credit examples of poor
      execution eg inaccurate measurement/samples too small etc.
      Award [6] max if ecosystem is not named.
      No credit can be given to responses that mistakenly address eg biodiversity
      rather than productivity.

(c)   Discuss how human activities impact the flows and stores in the nitrogen cycle.       [9 max]

      The following guide for using the markbands suggests certain features that may
      be offered in responses. The five headings coincide with the criteria given in each
      of the markbands (although “ESS terminology” has been conflated with
      “Understanding concepts”). This guide simply provides some possible inclusions
      and should not be seen as requisite or comprehensive. It outlines the kind of
      elements to look for when deciding on the appropriate markband and the specific
      mark within that band.

      Answers may include:
      • understanding concepts and terminology of systems approach; flows and
         (biotic and/or abiotic) stores in nitrogen cycle; atmospheric content; farming
         practices (aquatic and terrestrial); soil; eutrophication; urbanization,
         deforestation; transportation; forest fires; use of fossil fuels;
      • breadth in addressing and linking climate change; photochemical smog;
         secondary pollutant; acid deposition; scrubbers/catalytic converters;
         renewable vs. non-renewable energy sources; population growth; EVSs;
         sustainable development;
      • examples of farming practices (aquatic and terrestrial) which affect nitrogen
         flows; eutrophication/pollution management strategies; specific human

         stores, as well as decreasing or managing these flows and stores;
      • a conclusion that is consistent with, and supported by, analysis and
         examples given eg probably the greatest human disturbance to steady state

5.   (a)   Outline how a positive feedback loop can impact an ecosystem.                            [4 max]

           positive feedback loops (destabilizing) amplify changes in an ecosystem;
           feedback refers to the return of part of the output from a system as input so as to
           affect succeeding outputs;
           this drives the system towards a tipping point where a new equilibrium is
           adopted;
           this new equilibrium may be an alternative stable state / involve collapse of
           original system;
           eg increased global temperatures are melting permafrost, leading to the release
           of methane;
           ...which is a greenhouse gas and leads to further increases in global
           temperatures;

     Note: Candidates may gain full credit by illustrating the principles of positive feedback
     by means of a diagram or well-developed example. Credit should be allowed for this.

     (b)   Compare and contrast the impact of two named food production systems on
           climate change.                                                                          [7 max]

           named food production system with description; (eg Iowa corn production in mid-
           west USA is highly intensive, relying upon large machinery and inorganic nitrogen
           fertilizers)
           named food production system with description; (eg rice-fish farming in China is a
           low-intensity system managed by human labour, with few chemical inputs)

           use of machinery vs human labour, dependency on fossil fuels;
           use of organic vs inorganic fertilizers, intensive energy needs of production of
           inorganic fertilizers/NOx released from use of inorganic fertilizers;
           animal vs plant production, animals require more land use due to position in food
           chain;
           types of greenhouse gases produced, eg both rice and animal production
           produce methane;

           eg case study: Rice-fish farming in Thailand [1] v cattle farming in US [1]. Both rice
           and cattle produce methane, a greenhouse gas [1]. Inorganic fertilisers used in
           cattle farming releasing nitrogen oxides into atmosphere [1]. Rice is fertilised
           naturally from fish faeces so has no direct impact on climate change [1]. Cattle
           farming involves use of heavy machinery / fossil fuels not used in rice fish farming
           [1]. Rice farming produces food at lower trophic level so absorbs carbon dioxide [1].

     Notes: Award [2] max for description of food production systems.
     Other points of comparison or contrast may be acceptable but must be explicitly linked
     to climate change in order to gain credit.
     Award [4] max if only points of comparison or only points of contrast are addressed
     Credit can be given for any points of comparison or contrast with regard to impact on
     climate change/release of greenhouse gases.

(c)   To what extent does the development of different societies impact their choice of
      mitigation and adaptation strategies for climate change?                              [9 max]

      The following guide for using the markbands suggests certain features that may
      be offered in responses. The five headings coincide with the criteria given in each
      of the markbands (although “ESS terminology” has been conflated with
      “Understanding concepts”). This guide simply provides some possible inclusions
      and should not be seen as requisite or comprehensive. It outlines the kind of
      elements to look for when deciding on the appropriate markband and the specific
      mark within that band.

      Answers may include:
      • understanding concepts and terminology of development (may not just
         be economic); mitigation and adaptation strategies; climate change; NAPA,
         UNFCCC and IPCC; EIAs
      • breadth in addressing and linking climate change; demographic transition
         model; geographical factors such as location/biome; socio-economic and
         political factors may be related to EVS;
      • examples of mitigation and adaptation strategies in at least two contrasting
         countries;
      • balanced analysis discussing range of factors influencing a society’s
         choices;
      • a conclusion that is consistent with, and supported by, analysis and
         examples given eg the combination of political system and economic
         development will be the primary determinant of the choice of mitigation and
         adaptation strategies, with countries such as USA preferring to invest in
         adaptation strategies involving hard infrastructure while less economically
         developed countries will heavily support the implementation of IPCC climate
         goals (mitigation) and education of the population to mitigate problems;

6.   (a)   Outline two factors that enable a human population to increase its local carrying
           capacity.                                                                             [4 max]

           range of resources used;
           …means that a local human population can consume/exploit more resources
           available locally than any other species;
           human ingenuity/substitution;
           …means that humans are capable to find alternative resources when one is near
           depletion;
           variations in lifestyle;
           …means that people can be flexible in their mode of consumption of
           limited/dwindling resources;
           importation of resources;
           …means that a wealthy population can grow beyond the boundaries set by their
           local resources;
           technological developments; (can be linked to all previous factors)
           …allows humans to use available resources more efficiently / discover new
           resources / import resources from far away;

     Note: Award [1] for identifying each factor and [1] for outlining how it enables
     increase in carrying capacity.


     (b)   Explain how the growth in human population can affect local and regional water
           resources.                                                                            [7 max]

           growing human populations result in increased need for water for
           domestic/drinking/cooking use;
           Commercial development/industrialisation/factories increase water demand;
           increasing food demand entails increased irrigation/water for crops/agriculture;
           increasing populations may increase poverty and thus economic water scarcity;
           areas/locations/countries that have physical water scarcity would be mostly
           affected;
           …causing freshwater land resources (lakes, rivers) to dwindle / risking
           sustainability of freshwater- resources / depletion of aquifers;
           …often resulting in conflict over access to water;
           increased groundwater abstraction may lead to intrusion from salt water;
           (increased) industrial effluents can cause water (toxic) pollution;
           dam construction to meet higher demands of growing population can affect
           sustainability of that water source;
           increasing populations can stimulate technological innovation and greater
           efficiency of water use / management;

           The points above may be credited through a case-study eg

           case study: Egypt’s population is growing fast, thus increasing demand for drinking
           water [1]. Need for more food in a country would increase need for irrigation [1]
           which would cause cause reduction in groundwater [1] in a country with scarce
           water resources (most water comes from the Nile river) [1]. Government has
           constructed dams in the Nile basin, which are threatening conflict between Egypt
           and its neighbouring countries [1] decreasing the amount of water downstream
           (due to evaporation) [1: different enough from groundwater/aquifer depletion] and
           decreasing silt which used to fertilize plains [1: an impact on water quality].
           However more electricity is produced [no mark as IRRL] and provision of irrigation
           water is more stable/controlled (not dependent to seasonal floods) [1 for positive
           impact on water resources];

(c)   To what extent would different environmental value systems be successful in
      reducing a society’s ecological footprint?                                            [9 max]

      The following guide for using the markbands suggests certain features that may
      be offered in responses. The five headings coincide with the criteria given in each
      of the markbands (although “ESS terminology” has been conflated with

      and should not be seen as requisite or comprehensive. It outlines the kind of
      elements to look for when deciding on the appropriate markband and the specific
      mark within that band.

      Answers may include:
      • understanding concepts and terminology of ecological footprint; EVS;
         carrying capacity; sustainability; population growth;
      • breadth in addressing and linking climate change; population growth;
         sustainability; food production methods; water resource management; SDW
         management; resource management; consumption rates; living standards;
         land use; environmental degradation;
      • examples of different strategies/perspectives to reduce the EF of a society;
      • balanced analysis discussing how the eco-, anthro-, and techno- centric
         EVSs would approach the reduction of a society’s EF using a range of
         resource use and management and addressing a range of factors/variables
         influencing EF;
      • a conclusion that is consistent with, and supported by, analysis and
         examples given eg ideologically, an ecocentric value system may be most
         successful in reducing ecological footprints but in practice there needs to be
         the legislative aspect of anthropocentrism and the technological innovation of
         technocentrism to be really effective;

7.   (a)   Outline two factors that affect the frequency and severity of photochemical smog
           in an area.                                                                              [4 max]

           societies with intensive fossil fuel use/industrialization;
           ...produce more of the primary pollutants;

           high population density is characterized by car traffic/more dense use of heating;
           ...which increases the concentration of the primary pollutant;

           local climate can have thermal inversions/lack of wind;
           ...that traps the smog/decreases its dispersion;

           local climate with intense sunlight;
           ...increases photochemical reactions/increases rate of production of secondary
             pollutant;

           topographic factors such as hills and mountains;
           ...can result in trapping the pollutants/reducing wind dispersion;

Notes: Award [1] max for clearly identifying each factor, and [1] max for outlining its effect on
severity/ of smog:
Award [1] max if factors are simply identified by their title with no explanation eg “population
density” and “topography”
Any of the points above can be equally credited if presented in the form of a case study eg Los
Angeles / Mexico City, etc)

     (b)   Evaluate strategies to manage regional acid deposition using the pollution
           management model.                                                                        [7 max]

           Altering human activity:
           changing transportation use to reduce private transportation / increase public
           transportation / walking/biking;
                  this can be expensive due to infrastructure improvements required;
                  requires public buy-in / change in behaviour;
                  successful if a reduction in use of fossil fuels for transportation needs;
                  successful if good network of charging stations / footpaths/bike lanes to
                  encourage change;
                  addresses root cause of pollution/prevents any damage in first place;

           education of public regarding value of renewable energies/impacts of pollution;
                this can influence more environmentally friendly choices;
                influences attitudes/values in future generations;
                but maybe the local governments/authorities that need influencing more
                than general public;

           Controlling release of pollutant:
           reduce sulphur content of fossil fuels using trading system or pollution budgets;
                has proved very successful in USA where government put legislation in
                place to support this;
                increases costs as low sulphur fuels are more expensive / requires
                technological investment;

           use catalytic converters on car exhausts/scrubbers/CATS;
                very effective at reducing nitrous oxides;
                ...but expensive;
                use heavy metals which need to be mined;

           catalysts need replacing frequently;
           effective but requires investment in the technology and expensive;

     switch to renewable energy sources/nuclear;
           very effective as no direct emissions of NOx or SOx;
           requires diversification of energy supply, which requires political will;
           requires investment to support the change in energy policy;
           successful when implemented with supportive legislation;

     increase efficiency of power production and demand;
           advantage that it reduces all pollutants associated with power production;

     taxation systems and trading mechanisms;
           very effective when implemented with political support;
           requires improvement in public transportation infrastructure;
           could be argued that not ethical as encourages trading of pollutants;

     international legislation to control emissions (eg Sulphur Emissions Reduction
           Protocol and the Convention on Long Range Transboundary Air Pollution);
           have been successful in reducing sulphur dioxide emissions;
           ...but led to increase in nitrous oxide production;
           can be difficult to implement and monitor;

     Clean-up and restoration of damaged systems:
     adding limestone powder to acidified lakes;
          effective and cheap solution;
          but does not remove the cause of the problem;
          environmental impact of mining the limestone;

     restocking lakes after remediation;
           needs careful management and unlikely to return the lake to the prior system;

     reafforestation/replanting of damaged forests;
           expensive;
           takes long time for restoration;
           new growth acts as effect carbon sink;

Note: Award [5] max if only one or two out of three levels of the pollution management
model addressed.
Award [3] max if no evaluation points given.

      Answers may include:
      • understanding concepts and terminology of international agreements

      • a conclusion that is consistent with, and supported by, analysis and
         examples given eg currently the Montreal Protocol is thought to be the most
         successful international piece of legislation tackling an environmental
         problem. The problem of ozone depletion was not challenged in the political
         sphere and there were solutions that industry could implement. It did not
         require any change to the way that people lived their lives. Climate change
         legislation, on the other hand has been politically controversial and despite
         all countries initially signing up to the Paris Accord in 2015, it is still struggling
         to be implemented as it requires system-wide changes to the way countries
         organise themselves;
