Mark Allocation

Candidates are required to answer ALL questions in Section A [30 marks] and ONE question in Section B [20 marks].
Maximum total = [50 marks].

Markscheme format example:

                  OR
                  the extent to which the performer has control over the timing of the
                  movement ;                                                                                                            2 max

                  external paced skills are sailing/windsurfing/receiving a serve ;
                  internal paced skills are javelin throw/gymnastics routine ;


1.    Each row in the “Question” column relates to the smallest subpart of the question.

2.    The maximum mark for each question subpart is indicated in the “Total” column.

3.    Each marking point in the “Answers” column is shown by means of a semi colon (;) at the end of the marking point.

4.    A question subpart may have more marking points than the total allows. This will be indicated by “max” written after the mark in the “Total” column.
      The related rubric, if necessary, will be outlined in the “Notes” column.

5.    An alternative word is indicated in the “Answers” column by a slash (/). Either word can be accepted.

6.    An alternative answer is indicated in the “Answers” column by “OR”. Either answer can be accepted.

7.    An alternative markscheme is indicated in the “Answers” column under heading ALTERNATIVE 1 etc. Either alternative can be accepted.

8.    Words inside chevrons « » in the “Answers” column are not necessary to gain the mark.

9.    Words that are underlined are essential for the mark.

10.   The order of marking points does not have to be as in the “Answers” column, unless stated otherwise in the “Notes” column.

11.   If the candidate’s answer has the same “meaning” or can be clearly interpreted as being of equivalent significance, detail and validity as
      that in the “Answers” column then award the mark. Where this point is considered to be particularly relevant in a question it is emphasized
      by OWTTE (or words to that effect) in the “Notes” column.

12.   Remember that many candidates are writing in a second language. Effective communication is more important than grammatical accuracy.

13.   Occasionally, a part of a question may require an answer that is required for subsequent marking points. If an error is made in the first marking point
      then it should be penalized. However, if the incorrect answer is used correctly in subsequent marking points then follow through marks should be
      awarded. When marking, indicate this by adding ECF (error carried forward) on the script. “ECF acceptable” will be displayed in the “Notes” column.

14.   Do not penalize candidates for errors in units or significant figures, unless it is specifically referred to in the “Notes” column.

               Strengths:
               can be used to help a performer have greater chances of success eg pretending
               to pass / run one direction then quickly changing to pass / run the other way;

               options;

               Limitations:
               if a performer uses it too often, they will become predictable and this limits
               success eg dummying once to the left before leading to the right;

               PRP may be reduced by anticipation/early cue detection/effective coach analysis/
               practising «open» skills eg a football player would be able to detect cues earlier
               than a swimmer;

               anxiety might make the performer get the timing wrong and thus the PRP is not
               effective;

               synovial membrane:
               location just inside the articular capsule;
               secretes synovial fluid into the joint;

               synovial fluid:
               lubricating liquid with the joint capsule;
               reduces friction and nourishes the articular cartilage;

               bursae:
               fluid filled sacs located where a tendon moves over a bone;
               reduces the friction between tendons and bones;

               meniscus:
               fibro-cartilage located at the knee joint;
               shock absorption <and load bearing> at the knee;

               ligaments:
               tough bands of fibrous <slightly elastic> connective tissue;
               connects bone to bone <stabilizing the joint during movement>;

               articular capsule:
               a fibrous sac that surrounds/encloses the joint;
               provides strength to the joint;

8     e        the greater the intensity of the exercise, the greater the EPOC;                                      5 max

               initial stages of exercise, oxygen demand cannot be met by the aerobic system
               <oxygen deficit>
               OR
               initial stages are met by anaerobic processes;

               oxygen deficit is paid back after exercise/oxygen debt;

               alactacid/fast component is replenished with the first few minutes
               OR
               alactacid/fast component requires relatively less oxygen compared to the
               lactacid/slow component;

               ATP and CP/PC stores are replenished;

               myoglobin oxygen levels are replenished;

               aerobically metabolize lactic acid;

               resynthesize lactate to glycogen;

               replacement of muscle / liver glycogen stores;
