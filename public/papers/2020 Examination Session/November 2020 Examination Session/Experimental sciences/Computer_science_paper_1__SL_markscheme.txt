Subject details:        Computer science SL paper 1 markscheme

Mark allocation

Section A: Candidates are required to answer all questions. Total 25 marks.
Section B: Candidates are required to answer all questions. Total 45 marks.
           Maximum total = 70 marks.

General

A markscheme often has more specific points worthy of a mark than the total allows. This is intentional.
Do not award more than the maximum marks allowed for that part of a question.

When deciding upon alternative answers by candidates to those given in the markscheme, consider the
following points:

• Each statement worth one point has a separate line and the end is signified by means of a
   semi-colon (;).

• An alternative answer or wording is indicated in the markscheme by a “/”; either wording can be
   accepted.

• Words in ( … ) in the markscheme are not necessary to gain the mark.

• If the candidate’s answer has the same meaning or can be clearly interpreted as being the same as
   that in the markscheme then award the mark.

• Mark positively. Give candidates credit for what they have achieved and for what they have got
   correct, rather than penalizing them for what they have not achieved or what they have got wrong.

• Remember that many candidates are writing in a second language; be forgiving of minor linguistic
   slips. In this subject effective communication is more important than grammatical accuracy.

• Occasionally, a part of a question may require a calculation whose answer is required for subsequent
   parts. If an error is made in the first part then it should be penalized. However, if the incorrect answer
   is used correctly in subsequent parts then follow through marks should be awarded. Indicate this
   with “FT”.


General guidance

 Issue            Guidance
 Answering        • In the case of an “identify” question, read all answers and mark positively up to the
 more than           maximum marks. Disregard incorrect answers.
 the quantity     • In the case of a “describe” question, which asks for a certain number of facts
 of                 eg “describe two kinds”, mark the first two correct answers. This could include two
 responses          descriptions, one description and one identification, or two identifications.
 prescribed       • In the case of an “explain” question, which asks for a specified number of
 in the             explanations eg “explain two reasons …”, mark the first two correct answers.
 questions          This could include two full explanations, one explanation, one partial
                    explanation etc.
