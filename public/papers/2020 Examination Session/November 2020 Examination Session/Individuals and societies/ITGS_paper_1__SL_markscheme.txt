Critical Thinking – explanation, analysis and evaluation

These trigger words often signal critical thinking. The bold words are the key terms in the various
criteria.
Explanation – Because, as a result of, due to, therefore, consequently, for example
Analysis – Furthermore, additionally, however, but, conversely, likewise, in addition, on the other hand,
whereas
Evaluation ‫ –ؘ‬My opinion, overall, although, despite, on balance, weighing up

Examiners should be aware that in some cases, candidates may take a different approach, which if
appropriate should be rewarded. If in doubt, check with your team leader.

In the case of an “identify” question read all answers and mark positively up to the maximum marks.
Disregard incorrect answers. In all other cases where a question asks for a certain number of facts
eg “describe two kinds”, mark the first two correct answers. This could include two descriptions,
one description and one identification, or two identifications.

It should be recognized that, given time constraints, answers for part (c) questions are likely to include a
much narrower range of issues and concepts than identified in the markband. There is no “correct”
answer. Examiners must be prepared to award full marks to answers which synthesize and evaluate
even if they do not examine all the stimulus material.

     Note to examiners:
     •     All part (a) questions are marked using ticks and annotations where appropriate.
     •     Part (b) and part (c) are marked using markbands. Use annotations and text
     comments to provide a rationale behind the marks you awarded. Do not use ticks.

     (a)   (i)     State the primary key in the Voter table in Figure 2.                            [1]

                   VoterID

                   Award [1] for stating VoterID.

           (ii)    Identify one foreign key in the Votes table in Figure 2.                         [1]

                   Answers may include:
                   • VoterID
                   • CandidateID

                   Award [1] for identifying the foreign key up to a maximum of [1].

           (iii)   Identify the data type that would be used in the Gender field in Figure 2.       [1]

                   Answers may include:
                   • Text
                   • String

           (iv)    State the relationship between the Candidate table and the Votes table.          [1]

                   One – Many

           (v)     Outline why a drop-down list would be used for the Party field in the
                   Candidate table.                                                                 [2]

                   Answers may include:
                   • Provides a set number of possible options.
                   • To remove the likelihood of data input errors.
                   • They conserve screen space, other alternatives such as radio button or
                      checkbox may require all possible options to be displayed taking more
                      screen space.
                   • Faster data entry.

                   Award [1] for identifying why a drop-down list would be used for the Party
                   field and [1] for a development of that point up to a maximum of [2].

       (b)   A number of individuals and groups were consulted during the design of the e-
             voting system to enable designers to create an intuitive interface for it.

             Analyse questionnaires and interviews as methods of data collection to gather
             this information from these individuals and groups.                                         [6]

             Answers may include:

             Questionnaires:
                • Provide a mechanism to get responses from a large number of people.
                • Provide a mechanism to obtain quantitative answers. These answers
                    are relatively easy/quick to analyse.
                • Less labour intensive than using interviews.
                • Poorly designed questions, for example the overuse or lack of closed
                    questions, can yield almost meaningless information.
                • Respondents may sometimes misunderstand or misinterpret
                    questions; it will be very hard to correct these mistakes and collect
                    missing data in a second round.
                • Questionnaires do not have time constraints; respondents can take
                    their time to complete the questionnaire in their own time.
                • Questionnaires safeguard respondents’ anonymity, which allows for
                    complete invisibility, maximizing comfort for those answering.

             Interviews:
                 • Provide information that may be more detailed than that obtained from
                     a questionnaire.
                 • Require skillful interviewers to be able to take advantage of the face-to-
                     face interactions.
                 • If the skillset of the interviewees is appropriate, the qualitative data
                     may be used to provide more substantial conclusions than relying
                     solely, or largely, on quantitative data.
                 • Can be very time consuming: setting up, interviewing, transcribing,
                     analysing, feedback, reporting.
                 • Not all respondents may be comfortable taking part in interviews and
                     may feel nervous, especially when it is being recorded.

(c)   Some states are planning to return to a paper-based voting system, where
      voters put a cross (X) in the column next to the party of their choice.

      Discuss whether these states should retain e-voting or return to a paper-based
      voting system.                                                                      [8]

      Answers may include:

      Advantages of retaining e-voting:
         • The collection of the votes is more straightforward if the voting form is
            online.
         • Voters will have the flexibility to cast their votes from any location using
            online voting.
         • The results of the election can be reported more quickly.
         • More in-depth analysis of the voting patterns may occur, which may
            help political parties target voters during subsequent elections.
         • Electronic voting machines with touch screens are proven to be
            advantageous for physically challenged people.
         • Electronic voting machines can also come with audio support to assist
            visually impaired voters. In such cases, the visually challenged person
            can cast their vote without any problem.
         • Electronic voting machines allow people with disabilities to cast truly
            anonymous ballots and ensure them equitable rights.
         • A long-term decrease in expenses. Conducting a large-scale election
            can be a costly prospect, primarily because of labour costs.
         • More convenient to transport e-voting machines than ballot papers and
            boxes.

      Disadvantages of retaining e-voting:
         • The biggest concern about electronic voting is hacking: there is always
            the risk that someone without authorization would be able to access
            and alter the results of an election. This could be done either in-
            person, by physically tampering with the voting machines, or remotely,
            if the system transmits any kind of data over the internet.
         • A hurdle for implementing widespread e-voting is the high upfront cost
            of installation. While electronic voting can be a cost-saving measure in
            the long term, the cost of setting it up may be a prohibitive factor.
            Costs include the servers, voting machines, maintenance and
            installation, testing the infrastructure, and securing the premises.
         • E-voting machines may require power backup, which may be a
            challenge, especially in remote locations.
         • Technical supervisors/staff may be required at the site of e-voting to
            deal with technical glitches.

      Advantages of reverting to paper voting:
         • The cost of implementing the technology may not be cost effective.
         • There are concerns about the e-voting system being hacked or
            fraudulent activities linked to the voting.
         • Some people prefer the human element of paper voting.
         • No technical training required for voters: they can mark their
            preference on a paper ballot and drop it into the ballot box.
         • Even people with low literacy levels can easily use a paper ballot.
         • No technical training is required for election officers deployed at the
            polling booths: no electronic capturing devices are in use.

   •   Paper ballots are more secure – tampering is not possible due to a
       physical record of votes.
   •   The paper ballot is effective in reducing fake and bogus votes, as the
       software of electronic voting machines can be manipulated with
       malware, which can be used to tamper with the election results.
   •   Statistically relevant auditing can serve as a tool to detect or deter
       malfunction or fraud.
   •   In the instance where a candidate is entitled to a recount, a full hand
       recount of paper ballots can determine the accurate or final results.

Disadvantages of reverting to paper voting:
   • Printing of ballots ahead of time and setting them in order is a difficult
      task. Printing of ballots is done district-wise, making the task even
      more complex.
   • The voter may accidentally mark two boxes on the same ballot or may
      not mark the choice correctly. The computer software can prevent this
      happening.
   • With traditional paper methods, ballots must be collected from various
      polling locations and consolidated at a central location before a team of
      individuals sifts through them manually. This process is very time
      consuming, leading to a significant delay in the announcement of
      election results.
   • In a paper ballot, physically challenged people may have difficulty
      casting their votes in private.
   • The requirement to go to a polling location continues to drive down
      voter turnout. Some people don’t have time to take off work, don’t live
      close to a polling location, or just can’t be bothered.

(b)   Digital citizenship is included in Xingu Academy’s IT acceptable-use policy.

      Explain why it is important that students at Xingu Academy are both
      competent users of digital technologies and good digital citizens.                  [6]

      Reasons for being competent users of digital technologies:
         • To be able to use digital technologies to support their learning.
         • To be able to use software tools appropriately to maximize their
            efficiency.
         • To develop a set of transferable skills they can take beyond school.
         • To be able to access a wide range of online resources.
         • In order to take responsibility for their personal devices – ensure they
            are in working order and keep hardware and data secure. In a BYOD
            school, technicians may not be able to support all these diverse
            devices


      Reasons for being good digital citizens:
         • Understand that being able to use the digital technologies is not
            sufficient to ensure the opportunities they bring are harnessed.
         • Appreciates that a number of ethical decisions occur when interactions
            with the digital technologies occur.
         • Accept that they should be responsible for their actions when
            interacting with digital technologies and that some actions could have
            potentially negative consequences, such as employers judging
            prospective students by their social media profiles. So, it is important to
            teach students how to create online personas that project a positive
            and constructive image.
         • See the need for good digital citizenship as no more than an extension
            of their own physical citizenship.
         • Accept that the boundary between digital and physical citizenship can
            be blurred and ensure that these dual roles can be reconciled.
         • Students must respect other users and be aware of the impacts of
            irresponsible online behavior, eg cyber-bullying.
         • Students need to be aware of legal issues – illegally downloading
            games/music, crimes such as hacking/identity theft. Illegal
            games/hacking tools could be brought to school on their own devices.
         • Students require digital literacy to wisely use the vast amount of
            information on the internet.
         • Students need to understand that there is a digital divide – within the
            school/community/world – that may be accentuated at a BYOD school
            where some students own the latest technology. Children could put
            pressure on parents to buy newer devices.
         • Students need to be aware of digital health issues – good ergonomics,
            risks of internet/game addiction.
         • Students need to be aware of the need to protect their data using
            passwords/backup.

(c)   Discuss whether Xingu Academy should become a bring-your-own-device
      (BYOD) school.                                                                   [8]

      Answers may include:

      Reasons why Xingu Academy should become a bring-your-own-device
      (BYOD) school:
         • There will be a significant reduction in the cost of IT hardware that can
            be passed on to other teachers and learning needs (such as more
            staff).
         • The IT support team may not need to be so large, but will need to
            support a wide range of devices, including the latest technology as well
            as old technology.
         • Students may find that they do not have to learn the software used by
            the school as they have similar (or better) software installed on their
            device.
         • Students are already familiar and comfortable using their own
            technology so they can focus on the lesson.
         • Students can choose their own device type, more comfortable learning
            on certain devices.
         • Students’ personal mobile devices tend to be more cutting-edge, so
            schools can more easily stay up to date with technology – but this
            could present problems (digital divide/technical support).
         • With BYOD, students are more likely to continue learning outside of
            school hours.
         • Students will be more organized with all their notes and assignments
            all in one place (as opposed to having them on different computers and
            devices in different places at school and home).
         • Students can store their data on their own personal devices, so Xingu
            Academy is not responsible for data storage.
         • BYOD allows opportunities for more personalized learning where
            students can excel at their own pace.

Reasons why Xingu Academy should not become a bring-your-own-device
(BYOD) school:
   • Some teachers may not be comfortable with the new BYOD approach
      and may see it as technology for technology’s sake.
   • Some teachers may not be familiar with the software on a student’s
      device.
   • The school network may not have the capacity to deal with the
      increased number of devices on the network.
   • Some students will be advantaged, as they can afford much better
      devices than others, some may not be able to bring in a device –
      children may put pressure on their parents to upgrade their devices to
      keep up with their friends. Digital divide issues.
   • Teachers may find it harder to monitor a student’s digital behaviour.
   • Some schools monitor students’ screens – this will raise issues if
      monitoring software must be installed on students’ personal devices.
   • The IT support team may have to install network peripherals, such as
      printers, onto to the students’ devices.
   • The increased levels of access may lead to security concerns.
   • Students bringing in their own devices to school may increase the
      possibility of theft.
   • Applications may not be universal across all platforms, making it
      difficult for teachers to assist.
   • There may be more work for the IT department if they must support
      students’ personal devices.
   • Students sometimes may forget to bring their device or charge it.

3.   Clouds under the sea

     (a)   (i)     Identify two characteristics of cloud computing.                                 [2]

                   Answers may include:
                   • On-demand / measured service.
                   • Based on a network of linked servers.
                   • Multi-tenancy and resource pooling.
                   • Rapid elasticity and scalability.
                   • Broad network access.
                   • Pay-as-you-go.
                   • Easy maintenance.
                   • Low down time.
                   • Higher level of security, hard to breach.
                   • Accessible from multiple devices.
                   • Accessed via the internet.

                   Award [1] for identifying characteristics of cloud computing, up to a
                   maximum of [2].

           (ii)    Servers used in cloud computing hold considerable amounts of data.

                   Identify two forms of backup that could be used for the data on these
                   servers.                                                                         [2]

                   Answers may include:
                   • Duplicate/alternative versions
                   • Disk-to-cloud backup / Multi-location backup
                   • Disk-to-disk backup

                   Award [1] for identifying each form of back-up that could be used for the
                   data on these servers, up to a maximum of [2].

           (iii)   A user is downloading a ZIP (zipped file) from cloud storage.

                   The ZIP file is 0.6 GB in size and the bandwidth speed is 8 mbps.

                   Calculate the total time it will take to download the ZIP file.

                   Note: 1 GB=1000 MB.                                                              [2]

                   Bandwidth = 8 (mbps) / 8 = 1 (MB)

                   Download time = 600 / 1 seconds or 10 minutes.

                   Award [1] for correct conversion of mbps to MB (ie, divide by 8)
                   Award [1] for correct answer.

(b)   (i)     Compression software can be used to speed up the upload and download
              of files.

              The ZIP file recently downloaded from the cloud-based server contained a
              number of images and videos.

              Explain why lossy compression techniques would be used for the images
              that have been downloaded from cloud storage.                                   [2]

              Answers may include:
               • The image may not be used for printing.
               • Therefore, the quality/resolution of the image does not need to be as
                 high if it is only to be viewed on screen.
               • Due to significantly reduced file size, downloading images from cloud
                 storage will be fast and will consume less internet bandwidth.

              Award [1] for identifying why lossy compression techniques would be used
              for the images and [1] for a development of that point, up to a maximum of
              [2].

      (ii)    Explain why lossless compression techniques would be used for the videos
              that have been downloaded from cloud storage.                                   [2]

              Answers may include:
               • The quality of the decompressed video would need to be exactly the
                 same as the pre-compressed version.
               • Because the use of lossy compression techniques could lead to critical
                 parts of the video being lost.
               • Reduced file size without losing the quality of the video.

              Award [1] for identifying why lossless compression techniques would be
              used for the videos and [1] for a development of that point, up to a
              maximum of [2].

      (iii)   Cloud storage providers are responsible for protecting the privacy and
              anonymity of the individuals whose data is held on their servers.

              Distinguish between privacy and anonymity.                                      [2]

              Answers may include:
               • Privacy is knowing who the person is, but not knowing what they are
                 doing / privacy is a concept describing activities that one keeps entirely
                 to themselves, or to a limited group of people.
               • Anonymity is knowing what a person may be doing, but not being able
                 to identify the person.

              Award [1] for identifying each difference between privacy and anonymity,
              up to a maximum of [2].

              Note: It is acceptable to correctly define each term for [2].

(c)   Evaluate Microsoft’s decision to build data centres on the seabed.              [8]

      Answers may include:

      Reasons why Microsoft should build data centres on the seabed:
         • The water surrounding the data centre can be used to cool it.
         • The percentage of the world’s water used for this purpose is almost
            infinitesimally small, so there is going to be almost no environmental
            effect.
         • They can be hidden and will not be unsightly.
         • They may not take up valuable sites on land that could be used for
            housing.
         • They are likely to need less maintenance.
         • The underwater data centers will take relatively less time compared to
            land constructions.

      Reasons why Microsoft should not build data centres on the seabed:
         • The technology has existed for 10 years, but there has been no
            commercial development of these data centres – why is this the case?
         • The data centres may need to be backed up terrestrially, so it may not
            be as environmentally friendly as suggested.
         • Maintenance will be more difficult.
         • The data centres may have an impact on local ecosystems e.g. heat
            from the plants / chemicals leaching from the equipment.
         • The cables to the data centres may be damaged by ships.
         • Seabed data centres may be significantly more expensive than land-
            based ones.
         • Finding efficient ways of delivering backup power suppliers to an
            underwater site may be problematic.

4.   The role of portable digital devices in health

     (a)   (i)    Identify two vital signs that can be recorded by Jaime’s sport watch.             [2]

                  Answers may include:
                  • Heart rate / pulse.
                  • Blood pressure.
                  • Blood oxygen level / oxygen saturation.
                  • Respiration rate.
                  • Body temperature.

                  Award [1] for identifying each vital sign, up to a maximum of [2].

           (ii)   Describe the steps that the GPS receiver in Jaime’s sport watch uses to
                  show the routes of his training runs.                                             [4]

                  Answers may include:
                   • The GPS receiver receives data from satellites that circle the earth,
                     tracking the location of the runner as he moves.
                   • The GPS receiver receives information about the orbits of each
                     satellite (so it knows where each satellite will be at any given moment).
                   • The GPS receiver calculates how far away from each satellite it is and
                     therefore where it is on the surface of the earth.
                   • It measures the distance to each satellite by calculating the amount of
                     time it takes to receive its signal.
                   • Once the GPS receiver has a minimum of three satellites in its fix, it
                     can calculate its position on earth.
                   • It uses a process of trilateration.
                   • With two satellites in its fix, a GPS receiver can calculate its latitude
                     and longitude (2D fix).
                   • With three satellites in its fix, a GPS receiver can calculate its latitude,
                     longitude and altitude (3D fix).
                   • With four or more satellites in range, the GPS receiver can
                     compensate for time differences between the receiver’s clock and the
                     satellites’ clocks.
                   • Using the location data, the route can be displayed on a map (GIS
                     software).

                  Award [1] for identifying each step that global positioning systems (GPS)
                  follow to give an accurate location, up to maximum of [4].

       (b)   Jaime has decided to share his personal health information with researchers
             at the University of Sierra Nevada (USN).

             Analyse Jaime’s decision to share his personal health information with the
             University of Sierra Nevada (USN).                                                          [6]

             Reasons for sharing his personal health information:
                • The university may have access to data analytics tools that can
                   interrogate his personal health information and give him feedback on
                   his health/fitness.
                • The university may be able to provide additional health-related
                   information.
                • The university may be able to analyse Jaime’s data against other
                   and/or larger data sets.
                • Jaime may accept that his data is “out there” already so there is no
                   harm in re-sharing it.
                • Jaime may wish to contribute towards research at USN.

             Reasons for not sharing his personal health information:
                • There may be no way of knowing which other third parties the
                   university is sharing Jaime’s data with.
                • The university may impose conditions that may mean the data is not
                   used for the purposes it was intended.
                • Once the data is shared, it is hard to guarantee that is deleted when it
                   is no longer needed.
                • Patient privacy is a concern. Is data anonymized and does the
                   university have sufficient security measures in place?

(c)   The development of mobile health apps has changed the way citizens manage
      their own health and wellbeing.

      Discuss whether citizens such as Jaime should rely only on the advice of a
      health app to manage their own health and wellbeing.                            [8]

      Answers may include:

      Reasons why citizens such as Jaime should only rely on the
      recommendations of the health app:
         • The health app may be more consistent in its advice than a human
            doctor.
         • The health app will not be influenced by the patient during the
            consultation / will be completely objective.
         • The health app may lead to savings (for the user of the app) so that
            other treatments that are currently not available may become possible
            as money is freed up / health app may be more cost effective for the
            user than visiting a specialist.
         • The health app is available 24/7.
         • It is convenient, the app is available immediately and Jaime would not
            have to visit a doctor or sports scientist to get advice.
         • The information from the app is available immediately without any
            delays.
         • The health app can be updated almost instantaneously, whereas
            doctors would have to attend courses to ensure new procedures, etc,
            are explained.
         • App is available in any location so could, for example, be used on
            holiday and the information and advice would still be available.

      Reasons why citizens such as Jaime should not rely only on the
      recommendations of the health app:
         • The health app may be based on a generic profile and not have
            sufficient background data to make a more meaningful diagnosis than
            a human.
         • The users may not trust the health app due to reliability and integrity
            issues.
         • The quality of the data being collected may be poor and the advice
            might not be appropriate.
         • Negative results could result in anxiety or cause Jaime to overexert
            himself in order to follow the advice of the app.
