Prescribed subject 1: Military leaders

Read sources A to D and answer questions 1 to 4. The sources and questions relate to case study 2:
Richard I of England (1173–1199) — Campaigns: Involvement in the Third Crusade (1191–1192).

Source A              Richard I, speaking prior to the Third Crusade, as recorded in the contemporary
                      chronicle The History of the Holy War.

You will never see me lead a campaign for which I can be criticised, and I do not care if I am disliked
for it. Know for certain that wherever our army go, Saladin knows what we are about and what our
strength is. We are a long way from the sea, and if he and his Saracens were to come down on the
plains of the city of Ramla and intercept our provisions … this would not be wise for those who would
be besieging … and if I were to lead the army and besiege Jerusalem, and such a thing were to
happen … then I would be forever blamed, shamed and less loved. I know in truth and without doubt that
there are those here and in France who would have wanted and greatly desire that I should do such a
thing, which would everywhere be told to my shame.


Source B              James W Glass, an American painter, depicts Richard the Lionheart in the
                      historical scene Richard, Cœur de Lion [Lionheart], on his way to Jerusalem
                      (1854).

Source C               John Gillingham, professor of medieval history, writing in the academic book
                       Richard I (1999).

It might be argued that if Richard could not recapture Jerusalem, none the less he conquered
Cyprus … Whenever possible he chose options—the conquest of Cyprus, the recovery of the coastal
cities of Palestine, a campaign against Egypt—which made strategic sense and which brought
substantial and lasting gain for the shattered Christian presence in the Middle East. To a remarkable
degree most, though not all, contemporaries and near contemporaries adopted non-religious criteria in
assessing his conduct of the crusade. Even monks recognized and admired his prowess [skill] and his
conquests … Yet it is unlikely that anyone ever went on crusade in more extraordinary circumstances
than Richard did, when the wiser thing would have been to stay at home. His problem was that he came
to the throne in 1189 having been betrothed [engaged] for the last twenty years to Alice, a sister of the
reigning king of France, Philip Augustus. Alice had been in the custody of Richard’s father, Henry II, who
had not been able to resist the temptation to seduce her. Richard decided that this made it impossible for
him to marry her. But to send her back to her brother after twenty years would be an enormous insult to
the honour of the French royal house.


Source D               Jean Flori, an historian specializing in the Crusades, writing in the academic book
                       Richard the Lionheart: King and Knight (2006).

So, if we are to believe him [Richard I], it was to avoid the dishonour of a defeat for the whole army
that Richard refused to lead the crusader army to the walls of Jerusalem. Instead, he proposed an
expedition against Egypt. The matter was put before the council of barons, which consisted of twenty
men. To the immense despair of the majority of crusaders, the council opted for the overland expedition
to Egypt, supported by a fleet stationed off the coast. The advice of the local lords had been taken, which
confirmed the strategic logic of Richard’s choice in their eyes. But it was profoundly shocking to many
of the crusaders and, once again, the French went their own way. Hugh, Duke of Burgundy, seized the
opportunity to spread defamatory [offensive] stories about the King of England and songs accusing him
of cowardice … The army was deeply divided and, in these circumstances, all idea of taking Jerusalem
had to be abandoned. It was a failure both for the crusaders and for Richard, whose prestige was badly
damaged. Worse, he must have wondered whether he had lost out on both fronts: by agreeing to remain
in the Holy Land until the following Easter, he had seriously endangered the future of his empire in the
West, leaving the field clear for his brother John, without the compensation of the successes he had
counted on in the East.

Prescribed subject 2: Conquest and its impact

Read sources E to H and answer questions 5 to 8. The sources and questions relate to case study 2:
The conquest of Mexico and Peru (1519–1551) — Impact: Social and economic impact (including trade)
on indigenous populations; the encomienda and Mita systems.

Source E               Edward Gaylord Bourne, an historian specializing in Latin American history,
                       writing in the academic book Spain in America, 1450–1580 (1904).

The encomienda system deteriorated into a serfdom approaching slavery and was capable of great
abuses; but the crown tried to prevent these evils so far as possible. In the code for the Indies prepared
in 1542, commonly called the “New Laws”, the future enslavement of the Indians was absolutely
prohibited; encomenderos [holders of encomiendas] who had abused their Indians were to lose their
possessions; no new encomiendas were to be granted, and existing ones were to end on the death of
the holder.

In securing this legislation, Bartolomé de las Casas had been largely influential, but the practical
difficulties of its execution proved overwhelming. The problem was not an easy one. A kingdom had
been gained by the heroism and sacrifices of private adventurers: how were they to be rewarded and
their families supported? That they should have great estates with a numerous body of serfs and live
like nobles in Europe seemed a practical solution to the difficulty. On the other hand, the Spanish
crown strongly disapproved of the wasting [misuse] of the population that had taken place. The Indian
legislation of the Spanish kings is an impressive monument of good intentions.


Source F               Benjamin Keen, an historian specializing in colonial Latin America, writing an
                       introduction to Life and Labor in Ancient Mexico: The Brief and Summary Relation
                       of the Lords of New Spain (1963).

The conquistadores had visions of limitless wealth to be obtained through silver mines, sugar and cacao
plantations. The intensity of exploitation of Indian labor became intolerable.

The Crown faced a problem of balancing the demand of the colonists for cheap Indian labor with its
own interest in preserving a large tribute-paying Indian population. There was a political issue as well:
excessive concentration of land and Indians in the hands of the encomenderos might lead to the rise of
a class of great feudal lords independent of royal authority, a development the Spanish monarchs were
determined to prevent.

The evolution of Spain’s Indian policy reflected a complex clash of interests and opinions. Bartolomé
de las Casas demanded suppression of the encomiendas. The encomenderos threatened the Crown
with loss of its American empire through Indian revolt and requested that their encomiendas be made
hereditary. A majority of Crown officials and most of the clergy took a “realist” compromising position.
They argued that the encomienda, regulated by laws to safeguard Indian welfare, was necessary for the
prosperity and security of the land: “There could be no stability in the land without rich men and there
could be no rich men without encomiendas. All industry was carried on with Indian labor, and only those
with Indians could engage in commerce.”

Source G              Bartolomé de las Casas, a Spanish historian and Dominican missionary during
                      the conquest, writing in the chronicle An Account, Much Abbreviated, of the
                      Destruction of the Indies (written to Prince Philip of Spain in 1542, published
                      in 1552).

The Spaniards took the Indians’ lands they [the Indians] had inherited and which nourished them. And
the Spaniards had all the Indians—lords, old persons, women, and children—within their own houses,
and they would have the Indians serve them night and day, without rest, and even the children were
occupied in doing all they could, or even more. And so they have exhausted them, and still this day
exhaust the few who still remain, without allowing them to have their own house or any possession.

They have oppressed the Indians and been the cause of the rapid death of many people in this province,
by making them carry wood for a great distance to the harbour to make boats with, and sending them
to find honey and wax into the forests, where they are eaten by wild animals. And they have treated
pregnant women like beasts of burden.

Source K                  Martin Clark, an historian, writing in the academic book Mussolini (2014).

The Italians had invaded Abyssinia in the 1890s and had suffered a humiliating defeat at Adowa in
1896 … Mussolini’s great ambition was to establish an African empire and the obvious place was
Abyssinia, virtually the only part of Africa left uncolonized … The British and French would not be too
offended, providing their interests were safeguarded, since they too suffered from Abyssinian border
raids and would welcome greater security for their own neighbouring colonies. Mussolini had domestic
reasons too. He needed to maintain morale at home, especially among the young. He could hardly
keep proclaiming his warlike values and the need for Empire for over a decade, without actually fighting
anybody. Mussolini needed a war: a quick, easy war against carefully chosen, weak opponents. So
he set his sights on Abyssinia. As early as 1925 he ordered military and diplomatic preparations in
case Abyssinia collapsed. On 30 December 1935, he finally issued orders for the total conquest of
Abyssinia … [This] was not popular with the army high command. It was about to begin military talks with
the French, and did not want to risk alienating its new partners; nor did it want to see all the available
resources being swallowed up by a pointless colonial campaign.

                          in Italy (1998).

Mussolini believed that Fascism demanded a spectacular foreign policy achievement and the only one
that would suffice [be enough] was the conquest of Abyssinia. But while the invasion was launched
in 1935, it is clear that the decision to go to war was actually made in 1932, when Italy was still
suffering the worst effects of the Depression. Thus, the traditional view that the Abyssinian adventure
was almost certainly planned, at least in part, as an alternative to social reform still has some force.
The resort to colonial adventures as a way of distracting attention from domestic difficulties, and even
hopefully resolving them, was an established tradition among the Italian political class before the arrival
of Fascism … thus Mussolini’s proposed conquest had the additional attraction of offering to wipe out
the humiliation of Italy’s defeat by the Abyssinians at Adowa in 1896. In any case Abyssinia, as one of
the two surviving independent states in Africa, was the only realistic place for further Italian colonial
expansion. [By 1935] Italy was now more than a junior partner to Britain and France: it was Mussolini’s
judgement that Italy had instead become their absolutely indispensable ally.

Apartheid South Africa (1948–1964) — Nature and characteristics of discrimination: Bantustan system.

Source M                   Robert M Price, a professor of politics, writing in the academic book The
                           Apartheid State in Crisis: Political Transformation in South Africa,
                           1975–1990 (1991).

On March 21, 1960 in the black township of Sharpeville … peaceful demonstrators, for the most part
African women, were attacked by police, who shot and killed 69 and wounded another 178 … Images of
the Sharpeville massacre alerted international attention to the apartheid system, and to the state’s efforts
to suppress and silence opponents of racial separation. Pretoria found itself diplomatically isolated and
faced with threats to its security and economic growth. International investment, which had played a
considerable part in South Africa’s development, took flight.

It was in this context of international isolation and hostility that Prime Minister Verwoerd introduced his
plan for the eventual partition of South African territory into ten independent African states, and “white”
South Africa … Ten Bantustans would be created out of the 13 % of South Africa’s land area. Some
economic developments and limited powers of internal self-government were intended for these new
entities, which were seen as the future home of Africans who would be removed from “white South
Africa” … A combination of ruthless repression and apartheid measures served to crush all organized
manifestations of black political and economic power.

                         magazine Liberation (May 1959).

There is … no democracy. No self-government… Politically, the talk about self-government for the
reserves is a swindle [fraud]. Economically, it is [a nonsense].

The few scattered African reserves in various parts of the Union [of South Africa], comprising about 13
percent of the least desirable land area, represent the last shreds of land ownership left to the African
people of their original… home. … The facts are… that the reserves are congested [overcrowded]
distressed areas, completely unable to sustain their present populations. The majority of the adult males
are always away from home working in the towns, mines, or European-owned farms. The people are on
the verge of starvation. The [government] speaks of teaching Africans soil conservation and agriculture
and replacing European agricultural officers by Africans… [In fact, the main] problem of the reserves is
the intolerable congestion which already exists. No amount of agricultural instruction will ever enable 13
percent of the land to sustain 66 percent of the population.

The government is, of course, fully aware of [the] fact. They have no intention of creating African areas
which are genuinely self-supporting (and which could therefore create a genuine possibility of self-
government). If such areas were indeed self-supporting, where would the Chamber of Mines and the
Nationalist farmers get their supplies of cheap labour?


Source P                 Roger B Beck, an historian specializing in South African history, writing in the
                         academic book The History of South Africa (2000).

The Promotion of Bantu Self-Government Act (1959) limited African political rights to the reserves,
thereby taking away their elected White parliamentary representatives. … The bantustans were allotted
within the limits of the 13.7 percent of land earlier set aside and varied considerably in size and quality.
There were eventually ten homelands, or bantustans, based on ethnicity. Furthermore, in an effort to
guarantee White access to the best farming land and mineral wealth, only the tiny bantustan of Qwaqwa
was a single piece. Bophuthatswana consisted of nineteen fragments, some separated by hundreds of
miles; and KwaZulu had twenty-nine major and forty-one minor fragments. …

Verwoerd argued that South Africa was “decolonizing” the bantustans and granting them independence;
as citizens of their respective bantustans, Africans enjoyed full political rights according to their own
practices and traditions. According to Verwoerd, there could be no racial discrimination against Africans
in South Africa because there were no African citizens; African rights in White South Africa were not
restricted because of race but because they were foreigners.

To present an acceptable face to the world, Verwoerd increasingly referred to “separate development”
rather than apartheid; “Natives” became Bantu; bantustans became “homelands”.

to act. Fighting began in the village of Likosane [Likoshan] on February 28. It culminated a few days
later when Serbian security forces finally took Adem Jashari’s family compound. He was killed, along
with members of his extended family and others, making a total of 51 dead. There was no going back.
Jashari’s image, with bushy beard and white, domed Albanian hat, would be found everywhere and the
man himself elevated to the status of a saint.

Kosovar Albanians were overtaken by conflicting emotions. Fear was one of them, but another, euphoria,
was stronger, especially as the KLA began to take territory in central Drenica and in the west. More and
more young men began to trek over the mountains to Albania to collect weapons, and more and more
people began to donate to the KLA instead of contributing to [Ibrahim] Rugova’s fund.

The KLA’s strength at the beginning of 1998 was estimated at around 500 active members … [and]
would probably not have become a major threat, had it not been for two events. The first was the
collapse of the Albanian government in the spring of 1997. In the ensuing riots, weapons were looted
and as many as a million light arms were distributed among the [Albanian] population. Many of
these weapons ended in the hands of KLA fighters, smuggled across the mountains dividing Albania
from Kosovo.

The second event was the decision by Serbian authorities to launch a campaign to suppress armed
resistance. A police action on January 22, 1998, failed to arrest Adem Jashari, the head of a powerful
clan in the Drenica region who had become a symbol of local independence. An armed assault against
the Jashari clan followed, leaving 58 people dead.

The bloodbath had the predictable effect of galvanizing [stimulating] resentment, and the KLA grew
rapidly. Within Kosovo, however, lightly armed militants were no match for the disciplined military forces
of a modern state. In June 1998, the Serbian Army launched a counter offensive, with over 40 000
troops operating with tanks, helicopters, heavy artillery, and mortar fire, that gathered momentum as it
progressed. By late summer, it seemed to be on the verge of breaking organized resistance once and
for all.
