                                              Section A

Answer one question from this section.

1.   MiniVS (MV)

     MiniVS (MV) imports light bulbs, which it sells business to business (B2B) to customers in the
     UK. In 2020, MV ran into cash-flow problems and had to use debt factoring.

     MV has now solved its cash-flow problems. It operates a cost-plus (mark-up) pricing strategy
     and places a 100 % mark-up on the light bulbs that it purchases from suppliers.

     The forecasted opening cash balance for January 2021 is £20 000.

                         Table 1: Forecasted data per month for MV for the
                              first six months of 2021 (all figures in £)

                                                    Months 1–3        Months 4–6

                      Cash sales per month             75 000           70 000

                      Warehouse overheads                 5000            5000

                      Office salaries                  30 000           30 000

                      Marketing costs                     1000            1000

     The finance director is concerned that the online market for light bulbs in the UK is becoming
     increasingly price competitive. She believes that if suppliers raise prices in the second half of
     2021, MV will have to abandon its cost-plus (mark-up) pricing strategy to be price competitive.

     (a)   State two features of debt factoring.                                                          [2]

     (b)   Using the information in Table 1, construct a fully labelled cash flow forecast for MV for
           the first six months of 2021.                                                                  [6]

     (c)   Explain the potential impact on MV’s gross profit margin if the prices charged by its
           suppliers increase in the second half of 2021.                                                 [2]

                                               Section B

Answer one question from this section.

3.   The Burnt Tomato (BTO)

     In 2003, Ben opened a street-food stall selling vegan food. The food stall was successful.
     Ben spent little on marketing, mainly advertising on the food stall itself and relocating it to
     places or events where many consumers would pass by.

     In 2008, Ben used the profits from the food stall to open a restaurant, The Burnt Tomato
     (BTO), which initially employed 16 people. In the following years, labour turnover was low.
     Employees received an annual bonus, which increased with each year of employment.

     In 2015, Ben created a website and began to use social-media marketing. Customers were
     encouraged to rate their BTO experience online. Their reviews consistently rated BTO’s
     experienced staff highly and showed that they thought the food was exceptional value.
     Ben replied to all reviews. Many BTO customers also joined a BTO social media group
     and communicated with each other and BTO regularly. For many customers, the total BTO
     experience of vegan food and social networking was like being in a club.

     Unfortunately, high labour costs, reasonable profits and the use of high-quality ingredients
     meant that BTO’s gross and net profit margins were below industry averages.

     Aware of the growing demand for vegan food, Ben borrowed money from a family member
     in 2018 and opened two more BTOs in different cities, hiring 32 new employees. However,
     in January 2019, a long-time customer of the original BTO ate at one of the new restaurants
     and wrote a negative review. The review went viral and sales at all three BTOs declined.

     (a)   State two appropriate sources of finance Ben may have used when he first opened his
           vegan food stall.                                                                                  [2]

     (b)   Explain one positive impact and one negative impact on BTO as a result of having low
           labour turnover.                                                                                   [4]

     (c)   Explain one advantage and one disadvantage for BTO as a result of its use of social
           media.[4]

     (d)   Discuss Ben’s decision to enlarge the scale of BTO from one restaurant to three
           restaurants.[10]

4.   Nigris & Speroni (NS)

     Nigris & Speroni (NS) is a national grocery store chain. In the tertiary sector, it benefits from
     economies of scale, including purchasing economies of scale. Its stores use sophisticated
     computerization to manage stock and monitor customers’ purchasing habits. NS is currently
     experimenting with cleverly placed products and short-term promotions to increase impulse
     purchases, which occur when a customer makes unplanned purchases. Something in the
     store – a smell, a vivid display, samples of products – triggers a customer’s desire for items.

     NS has above-average prices compared to the industry average, but at least one other
     chain is more expensive. The grocery store industry is competitive and grocery stores use
     many different pricing strategies. NS is considering adopting an online ordering and delivery
     service for customers, which would operate from its stores.

     Each of NS’ stores is given a number to identify it. Store number 507 is called NS 507.

                     Table 3: Selected financial information for NS 507 for 2019

                                    Gross profit          $5 300 000

                                    Net profit margin     3%

                                    Sales revenue         $20 000 000

     On 1 January 2020, an organic grocery store, U-Foods, opened near NS 507. U-Foods sells
     high-quality foods, including organically produced fruits and vegetables, organically raised
     meats and sustainably sourced seafood (not from fish farms). It charges higher prices than
     NS 507 and has higher margins. The few processed foods that it sells are organic and low in
     salt. Unlike NS 507, U-Foods does not sell cigarettes or high-sugar beverages and cereals. It
     is also not considering an online ordering and delivery service like NS is.

     In the first six months of 2020, however, NS 507 lost market share. Sales revenue was
     12 % lower than in the first six months of 2019, even though the number of customers and
     transactions did not change.

     (a)   State two types of business, other than grocery stores, that operate in the tertiary sector.    [2]

     (b)   Explain two elements of U-Foods’ marketing mix other than price.                                [4]

     (c)   Calculate for 2019:

           (i)    NS 507’s gross profit margin (no working required);                                      [1]

           (ii)   NS 507’s net profit before interest and tax (no working required).[1]

     (d)   Explain one economy of scale, other than purchasing economies of scale, from which
           NS might benefit.                                                                               [2]

     (e)   Discuss two possible methods that NS 507 could use to regain lost market share.                [10]




                                                                                                   Turn over

5.   Pablo’s Peanuts (PP)

     Pablo recently emigrated from Argentina to Miami, Florida, which has a large Hispanic*
     population. However, he could not find caramelized peanuts – known as garrapiñada –at any
     of the Latin American markets in Miami. These tasty sweet snacks, sold by street vendors,
     are very popular in Latin American countries. Pablo began testing different recipes to make
     the snack himself. Once convinced he had the perfect product, he conducted primary market
     research in several Hispanic neighbourhoods. He was overwhelmed by the positive response.

     As a result, Pablo set up Pablo’s Peanuts (PP) as a private limited company. He then
     purchased a food truck (a large vehicle equipped to cook and sell food). From Tuesday to
     Sunday, he drove to different Latin American markets in the Miami area to cook and sell his
     product. PP soon became profitable, but meeting demand was difficult.

     Pablo wants PP to grow. To do this, he needs a second food truck and an employee. The
     second truck would require an investment of $100 000. Pablo’s break-even analysis shows
     that the expected increased output would more than double PP’s profits if the cost of fuel for
     the food trucks remains constant.

     Pablo is considering two options to finance the second truck:
     y Option 1: A local Miami bank, clearly impressed by the break-even analysis data, is willing to
       lend Pablo $100 000 with a 10 % interest rate.
     y Option 2: A business angel, Ana Perez, with a strong portfolio of Latin American food products,
       has approached Pablo. She is offering $100 000 for 35 % of shares in PP.
