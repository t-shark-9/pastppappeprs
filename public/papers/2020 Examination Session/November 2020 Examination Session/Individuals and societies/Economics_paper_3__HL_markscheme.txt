Alternative approaches may be taken in responses to the [4] questions that use A02 command
terms. If this is the case and the alternative approaches are valid, then full credit should be given.

Any part of an explanation or outline that is in brackets is not required for full marks, but may
appear in a response as an alternative or additional explanation.

The requirement for answers being given to two decimal places only applies to non-terminating
decimals. An accurate decimal answer is acceptable eg 2.0625 equals 33/16 exactly, so either
2.06 or 2.0625 should be rewarded.

Whenever relevant, carry over marks must be awarded. If a candidate makes an error in
calculation, but then uses the incorrect figure appropriately and accurately in later question
parts, then the candidate may be fully rewarded. This is the “own-figure rule” and you should put
OFR on the script where you are rewarding this.




1.   (a)   Using information from Figure 1, calculate Firm A’s total fixed costs.                       [2]

           20 (29 – 10)

           Any valid working (from another output level e.g. 30 (24.67 – 12)) is sufficient for [1].

           = $380

           Allow +/- $10 i.e. from $370 to $390.

           NB responses that lie outside the +/- $10 tolerance but indicate that, at a given quantity, the
           AVC and ATC are approximately accurate (eg 45 (31 – 23) = $360) may be fully rewarded.

           An answer of $380 or 380 without workings is sufficient for [1].

           For full marks to be awarded, the response must provide valid working and include correct
           units. However, superfluous units (e.g.$380 per kg) may be ignored.

     (b)   (i)    The market price of almonds is $11 per kilogram. Using Figure 1, identify the quantity
                  of almonds Firm A must produce in order to maximize profits.                         [1]

                  21kg OR 21 is sufficient for [1]

           (ii)   Calculate the economic profit/loss when Firm A is producing at the output level
                  identified in part (b)(i).                                                            [2]

                  21 (11 – 28)

                  Any valid working is sufficient for [1].

                  = – $357 OR (economic) losses = $357

                  OFR applies if incorrect quantity is given for (b)(i).

                  An answer of a loss of $357 or – 357 without workings is sufficient for [1].

                  For full marks to be awarded, the response must provide valid working and include
                  correct units. However, superfluous units may be ignored.

    (c)   (i)     Based on the information in Figure 2, state whether the firms in this market
                  are making normal profits, economic profits or economic losses.                           [1]

                  is sufficient for [1].

          (ii)    On Figure 2, draw and label appropriate additional curves to show how a perfectly
                  competitive market will move from short-run equilibrium to long-run equilibrium.          [2]

                  [2] for two accurate, labelled diagrams.

                  D1 or AR1 or MR1 is sufficient for firm’s model. P1 is not required for firm’s model. Titles
                  are not required for the diagrams.

                  The firm’s new Q need not be specified on the diagram.

(d)   State two assumed characteristics of a monopoly.                                       [2]

      Award [1] for each valid characteristic:
      • single or dominant firm in the market OR market power/price-setting power
      • no close substitutes
      • significant barriers to entry.

      Any other valid characteristic.

(e)   Explain two reasons why a monopoly may be considered desirable for an economy.         [4]

                For a limited explanation of one reason, award a maximum of [1].
                For an accurate explanation of one reason (see Level 2) OR a
                limited explanation of two reasons award a maximum of [2].

                Reasons may include:
                • it may engage in research and development (R&D)
                • it may engage in innovation
                • it may enjoy economies of scale.

                explanation of a second reason award a maximum of [3].

                For providing two accurate reasons, award a maximum of [4].

                Accurate explanations may include:
                • The ability to maintain abnormal profits permits it to invest in
                   R&D which leads to new products and new technologies
                • It may be forced to innovate to maintain abnormal profit, OR the
                   prospect of abnormal profit may encourage innovation AND
                   these innovations eventually benefit the whole economy
                • If it grows in size or is a natural monopoly it may achieve
                   economies of scale (which reduce average production costs),
                   permitting price to be lower to the benefit of consumers.

                Any other valid explanation.

              outlets not sufficiently surveyed by the government statisticians
           • consumers/households may have substituted cheaper items when the price
              of one item increased, but their weights are fixed
           • new goods may have appeared in the market after the basket was
              constructed and are not included in it even though a typical
              consumer/household may consume them
           • different groups have different expenditure patterns and, therefore, the
              calculated inflation rate does not apply to all groups
           • prices may vary significantly between areas of a country and, therefore, the
              calculated inflation rate does not apply to all areas
           • households changing their expenditure patterns significantly because of
              tastes changing after the basket was constructed.

           Any other valid explanation.

           For a response that interest rates rise OR the money supply is reduced.
           Higher interest rates reduce investment and/or consumption and/or net
           exports, so that AD falls (which will result in a lower inflation rate).

           Any valid outline of how monetary policy can be used to lower inflation may
           be awarded.

    (d)   (i)     In 2019, nominal GDP was $ 102 874.55 million. Using data from Table 2, identify
                  whether Country A experienced inflation or deflation or disinflation in 2019.        [1]

                  deflation OR inflation

                  is sufficient for [1].

                  NB There has been deflation since the base year. In 2019, however, the presence of
                  deflation can only be confirmed if the percentage change in nominal GDP is below
                  0.72%.

          (ii)    Using data from Table 2, state the reason why there is a difference between the
                  real GDP growth rate and the real GDP per capita growth rate between 2015
                  and 2019.                                                                            [1]

                  because the population has been growing.

                  is sufficient for [1].

          (iii)   An economist forecasts that the real GDP growth rate in 2020 will be 3.41 %. Using
                  the data in Table 2, calculate the forecast for real GDP ($ million) in 2020.      [2]

                  103 785.98 x 1.0341

                  Any valid working is sufficient for [1].

                  = $ 107 325.08 million OR $107.33 billion

                  An answer of 107 325.08 without workings is sufficient for [1].

                  NB Since ($ million) is in the question, units are not required.

(f)   (i)    Plot and label the production possibility curves for Country J and for Country H,
             assuming constant opportunity costs, on Figure 4.                                   [2]

        (ii)   Using the above data and the concept of opportunity costs to support your answer,
               determine which good Country H should specialize in. You must give a reason for
               your choice.                                                                      [2]

         For a response that H should specialize in wheat:

         • because its opportunity cost of producing wheat is lower than J’s.
         OR
         • because 14/7 rice is less than 12/4 rice.
         OR
         • because 2 rice < 3 rice.

         Alternative explanation based on the slopes should be fully rewarded.

         A response which does not mention opportunity costs and uses the data
         incorrectly may be awarded a maximum of [1].

    (g)   Explain two gains from trade that arise when Country J and Country H specialize according
          to comparative advantage.                                                               [4]

          For a limited explanation of one gain, award a maximum of [1].
          For an accurate explanation of one gain (see Level 2) OR a limited
          explanation of two gains award a maximum of [2].

          Limited explanations of gains may include:

              increased productivity OR improved resource allocation
          • import price lower than if country had produced the good domestically
          • economies of scale when specializing
          • consuming beyond production possibility curve

          of one other gain award a maximum of [3].
          For providing two accurate gains, award a maximum of [4].

          Accurate explanations of gains may include:
          • higher global output because resources are used more efficiently
          • each country can purchase the imported good at a lower price than its
             domestic opportunity cost of making it
          • each country could benefit from economies of scale when specializing in
             goods with a comparative advantage resulting in increased productive
             efficiency
          • each country can consume beyond its production possibility curve
          • economic growth accelerates because resource allocation is improved/
             productivity increases due to lower global opportunity costs
          • diffusion of technology because technology is often embodied in the
             traded goods.

          Any other valid gain plus explanation should be fully rewarded.

              incomes overseas OR an appreciation of currencies of trading partners
              (eg US$) OR signing an (enhanced) free trade agreement OR lower
              inflation in Mexico
           • lower demand for imports in Mexico as a result of: lower inflation in
              Mexico OR lower income growth (recession) in Mexico OR increased
              protection of Mexico markets
           • an increase in FDI inflows as a result of positive expectations about
              prospects of Mexico economy or lower wages, etc OR a decrease in FDI
              outflows as a result of negative expectations about prospects of US (et al)
              economy
           • an increase in portfolio (capital) inflows because of an increase in
              Mexican interest rates OR a decrease in portfolio (capital) outflows
              because of a decrease in overseas interest rates
           • increased speculation in favour of peso and against the dollar because of
              expectations that the Mexican peso will appreciate
           • any other valid explanation.

        OFR does not apply, since there would be a welfare gain if the answer to (d)(i)
        were $7.

(f)    Explain two methods that a government could use to correct a persistent current account
       deficit.                                                                                [4]

      Level                                                                         Marks
      0       The work does not meet a standard described by the descriptors        0

      1       The written response is limited.                                      1–2
              For a limited explanation of one method, award a maximum of [1].
              For an accurate explanation of one method OR a limited
              explanation of two methods award a maximum of [2].

              Methods may include:
              • expenditure switching policies/discouraging imports/currency
                   depreciation
              • expenditure reducing policies/contractionary macro policies
              • supply-side policies.
      2       The written response is accurate.                                     3–4
              For providing an accurate explanation of one method and a
              limited explanation of one other method award a maximum of [3].
              For providing two accurate methods, award a maximum of [4].

              Accurate explanations may include:
              • expenditure switching policies, such as tariffs and non-tariff
                 barriers, which will make imports more expensive /
                 discourage imports, and thus increase net exports OR
                 subsidies which will make exports more competitive and
                 imports less attractive
              • intervening in the foreign exchange market to weaken
                 (depreciate) its own currency, which will make its imports
                 more expensive and exports cheaper, which should increase
                 net exports
              • expenditure reducing policies, such as contractionary fiscal or
                 monetary policies to reduce income growth and prices and
                 thus consumption of imports. Lowering prices should also
                 assist exports, which will increase net exports
              • supply-side policies eg deregulation etc, to increase
                 competitiveness of domestically produced goods (lower
                 production costs and prices), such as by introducing new
                 technologies and by nurturing a more skilled work force,
                 which will increase net exports.

              Any two methods which are well explained should be fully
              rewarded. These may be two separate supply-side policies or two
              separate expenditure switching policies (but not two types of trade
              protection) or two separate expenditure reducing policies.
