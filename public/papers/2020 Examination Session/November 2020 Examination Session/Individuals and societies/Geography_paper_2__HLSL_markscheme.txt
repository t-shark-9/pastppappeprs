                                               Section A
1.   Changing population

     (a)   Describe the projected trends for the two dependent population groups from 2020
           to 2060.                                                                                 [2]

           Award [1] for each valid descriptive statement. Needs separate reference to both
           elderly [1] and children [1] for maximum marks.

           Quantification is needed for [2].

           Possibilities include:
           • 65 and over - no change / the proportion increases (actual amount remains 34-36 million
             but the percentage of 65 and over increases)
           • 0 –15 - drops (from 14-16 in 2020 to 7-9 in 2060) / the proportion of the total
             population decreases).

     (b)   Suggest two potential socio-economic problems that could result from the
           projected population trend.                                                            [2+2]

           The trend can be falling population total / a greying population / decreasing
           number of children.

           Allow [1] for a valid problem and [1] for development or exemplification.

           Possibilities include:

           • declining population and the resulting economic implications, such as a reduced work
             force, decreased tax revenue, shortage of qualified workers, declining productivity, high
             labour costs, a smaller tax base
           • declining population and social implications, such as social consequences of immigration
             caused by shortage of workers
           • increased dependency ratio/ageing population - increased expenditure to care
             for an ageing population due to pensions, health care
           • decreasing number of children – may lead to closure of schools,
             unemployment in education sector

           For example: An ageing population [1] would need more money to be spent on pensions [1],
           which would take a larger proportion of a nation’s GDP [1]. as seen in the UK [1].

           For example: A declining population [1] means that there will be a smaller
           workforce [1], which may mean that people are made to stay in work for longer [1].
           In recent years the retirement age in Canada has increased from 65 to 67 [1].

     (c)   Explain two ways in which one named country benefits from a demographic
           dividend.                                                                              [2+2]

           Allow [1] for a valid way and [1] for development or exemplification.

           Possibilities include:
           • Increased proportion of the population in the independent age range –
             provides a larger work force, increase in economic growth, potentially a larger
             market, increase in tax returns
                                          –6–               N20/3/GEOGR/BP2/ENG/TZ0/XX/M


  • Falling fertility rates – more women enter the workforce, boosting gender
    equity, lower proportion of children to support, frees up resources for
    investment in economic development/family welfare

  • Attracts large amounts of foreign investment, the nation becomes more
    important on the global stage.

  • Increase in savings rate – working age is the prime period for saving, working
    population saving for old age

  • Potential reduction in poverty – higher proportion of population working,
    (higher proportion of middle-income earners)

For example: India has one of the youngest populations and this will give an
increase in economic growth [1] due to an increase in the proportion of independent
population that provides a workforce [1].

Award a maximum of [3] if no valid country is identified.
                                                     –7–               N20/3/GEOGR/BP2/ENG/TZ0/XX/M


2.   Global climate – vulnerability and resilience

     (a)   (i)      State the age at which the average US citizen produces the most
                    CO2 emissions.                                                                       [1]

                    65 (accept 64–66)

           (ii)     State the age range in which the most rapid increase in CO2 emissions occurs.        [1]

                    13–23 (accept answers between 12-14 and 22-24)

     (b)   Suggest two health hazards that may result from climate change.                            [2+2]

           In each case, award [1] for identification of a valid health hazard, with a further [1]
           for development.

           Possibilities include:

           •      Health hazards associated with extreme heat – cardiovascular and respiratory diseases.
           •      Health hazards associated with drought – gastroenteritis, salmonella, typhoid.
           •      Health hazards associated with floods – cholera, malaria, drowning.
           •      Health hazards associated with extreme weather such as hurricanes – injury, asphyxiation
                  in a landslide
           •      Health hazards associated with changing (distribution of) climates – northward movement
                  of tropical insects, increase in disease carrying organisms - mosquitoes.
           •      Health hazards that result from changes in agricultural production – undernourishment,
                  leading to diseases such as marasmus and diarrhea.
           •       Mental health issues that are linked to climate change - anxiety, depression and post-
                   traumatic stress disorder linked to extreme weather-related natural disasters, decline in
                   farm outputs can lead to stress
           •      Melting permafrost may release viruses stored in the soil – anthrax in Siberia in 2016.

           For example: Climate change is expected to cause an expansion of the geographic range and
           seasonality of ticks [1], which has led to an increase in Lyme disease and other tick-borne
           diseases in parts of North America and Europe [1].

     (c)   Explain how two methods of geo-engineering could mitigate climate change.                  [2+2]

            In each case, award [1] for identification of a valid method of the deliberate large-scale
            manipulation of an environmental process that affects the Earth's climate, with a further [1]
           for explanation.

           Possibilities include:
           • Large-scale afforestation – removes atmospheric CO2.
           • Carbon dioxide removal by artificial trees.
           • Ocean fertilization – adding nutrients to oceans to encourage growth of CO2-eating
             plankton.
           • Reflective aerosols - inject particles of Sulphur into the atmosphere – act as aerosols and
             reflect sunlight.
           • Space mirrors – these reflect solar radiation so that it does not reach the Earth’s surface.
           • Cloud seeding
           • Albedo modification - increase number of reflective surfaces such as roads, roofs –
             enhances albedo. High albedo crops, micro-bubbling – releasing air bubbles into ocean
             surface to increase albedo, vertical gardens/green buildings at scale above local
                                                  –8–                 N20/3/GEOGR/BP2/ENG/TZ0/XX/M


           For example: CO2 removal from the atmosphere by carbon filtering [1]. Captured
           carbon is then stored in rocks [1].

3.   Global resource consumption and security

     (a)   Describe what is meant by an individual’s ecological footprint.                             [2]

           The approximate area of land and water needed to provide a person with the
           resources needed to live [1] and to absorb their waste [1].

     (b)   Suggest two ways in which meeting a nation’s water needs could result in
           reduced food availability.                                                                [2+2]

           In each case, award [1] for a valid way a nation’s water needs are met and [1] for
           its impact on reducing food availability.

           Possibilities of valid ways include:
           • over extraction of groundwater for crop production (food or non-
              food)/industry/urban demands
           • reservoirs built to provide water for urban areas/cash crop production, reservoirs built in
             one country use water that another country needs for agriculture
           • one country’s water imports leave another country with less water, imports of water cost
             money – less to invest in agriculture
           • water used by tourism.

           Possibilities of reduction of food availability include:
           • decreasing the supply of water to agricultural areas/farms
           • taking over agricultural land
           • impacts upon the quality of water used in agriculture

           For example: Over-extraction for cash crops [1] leads to insufficient water left to
           grow food crops [1].


     (c)   Explain how a circular economy approach can contribute to:

           (i)   reduced use of new resources;                                                         [2]

           Award [1] for a valid way of reducing new resources and [1] for development.

           Possibilities include:
           • recycling of materials means that less raw material is required, reference to
              inputs and outputs using systems approach
           • reuse/refurbishment of goods decreases the demand for new goods and
              therefore raw materials
           • industrial symbiosis – turning one industry’s by-product into another’s raw
              materials
           • design/consume products that are built to last/durable
           • resource efficiency by reducing the quantity of materials needed to produce a
              good – rraw materials/energy/water – asset sharing, reduced storage of
              perishable material, use of technology
           • incentivizing use of recycled/reused materials – taxes on products that use only
              virgin raw materials eg plastic packaging
                                      –9–                N20/3/GEOGR/BP2/ENG/TZ0/XX/M


       For example: Products are produced in such a way that they have a “life after
       death” [1], as parts will have further use later [1], decreases need for raw
       materials.

(ii)   changing attitudes to product ownership.                                         [2]

       Award [1] for a valid change and [1] for development.

Possibilities include:
• changes in consumer behaviour – fast fashion, food waste, single use plastic
   bags
• consume less – owning fewer consumer goods means less production is
   required
• accepting the purchase of pre-owned goods – using pre-owned clothes cuts
   down on raw materials/energy needed for clothes
• purchase of goods that are built to last – prolongs the life of goods so renewal is
   reduced
• consumption of goods that are produced in more sustainable ways
• product renting/lease/pooling – avoid purchasing for individuals altogether – shift
   to sharing platforms – decrease in consumption of CDs and DVDs and use of
   online entertainment.

       For example: People rent goods as opposed to buying them [1], which means
       that they are less likely to be “designed for the dump” [1].

                                              Section B
4.   (a)   Describe trends in the proportion of fuel directly imported into Australia between
           2000 and 2013.                                                                       [2]

           Award [1] for each trend. Two trends required for [2]. Quantification needed for
           [2].

           •   Increasing overall.
           •   Slow increase between 2000 and 2004.
           •   More rapid increase between 2007 and 2013.
           •   Fluctuating.

     (b)   Suggest one graphical method that could depict the information in box A, giving a
           reason for your choice.                                                              [2]

           Award [1] for a valid suggestion and [1] for reason for choice.

           Possibilities include:
           • Bar graph – easily constructed/analysed, contains categorized data.
           • Proportional shapes – easy visual analysis.
           • Pie charts – easy to identify relative proportions.

(c)   To what extent might this infographic make Australian citizens more concerned
      about their energy security than they need to be?                                            [6]

      Award [1] mark for each relevant point and [1] for each supported
      development/explanation, up to a maximum of [5]. Award the final [1] for an
      overall appraisal that weighs up the infographic as a whole.

      Award a maximum of [4] if only one perspective is given.

      Relevant points include:

      More concerned:
      • Fuel supply could run out in weeks
      • Conflict in the Middle East and impacts on financial stability – costs of fuel increase.
      • Piracy and impacts on shipping lanes.
      • Reliance on Singapore.
      • Increasing reliance on imports of fuel.
      • Closure of refineries decreases ability to process raw fuels.
      • Infographic does not emphasize renewable energy possibilities.
      • Negative language – dramatic nature of the title, boxes introduced as risks
      • Infographic supplied by a reliable source

      Not concerned:
      • Australia has abundant renewable and non-renewable energy resources
      • Australia is the world’s 9th largest energy producer
      • Many of the risks are predictions rather than actual issues
      • Introduction of non-oil based alternative fuels, electric cars

      Appraisal – accept any valid appraisal linked to supporting materials from the
      infographic
      • Overall tone is pessimistic rather than optimistic.
      • Infographic gives feeling of vulnerability
      • Infographic provides a series of possible solutions.

5.   “The growth of the global middle class will inevitably accelerate climate change.” To what
     extent do you agree with this statement?                                                        [10]

     Marks should be allocated according to the markbands on pages 3–4.

     Possible applied themes (AO2) demonstrating knowledge and understanding
     (AO1):
     • Reponses could show some understanding of the main anthropogenic causes of climate
        change. The enhanced greenhouse effect should be explored, with a focus on an increase in
        GHGs is the atmosphere – such as CO2, CH4. Sources of these emissions vary over time and
        space but there is a definite link between a region’s/individual’s emissions and their level of
        socio-economic development. Per capita global emissions are much higher in high-income
        regions, as they are linked to development, trade and globalization.
     • As low- to middle-income countries develop over time, there is an increase in the standard of
        living of many millions of their inhabitants. This emerging middle class, given the present model
        of development, will increase their ecological footprint as consumption and waste generation
        increases. For example, as disposable income has increased in China over the past 30 years,
        diets have changed to include more meat. Animal agriculture is a major contributor of
        greenhouse gasses like methane, and many carbon sinks – such as rainforests – are being
        cleared to accommodate more grazing land or land for growing cattle feed.
     • As this global middle class grows, so does their consumption of fossil fuels, as there is an
        increase in electricity consumption and car ownership and a demand for foreign goods, which
        increases global trade – all activities which rely on the use of traditional fossil fuels in many
        nations.
     • It could be noted that the per capita emissions of individuals in high-income nations are still
        much higher and have been so for a long time.
     • Alternatively, responses may disagree with the statement and argue that, as a new middle class
        grows, there are opportunities to learn from the mistakes of the past and to develop using
        greener technologies, thus keeping ecological footprints to more sustainable levels than those
        of the “Economic North”.
      • Responses could argue that it is already too late and that we have reached a tipping
        point where feedback loops are already at play, causing irreversible climate change.

     Good answers may be well structured (AO4) and may additionally offer a critical
     evaluation (AO3) that focuses on the relative role of the growing middle class on
     speeding up climate change. Responses may address the spatial aspect of middle-
     class growth and the varying impacts upon climate change.

6.   “Resource insecurity is becoming the main cause of forced migration.” To what extent do
     you agree with this statement?                                                                  [10]

     Marks should be allocated according to the markbands on pages 3–4.

     Possible applied themes (AO2) demonstrating knowledge and understanding
     (AO1):
     • Resource insecurity that could result in forced migration could be related to food – famine; water
       – or drought/contamination/disease. For example, Somalis moving to Kenya as a result of
       ongoing drought and famine.
     • Population growth many be seen as the underlying cause of resource insecurity, especially in
       Sub-Saharan Africa.
     • Alternatively there are many other causes of forced migration, both political (war/minority
       persecution), social (intolerance eg, LGBTQI+/crime/religion), economic (lack of employment
       opportunities) and environmental (sea level changes).
     • Many of the factors listed above do not work in isolation and have close causal links – many
       wars are the result of access to resources eg, Somalia, Sudan.
     • Responses may argue that the underlying cause of all significant forced migrations
        is climate change, which increases the likelihood of resource insecurity.

     Good answers may be well structured (AO4) and may additionally offer a critical
     evaluation (AO3) that focuses on the changing role of resource insecurity as a catalyst
     of forced migrations over time. Responses may address the spatial aspect of forced
     migration and the role of resource insecurity in different parts of the world.

     For 5–6 marks
     Expect a weakly evidenced outlining of resource insecurity as a cause of forced migration

     For 7–8 marks
