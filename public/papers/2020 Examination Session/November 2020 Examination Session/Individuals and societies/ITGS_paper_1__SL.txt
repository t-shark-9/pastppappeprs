Answer two questions. Each question is worth [20 marks].

1.   E-voting

     A number of countries, such as India, have introduced e-voting systems. Citizens can vote by
     going to a specified location, such as a school, or they can vote from home using a computer.
     Each voter is provided with a unique identifier, such as IND55454, that they must enter into
     the system when they vote.

     These e-voting systems usually consist of a user interface, such as the one in Figure 1,
     linked to a relational database (see Figure 2).

           (iii)   Identify the data type that would be used in the Gender field in Figure 2.[1]

           (iv)    State the relationship between the Candidate table and the Votes table.             [1]

           (v)     Outline why a drop-down list would be used for the Party field in the
                   Candidate table.                                                                    [2]

     (b)   A number of individuals and groups were consulted during the design of the e-voting
           system to enable designers to create an intuitive interface for it.

           Analyse questionnaires and interviews as methods of data collection to gather this
           information from these individuals and groups.                                              [6]

     (c)   Some states are planning to return to a paper-based voting system, where voters put
           a cross (X) in the column next to the party of their choice.

           Discuss whether these states should retain e-voting or return to a paper-based voting
           system.[8]

2.   BYOD at Xingu Academy

     Some students at Xingu Academy have been allowed to “bring your own device (BYOD)”
     into school so they can use assistive technologies, such as speech-to-text, to support
     their learning (see Figure 3). Mayu Jimenez, the Head of Learning and Teaching, has
     seen the benefits for these students. A number of other teachers believe there will be
     benefits if the school becomes a BYOD school. However, before a decision can be made,
     Alejandro Glandolla, the Head of IT, has been asked to investigate whether the school would
     be able to cope with the demands of the increased number of devices.

                                   Figure 3: Assistive technologies




     (a)   (i)	Identify two pieces of information that would be used to identify a device on the
                IT network.                                                                           [2]

           (ii)   Identify the steps used by speech-to-text software.                                 [4]

     (b)   Digital citizenship is included in Xingu Academy’s IT acceptable-use policy.

           Explain why it is important that students at Xingu Academy are both competent users of
           digital technologies and good digital citizens.                                            [6]

     (c)   Discuss whether Xingu Academy should become a bring-your-own-device (BYOD)
           school.[8]




                                                                                              Turn over

3.   Clouds under the sea

     Microsoft has located one of its data centres on the seabed. Project Natick is now operating
     100 feet below the surface of the North Sea (see Figure 4).

                   Figure 4: An artist’s representation of a data centre on the sea bed




     Microsoft has chosen to develop data centres on the seabed because concerns have been
     raised about the impact of data centres built on land. These seabed data centres can be
     constructed and placed on the sea bed in 90 days. This is compared to the two years that are
     required for land-based data centres.

     The demand for data storage is doubling every two years, so it is likely that an increasing
     number of data centres will need to be constructed under the sea as cloud computing
     continues to grow. Google patented their design for an underwater data centre in 2009 but,
     although functioning prototypes have been trialled, none have been used commercially.

     (a)   (i)     Identify two characteristics of cloud computing.                                     [2]

           (ii)    Servers used in cloud computing hold considerable amounts of data.

                   Identify two forms of backup that could be used for the data on these servers.       [2]

           (iii)   A user is downloading a ZIP (zipped file) from cloud storage.

                   The ZIP file is 0.6 GB in size and the download rate is 8 mb/s.

                   Calculate the total time it will take to download the ZIP file.

                   Note: 1 GB = 1000 MB.                                                                [2]

(Question 3 continued)

     (b)   (i)     Compression software can be used to speed up the upload and download of files.

                   The ZIP file recently downloaded from the cloud-based server contained a
                   number of images and videos.

                   Explain why lossy compression techniques would be used for the images that
                   have been downloaded from cloud storage.                                            [2]

           (ii)    Explain why lossless compression techniques would be used for the videos that
                   have been downloaded from cloud storage.                                            [2]

           (iii)   Cloud storage providers are responsible for protecting the privacy and anonymity
                   of the individuals whose data is held on their servers.

                   Distinguish between privacy and anonymity.                                          [2]

     (c)   Evaluate Microsoft’s decision to build data centres on the seabed.                          [8]




                                                                                               Turn over

4.   The role of portable digital devices in health

     Jaime is an athlete and uses his sports watch to monitor his training sessions. He also
     uses it to keep a record of his health and well-being. The sports watch can monitor Jaime’s
     vital signs. It is also global positioning systems (GPS) enabled, so it can track his location
     (see Figure 5).

     The information that is recorded by Jaime’s sports watch is synchronized with a mobile
     application (app) installed on his cell/mobile phone.

     (a)   (i)    Identify two vital signs that can be recorded by Jaime’s sport watch.                  [2]

           (ii)   Describe the steps that the GPS receiver in Jaime’s sport watch uses to show the
                  routes of his training runs.                                                           [4]

     (b)   Jaime has decided to share his personal health information with researchers at the
           University of Sierra Nevada (USN).

           Analyse Jaime’s decision to share his personal health information with the University of
           Sierra Nevada (USN).                                                                          [6]

     (c)   The development of mobile health apps has changed the way citizens manage their
           own health and wellbeing.

           Discuss whether citizens such as Jaime should rely only on the advice of a health app
           to manage their own health and wellbeing.                                                     [8]
