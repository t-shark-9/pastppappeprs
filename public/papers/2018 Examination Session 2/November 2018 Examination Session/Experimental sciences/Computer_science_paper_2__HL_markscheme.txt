Option A — Databases

1.   (a)   Award up to [3 max].
           Award [1] for a definition of an information system, [1] for a definition of a
           database and [1] for the relationship between the two.
           An information system is the collection of software, hardware, networking
           infrastructure, human resources and databases that provide the storage,
           processing and communication/distribution of information;
           A database is an organized collection of data (organized so that its contents can
           easily be accessed, processed, and updated);
           A database is a subset of the information system;                                      [3]

     (b)   Award up to [8 max].
           Award up to [2 max] for each of the four properties,
           Award [1] for an explanation of the property and [1] in relation to the money
           transfer transaction.

           Example answers:

           Atomicity:
           Ensures that either all changes to data are performed as if they are a single
           operation or none of them are performed;
           In moving money from one account to another, it ensures that if a debit is made
           successfully from one account then the corresponding credit is made to the other
           account;

           Consistency:
           Ensures that data is in a consistent state when a transaction begins and when it
           ends / ensures that only valid data is written in the database;
           In transferring money from one account to another, it ensures that the total value
           of money in both the accounts is the same at the beginning and at the end of
           each transaction;

           Isolation:
           Ensures that intermediate state of a transaction is invisible to other transactions;
           In moving money from one account to another the isolation property ensures that
           another transaction might see one account or the other but cannot see both
           accounts;

           Durability:
           Ensures that after a transaction successfully completes, changes to data persist
           and are not undone even in the event of a system failure;
           In moving money from one account to another durability property ensures that the
           changes made to each account are permanent;                                            [8]
                                            –4–                N18/4/COMSC/HP2/ENG/TZ0/XX/M


(c)   Award up to [6 max].
      Award [1] for identifying an advantage of these databases being open to
      interrogation and an additional [1] for each development of that advantage up to
      [3 max].
      Award [1] for identifying a disadvantage of these databases being open to
      interrogation and an additional [1] for each development of that disadvantage up
      to [3 max].
      Award [1] for a valid conclusion.
      If there is no conclusion, award [5 max].

      Advantages:
      Sharing the information may enable it to be made accessible to organizations
      such as the Police or the Government that may not have access to it;
      This means that it could be used to detect fraudulent financial activities;
      Leading to reduced insurance or health insurance premiums as monies are not
      lost from the system that create artificially high premiums;

      Disadvantages:
      Misuse of information / security issues;
      Information from this database may enable the account details of the clients to be
      shared with third parties;
      Who may use this information to take money from their accounts;

      Conclusion:
      Although the information may be shared, the overall benefits from a reduction in
      fraudulent crime or inflated insurance premiums is greater than the potential for
      this information to get into the wrong hands;                                        [6]

           Award [1] for each identifying the role of Data Definition Language (DDL) and [1]
           for an expansion or explains how it may be used up to [2 max].
           The Data Definition Language (DDL) are commands which define the different
           structures/objects in a database;
           Database administrators use these commands during the setup and/or removal
           of a database and database objects (such as tables, indexes, and users);            [2]

                   WHERE NOT (Prod_Price <4.00 OR Prod_Price >10) AND
                   Supp_Name == 'Veggy Co.'

                   Example answer 3:
                   SELECT Prod_Name FROM Greengrocer
                   WHERE NOT (Prod_Price <4 OR Prod_Price >10 OR Supp_Name !=

           For example,
           Items P118, P122 and P220 have the same supplier (Veggy Co)
           Items P219, P111, P121 and P211 have the same supplier (Fruit and Veggie)

           Note: Accept any correct example from the table given, such is the following:

            Prod_ID Prod_Name Prod_Price                 Supp_Name            Supp_Contact Supp_Phone

                 P211      Apples          5.00       Fruit and Veggie         Ines Bond    542 9800

(c)     (i)     Award up to [2 max].
                Award [1] for explaining a problem that may arise (such as inconsistency,
                inaccuracy / unnecessary additional/repeated work needed when updating).
                Award [1] for including example with reference to the relation given.

                Example answer:
                When inserting a tuple supplied by the existing supplier, for example,
                inserting:

                   P189        Potatoes        9.90      Veggy Co.      234 7654        Mia Abiss

                All data about supplier should be accurately entered;
                And consistent with the data about this supplier in all other tuples;                 [2]

        (ii)    Award up to [2 max].
                Award [1] for explaining a problem that may arise (such as inconsistency,
                inaccuracy).
                Award [1] for including example with reference to the relation given.

                Example answer:
                Deleting a tuple could remove data which is not intended to be lost;
                For example; deleting the following tuple.

                   P265       Tomatoes         7.45      New Fruits     John Smith        677 7895

                Which is the only tuple in the relation which holds data about New Fruits
                suppliers (all data about this supplier will be lost);                                [2]

        (iii)   Award up to [2 max].
                Award [1] for explaining a problem that may arise (such as inconsistency,
                inaccuracy/unnecessary additional/repeated work needed when updating.
                Award [1] for including example with reference to the relation given.

                Example answer:
                Modifying/changing the phone number for Fruit and Veggie. would require
                that each and every tuple containing item supplied by Fruit and Veggie
                should be modified (unnecessary work);

 Prod_ID        Prod_Name        Prod_Price       Supp_Name           Supp_Contact       Supp_Phone

      P211         Apples           5.00        Fruit and Veggie       Ines Bond           542 9800

      P121         Onions           3.00        Fruit and Veggie       Ines Bond           542 9800
                                              –8–                 N18/4/COMSC/HP2/ENG/TZ0/XX/M


             Otherwise the data in the relation would be inaccurate (for example, would
             contain different/incorrect phone numbers for the same supplier);

 Prod_ID       Prod_Name       Prod_Price       Supp_Name         Supp_Contact      Supp_Phone

      P211       Apples              5.00     Fruit and Veggie      Ines Bond        542 9800

      P121       Onions              3.00     Fruit and Veggie      Ines Bond        542 1811
                                                                                                 [2]

(d)    Award up to [8 max].
       Award [1] for explaining/clearly showing each of the steps.
       Award [1] for identifying two entities (Product and Supplier) in Greengrocer.
       Award [1] for choosing/identifying a primary key in relation Supplier.
       Award [1] for clearly showing that the relation must be in 1NF and then could be
       put to 2NF.
       Award [1] for showing that each tuple in 2NF has a primary key.
       Award [1] for showing that in 2NF all attributes are on the whole dependent of the
       primary key.
       Award [1] for introducing new relations or using a foreign key.
       Award [1] for showing that the relation must be in 2NF and then could be put to
       3NF.
       Award [1] stating that there are no transitive dependencies in 3NF.

       Note: Because there is significant inconsistency in textbooks’ accounts of
       precisely what constitutes 1NF and 2NF, award marks depending on the
       explanation. Please see the two different example answers.

       Example answer 1:
       Given relation
       Greengrocer(Prod_ID, Prod_Name, Prod_Price, Supp_Name, Supp_Phone,
       Supp_Contact)

       There are two entities in this relation (Product and Supplier).

       Product(Prod_ID, Prod_Name, Prod_Price)
       Supplier(Supp_ID, Supp_Name, Supp_Phone, Supp_Contact)

       Primary key (Supp_ID) in relation Supplier is added to make sure that it is unique
       because it might be that two suppliers have the same name.

       Product(Prod_ID, Prod_Name, Prod_Price, Supp_ID)
       Supplier(Supp_ID, Supp_Name, Supp_Phone, Supp_Contact)

       To construct to 2NF relation must be in 1NF;
       Each tuple in 2NF must have a primary key;
       And all attributes in the 2NF must be dependent on the whole of the primary key.

       New relation is introduced.

       Product(Prod_ID, Prod_Name, Prod_Price)
       Supplier(Supp_ID,Supp_Name,Supp_Phone,Supp_Contact)
       ProdSupp(Prod_ID, Supp_ID)
                                     –9–                N18/4/COMSC/HP2/ENG/TZ0/XX/M


There are two different contacts with the same name (Mia Abiss) at the two
different companies.
Assuming that each contact has a unique phone number, a new relation could be
introduced in which Supp_Phone is a key.

Supplier(Supp_ID, Supp_Name)
SupplierContact(Supp_Phone, Supp_Contact)
Product(Prod_ID, Prod_Name, Prod_Price)
ProdSupp (Prod_ID, Supp_ID)

The relation is in the 2NF and there are no attributes which are not dependent on
the key.
There are no transitive dependences so it is in the 3NF.

Example answer 2:
The table is already in 1NF because all values are atomic. There are no “fake”
attributes/columns, like Supp_Phone1, Supp_Phone2;
So there are no repeating groups, either obvious or created by repeating columns
for what is really the same attribute;
To be in 2NF, in addition to being in 1NF;
Every non-prime attribute must be dependent on the whole of every key;
To be in 3NF, in addition to being in 2NF;
All the attributes in a relation must be determined only by the key(s);
And there should not be any transitive dependences;

There are two entities (Supplier and Product);
Supp_ID should be introduced;

Supplier(Supp_ID, Supp_Name, Supp_Phone, Supp_Contact)
Product(Prod_ID, Prod_Name, Prod_Price, Supp_ID*)

Where underlining marks primary key(s) and *foreign key(s);

There are two different contacts with the same name(Mia Abiss)at the two
different companies.

A new relation introduced in which Supp_Phone is a key;

SupplierContact(Supp_Phone, Supp_Contact, Supp_ID*)
Supplier(Supp_ID, Supp_Name)
Product(Prod_ID, Prod_Name, Prod_Price, Supp_ID*)                                   [8]

           Database is based on operational processing;
           Whilst data warehouse is based on informational processing;

           The operations on databases consist of transactions;
           Whilst operations on data warehouse consist of queries;

           Database is used for everyday transactions;
           Whilst data warehouse is used for decision support;

           Database mainly stores current data;
           Whilst data warehouse stores historical data;

           Data in the database is always up to date/accurate;
           Whilst the data in data warehouse is maintained over time;

           Data in the database is simple/primitive/detailed;
           Whilst data warehouse holds summarized/consolidated data;

           The type of access to data in database is read/write;
           Whilst mostly read only access for the data stored in data warehouse;

           Database size is smaller (for example in up to 10 GB);
           Than the size of data warehouse (for example 100 GB to TB);

           View of data in database is flat/relational;
           Whilst the view of data in data warehouse is multidimensional;

           Users (end-users) of the database are common users (for example customers,
           tourists, clerks, etc);
           Whilst end-users of data warehouse are knowledge users (for example, analysts,
           managers, executives);

           The number of database users is greater;
           Whilst the data in data warehouse is used by smaller number of people;             [4]

      Transfer data into data warehouse/ data mart/operational data store so it can be
      used for the mining processes within the data warehouse;                             [3]

(d)   Award up to [2 max].
      Award [1] for each identifying an ethical problem that may result from data mining
      and [1] for an expansion up to [2 max].

      Data mining raises privacy concerns when people are traced;
      Their actions are analyzed without their knowledge;

      Data mining creates people/tourist/customer files with a tendency of judging and
      treating people on the basis of group characteristics;
      Instead of on their own individual characteristics;

      Data mining can provide information that could be used unethically;
      For example, increasing profits by selling this information to others / or by
      targeting return tourists with information obtained on their previous visits;        [2]

(e)   Award up to [4 max].
      Award [2 max] for evidence that candidates understand how cluster analysis is
      used and [2 max] for an explanation related to tourism products/services.

      Cluster analysis:
      Subdivide tourists into distinct subsets;
      Where any subset may be selected as a market target;

      Explanation related to tourism products/services:
      Subsets could be “young tourists with limited budget”;
      For this subset music festivals, sport could be advertised to ensure the hotel can
      maximize its revenue;

      Subset of tourists traveling with young children;
      Children activities / sports / games available / “kids hotels” could be advertised to
      ensure the hotel can maximize its revenue;

      Subset of older tourists influenced by cost–value considerations and/or secure/or
      quiet environment;
      So these hotels can be configured to specifically meet their needs and promoted
      only to these tourists such as advertise “stay 7 days and pay only 6 days” /
      advertise hotel located in the quiet place/secure place / at some distance from
      the center;                                                                             [4]

(f)   Award up to [3 max].
      Award [1] for each identifying the importance of link analysis in exploring patterns
      in data mining and [1] for each subsequent expansion up to [3 max].

      Link analysis technique is used to analyse connections/links between small
      instances of relational databases / only on required datasets of database/;
      (But) it can also be applied on large number of databases to show the
      relationships between these databases;
      Link analysis is important because it discovers new relations in relational
      databases / new patterns of interest / checks the similarity between the datasets /
      finds anomalies where old/known patterns are violated;                                  [3]

6.   (a)   The model is a static description of some rules;
           In this case a list of appliances and their water consumption (min or max);
           Whereas the simulation is the use of that model;
           With input from real parameters (such as those that families may input);           [4]

     (b)   Award up to [4 max].
           There may be missing data:
           For example, watering plants (allow any suitable example);
           The consequences, eg the totals will be underestimated;
           The data may be inaccurate;
           For example, the shower times may exceed the stated;
           The consequence, eg the results of the simulation may not be valid;                [4]

     (c)   The answer shows the use of columns and rows;
           The data from part (b) is included together with the addition of a TimesPerWeek

           Individual and individualistic use:
           They don’t know each other, and they do their laundry separately, not full load;
           They don’t cook together and consume more water consequently;
           Somebody washes the car every week without telling the others;

           Special occasions:
           Some of them may be athletes and need to wash the sport gear separately;
           Somebody invites friends over night/for dinner and the water consumption
           increases;

           Technical reasons:
           There are water leaks in the house and they are not aware about them;
           The counter was manipulated by the landlord years ago;                             [2]

           Award [1 max] for identifying an advantage and [1 max] for an expansion.
           Award [1 max] for identifying a disadvantage and [1 max] for an expansion.

           Advantages (requires an expansion):
           They may see a complex situation numerous times / gain confidence in using the
           surgical tools;
           Without putting patients at risk / or keep practicing until they feel confident that
           they will be able to get it right in reality;

           Disadvantages (requires an expansion):
           They don’t have real-life experience;
           Therefore, we don’t know whether they will faint at the sight of blood;

           They may be trained just on the software (a unique body shape);
           But body shapes are different and students might find themselves at odds;

           They do not get an idea of how hectic the theatre can be/space
           available/interferences among people;
           And this training alone will be useless;                                               [4]

     (b)   Award up to [3 max].
           It needs sensors to assess the pressure of the hand on the instrument;
           Its positioning with respect to the touchscreen needs to be tracked
           (for example by an external camera);
           Its inclination with respect to the touchscreen needs to be tracked;
           The change of tools held should be quickly reflected in the image that is
           displayed (affects communication);
           The specific tool needs to be recognized;                                              [3]

     (c)   The representation of (abstract) data;

           Award [1 max] for identifying an advantage of the use of 3D and [1 max] for an
           expansion up to [3 max] for discussing the advantages of the use of 3D;
           Award [1 max] for identifying a disadvantage of the use of 3D and [1 max] for an
           expansion up to [3 max] for discussing the advantages of the use of 3D;
           Award [1 max] for a considered conclusion;

           Note to examiners: To achieve [6] a conclusion must be provided.
           If there is no conclusion the maximum mark is 5.

           A 3D simulation will be more realistic;
           As depth can be shown;
           Patient’s body can be rotated; // allow up to [2] for example;

           But, a 3D simulation takes more time to render / more calculations have to be
           made;
           So, may not be displayed in real time;
           It is more demanding on memory / may exceed available memory;

           For an application, as serious as medical training, adequate hardware and
           software should be made available so that 3D simulations can be carried out;           [6]

8.   (a)   The initial population set is chosen randomly/pseudo randomly;
           A fitness function is applied to each population;
           The fittest members are selected for the next stage;
           Genetic operators are applied;

           An acceptable level of fitness is found / a plateau is reached / a maximum
           number of iterations has been reached;                                              [6]

     (b)   (i)    Network networks initially have a randomly chosen set of weights;
                  Which will not solve any problem;
                  These weights must be altered;
                  Until they fulfil their objective;                                           [4]

           (ii)   Award up to [6 max].
                  Award [3 max] for considerations linked to each of the two forms of
                  learning.
                  With supervized learning the processing of the image is guided
                  (supervised) by the output dataset to the purpose of classifying certain
                  features of the image;
                  For example, to the value of the pixel (grey or colour) one can assign
                  likelihood of belonging to neighbouring values of greys/colours;
                  And this can be defined in advance as a way to represent a potential value
                  for an infected tree;

                  However, with unsupervised learning the processing of the image is not
                  guided in any way / the output is not known;
                  And the purpose is to discover and build clusters that have common
                  characteristics;
                  Therefore, this may clearly help in building up the main regions, but not
                  specifically on focussing on the infected trees;                             [6]

     (c)   Award up to [4 max].
           Questions/requests must be short so repetition is not required / so they are
           immediately understood;
           And chosen so that there is a restricted response set;
           That can be recognised by the system / that can be stored by the system;
           The requests must lead to a satisfactory end;
           Or customers will get frustrated / hang up / the company will lose business etc;    [4]

           To better control access to their servers;
           Because it could be cause of bottleneck on the server / to reduce/minimize risks
           of DDoS;

           To better manage the UI;
           So that the offer of podcasts is well visible also from small devices;

           To have a smaller system that is easier to maintain;
           That can be maintained more effectively also remotely by one person;                  [2]

     (c)   Award up to [1 max].
           (accept for general sound format:) MP3, FLAC, WAV, WMA;                               [1]

     (d)   Award up to [5 max]:
           Award up to [4 max] for comparing lossless and lossy.
           Award [1] for a conclusion with reference to the scenario.

           In terms of audio quality for spoken language there is not much difference in
           using lossy or lossless compression/ lossless compression does not really bring
           benefit to the spoken audio;

           A minor benefit could be in using lossy compression in relation to transmission
           while downloading (and also in streaming);

           And it is relevant, in general, in a situation with low bandwidth;

           However, these files are small in size anyway, because their duration is limited to
           10 minutes;

           And this suggests that for the specific nature and size of the files (spoken and 10
           minutes duration) lossy might be slightly preferable for some users for
           downloading without compromising on quality of audio.                                 [5]

      expansion/example up to [2 max].

      Too many people are using their own Internet access point at home
      simultaneously;
      Possibly on different devices, including tablets, smartphones on WiFi;

      There is low bandwidth because it is peak time;
      Possibly too many people are downloading simultaneously;

      Old router/modem/computer / outdated software may slow performance;
      Computer that is not protected by antivirus may have performance affected by
      malware;
      Performance;

      There are too many applications running simultaneously on the computer;
      So, memory is insufficient and one should close some applications;                   [2]

      To present them in a way that takes into account the previous uses from the user;
      By monitoring their preferences, over time;

      Tracking a person’s preferences
      For example, counting the clicks and themes to extract regularities / support data
      analytics;
      That can be identified for example by the IP of their device when this is not
      anonymised;

            Award [1] for step that the Domain Name System (DNS) server will take in order
            to locate the correct IP address for this request from the browser up to [4 max].

            The DNS server configured to the browser’s computer / the ISP (Internet Service
            Provider) checks through its own database to see if the (domain) name is there;
            If it is, it will return the corresponding IP address to the browser;
            If it isn’t the request is passed onto the next DNS server (in the hierarchy);
            This continues until the (domain) name is found;
            Or the top level / authoritative DNS server if reached;
            When IP address is found, it is sent back to the original DNS server;                    [4]

            retrieve all fields of the record;
            Award [1] to instantiate a variable $userRecord.

            The shopping basket is modelled centred on the “session”;
            A global array $_SESSION exists, holding a session identifier associated with any
            user;
            And a new sessionUserID is added to the array and instantiated by a unique

11.   (a)   Award up to [2 max].
            Award [1] for describing the challenge resulting from some limitation and [1]
            expansion, possibly with example up to [2 max].
            Old computers impose memory and processing constraints;
            It is likely that they cannot make sophisticated web pages;
            For example, they may need to reduce the number of interactions/transmissions;
            By deciding not to have dynamic web pages;
            To the purpose of not generating loss of processing power on their side;

            The software might not be up-to-date/the OS is old;
            This poses a threat for viruses or deliberate attacks (attack the weakest nodes);
            To the point that not even the charities will link to their website, rather just listing
            the name of the association;
            To limit the risk of propagating malware;                                                  [2]

      (b)   Award up to [4 max].
            Award [1] for each reason how the use of cloud-based services may help Harvest
            to overcome the limitations of the available technologies up to
            [4 max].
            They can host the website on the cloud;
            Enabling a sophisticated site to be created / bypassing their own limitations;
            The cloud could store all of their data;
            As they will have limited storage on their own equipment;                                  [4]

            Mark as [2] and [2].
            The costs are likely to be high;
            And Harvest is clearly a company with limited funds;

            The cloud company will be bound by rules and regulations in the country in which
            it is registered;
            These may cause conflicts with regard to the type of information that Harvest
            deals with;                                                                                [4]

      Award [1] for identifying a disadvantage of using black hat techniques and an
      additional [1] for each development of that disadvantage up to [2 max].

      Award [1] for a valid conclusion.

      Advantages:
      The use of black hat techniques + an example (eg hidden links, or reciprocal
      links, keyword stuffing, hidden content, content theft, etc);
      May temporarily improve its ranking;

      Disadvantages:
      However, this is unethical;
      This may not sit well with its image as a charity;

      Conclusion:
      Search engines will eventually discover that these techniques are being used;
      This may lead to the site being banned;                                          [5]

12.   (a)   Award up to [4 max].
            Award [2 max] for a general knowledge and understanding of multimedia web.
            Award [2 max] for describing a situation where the multimedia web may be
            beneficial to using a text based search.

            Knowledge of multimedia web
            The multimedia web makes an expanded use of the semantic web (formally and
            semantically interlinked data of any kind) making possible to provide input in a
            form other than text, and possibly return output in various forms;
            Therefore, the search is made at the level of “concepts” and not just textual
            terms;
            In a way that the computer can retrieve semantical links among different
            concepts/concepts presented in different formats;
            That includes the ability for crawlers to go through scientific classifications of
            text/captions/description of images;
            That can all be indexed and clustered into a common “concept”;

            Example 1:
            To detect/discover/verify/monitor the presence of species based on sound
            For example:
            We might aim in recognising and searching on the web starting from the sound of
            some nocturnal animal that we don’t see/we don’t know, but whose presence is
            revealed by their eyes;
            Giving the sound as input would allow to perform a search based on
            registration/audio that would run on multimedia sources linked with semantical
            links;

            Example 2:
            To detect/discover/verify/monitor the presence of species based on images
            For example:
            We might start a multimedia search based on images/photos of nocturnal animals
            we may have taken;
            To see whether those sightings were associated to dangerous species or not;
            To signal the presence of some unusual species in the region;
            To signal the presence of some animal in difficulty to the protection agency;        [4]

      (b)   Award up to [3 max].

(c)   Award up to [6 max].
      Award [2 max] for a superficial response that uses generic terminology.
      Award [4 max] for a response that shows some analytical comments,
      unsubstantiated conclusions and some use of appropriate terminology.
      Award [6 max] for a coherent analysis leading to substantiated conclusions with
      the appropriate use of subject specific terminology.
      General, possibly described through examples
      The ontology of the semantics web is extracted with expert means from
      documents;
      (For example, by making features analysis / aggregating concepts /
      eliminating disambiguation;)

      Whereas, the folksonomy is the result of adding different vocabulary (done by the
      users) via tags in posts/web pages/social web (like Tumblr);
      (For example, tagging the photo of a cat under an informal “cat’s eye” would add
      a different perspective to the ontology);

      The problem:
      If not monitored, tagging may be source of “garbage” and hinder the research for
      the ontology;
      The ambiguity problem of tagging needs to be addressed so to extract a weight
      to ambiguous use of tags;

      Possible countermeasures:
      Expand the query within social tagging platforms;
      In order to extract a weight to ambiguous use of tags and use this weight to cut-
      out some irrelevant retrieved information;

      OR
      Use the folksonomy tags (at least some) to update (possibly as metadata) the
      ontology vocabulary;
      However, depending on the context, this may not always be feasible/applicable
      and depends on the domain of discourse;

      OR
      Re-engineer the ontology to include a collaborative form of construction from
      tagging;
      However, this is method is not applicable in expert fields where quality of content
      must be preserved;

      OR
      Keep the ontology and folksonomy well separated, but let them work in tandem;
      In a way to have feedback from folksonomies, but merged in a controlled way;          [6]

(d)   Award up to [4 max].
      Award [1] for each comment that indicates the role that web crawlers perform in
      developing an index that is used by a search engine up to [4 max].
      A web crawler is given a “seed” page which is where it starts;
      It searches for hyperlinks;
      Which it recursively follows;
      Making a copy of each web page visited;
      Which can be indexed by the search engine;                                            [4]

(e)   Award up to [3 max].
      Award [1] some example to fix the scenario of open source;
      Award [1] what is meant by collective intelligence;
      Award [1] some explanation/expansion to link the concepts;

      The focus:
      “Software for Public Interest”;

      Open source and free software development is the result of initiatives taken by
      sparse communities of programmers that collaborate effectively to maintain
      complex programs/packages of code;

      (For example, Debian Foundation, Linux Foundation, Mozilla Foundation, Apache
      Foundation, Free Software Foundation, Wikipedia…;)

      The structure:
      A distributed system of development AND tightly governed /
      Each developer codes individually, but the whole project relies on the fact that
      portions of code may be integrated as components of other parts;

      Organisations may have different modes of governance, and have precise ways
      (processes) to contribute to a project, both technical and social;

      The objective is to guarantee coordination, quality and relevance for the project
      development (technical) based on contributions of the individuals;
      While modulating possible clashes/conflicts between different personalities;

      Examples:
      OS kernels, Wikipedia, mail programs, GNU, …;
      Build a deposit of old software (free/open source), for preservation and sharing
      (with everybody);
      Old open source SW may in fact be at risk of not being publicly available for a
      variety of reasons, such as sites become proprietary and limit public access,
      crash of the systems, business decisions;

      Role of collective intelligence
      Individuals are expert developers, but act collectively, for public interest, and this
      becomes a movement that may make a cultural/political difference/impact (the
      key is high quality, not populism!);
      eg the French Public Administration adopts Open Source software and has
      rejected proprietary products (Microsoft, specifically)                                  [3]

Option D — Object-oriented programming

13.   (a)   (i)     Award up to [1] for each part of a suitable definition up to [2 max].
                    An object is an abstract entity;
                    and its components are data and/or actions;                                    [2]

            (ii)    Award up to [1] for identifying each disadvantage and [1] for an elaboration
                    of this disadvantage, up to [2 max].
                    Mark as [2] and [2].                                                           [4]
                    Unsuitable for minor projects;
                    since OOP increases complexity for little gain;

                    OOP programs are larger than other programs;
                    and therefore slower;

                    OOP programs take more effort to construct;
                    because of the decomposition needed to achieve abstraction;

            (iii)   Award [1] for identifying an advantage and [1] for an elaboration of this
                    advantage up to [2 max].                                                       [2]

                    Example answers:
                    Faster development;
                    Because different programming teams can work on different modules;

                    Easier to debug;
                    Because the smaller modules will have fewer mistakes than one big
                    program;

                    Easier to update (in the future);
                    Because it is easier to update a module than the full program;

                    Re-usability;
                    Modules can be stored in libraries and reused for different programs;

      (b)   Award up to [1] for any indication of aggregation.

            Example answer:

      Example answer:
      private int search(String flightID)
      {    int i = 0;
           while (inbound[i].compareWith(flightID) != 0)
           { i++; }

(e)   (i)     Award up to [2 max].
              Award [1] for identifying an advantage of using a binary search and [1] for
              an elaboration of the advantage up to [2 max].

              Binary search is much faster than sequential search;
              Because it halves the search range for every comparison;                        [2]

              Award [1] for identifying a disadvantage of using a binary search and [1] for
              an elaboration of the disadvantage up to [2 max].

              However, it is not applicable to unsorted data sets;
              Because the data must be sorted first which adds to computational cost;         [2]

            Example answer:
            Encapsulation allows to make instance variables (and methods) of a class private
            to that class;
            So that the main program / other classes can't accidentally access / change the
            data in an object;

      (b)   (i)    Award up to [2 max].
                   The two methods have different parameters;
                   allowing the compiler to choose the correct one.                            [2]
