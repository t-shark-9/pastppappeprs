Questions 27 – 30 relate to the following case study.  Please read the case study carefully and answer
the questions.

The Centriphone is an original design by Nicolas Vuignier, a professional skier.  The product enables
users to attach their mobile phone into the device and take 360 degree dynamic video footage of
themselves skiing.  The Centriphone is attached to a cable with a handle on the end, which the skier
swings around their head.

From simple foam-board models, through to plywood and a final 3D printed prototype, Vuignier went
through several iterations of the Centriphone, see Figure 9.
