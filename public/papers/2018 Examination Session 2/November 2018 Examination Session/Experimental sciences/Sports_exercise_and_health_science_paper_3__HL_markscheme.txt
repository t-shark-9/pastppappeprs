             tuna ✔                                                                              medium GI.                                2
                                                                                               Accept any suitable example (<15).

15.   b      Before race:
             simple sugars/high-GI foods immediately pre-competition causes blood sugar to
             rise rapidly/ excessive insulin release/ negatively impacts endurance ✔
             low-GI immediately pre-competition has a slower rate of glucose absorption into                                               3
             the blood/ eliminates the insulin surge/ is beneficial for endurance ✔
             During race:
             Triathlete should consume high-GI «in optimal amounts» during a race ✔

16.   a      Several causes but most commonly:
             high insulin levels among diabetics ✔
             Can also exist in non-diabetics through:
             insufficient food intake ✔
             excessive exercise ✔                                                                                        3 max
             illness ✔

             postponing or skipping a meal or snack

             drinking alcohol

16.   b      glucose uptake into a cell is facilitated by the glucose transport proteins GLUT4
             and GLUT1 ✔
             GLUT4 transporters are stored inside intracellular vesicles that are translocated to
             cell membrane to allow greater glucose movement into cell ✔
                                                                                                                         3 max
             GLUT4 transporters can be stimulated without insulin during physical exercise
             from other stimuli such as calcium ions ✔
             glucose taken into muscle cells is quickly converted to glucose-6-phosphate to
             maintain glucose movement ✔



17.          antioxidants are found in many foods and so are consumed as part of a healthy,
             well-balanced diet ✔
                                                                                                                         4 max
             free radicals are unstable and destructive to nearby molecules ✔

OR

free radicals can: affect cell / mitochondrial membrane integrity / permeability
/ impair the function of molecules (eg enzymes) / impair DNA structure ✔

free radicals are a by-product of normal cell function that can lead to oxidative
stress without sufficient antioxidants ✔
many athletes consume antioxidants in dietary supplements as extra defence
against free radical damage ✔
no consistent evidence that these supplements reduce oxidative stress or have
positive training or performance impact ✔
excess intake above RDA may have detrimental effects on the body ✔
a lack of adequate regulation means that some products are poorly formulated
and may even contain banned substances ✔
